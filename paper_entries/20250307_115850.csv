Its emissions are dominated by space heating and show strong daily variations linked to changes in outside temperature. Using heating degree days, we provide country- and species-dependent parameters for the distribution of these emissions, improving the performance of the CHIMERE air quality model. This also allows  annual residential emissions to be projected before official publications. 
 The combustion of fossil and biofuels in the residential sector can cause high background levels of air pollutants in winter but also pollution peaks during cold periods. Its emissions are dominated by space heating and show strong daily variations linked to changes in outside temperatures. The heating degree day (HDD) approach allows daily variations in space heating emissions to be represented. The method depends on a temperature threshold (“Tb”) below which building heating is activated and a fraction (“f”) considering the relative contribution of space heating to total residential combustion emissions. These parameters are fixed in the literature. However, they are likely to vary according to the country and pollutant. Using statistics on household energy consumption, we provide country- and species-dependent Tb and f parameters to derive daily temporal factors distributing PM and NOx emissions from the residential sector in the EU 27. Tested in the CHIMERE model, the simulations show better performance scores (temporal correlation and threshold exceedance detection) in winter, especially for PM, when compared to the simulation with a monthly temporal factor, or based on HDDs but using fixed parameters from the literature. Finally, the HDDs with fitted parameters are used as a method to project official annual residential combustion emissions in subsequent years, as these are typically reported with a 2-year time lag. Results show that this method performs better regarding the persistence method and remains within emission uncertainties for both PM and NOx emissions, indicating the importance of considering HDDs for air quality forecasting."

In polar regions, their measurement helps to improve the interpretation of water isotopic records in ice cores. However, in situ water vapour isotopic monitoring is an important challenge, especially in dry places of East Antarctica.

 Water vapour isotopes are important tools to better understand processes governing the atmospheric hydrological cycle. Their measurement in polar regions is crucial to improve the interpretation of water isotopic records in ice cores. In situ water vapour isotopic monitoring remains challenging, especially in dry places of the East Antarctic Plateau, where water mixing ratios can be as low as 10 ppm. We present in this article new commercial laser spectrometers based on the optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OF–CEAS) technique, adapted for water vapour isotopic measurements in dry regions. We characterise a first instrument adapted for Antarctic coastal monitoring with an optical cavity finesse of 64 000 (ring-down time of 54 µs), installed at Dumont d'Urville Station during the summer campaign 2022–2023, and a second instrument with a high finesse of 116 000 (98 µs ring-down time), to be deployed inland of East Antarctica. With a drift calibration every 24 h, the stability demonstrated by the high-finesse instrument allows one to study isotopic diurnal cycles down to 10 ppm humidity for δD and 100 ppm for δ18O."

This study establishes a machine-learning-based inversion model which can accurately and efficiently acquire the BC mixing state. Compared to the widely used leading-edge-only method, our model utilizes a broader scattering signal coverage to more accurately capture diverse particle characteristics. 
 The radiative properties of black carbon (BC) are significantly influenced by its mixing state. The single-particle soot photometer (SP2) is a widely recognized instrument for quantifying BC mixing state. However, the derivation of BC mixing state from SP2 is quite challenging. Since the SP2 records individual particle signals, it requires complex data processing to convert raw signals into particle size and mixing states. Furthermore, the rapid accumulation of substantial data volumes impedes real-time analysis of BC mixing states. This study employs the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), an advanced tree-based ensemble learning algorithm, to establish an inversion model that directly correlates SP2 signals with the mixing state of BC-containing particles. Our model achieves high accuracy for both particle size inversion and optical cross-section inversion of BC-containing particles, with a coefficient of determination R2 higher than 0.98. We further employ the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to analyze the importance of input features from SP2 signals in the inversion model of the entire particle diameter (Dp) and explore their underlying physical significance. Compared to the widely used leading-edge-only (LEO) fitting method, the machine learning (ML) method utilizes a larger coverage of signals encompassing the peak of scattering signal rather than the leading-edge data. This allows for more accurate capture of the diverse characteristics of particles. Moreover, the ML method uses signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio, providing better noise resistance. Our model is capable of accurately and efficiently acquiring the single-particle information and statistical results of the BC mixing state, which provides essential data for BC aging mechanism investigation and the assessment of further BC radiative effects."

We found that 23.4 % of global cropland is irrigated, with the most extensive areas in India, China, the United States, and Pakistan. We identified the distribution of central pivot systems commonly used in the United States and Saudi Arabia. This new map can better support water management and food security globally. 
 Irrigation accounts for the major form of human water consumption and plays a pivotal role in enhancing crop yields and mitigating the effects of drought. Accurate mapping of irrigation distribution is essential for effective water resource management and the assessment of food security. However, the resolution of the global irrigated cropland map is coarse, typically approximately 10 km, and it lacks regular updates. In our study, we present a robust methodology that leverages irrigation performance during drought stress as an indicator of crop productivity and water consumption to identify global irrigated cropland. Within each irrigation mapping zone (IMZ), we identified the dry months of the growing season from 2017 to 2019 or the driest months from 2010 to 2019. To delineate irrigated cropland, we utilized the collected samples to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds for the dry months of 2017 to 2019 and the NDVI deviation from the 10-year average for the driest month. By integrating the most accurate results from these two methods, we generated the Global Maximum Irrigation Extent dataset at 100 m resolution (GMIE-100), achieving an overall accuracy of 83.6 % ± 0.6 %. The GMIE-100 reveals that the maximum extent of irrigated cropland encompasses 403.17 ± 9.82 Mha, accounting for 23.4 % ± 0.6 % of the global cropland. Concentrated in fertile plains and regions adjacent to major rivers, the largest irrigated cropland areas are found in India, China, the United States, and Pakistan, which rank first to fourth, respectively. Importantly, the spatial resolution of GMIE-100 surpasses that of the dominant irrigation map, offering more detailed information essential to support estimates of agricultural water use and regional food security assessments. Furthermore, with the help of the deep learning (DL) method, the global central pivot irrigation system (CPIS) was identified using Pivot-Net, a novel convolutional neural network built on the U-net architecture. We found that there is 11.5 ± 0.01 Mha of CPIS, accounting for approximately 2.90 % ± 0.03 % of the total irrigated cropland. In Namibia, the United States, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Canada, and Zambia, the CPIS proportion was greater than 10 %. To our knowledge, this is the inaugural study to undertake a global identification of specific irrigation methods, with a focus on the CPIS. The GMIE-100 dataset containing both the irrigated extent and CPIS distribution is publicly available on Harvard Dataverse at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HKBAQQ (Tian et al., 2023a)."

We present a simulation framework for modeling CO2 storage beneath the seafloor, where CO2 can form a solid. This can aid in permanent CO2 storage for long periods of time. Our models show what a commercial-scale CO2 injection would look like in a marine environment. We discuss what would need to be considered when designing a subsea CO2 injection. 
 Safe and secure carbon dioxide (CO2) storage is likely to be critical for mitigating some of the most dangerous effects of climate change. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in activity associated with reservoir characterization and site selection for large-scale CO2 storage projects across the globe. These prospective storage sites tend to be selected for their optimal structural, petrophysical, and geochemical trapping potential. However, it has also been suggested that storing CO2 in reservoirs within the CO2 hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), characterized by high pressures and low temperatures (e.g., Arctic or marine environments), could provide a natural thermodynamic barrier to gas leakage.  Evaluating the prospect of commercial-scale, long-term storage of CO2 in the GHSZ requires reservoir-scale modeling capabilities designed to account for the unique physics and thermodynamics associated with these systems. We have developed the HYDRATE flow mode and the accompanying fully implicit parallel well model in the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model CO2 injection into the marine GHSZ. We have applied these capabilities to a set of CO2 injection scenarios designed to reveal the challenges and opportunities for commercial-scale CO2 storage in the GHSZ."

Our analysis shows that hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H2DRI) provides a cost-effective decarbonization strategy only under a relatively narrow set of conditions. Using today’s best estimates of the capital and variable costs of alternative decarbonized iron and steelmaking technologies in a U.S. economy-wide simulation framework, we find that carbon capture technologies can achieve comparable decarbonization levels by 2050 and greater cumulative emissions reductions from iron and steel production at a lower cost. Simulations suggest hydrogen contributes to economy-wide decarbonization, but H2DRI is not the preferred use case for hydrogen in most scenarios. The average abatement cost for U.S. iron and steel production could be as low as $70/tonne CO2 with existing technologies plus carbon capture, while the cost with H2DRI rises to over $500/tonne CO2. We also find that IRA tax credits are insufficient to spur hydrogen use in steelmaking in our model and that a green steel production tax credit would need to be as high as $300/tonne steel to lead to sustained H2DRI use."

Here, we promote the bond activation of oxygen in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and carbon in graphite electrodes, achieving rapid gasification and thermal decomposition of active crystals at lower temperatures in the absence of other activating agents. The activation of C and O bond leads to the storage of internal energy and the transition of the crystalline phase (single crystal to polycrystal) of the active crystals. Density functional theory modeling confirms that the CO adsorption energy is significantly higher with Ca–Oa (−3.35 eV, C and O activation) than with no activation (−1.66 eV). The differential charge results show that the bond activation model has the highest charge accumulation and consumption, improving the electron transfer. The Bader charge transfer between Ca–Oa and CO is also the largest, with a value of 0.433 |e|. Therefore, synchronous activation of C and O bonds can reduce the decomposition temperature of active crystals by 200 °C and allows a low-temperature pyrolysis recycling of retired LIB cathode materials. Our research provides a potential strategy for low-carbon recycling of retired LIBs worldwide."

However, high-loading single-atom catalysts (SACs) with controllable configurations are urgently required to selectively generate high-yield nonradicals. Herein, we constructed high-loading Fe SACs (5.4–34.2 wt %) with uniform Fe–N4 sites via an optimized coordination balance of supermolecular assembly for peroxymonosulfate activation. The selectivity of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation and its contribution to eARGs degradation were both >98%. This targeting strategy of oxidizing guanines with low ionization potentials by 1O2 allowed 7 log eARGs degradation within 10 min and eliminated their transformation within 2 min, outperforming most reported advanced oxidation processes. Relevant interactions between 1O2 and guanines were revealed at a single-molecule resolution.

However, the efficiency of the conventional bulk-phase UV/H2O2 system is limited by the low yield and utilization of •OH, in turn necessitating high UV energy input and long purification period. In this study, we present an innovative UV/H2O2 microdroplet system for enhanced pollutant degradation. The degradation of pollutants in sprayed microdroplets was accelerated by 8.5–63.3-fold compared to those in bulk water, demonstrating universal effectiveness across a range of pollutant types and diverse aqueous matrices. This enhancement stems from elevated •OH production at the air–water interface due to the enhanced UV absorbance of H2O2. The production of •OH in the microdroplet system was 45-fold higher than that in bulk water, facilitating rapid •OH-mediated pollutant degradation. Moreover, pollutants accumulate at the air–water interface, where •OH is concentrated, leading to higher utilization of •OH for mediating pollutant degradation before quenching. Our findings provide a solution to overcome the bottlenecks in •OH production and utilization, offering insights for improving the efficiency of UV/H2O2 water treatment systems."

Subsequently, we quantified the uncertainty of speciation predictions and the sensitivity to model parameters and input values. Importantly, we established new generic NICA-Donnan parameters that substantially improved model accuracy, especially for Zn. Uncertainties generally followed Cu < Cd < Zn. With OM being the major binding surface across most soils, the affinity parameters (log Ki) were most influential. Compared to a “best-case” scenario with all relevant soil properties measured, a “simplified” scenario with assumptions about OM fractionation and metal-oxide specific surface area could be employed with a negligible effect on model accuracy and uncertainty.

Regional GEM concentrations were elevated (∼1.3 to 11 ng m–3) compared to the background (<1 ng m–3), with very high GEM levels (∼10 to >5000 ng m–3) associated with mining areas and gold shops. Because ASGM-derived GEM is isotopically distinct, its contribution to regional and local atmospheric Hg was estimated using an isotope mixing model and found to be generally over 70%. We also show that vegetation is taking up ASGM-derived GEM, affecting both the concentrations and isotope compositions of GEM as well as in foliage and litter samples. This supports vegetation uptake as a key removal process of GEM from the atmosphere and therefore a major source of Hg to terrestrial ecosystems and soils, which is heightened in ASGM regions."

Yet, how wildfires alter the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) as a critical parameter determining the C efflux from burned landscapes remains unknown. We conducted a field survey and two confirmatory experiments in two fire-prone regions of China at <1, 3, 6, and 12 months after wildfires (n = 160 soil samples). We found that wildfire generally reduced the Q10 for soil organic and mineral horizons within the first year after wildfire mainly due to substrate depletion, which was confirmed by a uniform inoculation experiment. Mineral protection of organic matter in the mineral horizon rich in iron/aluminum (hydr)oxides and a near-neutral pH in organic horizons of postfire soils further suppressed the Q10. Decreased Q10 persisted in organic horizons even after removing substrate limitation, reflecting the dominance of a thermally adapted, r-strategist microbial community in postfire soils. Moreover, fire-induced low C quality increased Q10, which supported the C quality-temperature hypothesis, but a C-limited condition restricted this stimulatory effect.

Young,Comprehensive Nontargeted Analysis of Drinking Water Supplies to Identify Chemicals Associated with Estrogen Receptor Agonism or Present in Regions of Elevated Breast Cancer Occurrence,"To explore the hypothesis that differential exposures to estrogen active chemicals may contribute to regional disparities in cancer incidence, a comprehensive targeted and nontargeted analysis was conducted over two seasons (2020) for drinking water samples from 120 households served by 8 public water systems (4 with historically elevated breast cancer incidence) and from 15 brands of retail water. All samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry and a bioassay for estrogen receptor agonism. Target compounds included disinfection byproducts, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), trace elements, and compounds selected for their possible relation to breast cancer. Over 7500 GC and LC nontargeted molecular features passed all quality control filters in each sampling season and were prioritized for identification if they were related to measured estrogen receptor agonism or were present at higher levels in areas with high breast cancer incidence (n = 1036). Benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid, acetyl tributyl citrate, and diphenyl sulfone were among the prioritized and confirmed nontarget compounds. Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and two ketone derivatives displayed significant negative correlations with estrogen receptor agonism. Many prioritized compounds remained unidentified, as 84.4% of the LC features and 77.5% of the GC features could not be annotated with high confidence."

This research targets Texas coastal bays (Matagorda and San Antonio), to better understand microplastic contamination in sediments and provide insight into the processes controlling its distribution. Microplastic extraction and quantification methods employed include sediment sieving, elutriation, microscopy, and spectroscopy. This study found low concentrations (ca. 10s–100s particles kilogram–1 sediment or 20–200 × 104 items meter–3 wet sediment) and negligible correlations between analyzed deposit constituents (R2 for grain size = −0.14 to 0.12, organic content = 0.08, water depth = −0.11, distance to shore = −0.14). The highly dynamic role of wind-driven mixing and openness to the Gulf of Mexico leads to the high flushing rate of sediment and microplastics out of the bays. Larger microplastic particles (fragments: 178 ± 93 μm, fibers: 0.5 to 2.0 mm) were consistently deposited with finer sediments, indicating high transportability. Microplastic resuspension into bay waters has significant implications for limiting microplastic accumulation within bay sediments.

Plant operators rely heavily on observations of filtration performance from noisy sensor data to assess membrane fouling conditions and lab-based protocols for plant maintenance, often leading to inaccurate estimations of future performance and delayed membrane cleaning. This challenge is further compounded by the difficulty in integrating existing complex mechanistic models with the Internet of Things (IoT) systems of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). By harnessing data obtained from WWTPs, along with innovative data denoising and model training strategies, we developed a machine learning application (MBR-Net) that is capable of forecasting membrane fouling, as indicated by permeability, for a full-scale submerged MBR plant in real time. We show that the trained model can effectively predict one-day-ahead changes in irreversible fouling under different desired fluxes, cleaning conditions and feedwater conditions (with MAPE < 6.45%, MAE < 3.71 LMH bar–1, and R2 > 0.87 on two independent testing sets).

This study investigated the initial phase of PFAS contamination in concrete, focusing on factors influencing PFAS retention and penetration. Laboratory experiments assessed the uptake kinetics of PFAS into concrete over one year, revealing that PFAS penetrated beyond surface layers, as confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry and desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging. PFAS mass loss into the concrete was limited, with 0.99% to 18.5% (mean 6.6%) of initial spiked PFAS being retained. Uptake behaviors were influenced by PFAS chain length and chemistry, concrete surface characteristics, as well as wetting/drying cycles, which accelerated PFAS penetration through the wick effect. Damaged concrete surfaces also showed faster PFAS penetration due to the exposed interfacial transition zones. Field-impacted concrete samples from Canada revealed some similar migration trends with lab-exposed concrete, with shorter-chain PFAS exhibiting greater mobility in the concrete matrix, though notable differences were observed between field and lab samples. These findings highlight the complex dynamics of PFAS contamination in concrete and provide insights into factors affecting PFAS penetration and retention."

Thus, the traditional EDC in vitro screening processes often require a battery of bioassays to cover multiple target pathways. Here we developed an endocrine-enhanced reduced human transcriptome (ERHT) focused on hormone receptor signaling induced by the EDCs regulating specific genes. ERHT was developed based on 1200 prioritized genes covering 110 endocrine-related biological pathways across eight potential adverse outcomes. The ability of this approach to identify EDCs was derived from machine learning of 1068 dose-dependent transcriptome profiles and enhanced by quantifying chemical-induced critical pathway responses, and thus, it demonstrated excellent classification performance (AUC = 0.84 ± 0.03) in internal cross-validation. We ultimately applied this approach to known EDCs and inactive substances to validate the reliability of this approach. Through external validation on 210 chemicals, the extrapolation accuracy exceeded 80%, demonstrating the outstanding practical performance of this approach. Meanwhile, the pathway responses induced by the same chemical were consistent with the experimental results reported by multiple sequencing platforms, highlighting the robustness of this approach. The above results demonstrate that this approach can provide novel insights for EDCs’ high-throughput screening and comprehensive toxic mechanisms through biological pathways."

The probability of PhAC detection (above limits of quantification) in larvae was relatively constant throughout the exposure time, while in adults, it was lower at the beginning with a subsequent increase. The total concentration of detected PhACs was highest in larvae of Limnephilus spp. and lowest in larvae of S. aestivalis, decreasing similarly in the adults of all three species. Significant differences in the composition of PhACs with different levels of changes after emergence were detected between species. Only telmisartan was detected in all species and life stages. Sertraline and its active metabolite norsertraline exhibited significantly higher relative concentrations in caddisfly adults compared to larvae. Apart from the bioconcentration factor, increasing biodegradation half-life was the second-best predictor of increased PhAC concentration in adults compared to larvae. At the same time, log Kow, commonly associated with bioaccumulation, was not found to be a good predictor of this relationship.

Reasons for differences in fire patterns can be difficult to determine due to variable vegetation types, land use patterns, fuel conditions, and human influences on fire ignition and suppression. This study compares burned areas to climate and fuel conditions in three temperate regions: the desert, shrub, and forest ecoregions of western North America, west‐central Europe, and southwestern South America. In each region the mean annual aridity index (AI, precipitation over potential evapotranspiration) spans arid to humid climates. We examined how the fraction of area burned from 2001 to 2021 varied with mean annual AI, mean aboveground biomass, and land cover type distributions. All three regions had low fractions of area burned for the driest climate zones (AI < 0.5), a sign of fuel limitation to burned area. Fraction of area burned increased with mean aboveground biomass for these dry zones. Fraction of area burned peaked at intermediate AI (0.7–1.5) for all regions and declined again in the wettest climate zones (AI > 1.5), a sign of climate limitation to burned area. Of the three regions, western North America had the highest burned area, fraction of area burned, and fire sizes. Fragmentation of vegetation patches by the high Andes Mountains in southwestern South America and by intensive land use changes in west‐central Europe likely limited fire sizes.

We simulated five‐member ensembles of historical hindcasts and experiments representing the storms in the future using the pseudo‐global warming method.

 Recent evidence shows elevated circulating long-chain ceramide levels predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases."

 The generation and dynamics of plasmon-induced hot carriers in gold nanoparticles offer crucial insights into nonequilibrium states for energy applications, yet the underlying mechanisms remain experimentally elusive. Here, we leverage ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to directly capture hot carrier dynamics with sub-50 fs temporal resolution, providing clear evidence of plasmon decay mechanisms. We observe the sequential processes of Landau damping (~25 fs) and hot carrier thermalization (~1.5 ps), identifying hot carrier formation as a significant decay pathway. Energy distribution measurements reveal carriers in non-Fermi-Dirac states persisting beyond 500 fs and observe electron populations exceeding single-photon excitation energy, indicating the role of an Auger heating mechanism alongside traditional impact excitation. These findings deepen the understanding of hot carrier behavior under localized surface plasmon resonance, offering valuable implications for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and phototherapy. This work establishes a methodological framework for studying hot carrier dynamics, opening avenues for optimizing energy transfer processes in nanoscale plasmonic systems.

Here, authors enhance MicroED data quality using energy filtering, achieving sub-atomic resolution protein data and uncovering diffuse scattering, offering detailed insights into protein structure and function. 
 High-resolution information is important for accurate structure modeling but is challenging to attain in macromolecular crystallography due to the rapid fading of diffracted intensities at increasing resolution. While direct electron detection essentially eliminates the read-out noise during MicroED data collection, other sources of noise remain and limit the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections. Inelastic scattering significantly contributes to noise, raising background levels and broadening diffraction peaks. We demonstrate a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio by using energy filtering to remove inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy results in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling the visualization of detailed structural features. Interestingly, reducing the noise further reveals diffuse scattering that may hold additional structural information. Our findings suggest that combining energy filtering and direct detection provides more accurate measurements at higher resolution, facilitating precise model refinement and improved insights into protein structure and function.

 The role of meteorite impacts in the origin, modification, and destruction of crust during the first two billion years of Earth history (4.5–2.5 billion years ago; Ga) is disputed. Whereas some argue for a relatively minor contribution overall, others have proposed that individual giant impactors (>10–50 km diameter) can initiate subduction zones and deep mantle plumes, arguably triggering a chain of events that formed cratons, the ancient nuclei of the continents. The uncertainty is compounded by the seeming absence of impact structures older than 2.23 Ga, such that the evidence for the terrestrial impact flux in the Hadean and Archaean eons is circumstantial. Here, we report the discovery of shatter cones in a complex, dominantly metasedimentary layer, the Antarctic Creek Member (ACM), in the centre of the East Pilbara Terrane, Western Australia, which provide unequivocal evidence for a hypervelocity meteorite impact. The shocked rocks of the crater floor are overlain by (unshocked) carbonate breccias and pillow lavas, stratigraphically constraining the age of the impact to 3.47 Ga and confirming discovery of the only Archaean crater known thus far.

 Frequency transfer is a key challenge in machine learning as it allows researchers to go beyond in-range analyses of spectrum properties towards out-of-the-range predictions. Traditionally, to predict properties at a specific frequency, targeted spectrum is included in training data for a deep neural network (DNN). However, due to limitations of measurement or computation source, training data at some frequencies are hardly accessible, especially for multi-physics problems. In this work, we propose a multi-physics deep learning framework (MDLF) consisting of a multi-fidelity DeepONet, a Euler latent dynamic network, and a data-analytical inversion network. Without the knowledge about multi-physics response, MDLF is successfully generalized to unseen frequency bands for both parametric and free-form metasurface by dynamically utilizing a Euler latent space and single-physics information. Moreover, an inversion method is introduced to incorporate hybrid a priori in inverse design of metasurface. Under EM-thermal coupling, we verify the proposed MDLF numerically and experimentally.

 Water-ice prospecting is a crucial step in unlocking the Moon’s potential for supporting human habitat and furthering exploration. Lunar Temperatures not only dictate water-ice, but also drive other aspects of science and exploration.

The surface peak temperature of 355 K from ChaSTE is higher than expected(330 K) owing to its deployment on a sunward illuminated local slope region of 6°. This demonstrates that local topography at metre scales can alter temperature at high latitudes, unlike equatorial regions. Numerical model calculations using ChaSTE measurements, suggest that larger poleward facing slopes(>14°) at high latitudes can harbour water-ice, making them promising and technically less challenging sites for future lunar exploration and habitation.

 Satellite-based precipitation products have significantly advanced applications in hydrology, climate science, and related fields. Despite the significant role of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission in monitoring global precipitation dynamics over the past decade, its performance on sub-daily time scales remains insufficiently explored on a global scale. This study provides a continental assessment of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) V07B Final Run using extensive hourly ground observations across contiguous United States (CONUS), West Europe, and East Asia. The results demonstrate that IMERG captures precipitation amounts with reasonable accuracy, yielding a median Kling–Gupta efficiency of 0.31 and a median relative bias of 7 %. This bias is primarily attributed to overestimated precipitation frequency and underestimated intensity. However, its performance varies significantly with seasons, land surface attributes, and precipitation types, with better performance generally observed in spring and fall, as well as in temperate and humid climates, and low-altitude regions. While IMERG performs well in detecting moderate precipitation, it struggles with drizzle and moderate-to-extreme events, particularly those exceeding 5 mm/h. Additionally, diurnal performance variability is evident, with the highest accuracy observed in the morning (0600–0900) and the lowest in the afternoon (1400–1700).

 Fire severity is closely linked to ecosystem responses. As climate change increases the frequency of severe fires, large-scale fire severity monitoring has become increasingly important. The traditional bitemporal approach, which compares single pre- and post-fire images to map fire severity, is effective at local scales but less efficient for larger-scale assessments. Recent advances in compositing multiple images have improved large-scale mapping; however, the effects of compositing parameters on mapping accuracy remain poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of compositing parameters on composite-based fire severity maps derived from Landsat images across summer fires at multiple scales. At the large scale, we analysed fires in the Iberian Peninsula (2000−2023); at the medium scale, fires in a Mediterranean region of Spain (1985–2015), validated with national statistics; and at the local scale, two fires with field-based severity data. Various compositing parameters were tested, including the period for selecting pre- and post-fire images: lag timing (initial vs. extended assessment), seasonal timing (summer-summer, spring-summer, and summer-autumn), and the criteria for determining pre- and post-fire pixel values (mean-mean, max-min, and mean-min). Accuracy was assessed using the optimality index, correlation with the bitemporal approach, and alignment with field-based severity data, depending on the scale. Both the compositing period and criteria significantly influenced the accuracy of severity maps. In Mediterranean landscapes, the highest accuracy was achieved using post-fire imagery from the same year as the fire, whereas in alpine areas, it was achieved using post-fire imagery from the year after the fire. Seasonally consistent pre- and post-fire images acquired during summer also improved accuracy. The optimal compositing criteria varied depending on the lag timing: mean-min and max-min were most effective for assessing fire severity shortly after the fire, whereas mean-mean performed better for assessments conducted one year later. This study highlights the importance of carefully selecting compositing parameters based on the ecological characteristics of the study area. Additionally, it presents a scalable, automated methodology for large-scale fire severity mapping using Google Earth Engine, which can be applied to larger regions with appropriate adjustments to the compositing parameters."

 Spatiotemporal fusion of multisource remote sensing data offers a viable way for precise and dynamic Earth monitoring. However, existing methods struggle with reliable spatiotemporal fusion in two commonly occurring yet complex scenarios: drastic surface changes, such as those caused by natural disasters and human activities, and poor image quality, which caused by thick cloud cover, cloud shadows, haze and noise. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Reliable deep learning-based spatiotemporal Fusion framework (RealFusion), designed to blend Landsat and MODIS imagery to generate daily seamless Landsat-like imagery. ReadFusion enhances fusion reliability through several advancements: (1) integrating diverse input data with complementary information, (2) implementing task decoupled architectures, (3) developing advanced restoration and fusion networks, (4) adopting adaptive training strategy, (5) and establishing a comprehensive accuracy assessment framework. Extensive experiments, comprising 25 trials in three distinct areas, demonstrate that RealFusion outperforms four methods proposed in recent years (Object-Level Hybrid SpatioTemporal Fusion Method, OL-HSTFM; Enhanced Deep Convolutional Spatiotemporal Fusion Network, EDCSTFN; Generative Adversarial Network-based SpatioTemporal Fusion Model, GAN-STFM; and Multilevel Feature Fusion with Generative Adversarial Network, MLFF-GAN).

 Soil texture is an essential attribute of soil structure, which plays an important role in evaluating soil fertility and carrying out agricultural production. This study developed a novel soil texture estimation model using ZiYuan-1-02D (ZY1-02D) satellite Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI), based on the mechanism of soil spectral mixing, that enables simultaneous estimation of the three soil texture attributes (clay, silt, and sand). Study area is located in the north-eastern region of China covering 1683.31 km2. To reduce data redundancy, we used correlation analysis and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) algorithms to select sensitive spectral features of soil texture, and excluded spectral bands that are strongly influenced by other soil physicochemical properties. Finally, the spatial distribution map and classification map of soil texture have been generated for the study area. We also used AHSI/GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite images to further validate the generalizability of the model. The results suggest that the model can be used in the estimation of soil texture, and the developed novel model can effectively reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of surface soil texture attributes. The R2 values of all outcomes for inverting three texture attributes were larger than 0.5, with silt exhibiting the best estimation effect (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 6.46 %, RPD = 2.19). The Max-divergence between the estimated surface soil texture attributes based on the two satellite images (AHSI/ZY1-02D and AHSI/GF-5) and the measured data were less than 4 %. The novel spectral mixture model of soil texture is suitable for spaceborne remote sensing data and has broad application prospects in surface soil texture mapping."

 The p-Median Problem (PMP) is a classical discrete facility location problem with significant implications for optimizing the placement of urban public service facilities. Improved heuristics, a well-established method for solving the PMP, aim to iteratively enhance solution quality through efficient neighborhood exploration. In this study, we model the neighborhood exploration process as a Markov decision process and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach to solving the PMP, achieving higher problem-solving efficiency and quality. The proposed method introduces an encoder-decoder structure, consisting of an Interactive Attention Encoder (IAE), a Node Removal Decoder (NRD), and a Node Insertion Decoder (NID), aimed at learning an optimal strategy for node selection. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms genetic algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. While the solution time is slightly longer than that of the Attention Model (AM), our method achieves a reduced gap to the optimal solution. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the proposed adaptive interactive encoder and the two decoders significantly enhance the model performance. Finally, we applied the Adaptive Interactive Attention Model (AIAM) to a real-world scenario, demonstrating its practical utility in guiding medical facility location decisions."

 Deep learning methods for classification have achieved significant advancements in processing 3D point clouds. A fundamental aspect of deep learning networks is how to best aggregate features into a global representation of the point cloud. While many existing networks rely on the traditional max-pooling for feature aggregation due to its efficiency and permutation-invariance, max-pooling has some limitations. It is a fixed operation, lacking learnability and adaptability, which restricts the network’s ability to capture the most informative global feature representation. This limitation motivates for developing a new feature aggregation method that generates a richer and more diverse feature representation. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel pooling operation, the Weighted Activation Pooling (WAP) module. WAP adds adaptability to the pooling operation by using learnable weights to dynamically adjust the importance of the pooled features. Features are further transformed through different activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and relations in the data. The WAP module is a plug-and-play module that can replace the traditional pooling operation in existing networks, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, this paper introduces the AdaptNet classification network, where the proposed WAP module is used to obtain global features. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate AdaptNet using both real-world data and the ModelNet40 dataset. Results show that AdaptNet outperforms other networks, achieving higher overall accuracy on both datasets. Moreover, WAP is integrated into existing classification networks, and experiments using real-world data show an increased performance of all tested networks compared to using their original pooling strategy."

 Airborne hyperspectral systems can provide high-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) covering large scenes, enabling fine-grained land-cover classification. However, the most popular patch-based methods are limited by low computational efficiency and broken classification results, which hinders the full utilization of this powerful technology in Earth observation applications. Therefore, in this paper, considering the efficiency requirements for large-scale land-cover classification, a novel patch-free approach based on a Transformer-CNN hybrid (PatchOut) framework is proposed. The proposed PatchOut framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, enabling rapid semantic segmentation for HSI classification. For the encoder module, we introduce a computationally efficient reduced Transformer module integrated with convolutional neural network (CNN), to leverage their complementary strengths for long-range and local feature extraction, respectively. A multi-scale spatial-spectral feature fusion (MSSSFF) module is also proposed to amalgamate the characteristics of different levels from the encoder, which enhances the overall feature representation. Then, to address the loss of semantic detail and resolution inherent in multi-level feature extraction, a novel feature reconstruction module (FRM) is applied to recover high-quality semantic features. Finally, a large-scale benchmark dataset, Qingpu-HSI, is presented, comprising airborne HSIs covering 33.91 km2 with 20 land-cover classes. Experiments on the Qingpu-HSI and another public dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of our proposed PatchOut framework, outperforming several well-known patch-free and patch-based methods.

 Biogenic hydrocarbons, sea salt and dust emissions are driven by meteorological variables, which will change in a future climate. Natural emissions can dominate air quality in Australia, particularly when high biogenic activity promotes smog formation in summer. Therefore, quantifying how natural emissions might change is important. This study uses 4 downscaled Global Climate Models (GCMs) under 2 shared socioeconomic pathways in the 2050s to drive natural emissions at 20 km spatial resolution in the CSIRO Chemical Transport Model. Changes in air quality parameters were calculated by comparing each 5-year future run to a 5-year run from the current period. Higher urban air mass stagnancy was predicted in winter. When combined with lower rainfall increased particle residence time is expected. By contrast, higher ventilation indices were predicted in summer. Higher wind speeds in the ocean facilitated additional sea salt emissions. As Australian cities are largely coastal, sea salt contributed ∼35% of the1-2 μg m−3 extra coarse particulate matter predicted. Peak summertime isoprene emissions are set to double in 2050, by 3–4 mg m−2 h−1 in eastern Australia. This produced 3–6 ppb additional ozone in Australian cities already at air quality limits. Monoterpene emissions increased in 2050, but cooler night-time minimum temperatures led to decreased emissions in some GCMs. A reduced summertime oxidant capacity in Australian cities is likely driven by higher biogenic emissions. The lifetime of methane will increase by half a year in response, causing a warming feedback warranting further study using models with free running oxidant schemes."

 Accurate and fine-grained precipitation nowcasting holds paramount importance for weather-dependent decision-making and is facing escalating expectations and challenges. While researchers have notably advanced precipitation nowcasting using deep learning (DL) models with larger sizes and more complicated structures, there is scarce research exploring the potential improvement from employing radar data with higher spatial resolutions—a hundred-meter scale rather than a kilometer scale. To evaluate the improvement of higher-resolution data, two U-Net architecture-based models, one larger and another smaller, were designed and trained with radar data at different spatial resolutions—1000 m, 500 m, and 100 m. Their effectiveness was examined by comparison to two baseline models. The models trained with diverse resolutions of data underwent comparative evaluation through two specific precipitation cases. The results unveil a positive correlation between the precipitation nowcasting performance and the spatial resolution of radar data. Models trained with higher-resolution data demonstrate superior forecasting accuracy, reduced bias, and enhanced spatial alignment between predictions and observations. Higher-resolution data empowers DL models to capture boundaries and local-scale patterns of convective systems more accurately, thereby improving the performance in precipitation nowcasting. More importantly, the comparison indicates that to further promote the performance of DL-based precipitation nowcasting, improving data resolution is more efficient than expanding model size. The use of high-resolution data diminishes computational and development costs by concurrently reducing the size of DL models, underscoring pragmatic benefits for related services. Given limited resources, employing higher-resolution data is recommended for priority consideration over larger-size models."

 In the boreal winter of 2023/2024, the 10-hPa stratosphere experienced unprecedented planetary wave activity. This led to two major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events occurring on January 16 and March 4. The onset processes of both SSWs demonstrated clear stratosphere-troposphere coupling. On one hand, notable precursor signals were detected in the troposphere before each SSW. Approximately 15 days prior to the first SSW, a markedly intensified 500-hPa high pressure emerged over the high-latitude Atlantic, resulting in the strongest wave 3 in the troposphere since 1979. Additionally, an anomalous high over eastern Europe served as a precursor signal for the second SSW, contributing to a rapid increase in waves 1 and 2 approximately 20 days before its occurrence. On the other hand, these two SSWs exhibited distinct impacts on subsequent surface air temperature (SAT) over China. Specifically, the first SSW was characterized as a reflecting event. Following its onset, strong planetary wave reflections were observed in the troposphere over the Siberian and North Pacific regions, leading to local high-pressure ridge development. The two ridges, along with troughs between them, created an “inverted Ω-shaped” circulation pattern and caused a cold wave across China during January 18–22. In contrast, the second SSW was identified as an absorbing event; its impact aligned with typical effects of SSWs on SAT over Eurasia. After its onset, a negative phase of Northern Annular Mode emerged in the stratosphere and propagated downward into the troposphere over time, resulting in warming conditions over China during the following month."

 Human-induced nitrogen (N) emissions have enhanced atmospheric N deposition in many polluted regions. However, the spatiotemporal relations between N emissions and deposition remain poorly characterized, which hampers N emission management and effect evaluation in polluted regions. This study investigated dry and wet inorganic N (IN) deposition at representative urban and suburban sites from June 2018 to May 2019 and analyzed historical N emission and deposition data in a N-polluted region of southern China. Dry, wet, and total IN deposition were 14.1 and 6.3, 36.4 and 29.0, and 50.5 and 35.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1 at the urban and suburban sites, respectively. Gaseous N accounted for 79–87 % of dry IN deposition and dry deposition accounted for 18–28 % of total IN deposition. The inter-annual variation of wet IN deposition exhibits an inverted “V” shape: the turning point for ammonium (NH4+) was in 1991 due to the decline in the ratio of ammonia to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and ammonia emissions; nitrate (NO3−) peaked in 2010, reflecting the benefits of national controls on nitrogen oxide emissions. Consequently, a shift to approximately equal NH4+ and NO3− deposition occurred in 2010–2020. Spatially, annual IN deposition increased with human-induced land use and N emissions, and about 30 % of the area exceeded the critical load for N deposition. Current emission controls are reducing N emissions and deposition but further mitigation measures are needed, especially broader regional strategies."

PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuableN-heterocycles. Additionally, our method can be used as a general strategy for synthesizing amides and amines, as well as15N-labeled molecules."

Despite the substantial advances in olefin metathesis and ozonolysis for natural product synthesis through C=C double-bond cleavage, the catalytic remodeling of complex molecules through C=C double-bond deconstruction has been underdeveloped. We report a heterogeneous copper-catalyzed C=C double-bond cleavage, which enables the remodeling of complex molecules by converting the carbons on either side of the C=C double bond to carbonyl and cyano groups, respectively. In particular, this method provides an efficient protocol to conveniently transform terpenoids, glycals, steroids, and bioactive molecules to privileged scaffolds with underexplored chemical space."

We demonstrate an inexpensive mandrel-free method for making polymer muscles that can have a spring index of >50 and a contractile tensile stroke exceeding 97%. This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle’s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets. This mandrel-free method was used to make high-spring-index carbon nanotube yarns for mechanical energy harvesters, self-powered strain sensors, and solvent-driven and electrochemically driven artificial muscles."

To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression."

In this study, we demonstrated exciton formation in a single molecule through ultrafast electron tunneling processes between a molecule and a metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a phase-controlled terahertz (THz) pulse. The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions."

To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions."

Domestication for its starchy roots involved a near-total shift from sexual to clonal propagation, and almost all manioc worldwide is now grown from stem cuttings. In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide. Interviews with Indigenous traditional farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado illuminate how traditional management strategies for sustaining, diversifying, and sharing the gene pool have shaped manioc diversity."
