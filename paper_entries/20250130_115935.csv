10.5194/acp-25-1289-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了亚洲季风区边界层空气团输送到极地平流层的过程及其对极地污染物的影响。研究发现，亚洲季风区边界层空气团输送到极地平流层的比例比南半球同纬度地区高约1.5倍，主要发生在20公里以上的高度，时间尺度超过两年。研究利用SF6作为示踪气体，结合化学输运模式(CLaMS)和ACE-FTS卫星观测数据，定量评估了亚洲季风区对北极和南极平流层污染物的贡献，结果表明约20%的极地平流层SF6源于亚洲季风区边界层。该研究揭示了亚洲季风区对全球大气环境，特别是极地地区大气成分的影响，体现了大气环境遥感技术在研究大气成分、输送过程和污染物来源方面的应用。,"['stratospheric pollution', 'air mass transport', 'SF6', 'polar regions', 'Asian monsoon', 'Lagrangian model', 'ACE-FTS', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Xiaolu Yan;Paul Konopka;Felix Ploeger;Aurélien Podglajen,Transport into the polar stratosphere from the Asian monsoon region,"Our study finds that the air mass fractions (AMFs) from the Asian boundary layer (ABL) to the polar regions are about 1.5 times larger than those from the same latitude band in the Southern Hemisphere. The transport of AMFs from the ABL to the polar vortex primarily occurs above 20 km and over timescales exceeding 2 years. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the polar pollutants and the AMFs from the ABL. About 20 % of SF6 in the polar stratosphere originates from the ABL. 
 The Southeast Asian boundary layer has witnessed alarming pollution levels in recent years, which even affects the trace gas composition in the Southern Hemisphere by inter-hemispheric transport. We use SF6 observations and the Lagrangian chemistry transport model Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS), driven by the ERA5 reanalysis data for the period 2010–2014, to assess the impact of the Asian monsoon (AM) region (15–45° N, 30–120° E) as a significant source of pollutants for the stratosphere, in particular in polar regions. We examine the contribution of transport from the AM region to the Northern Hemisphere polar region (NP) (60–90° N) and to the Southern Hemisphere polar region (SP) (60–90° S). Despite the smaller geographical size of the AM region when compared to the Southern Hemisphere subtropics (15–45° S) and the tropics (15° S–15° N), our findings reveal that the air mass fractions from the AM to the polar regions are approximately 1.5 times larger than the corresponding contributions from the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and only about 2 times smaller than those from the tropics. The transport of air masses from the AM boundary layer to the stratospheric polar vortex primarily occurs above an altitude of about 450 K and over timescales exceeding 2 years. In contrast, transport timescales to the polar regions situated below the vortex are shorter, typically less than about 2 years. Furthermore, the transport contribution from the AM region to the polar regions exhibits distinctive inter-annual variability, significantly influencing the distributions of pollutants. Our analysis of detrended SF6 from an Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) over the polar regions reveals a strong correlation with the fraction of relatively young air (less than 2 years old) originating from the AM, Southern Hemisphere subtropics, and the tropics. Importantly, our reconstructed SF6 data indicate that approximately 20 % of SF6 in both the northern and southern polar stratosphere originates from the AM boundary layer. The largest fraction of SF6 in the polar stratosphere still originates from the tropical boundary layer, contributing about 50 % of SF6."

Over northern France and Benelux, influenced by anthropogenic aerosols and cloudy conditions, regional evaluation of recent hindcast simulations shows satisfying results and high spatial variability. Future SSR evolution by the end of the century for two contrasting CMIP6 scenarios highlights large decreases in SSR for SSP3-7.0. 
 Investigating the current and future evolution of surface solar radiation (SSR) is essential in the context of climate change and associated environmental issues. We focus on the influence of atmospheric aerosols, along with cloud cover and water vapor content, on northern France and Benelux in spring and summer. Our analysis relies on the National Centre for Meteorological Research–Limited Area Adaptation Dynamic International Development v6.4 (CNRM-ALADIN64) regional climate model at 12.5 km resolution, which includes an interactive aerosol scheme. A regional evaluation of 2010–2020 ALADIN hindcast simulations of clear-sky and all-sky SSR, clear-sky frequency, and aerosols, through comparison to coincident multi-site ground-based measurements, shows reasonable agreement. In addition, these hindcast simulations emphasize how elevated aerosol loads over Benelux and high cloud cover over southwestern England reduce the SSR. Additional ALADIN climate simulations for 2050 and 2100 under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1-1.9 predict a significant reduction in aerosol loads compared to 2005–2014, especially over Benelux, associated with future increases in clear-sky SSR but geographically limited all-sky SSR evolution. In contrast, under SSP3-7.0, clear-sky and all-sky SSR is projected to decline significantly over the domain. This decline is greatest in spring over Benelux due to combined increases in cloud cover and nitrate aerosols projected from 2050 onwards. In summer, projected decreases in cloud cover largely attenuate the reduction in SSR due to aerosols in 2050, while by 2100 rising water vapor contents counteract this attenuation. Thus, our results highlight seasonally and spatially variable impacts of future anthropogenic aerosol emissions on SSR evolution due to cloud cover and water vapor modifications that will likely largely contribute to the modulation of forthcoming aerosol influences."

In addition, the atmospheric transport of the volcanic cloud towards Europe is studied in detail. The amount of SO2 released during the eruption and the height of the volcanic plume are in excellent agreement among the different measurements. Furthermore, volcanic aerosol microphysical properties could be retrieved using a new retrieval approach based on lidar measurements. 
 The eruptions of the Tajogaite volcano on the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja ridge on the island of La Palma between September and December 2021 released large amounts of ash and SO2. Transport and dispersion of the volcanic emissions were monitored by ground-based stations and satellite instruments alike. In particular, the spectrometric fluorescence and Raman lidar for atmospheric moisture sensing (RAMSES) at the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory measured the plume of the strongest Tajogaite eruption of 22–23 September 2021 over northeastern Germany 4 d later. This study provides an analysis of SO2 vertical column density (VCD) and layer height (LH) measurements of the volcanic plume obtained with Sentinel-5 Precursor/TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which are compared to the observations at several stations across the Canary Islands. Furthermore, a new modeling approach based on TROPOMI SO2 VCD measurements and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) was developed, which confirmed the link between Tajogaite eruptions and Lindenberg measurements. Modeled mean emission height at the volcanic vent is in excellent agreement with co-located TROPOMI SO2 LH and local lidar ash-height measurements. Finally, a comprehensive discussion of the RAMSES measurements is presented. A new retrieval approach has been developed to estimate the microphysical properties of the volcanic aerosol. For the first time, an optical particle model is utilized that assumes an irregular, non-spheroidal shape of the aerosol particles. According to the analysis, the volcanic aerosol consisted solely of fine-mode inorganic, solid, and irregularly shaped particles – the presence of large aerosol particles or wildfire aerosols could be excluded. The particles likely had an isometric to slightly plate-like shape with an effective half of the particle maximum dimension around 0.1 µm and a refractive index of about 1.51. Moreover, mass column values between 70 and 110 mg m−2, mean mass concentrations of 45–70 µg m−3, and mean mass conversion factors between 0.21 and 0.33 g m−2 at 355 nm were retrieved. Possibly RAMSES observed, at least in part, volcanic secondary sulfate aerosol, which was produced by gas-phase homogeneous reactions during the transport of the air masses from La Palma to Lindenberg."
10.5194/acp-25-1227-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文利用1979年至2019年的再分析数据研究了最低平流层（LMS）的热力学结构的长期变化。研究发现，由于人为气候变化和平流层臭氧的恢复，LMS的热力学结构发生了变化，这同时也表明了大尺度环流的变化。研究重点关注1998年之后的变化，因为这被认为是平流层臭氧开始恢复的时期。研究使用了五种现代再分析资料：ERA5、ERA-Interim、MERRA-2、JRA-55和JRA-3Q，并采用动态线性回归模型进行趋势分析。结果表明，研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析。再分析数据本身就是整合了多种地面观测和卫星观测数据的结果，而研究分析的臭氧、水汽等，都属于大气成分分析的范畴。此外，对平流层和对流层顶的研究也与大气环境遥感技术中的高度信息提取和分析直接相关。,"['stratospheric ozone', 'water vapor', 'tropopause', 'isentropic pressure', 'reanalysis data', 'climate change', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Franziska Weyland;Peter Hoor;Daniel Kunkel;Thomas Birner;Felix Plöger;Katharina Turhal,Long-term changes in the thermodynamic structure of the lowermost stratosphere inferred from reanalysis data,"The lowermost stratosphere (LMS) plays an important role in the Earth's climate, containing strong gradients of ozone and water vapor. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic structure of the LMS was changing between 1979–2019 in response to anthropogenic climate change and the recovery of stratospheric ozone, also indicating large-scale circulation changes. We find that both the upper and the lower LMS boundaries show an (upward) trend, which has implications for the LMS mass. 
 The lowermost stratosphere (LMS) plays an important role in stratosphere–troposphere coupling and the Earth's radiation balance. This study investigates the effects of long-term changes in the tropopause and the lower-stratospheric isentropic structure on the mass of the LMS. We compare five modern reanalyses: ERA5, ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, JRA-55 and JRA-3Q. The focus is on changes after 1998, which marks the anticipated beginning of stratospheric ozone recovery. The trend analysis is performed with a dynamic linear regression model (DLM), capable of modeling non-linear trends. According to our study, isentropic pressure in the lower stratosphere (here 380–430 K) shows negative trends in the tropics and positive trends in the extratropics. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), we find that the extratropical tropopause is rising, accompanied by decreasing pressure at an average rate of −1 hPa per decade. Additionally, our results indicate that the tropical tropopause in the NH has expanded poleward by 0.5° latitude between 1998–2019. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics, the lapse rate tropopause shows a downward tendency of up to +2 hPa per decade after 1998, consistent across all reanalyses except JRA-3Q. The tropical tropopause and the cold point is rising, accompanied by decreasing pressure at a rate of ca. −0.5 hPa per decade in all reanalyses. The sign of the tropical tropopause potential temperature trends, however, differs across the reanalyses. This can be attributed to contrasting (absolute) temperature trends in the tropical tropopause region, such as at the 100 hPa pressure level. Consistent with the upward and poleward trend of the NH tropopause, the mass of the LMS decreases by 2 %–3 % for 1998–2019 if a fixed isentrope (380 K) is chosen as the upper LMS boundary. In ERA5, as well as MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim, this mass decline disappears if dynamical upper LMS boundaries are used that take the upward trends of the tropical tropopause into account."

In this paper, we present the new methods that add an ionospheric electrodynamics model to Vlasiator, coupling it with the existing methods and presenting new simulation results of how space plasma and Earth's ionosphere interact. 
 Simulations of the coupled ionosphere–magnetosphere system are a key tool to understand geospace and its response to space weather. For the most part, they are based on fluid descriptions of plasma (magnetohydrodynamics, MHD) formalism, coupled to an electrostatic ionosphere. Kinetic approaches to modeling the global magnetosphere with a coupled ionosphere system are still a rarity.We present an ionospheric boundary model for the global near-Earth plasma simulation system Vlasiator. It complements the magnetospheric hybrid-Vlasov simulations with an inner boundary condition that solves the ionospheric potential based on field-aligned current and plasma quantities from the magnetospheric domain. This new ionospheric module solves the ionospheric potential in a height-integrated approach on an unstructured grid and couples back to the hybrid-kinetic simulation by mapping the resulting electric field to the magnetosphere's inner boundary.The solver is benchmarked against a set of well-established analytic reference cases, and we discuss the benefits of a spherical Fibonacci mesh for use in ionospheric modeling. Preliminary results from coupled global magnetospheric–ionospheric simulations are presented, showing formation of both Region 1 and Region 2 current systems."

The size-dependent reduction behavior of iron (oxyhydr)oxides in single and mixed mineral systems remains poorly understood. In this study, we used microbial and mediated electrochemical reduction approaches to investigate the reduction kinetics and extents of goethite and hematite. We found that small particles were preferentially reduced relative to their large counterparts in single and mixed mineral systems regardless of microbial or electrochemical treatments, which is attributed to the combined effect of higher thermodynamic favorability and greater surface availability. In mixed mineral systems, small particles were reduced slightly faster, whereas large particles were reduced notably slower and less extensively than solely predicted from single mineral systems. Specifically, when reduced alone, small particles showed Fe(III) reduction rate constants that were 1.5- to 3.6-fold higher than large particles, while when reduced together, the reduction rate constants for small particles were 6- to 21-fold higher than the rate constants for large particles. These collective findings provide new insights into the pivotal role of nanoparticulate iron (oxyhydr)oxides in environmental redox reactions."

Tap water is an important source of exposure in communities with any degree of contamination but routine or large-scale PFAS monitoring often depends on targeted analytical methods limited to measuring specific PFAS. We analyzed 680 tap water samples from the American Healthy Homes Survey II for PFAS using non-targeted analysis (NTA) to expand the range of detectable PFAS. Based on detection frequency and relative abundance, about half of the identified PFAS were found only by NTA. We identified (with varying degrees of confidence) 75 distinct PFAS, including 57 exclusively detected by NTA. The identified PFAS are members of seven structural subclasses differentiated by their head groups and degree of fluorination. Clustering analysis categorized the PFAS into four coabundance groups dominated by specific PFAS subclasses. One group uniquely identified by NTA contains zwitterionic PFAS and other PFAS transformation products which are likely associated with aqueous firefighting foam contaminants in a small number of spatially correlated samples. These results help further characterize the scope of exposure to emerging PFAS experienced by the U.S. population via tap water and augment nationwide targeted-PFAS monitoring programs."

 Turnover in species composition through time is a dominant form of biodiversity change, which has profound effects on the functioning of ecological communities1–4. Turnover rates differ markedly among communities4, but the drivers of this variation across taxa and realms remain unknown. Here we analyse 42,225 time series of species composition from marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages, and show that temporal rates of turnover were consistently faster in locations that experienced faster temperature change, including both warming and cooling. In addition, assemblages with limited access to microclimate refugia or that faced stronger human impacts on land were especially responsive to temperature change, with up to 48% of species replaced per decade. These results reveal a widespread signal of vulnerability to continuing climate change and highlight which ecological communities are most sensitive, raising concerns about ecosystem integrity as climate change and other human impacts accelerate. Global-scale analyses of marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages found that temporal rates of species replacement were faster in locations with faster temperature change, including warming and cooling, and vulnerable assemblages were especially responsive."

Corn,C-terminal amides mark proteins for degradation via SCF–FBXO31,"SCF–FBXO31 scans proteins for C-terminal amidation and marks them for subsequent proteasomal degradation. 
 During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts1. When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites2,3. Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins3–6; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins.

 Carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bonds are the foundation of essentially every organic molecule, making them an ideal place to do chemical synthesis. The key challenge is achieving selectivity for one particular C(sp3)−H bond1–3. In recent years, metalloenzymes have been found to perform C(sp3)−H bond functionalization4,5. Despite substantial progresses in the past two decades6,7, enzymatic halogenation and pseudohalogenation of unactivated C(sp3)−H—providing a functional handle for further modification—have been achieved with only non-haem iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and are therefore limited by the chemistry possible with these enzymes8. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a previously unknown halogenase ApnU, part of a protein family containing domain of unknown function 3328 (DUF3328). ApnU uses copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds. By taking advantage of the softer copper centre, we demonstrate that ApnU can catalyse unprecedented enzymatic C(sp3)−H bond functionalization such as iodination and thiocyanation. Using biochemical characterization and proteomics analysis, we identified the functional oligomeric state of ApnU as a covalently linked homodimer, which contains three essential pairs—one interchain and two intrachain—of disulfide bonds. The metal-coordination active site in ApnU consists of binuclear type II copper centres, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This discovery expands the enzymatic capability of C(sp3)−H halogenases and provides a foundational understanding of this family of binuclear copper-dependent oxidative enzymes.

 As a result of the high volume of maritime traffic along the coasts of Namibia and western South Africa, mariners recorded numerous in-situ wind observations since early times. Many of these historical data are currently available through the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). Here, we make use of these historical data to develop an instrumental index for the characterization of the upwelling-favorable winds over the southern Benguela Upwelling System from 1833 to 2014. Our results suggest that upwelling in this region has increased since the mid-1980s, in good agreement with previous research. However, when the entire period is considered, our index does not evidence a long-term trend but a multidecadal variability with an oscillation period between 20 and 30 years.

 In deep continental bedrock groundwater, volatile organic compounds pose intriguing questions about their occurrence. Although their natural sources remain poorly characterized, they potentially have profound effects on global elemental cycles and safety assessment of underground facilities. Our investigation focused on non-methane volatile organic compounds in five groundwater-filled Precambrian bedrock fracture zones at 500 m to 2300 m depth in the Outokumpu Deep Drill Hole, Finland. The system revealed a range of indigenous volatile organic compounds, including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, alkanes, aromatics, and sulfur-compounds. Metagenomic sequencing demonstrated spatially widely distributed genetic potential for microbial volatile organic compound metabolism. Integrating these findings with local geology and hydrogeochemistry, our results suggest that volatile organic compounds are not only formed in or released to groundwater but also degraded in the continental bedrock through interconnected abiotic and biotic processes.

 In this work, a depth-only completion method designed to enhance perception in light-deprived environments. We achieve this through LidarDepthNet, a novel end-to-end unsupervised learning framework that fuses heterogeneous depth information captured by two distinct depth sensors: LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. This represents the first unsupervised LiDAR-depth fusion framework for depth completion, demonstrating scalability to diverse real-world subterranean and enclosed environments. To facilitate unsupervised learning, we leverage relative rigid motion transfer (RRMT) to synthesize co-visible depth maps from temporally adjacent frames. This allows us to construct a temporal depth consistency loss, constraining the fused depth to adhere to realistic metric scale. Furthermore, we introduce measurement confidence into the heterogeneous depth fusion model, further refining the fused depth and promoting synergistic complementation between the two depth modalities. Extensive evaluation on both real-world and synthetic datasets, notably a newly proposed LiDAR-depth fusion dataset, LidarDepthSet, demonstrates the significant advantages of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches."

 The tunnel environment is characterized by insufficient ambient light, obstructed view, and complex inner lining construction conditions. These factors frequently result in limited anti-interference capability, reduced recognition accuracy, and suboptimal segmentation results for defect extraction. We propose a deep network model utilizing an encoder–decoder framework that integrates Transformer and convolution for comprehensive defect extraction. The proposed model utilizes an encoder that integrates a hierarchical Transformer backbone with an efficient attention mechanism to fully explore complete information at multi-scale granularities. In the decoder, multi-scale information is initially aggregated using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module. Additionally, the Stacking Filters with Atrous Convolutions (SFAC) module are implemented to enhance the perception of the complete defect scope. Furthermore, a Boundary-aware Attention Module (BAM) is implemented to enhance edge information to improve the detection of defects. With this well-designed decoder, the multi-scale information from the encoder can be fully aggregated and exploited for complete defect detection. Experimental findings illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing tunnel lining defects within the image dataset. The outcomes reveal that our proposed network achieves an accuracy (Acc) of 94.4% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 78.14%. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation networks, our model improves the accuracy of tunnel lining defect extraction, showcasing enhanced extraction effectiveness and anti-interference capability, thus meeting the engineering requirements for defect detection in complex environments of tunnels."

Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultrahigh precision, below 0.01‰, but its accuracy is often worse than 5‰ due to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements. To eliminate this problem, we exploit optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a high-fidelity dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. We demonstrate the sub–per-mil accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results for CO line intensity and for HD line shape, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10−4level.

BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs.

Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors.
