10.1021/acs.est.4c06586,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文主要研究的是泥炭土燃烧后土壤有机质电子转移性质的变化，以及这种变化对微生物铁还原和甲烷生成的影 响。研究模拟了不同温度下泥炭土的燃烧过程，分析了燃烧温度、氧气供应等因素对土壤有机质电子交换能力、氧化还原活性物质以及电导率的影响。实验结果表明，燃烧会显著降低土壤有机质的电子交换能力，但也会产生新的氧化还原活性物质和石墨化碳，从而影响土壤的电子转移过程和微生物活性。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它关注的是土壤层面的生物地球化学过程，而非大气成分的遥感监测。,[],Peijie Yang;Shuai Wang;Tianran Sun;Tao Jiang;Yifan Cui;Guangliang Liu;Yingying Guo;Yanwei Liu;Ligang Hu;Jianbo Shi;Qinghua Zhang;Yongguang Yin;Yong Cai;Guibin Jiang,"Fire-Induced Multiple Changes in Electron Transfer Properties of Peat Soil Organic Matter: The Role of Functional Groups, Graphitic Carbon, and Iron","Peatland fires induced changes in electron transfer properties and relevant electroactive structures of peat soil organic matter (PSOM) remain ambiguous, impeding comprehension of postfire biogeochemical processes. Here, we revealed temperature-dependent electron exchange capacity (EEC) of PSOM dynamics through simulated peat soil burning (150–500 °C), which extremely changed postfire microbial Fe-nanoparticles reduction and methanogenesis. EEC diminished significantly (60–75% loss) due to phenolic-quinone moieties depletion with increasing temperature, regardless of oxygen availability. The final EEC in oxic burning surpassed that of anoxic burning by 1.5 times, attributed to additional quinones from oxygen incorporation. Notably, EEC exhibited heat resistance up to 200 °C and stabilized above 350 °C. Additionally, fire reshaped the EEC-relevant redox-active moieties. Heterocyclic-N generated from burning predominantly contributed to the electron-accepting capacity (EAC) alongside quinones, while phenolic moieties and bonded Fe(II) enhanced the electron-donating capacity (EDC). However, the preferential binding of heterocyclic-N to Fe(II) restricted the EDC of Fe(II). Interestingly, the decrease in EAC declined its electron-shuttling effects in microbial Fe nanoparticle reduction, but fire-induced graphitic carbon formation increased the electrical conductivity (EC) of PSOM, promoting electron transfer. Further, enhanced EC may facilitate methanogenesis in postfire peatlands. These findings advance our understanding of elemental biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse emission mechanisms in postfire peatlands."

We conducted a systematic review of the current epidemiological evidence on wildfire health risks and a meta-analysis to investigate the association between wildfire smoke exposure and various health outcomes. We discovered that wildfire smoke increases the risk of premature deaths and respiratory morbidity in the general population. Meta-analysis of cause-specific mortality and morbidity revealed that wildfire smoke had the strongest associations with cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.014–1.021), asthma hospitalization (RR: 1.054, 95% CI: 1.026–1.082), and asthma emergency department visits (RR: 1.117, 95% CI: 1.035–1.204) in the general population. Subgroup analyses of age found that adults and  elderly adults were more susceptible to the cardiopulmonary effects of wildfire smoke. Next, we systematically addressed the toxicological mechanisms of wildfire smoke, including direct toxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, immune dysregulation, genotoxicity and mutations, skin allergies, inflammation, and others. We discuss wildfire smoke risk mitigation strategies including public health interventions, regulatory measures, and personal actions. We conclude by highlighting current research limitations and future directions for wildfire research, such as elucidating the complex interactions of wildfire smoke components on human health, developing personalized risk assessment tools, and improving resilience and adaptation strategies to mitigate the health effects of wildfires in  changing climate."

Spectra-derived lists of formulas and their relative abundances are used to compare ambient OA from different sources or to monitor secondary OA formation under controlled laboratory conditions in smog chamber experiments. Various techniques are implemented to visualize common and unique features, series of precursors, and products. The disadvantage of this conventional approach is in associating elemental compositions to specific compounds, while due to several analytical limitations, the structural information remains hidden. We argue that some of the conclusions derived from this data analysis can be misleading. In this study, we applied in-ESI source H/D exchange (HDX), which facilitated enumeration of labile protons in molecules behind elemental compositions of OA. We applied this technique to compare OA from three different locations representing urban, forest, and marine environments and to examine tentative chemical information derived from Kendrick mass defect (KMD) series analysis. Significant discrepancies were found between numbers of labile protons in protogenic functional groups and the stoichiometry of chemical reactions, which are associated with KMD series. Only a portion of chemical pairs matched target stoichiometries, which highlights the existing limitations in environmental applications of conventional formula-based HRMS data interpretation strategies."

However, FNP aggregation is difficult to predict in the presence of organic matter (OM), given the heterogeneity in the OM properties. Five model OMs based on (poly)acrylic acid (PAA or AA) and polyethylene glycol with or without terminal carboxyl groups (PEG or PEGbis, respectively) were chosen to probe the influence of key OM properties─specifically, carboxyl richness and molecular weight (MW)─and the dominant mechanisms by which they influence OM adsorption onto FNPs and the resulting aggregation. For OMs with similar MWs, those with a higher carboxyl richness adsorbed more extensively onto FNPs: PAA2k > PEGbis > PEG. Meanwhile, for OMs with the same carboxyl richness, higher MW OMs adsorbed more: PAA25k > PAA2k > AA. Furthermore, the subsequent aggregation of FNPs was largely controlled by the adsorbed mass. OMs with negligible adsorption (i.e., PEG and AA) did not change the aggregation behavior of FNPs. For OMs with low carboxyl richness (PEGbis), accelerated aggregation occurred through a bridging effect with low adsorbed mass. For OMs with high carboxyl richness (PAA2k and PAA25k), aggregation was accelerated at moderate adsorbed OM masses by patch-charge attraction and was inhibited with high adsorbed OM mass due to steric repulsion. This study provided new insights into understanding and predicting the transport and fate of FNPs and natural organic matter (NOM) in natural environments with various NOM compositions."

Large language model (LLM)-based text mining holds the potential to automatically extract complex toxicological information from the literature. Due to its relevance to diseases and the challenge of comprehensive characterization, oxidative stress serves as a suitable case for research by texting mining. In this study, a robust workflow utilizing a LLM (i.e., GPT-4) was developed to extract information on oxidative stress tests, including data collection, text preprocessing, prompt engineering, and performance evaluation procedures. A total of 17,780 relevant records were extracted from 7166 articles, covering 2558 unique compounds. A rising interest in oxidative stress was observed over the past two decades. A list of known prooxidants (n = 1416) and antioxidants (n = 1102) was established, with the leading chemical categories being pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and metals for prooxidants and pharmaceuticals and flavonoids for antioxidants. Structural alert analysis identified potential prooxidant (e.g., chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, and tertiary amines) and antioxidant (e.g., flavonoid and thiol) substructures.

Rivers can be dynamic and difficult systems to study for MeHg production and bioaccumulation, hence identifying sources of MeHg to these systems is both challenging and important for resource management within rivers and main-stem reservoirs. Riparian zones, which are known biogeochemical hotspots for MeHg production, are understudied as potential sources of MeHg to rivers. Here, we present a comprehensive quantification of the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes governing MeHg concentrations, loads, and bioaccumulation at 16 locations along 164 km of the agriculturally intensive Snake River (Idaho, Oregon USA) during summer baseflow conditions, with emphasis on riparian production of MeHg. Approximately one-third of the MeHg load of the Snake River could not be attributed to inflowing waters (upgradient, tributaries, or irrigation drains). Across the study reach, increases in MeHg loads in surface waters were significantly correlated with MeHg concentrations in riparian porewaters, suggesting riparian zones were likely an important source of MeHg to the Snake River. Across all locations, MeHg concentrations in surface waters positively correlated with MeHg concentrations in benthic snails and clams, supporting that riparian produced MeHg was assimilated into local aquatic food webs. This study contributes new insights into riparian MeHg production within rivers which can inform mitigation efforts to reduce MeHg bioaccumulation in fish."

Yingling;Paul Westerhoff,Multiple Data Imputation Methods Advance Risk Analysis and Treatability of Co-occurring Inorganic Chemicals in Groundwater,"Accurately assessing and managing risks associated with inorganic pollutants in groundwater is imperative. Historic water quality databases are often sparse due to rationale or financial budgets for sample collection and analysis, posing challenges in evaluating exposure or water treatment effectiveness. We utilized and compared two advanced multiple data imputation techniques, AMELIA and MICE algorithms, to fill gaps in sparse groundwater quality data sets. AMELIA outperformed MICE in handling missing values, as MICE tended to overestimate certain values, resulting in more outliers. Field data sets revealed that 75% to 80% of samples exhibited no co-occurring regulated pollutants surpassing MCL values, whereas imputed values showed only 15% to 55% of the samples posed no health risks. Imputed data unveiled a significant increase, ranging from 2 to 5 times, in the number of sampling locations predicted to potentially exceed health-based limits and identified samples where 2 to 6 co-occurring chemicals may occur and surpass health-based levels. Linking imputed data to sampling locations can pinpoint potential hotspots of elevated chemical levels and guide optimal resource allocation for additional field sampling and chemical analysis. With this approach, further analysis of complete data sets allows state agencies authorized to conduct groundwater monitoring, often with limited financial resources, to prioritize sampling locations and chemicals to be tested. Given existing data and time constraints, it is crucial to identify the most strategic use of the available resources to address data gaps effectively. This work establishes a framework to enhance the beneficial impact of funding groundwater data collection by reducing uncertainty in prioritizing future sampling locations and chemical analyses."

This study examines the influence of correcting systematic bias in RCM boundaries on the representation of Australian synoptic systems. We utilize a structural self‐organizing map to evaluate the frequency, persistence, and transitions of daily synoptic systems. Our findings reveal that an RCM with multivariate bias‐corrected boundaries improves the representation of synoptic systems compared to the driving GCM, or an RCM with uncorrected or simply bias‐corrected boundaries, particularly in reference to the frequency of systems identified.

 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play fundamental roles in cellular processes and pathologies, regulating gene expression at multiple levels. Despite being highly cell type-specific, their study at single-cell (sc) level is challenging due to their less accurate annotation and low expression compared to protein-coding genes. Here, we systematically benchmark different preprocessing methods and develop a computational framework, named ELATUS, based on the combination of the pseudoaligner Kallisto with selective functional filtering. ELATUS enhances the detection of functional lncRNAs from scRNA-seq data, detecting their expression with higher concordance than standard methods with the ATAC-seq profiles in single-cell multiome data. Interestingly, the better results of ELATUS are due to its advanced performance with an inaccurate reference annotation such as that of lncRNAs. We independently confirm the expression patterns of cell type-specific lncRNAs exclusively detected with ELATUS and unveil biologically important lncRNAs, such as AL121895.1, a previously undocumented cis-repressor lncRNA, whose role in breast cancer progression is unnoticed by traditional methodologies.

More importantly, a parallel-connected stack of six photoanodes of transparent p–n homojunction records a near-theoretical photocurrent density of ~10 mA cm–2 at 1.23 VRHE under standard photoelectrochemical water splitting conditions, which serves as a useful reference for hematite photoanodes and promises its practical application for unbiased photoelectrochemical water splitting. Developing efficient and transparent photoanodes for solar water splitting is crucial for advancing clean energy technologies. Here, the authors report Sb-doped p–n homojunction hematite photoanodes that achieve high transparency and a stable photocurrent density of 4.21 mA cm–2."

Here, the authors report biochemical and structural data showing that bacterial 2-methylisoborneol biosynthesis is compartmentalized inside a megadalton encapsulin protein compartment. 
 Terpenoids are the largest class of natural products, found across all domains of life. One of the most abundant bacterial terpenoids is the volatile odorant 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), partially responsible for the earthy smell of soil and musty taste of contaminated water. Many bacterial 2-MIB biosynthetic gene clusters were thought to encode a conserved transcription factor, named EshA in the model soil bacterium Streptomyces griseus. Here, we revise the function of EshA, now referred to as Sg Enc, and show that it is a Family 2B encapsulin shell protein. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we find that Sg Enc forms an icosahedral protein shell and encapsulates 2-methylisoborneol synthase (2-MIBS) as a cargo protein. Sg Enc contains a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binding domain (CBD)-fold insertion and a unique metal-binding domain, both displayed on the shell exterior. We show that Sg Enc CBDs do not bind cAMP. We find that 2-MIBS cargo loading is mediated by an N-terminal disordered cargo-loading domain and that 2-MIBS activity and Sg Enc shell structure are not modulated by cAMP. Our work redefines the function of EshA and establishes Family 2B encapsulins as cargo-loaded protein nanocompartments involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

Here, the authors report that lengthening the 2-position substituents of benzimidazole-based copper coordination polymer precatalysts retards H+ diffusion, reduces Cu-Cu coordination numbers, and promotes C-C coupling. 
 CO2 electroreduction is a potential pathway to achieve net-zero emissions in the chemical industry. Yet, CO2 loss, resulting from (bi)carbonate formation, renders the process energy-intensive. Acidic environments can address the issue but at the expense of compromised product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs), particularly for multi-carbon (C2+) products, as rapid diffusion and migration of protons (H+) favors competing H2 and CO production. Here, we present a strategy of tuning the 2-position substituent length on benzimidazole (BIM)-based copper (Cu) coordination polymer (CuCP) precatalyst – to enhance CO2 reduction to C2+ products in acidic environments. Lengthening the substituent from H to nonyl enhances H+ diffusion retardation and decreases Cu-Cu coordination numbers (CNs), favoring further reduction of CO. This leads to a nearly 24× enhancement of selectivity towards CO hydrogenation and C-C coupling at 60 mA cm−2. We report the highest C2+ product FE of more than 70% at 260 mA cm−2 on pentyl-CuCP and demonstrate a CO2-to-C2+ single-pass conversion (SPC) of ~54% at 180 mA cm−2 using pentyl-CuCP in zero-gap electrolyzers.

Here, the authors demonstrate that the coarsening behavior depends on the surface defect chemistry of the respective oxide support as well as the oxophilicity of the exsolved metal. 
 Exsolution reactions enable the synthesis of oxide-supported metal nanoparticles, which are desirable as catalysts in green energy conversion technologies. It is crucial to precisely tailor the nanoparticle characteristics to optimize the catalysts’ functionality, and to maintain the catalytic performance under operation conditions. We use chemical (co)-doping to modify the defect chemistry of exsolution-active perovskite oxides and examine its influence on the mass transfer kinetics of Ni dopants towards the oxide surface and on the subsequent coalescence behavior of the exsolved nanoparticles during a continuous thermal reduction treatment. Nanoparticles that exsolve at the surface of the acceptor-type fast-oxygen-ion-conductor SrTi0.95Ni0.05O3−δ (STNi) show a high surface mobility leading to a very low thermal stability compared to nanoparticles that exsolve at the surface of donor-type SrTi0.9Nb0.05Ni0.05O3−δ (STNNi). Our analysis indicates that the low thermal stability of exsolved nanoparticles at the acceptor-doped perovskite surface is linked to a high oxygen vacancy concentration at the nanoparticle-oxide interface. For catalysts that require fast oxygen exchange kinetics, exsolution synthesis routes in dry hydrogen conditions may hence lead to accelerated degradation, while humid reaction conditions may mitigate this failure mechanism.

 Salt marshes are among the most efficient blue carbon sinks worldwide. The fate of this carbon is uncertain due to limited knowledge about organic matter (OM) decomposition processes under sea-level rise. In an in-situ manipulative experiment, we compared salt marsh OM decomposition and quality across simulated sea-level scenarios (by modifying the inundation) and litter types (absorptive root, fine transportive root, leaves, and rhizomes of Halimione portulacoide) for 170 days. The litter decomposition varied only between the inundation treatments with the longest and shortest durations, while the decomposition differed significantly across litter types, with absorptive roots releasing up to 40% less carbon than other litters. Changes in lignin composition were minimal for absorptive roots and were unaffected by sea-level rise scenarios. Our study suggests that (i) current projections of sea-level rise are unlikely to decrease litter decomposition; (ii) separating litter types might lead to better assessments of salt marshes’ OM dynamics.

Our findings revealed significant variability in nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios in both water and seston, indicating heterogeneous nature of thermokarst lakes. Phytoplankton communities were dominated by cyanobacteria. Zooplankton communities, though simple, varied significantly and responded distinctly to the prevailing nutrient stoichiometry, and particularly shown competitive interactions between copepods and Cladocera. Structural Equation Modeling revealed a complex web of interactions, underscoring the bottom-up influences from nutrient stoichiometry in water to phytoplankton/seston, and finally to zooplankton, although there were no direct relationships between phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Water nutrient stoichiometry positively affected eukaryotic algae but negatively impacted seston stoichiometry, which. had a negative influence on copepods.

 The Arctic-Boreal region is projected to experience spatially divergent trends in snow depth following climate change. However, the impact of these spatial trends has remained largely unexplored, despite potentially large consequences for the carbon cycle. To address this knowledge gap, we forced a customised arctic version of the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS with daily CMIP6 outputs from a global climate model (MRI-ESM2-0) under three climate scenarios. We find that snow depths increased the most in the coldest, northernmost regions, insulating the soil, which led to increased heterotrophic respiration and reduced carbon residence times. We emphasise the need for improved projections of future snow depth - in particular diverging trends across landscapes - to more accurately simulate the strength of Arctic-Boreal carbon feedbacks and their impact on global climate.

 Precise forecasting of land use modifications and carbon storage (CS) alterations is essential for effective regulatory measures and ecological quality enhancement. However, there are limited studies on land use dynamics and its impact on CS in the arid regions of Northwest China. Therefore, this study explores land use and CS changes in the Tulufan-Hami Basin from 2000 to 2050. The SD-FLUS and InVEST models were employed to simulate land use patterns and assess CS under three scenarios (SSP126-EP, SSP245-ND and SSP585-ED). The results of our study indicate that the area of cropland and built-up land both increased dramatically from 2000 to 2020, expanding by 347 km2 and 505 km2 respectively. CS initially rose by 0.74 × 106t from 2000 to 2010 but then declined by 1.37 × 106t from 2010 to 2020. Construction expansion and grassland degradation drove the decline. By 2050, the SSP126-EP scenario predicts an increase in CS of 3.64 × 106t compared to 2020. However, both the SSP245-ND and SSP585-ED scenarios show significant decreases, with a decline of 0.55 × 106t and 1.87 × 106t respectively.

 Methoxyphenols are released in abundance from lignin pyrolysis during biomass burning. Apart from being atmospheric brown carbon components that absorb solar radiation and warm the climate, methoxyphenols also undergo photoreaction in the atmospheric aqueous phase and form secondary organic aerosols (aqSOA). While efforts have been devoted to understanding chemical evolutions and climate-related optical properties of aqSOA, their potential health impacts also require timely investigations. Herein, we used the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay to investigate oxidative potential of the aqSOA formed during the 8-h aqueous-phase photoreaction of two typical methoxyphenols, vanillin and vanillic acid, under pH 2 or 8, and with or without ammonia nitrate. The highest DTT consumption rates (RDTT) were observed for vanillin aqSOA formed in the presence of ammonia nitrate and at pH 8. At pH 2, although RDTT increased rapidly during early photoreaction, it reduced after prolonged illumination. High-resolution mass spectrometry and linear regression analyses were performed to correlate the photoreaction products with the observed RDTT. Results showed that three products that present quinone, lactone and dimer structures, respectively, should be the key drivers of elevated RDTT for aqSOA formed during photoreaction of vanillin and vanillic acid alone, whereas it shifted to the nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds during their photoreaction with ammonia nitrate. Our results have revealed the role of nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in the oxidative potential and health effects of aqSOA from biomass burning, which was rarely recognized before and warrants immediate assessments."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107716,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究的是城市群对区域极端高温和干旱事件的影响机制。研究使用RegCM 5.0数值模拟了2022年8月长江流域的一次极端高温事件，结果表明城市群导致城市和非城市地区气温显著升高，并通过改变地表感热通量、湍流活动、城市上升气流和城市热岛效应等，增强下沉气流，增加地表风速，形成城市群周围的穹顶状风场异常，从而扩大高温事件的地理范围并增强其强度。该研究主要关注城市化对区域气候的影响，特别是对极端天气事件的影响，并未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,"['temperature', 'surface wind', 'heat island effect', 'numerical simulation', 'regional climate modeling']",Yulong Ren;Ping Yue;Jinhu Yang;Qiang Zhang;Sha Sha;Xiaoyun Liu;Yaling Lu,The mechanism of urban agglomeration causing the enhancement of regional extreme heat and drought events,"•Urban agglomerations lead to obviously increasedT2min both urban (0.6°C increase) and non-urban (0.2°C increase) areas. •The feedback of urbans increases the surface sensible heat, turbulence activity, urban updraft and heat island effect. •The enhanced downdraft increase the surface wind, form a wind anomaly around the urbans, then rise the extreme event. •The mechanism of urban agglomeration causing the enhancement of regional extreme heat and drought events has been found. 
 Urban agglomerations formed by rapid urbanization have been found to be important ways through which human activities influence regional weather and climate. However, the role of urban agglomerations in the formation of extreme heat and drought events remains unclear. We perform numerical simulations using RegCM 5.0 on an August 2022 extreme heat event in the Yangtze River Basin in China. The results show that urban agglomerations lead to significantly increased temperature in both urban (0.6 °C increase) and non-urban (0.2 °C increase) areas. The land feedback formed by urban agglomerations significantly increases the surface sensible heat, turbulence activity, urban upward movement, and urban heat island effect. As a result, the sinking airflow is enhanced, the surface wind is increased, and a dome-shaped wind field anomaly is formed around the urban agglomerations. This widens the geographic scope of the heat event and heightens its intensity."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107759,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了化学传输模型 (CTM) 中垂直网格分辨率和湍流扩散方案对空气质量模拟的影响。研究使用了CHIMERE模型，在巴黎地区冬季污染事件期间进行了不同垂直分辨率和湍流扩散方案的对比实验。结果表明，更精细的垂直分辨率，特别是更精细的第一层高度，能够显著提高模型对重污染事件的模拟精度。然而，基于湍流动能的复杂扩散方案对第一层高度设置更为敏感。研究还发现，改进垂直扩散方案也能有效提升模型性能。总的来说，该研究关注的是如何改进数值模拟方法以提高空气质量预测的准确性，特别是针对重污染事件。虽然没有直接涉及到遥感技术，例如卫星观测数据，但其改进的数值模拟方法可以更好地与遥感数据结合，用于更准确的空气质量监测和分析。,"['air quality', 'pollution', 'chemical transport model', 'vertical resolution', 'turbulent diffusion', 'numerical simulation']",Lei Jiang;Bertrand Bessagnet;Frédérik Meleux;Florian Couvidat;Frédéric Tognet;Jianlin Hu,The role of vertical grid resolution and turbulent diffusion uncertainty on chemical transport modeling,"•The impact of the model's vertical grid resolution is especially evident during nocturnal stable conditions. •Excessively fine first-layer heights can lead to inaccurate turbulence kinetic energy calculations. •The advanced vertical diffusion scheme improved model performances in a heavy pollution event. 
 Chemical transport models (CTM) tend to perform poorly in simulating pollution processes under weak turbulent diffusion conditions. In this study, we address this issue from the perspectives of vertical grid resolution and vertical mixing schemes. Three vertical grid resolution configurations (L4, L12, L40) with the CHIMERE model are evaluated during a winter episode, which includes a heavy pollution episode (PE) in the Paris region. The results emphasize the significance of vertical grid resolution, particularly noticeable during nighttime, and consequently impacts CHIMERE simulations under nocturnal stable conditions. Consistent improvement in CTM modeling is observed with refined vertical resolutions and the first layer height based on a simple linear vertical diffusion scheme defined as the initial Kz diffusion (IKD) scheme. Compared to the other two configurations, the finest configuration (referred to as L4-IKD) demonstrates an average improvement in root mean square error of 23.26 % and 25.09 % on regular days (RD) and 62 % and 129 % during PE, respectively. However, simulations using the 1.5-order turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) based eddy diffusivity closure scheme, named the new eddy diffusion (NED), are more sensitive to the first layer height setup. Excessively fine first-layer heights can lead to inaccurate TKE calculations. Generally, models with low vertical grid resolution can reasonably predict air quality on RD or during light pollution events but struggle with heavy PEs. One straightforward enhancement strategy involves adding an extra fine first layer height in CTM simulations, resulting in an average 50.10 % improvement from L4-IKD to L12-IKD during PE. Another strategy is enhancing the model's vertical diffusion scheme, which improved the CTM modeling by 26.67 % compared with IKD during PE under identical vertical grid resolution."

 Vertical distributions of chemical components of particulate matter (PM) are essential for better understanding the climate, environmental and health effects. The steep slope from western SiChuan Basin (SCB) to eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) provides a good platform for obtaining the gradient variations of PM chemical components. Daytime and nighttime PM1 (particulate matter smaller than 1 μm) samples were collected with the medium-volume sampler at six sites with elevation ranging from 500 m to 3500 m (Chengdu, Sanbacun, Wenchuan, Lixian, Maerkang and Hongyuan). The secondary inorganic ions and carbonaceous aerosols were the largest contributor to PM1 concentrations. The chemical components from the anthropogenic sources existed strong stratification with high concentrations inside the basin, while primary natural ions showed little discrepancy among the sites. The concentrations of primary inorganic ions from anthropogenic sources were much higher at nighttime than daytime, which was contrary to the diurnal cycle of secondary inorganic ions. Spatial heterogeneity of PM chemical components was large between basin and plateau sites, especially for NO3− and NH4+, large depending on season and daylight. The excess NH4+ concentrations existed in spring, summer and fall, while SO42− and NO3− cannot be completely neutralized by NH4+ in winter. The proportion of secondary formation in all sources significantly increased from about 10 % to 30 %–40 % with the increased elevation, while the contribution of motor vehicles declined from western SCB to eastern TP. This study will fill the scarce observations of PM chemical components at the sloped terrain and deepen the understanding of formation mechanism of heavy pollution inside the basin."
