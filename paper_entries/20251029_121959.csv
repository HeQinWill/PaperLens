Meteorological data is critical for assessing heat stress, and localized microclimate data provide more precise measurements of heat hazards than traditional weather station data. Our study explored microclimate patterns in space and time in tropical cities with rapidly growing urban populations and warming climates. We established a microclimate monitoring network with sensors measuring air temperature and relative humidity throughout two large cities in Gujarat, India. We collected hourly microclimate data on temperature and humidity from April 2023 to May 2024 from paired indoor/outdoor sensors at 48 homes in Ahmedabad and 45 homes in Surat. We summarized dry bulb (T) and wet-bulb (Tw) temperatures at indoor and outdoor locations, compared temporal patterns across seasons and times of the day, and investigated relationships with urban land cover. Indoor and outdoor microclimates had different diurnal variations, with distinctive patterns during the monsoon compared to other seasons. Building volume had warming effects and vegetation had cooling effects on minimum T and Tw, particularly at outdoor locations. In contrast, building volume had cooling effects and vegetation had warming effects on maximum T and Tw, particularly at indoor locations. Temperatures were consistently cooler at locations with higher albedo, and relationships with water were weaker and more variable. A model comparison found significant differences in land cover effects for indoor versus outdoor locations. Given the increasing occurrence of heat waves and climate-related health threats in western India and other tropical areas, it will be essential to account for the different spatial and temporal patterns of indoor and outdoor microclimates to more precisely identify locations and timings of temperature extremes."

This paper delves into the water-energy-food-ecosystems (WEFE) nexus, a scientific framework that supports the integrated assessment and management of the interconnected resources. Shifting from sectoral to cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary perspectives, the WEFE nexus addresses interdependencies and interactions among water, energy, food, ecosystems, and climate. This paper focuses on the extended nexus, incorporating ecosystems as a fourth pillar, underscoring the importance of considering ecosystems on an equal footing with water, energy, and food sectors. In addition, the paper emphasizes the significance of monitoring and modelling techniques, laying the foundations for understanding the nexus complexities and assessing uncertainty. The paper offers an overview of integrated nexus modelling, system analysis and socio-economic modelling, bridging the gap between nexus science and practice. It highlights the role of multifaceted stakeholder engagement methods, policy assessment, and institutional analysis in nexus models. Quantifying the nexus through indicators, and its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, EU Green Deal, and EU Blue Deal are also key focal points. Finally, the last part of the paper addresses challenges in existing nexus modelling attempts, advocates for the integration of transdisciplinary information, and presents lessons learned. The paper concludes with recommendations for the future of the WEFE nexus, emphasizing its potential in fostering transformative change toward sustainable resource management and inclusive policymaking."

Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD)+ projects generate carbon credits by reducing forest loss within the project area compared with a counterfactual area that faces similar pressures (known as ‘additionality’). Several methods are available for constructing counterfactuals, but comparing their reliability is challenging. Here, we present an evaluation approach based on the creation of placebo projects, where there are no REDD+ activities and in which we would not expect project and counterfactual outcomes to diverge. We compare four methods based on pixel matching that estimate counterfactual deforestation rates. Using 27 placebo projects spread across the tropics, we found that pixel-matching is a reliable way of estimating a key element of additionality (i.e. deforestation in counterfactual areas) when based on data gathered at the end of an evaluation period after project start (i.e. ex-post estimation). However, forecasting counterfactual deforestation rates from information available at the start of a project (i.e. ex-ante estimation) is much less reliable, reinforcing existing concerns about ex-ante crediting mechanisms. We argue that systematic application of the placebo approach can accelerate the development and adoption of more credible counterfactual-estimating methods. As counterfactuals are the basis which underpins the validity claims of most nature credits, strengthening the credibility of counterfactuals will enhance the effectiveness of conservation finance, helping REDD+ and other nature-based solutions realise their full potential in delivering real, measurable benefits."

Examining intellectual hegemony in climate research,"Analysing a dataset of 5432 journal articles (1986–2023) using bibliometric techniques, we investigate the conceptual framing, thematic evolution and publication trends of just transition—a concept seeking to reconcile climate action with social and economic justice but the scope and application of which fuel intense debate between the Global South and North. Our findings reveal that a small cadre of scholars and core journals exert disproportionate influence, steering the discourse towards technological fixes at the expense of structural political change, societal transformation, inclusive sustainable development, and addressing global inequality. This intellectual hegemony underscores age-long significant challenges around the politics and ethics of knowledge production in the discourse of global sustainability, not least the grave risk of marginalising the experiences and perspectives of the most vulnerable, who remain under-represented in both scholarship and policy-making. We conclude by calling for the integration of diverse viewpoints to ensure just transition strategies are both effective and equitable across varied global contexts—an imperative made all the more urgent by the resurgence of fractured climate politics and weakened global solidarity."

Quantifying nutrient retention in freshwaters is important for basin management, but difficult as retention depends, among other things, on the spatial and temporal scales of interest. This study aimed at assessing freshwater nutrient retention in contemporary Europe at continental scale with an ensemble modeling exercise. We used the conceptual model GREEN, changing lake retention according to alternative formulations, generating six model versions for total nitrogen (TN), and seven for total phosphorus (TP). All versions were calibrated independently in six European regions, defined by the sea to which land drained to. Parameter sets that performed well in overall calibration and at stations downstream lakes formed the ensembles that were used to quantify freshwater retention over a decade (2012–2021). Ensemble median river retention was about 10% of incoming TN load and 6% TP load. Median lake retention was about 4% for TN and 6.5% for TP. Median freshwater retention amounted to 170 kg N yr−1 and 7.2 kg P yr−1 per km2 of drainage area. European freshwaters retained about 16% of incoming nitrogen and 13% of incoming phosphorus loads, preventing about 1066 kt N yr−1 and 49 kt P yr−1 to reaching the coastline. Nitrogen retention mostly occurred in rivers, whereas phosphorus retention occurred predominantly in lakes, however important regional differences were noted. The assessment likely underestimates the overall role of freshwater nutrient retention, as secondary streams, wetlands, and ponds were not considered explicitly. Nevertheless, it provides quantitative references for accounting of freshwaters ecosystem services at continental scale."

This world region has been strongly affected by natural hazards, political disruptions and historically diverse attempts to establish effective water management principles. Drawing on historical and contemporary evidence, we establish a game theoretical baseline model of a user community in which irrigation is efficiently governed by group sanctions. By allowing for drift in the evolutionary equilibrium, we model how a loss of traditional authorities over water management can erode established group norms. We then analyse a hypothetical scenario of privatised water rights, inspired by historical and current policy debates in Central Asia. Under the assumption that such rights can be technically implemented, we show that they can restore an efficient water use equilibrium of owners that is egalitarian and evolutionary stable. We discuss how future climate change scenarios or conflicts over transboundary water allocation may affect the model results, focusing on the effects of increased uncertainty and of decreasing water productivity on system resilience. Productivity shocks may make low-performing equilibria unsustainable and thus lead to disruptive change or extinction of certain equilibria. Policy should focus on local interaction as an arena of institutional change. We suggest empirical research questions emerging from our analysis and highlight the benefits of uncontested property rights as an institutional solution to water governance."

Due to the high-altitude and cold-climate conditions, the QTP is highly vulnerable to climate change. Understanding the relative importance of the drivers of grassland degradation is essential for developing adaptive management strategies. While numerous studies have explored these drivers, the impacts of large-scale ecological restoration efforts since 2000, particularly across different grassland types and degradation-recovery phases, remain underexplored. This study analyzes 40 years of grassland vegetation dynamics on the QTP, identifying key inflection points and classifying regions into four ‘degradation-restoration’ trajectory types. The effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers across distinct temporal phases are quantified. The results indicate that 6.56% of grasslands are in continuous degradation, while 28.97% are at risk of potential degradation risk. Drought and grazing emerge as the primary drivers of vegetation change, while restoration and afforestation programs play a significant role in enhancing recovery. Our findings underscore the spatiotemporal variability of grassland responses and emphasize the need for targeted grazing management and integrated water resource planning to optimize restoration outcomes. This study provides a framework for differentiated grassland management in the face of climate change and human pressures on the QTP."

This study leverages an immense dataset of parcel-resolved technoeconomic potential for the contiguous United States, focusing on distributed wind (DW) energy—a configuration where one or more turbines, typically 30–60 m in height are used to satisfy nearby energy needs. The analysis is conducted at multiple spatial scales and considers land use, crop land, census, and incentive program data to determine the most opportune areas for market development. The results show that rural, agricultural and residential areas are most suited to DW.

The research questions addressed are: (1) what effects might compound heatwaves have under climate change scenarios? (2) How are compound heatwaves expected to impact the population in the future? The outcomes indicate that the compound HWs may increase by 4.6 events annually in Northwest India (NWI) under the SSP585 scenario. In contrast, daytime-only HWs are expected to decline after 2060, except in the Himalayan region, possibly due to changes in monsoon patterns and increased evaporative cooling. It is anticipated that nighttime-only heatwaves will uniformly increase across all regions and scenarios, with the most substantial rises observed in the Central Northeast India (CNI) and NWI. Under the SSP370 scenario during 2061–2100, the population exposure to compound heatwaves and nighttime-only heatwaves is projected to increase substantially across all regions. Specifically, exposure to compound heatwaves is anticipated to exceed historical levels by more than 30 times in most regions. Both the CNI and NWI regions show the highest rise in compound and nighttime-only heatwave extremes.

A neural network-based suitability model was trained on coffee occurrence data derived from national statistics on coffee-growing areas. Bias-corrected regional climate models, adjusted to reduce systematic deviations from observed patterns, were used for two climate change scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP2.6) to assess changes in suitability for three future time periods (2038–2048, 2059–2069, 2060–2070) relative to the 2009–2019 baseline. Average expected losses in suitable areas were 62% and 27% for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The loss in suitability due to RCP8.5 is particularly pronounced after 2060. Increasing mean minimum temperature during the harvest (October–November) and growing season (March–September), and decreasing precipitation during the late growing season (July–September) mainly determined the loss in suitable areas.

However, the spatial resolution of these datasets is substantially coarser than the typical area of PV farms, which can lead to potential inaccuracies in power generation estimates. Despite this limitation, the associated errors have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we comprehensively assess the misestimations in power generation potential arising from the application of three widely used reanalysis datasets—ERA5, ERA5-Land and MERRA2—using observational data from twelve PV farms in China. Moreover, the key drivers and mechanisms underlying these inaccuracies are revealed. We find that the relative errors in annual power generation potential estimates were approximately −17%, −12% and 7% for ERA5, ERA5-Land and MERRA2, respectively. Notably, these errors escalated with increasing temporal resolution of estimation; at the hourly scale, they were amplified by approximately twofold and threefold for ERA5/ERA5-Land and MERRA2, respectively. Mechanistic analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between estimation errors and near-surface air temperature, suggesting that cloud conditions and terrain may be the primary drivers contributing to these inaccuracies. The results of our study underscore the importance of accounting for these errors when using reanalysis data for PV power generation potential estimation, particularly at monthly and hourly scales.

Here, we assess the influence of crop diversification on agricultural water-use efficiency (WUE, ratio of gross primary productivity to evapotranspiration) along a spectrum of monoculture to complex species rotations in California. Leveraging new high-resolution remote sensing datasets, we show that crop diversification is a key driver of agricultural WUE, and increasing the number of species planted in the previous 6 years from two to four increases WUE by ∼20% after accounting for differences between crops. Our results provide spatially explicit, large-scale quantification of crop diversification’s improvements to WUE, with direct implications for climate adaptation.

Zawadowicz;Lu Xu;Jian Wang,"The sources and diurnal variations of  submicron aerosols in a coastal–rural  environment near Houston, US","Using measurements at a rural coastal site, we quantified aerosols in representative air masses and identified major sources of organics in the Houston area. Our results show cooking aerosol is likely overestimated by earlier studies. Additionally, diurnal variation of highly oxidized organics is mostly driven by air mass changes instead of photochemistry. This study highlights the impacts of emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorology on aerosol properties in the coastal–rural environment. 
 Aerosol properties were characterized at a rural site southwest of Houston from May to September 2022 during the intensive operation periods (IOPs) of the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER). Backward trajectory analysis reveals three major air mass types: marine air mass from the Gulf, urban air mass influenced by urban emissions, and regional air mass. Marine aerosols typically show a bimodal size distribution and have the lowest particle number and mass concentrations of PM1 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1 µm), while aerosols from air masses strongly influenced by urban emissions exhibit the highest concentrations. Organic aerosol (OA) accounts for more than 50 % of PM1 for urban and regional air masses, whereas sulfate is comparable to OA in marine air masses. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of aerosol mass spectra identifies 6 OA factors: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), OA from the oxidation of monoterpenes (MT-SOA), OA from the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiols by acidic sulfate particles (isoprene-SOA), oxygenated OA arising from shipping emissions (shipping-OOA), and two oxygenated OA factors with high O : C ratios (OOA1 and OOA2). OOA2 has the highest O : C ratio and exhibits elevated mass concentration in the afternoon. Similar diurnal variation of highly oxidized OA factors was commonly observed in the Houston area during previous studies and attributed to the SOA formation by photochemistry and mixing from aloft. Here, using air mass backward trajectories and a 1-D box model, we show the diurnal trend of OOA2 mass concentration is instead driven by changes in air mass arriving at the rural site. The air mass changes are likely caused by the shift between land breezes and sea/bay breezes. Within the same air mass type (e.g., either urban or marine air mass), OOA2 mass concentration is largely independent of wind direction and shows essentially no diurnal variation, suggesting OOA2 is related to aged OA with minimal influence by local emissions. This study helps identify the major sources of OA in the Houston region and highlights the impacts of both atmospheric chemistry and meteorology on aerosol properties in the coastal–rural environment."

Remote sensing instruments have been used to estimate emissions from the strongest anthropogenic sources. Here, we study the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the estimation of CO₂ with a realistic atmospheric model, and we show that the formation of persistent plume structures causes uncertainty on the order of 10 % of total emission that cannot be avoided. 
 Observation-based monitoring of the status of greenhouse gas emissions goals set at the 2015 Paris Climate Summit is critical to provide timely, accurate and precise information on the progress towards these goals. Observations also permit the identification of potential deviations from the adopted policies that could compromise the efforts to reduce the future impact of pollutants on the climate.Current remote sensing capabilities of atmospheric CO2 have demonstrated the ability to estimate emissions from the strongest sources of CO2 based on imagery of individual plumes in conjunction with wind speed estimates. However, a realistic evaluation of the accuracy of the obtained estimates is essential. Here, we examine how the stochastic nature of daytime atmospheric turbulence affects the estimation of CO2 emissions from a lignite coal power plant in Bełchatów, Poland. For this investigation, we use a high-resolution (400 m × 400 m × 85 levels) atmospheric model set up in a realistic configuration. We demonstrate that persistent structures in the downwind concentration fields of emitted plumes can cause significant uncertainties in the retrieved fluxes, on the order of 10 % of the total source strength, when the commonly used cross-sectional mass-flux (CSF) method is applied with short distances between individual estimates. These form a significant contribution to the overall uncertainty which remains unavoidable in the presence of atmospheric turbulence.Furthermore, we applied temporally tagged tracers for the decomposition of the plume variability into its constituent parts. These tracers helped us to explain why spatial scales of variability in plume intensity are far larger than the size of turbulent eddies – a finding that challenges previous assumptions."

This study developed a quantitative method for separating the anthropogenic and natural contributions of total gaseous mercury. The underlying impacts on the sea–air exchange fluxes of mercury are evaluated. The new method developed in this study can be reproduced in other regions, and the findings are innovative in the field of mercury sources and biogeochemical cycles. 
 Mercury in the atmosphere is a crucial environmental concern due to its toxicity and its ability to travel long distances. In the marginal seas, the contributions of terrestrial anthropogenic vs. natural sources on atmospheric mercury have rarely been quantified and their roles in mercury sea–air exchange are not well understood. To address this issue, this study integrated observations from island, cruise, and inland campaigns. The mean concentrations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) were 2.32 ± 1.02 ng m−3 (Bohai Sea), 2.55 ± 0.55 ng m−3 (Yellow Sea), and 2.31 ± 0.81 ng m−3 (East China Sea), respectively, with coastal regions exhibiting significantly higher values than open ocean areas due to continental outflows. Positive correlations were observed between TGM concentrations and environmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, indicating the significant influence of natural sources on atmospheric mercury in the marine environment. By utilizing a receptor model and linear regression analysis, a robust method was developed to quantitatively estimate the contribution of anthropogenic and natural sources to TGM. Anthropogenic sources accounted for an average of 59 %, 40 %, and 27 % of TGM over the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, respectively. The sea–air exchange fluxes of mercury were estimated as 0.17 ± 0.38, 1.10 ± 1.34, and 3.44 ± 3.24 ng m−2 h−1 over these three seas, respectively. Stronger anthropogenic mercury emissions in northern China partially explained the suppressed sea–air exchange fluxes of mercury in the Bohai Sea. This study elucidated the role of anthropogenic emissions in shaping the marine atmospheric mercury and the sea–air exchange fluxes, thereby informing valuable assessments regarding the influence of future reduced anthropogenic mercury emissions on the marine mercury cycle and ecosystems."

By combining Aeolus satellite data with ERA5 reanalysis data and radio occultation measurements, we identified significant wave activity overlooked by ERA5, particularly over the Indian Ocean. Aeolus fills major gaps in wind data, offering a clearer picture of wave dynamics and challenging assumptions about their behavior, thereby improving climate models. 
 The European Space Agency's Aeolus satellite, equipped with the Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument (ALADIN), provides near-global wind profiles from the surface to about 30 km altitude. These wind measurements enable the investigation of atmospheric dynamics, including gravity waves (GWs) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This study analyzes ALADIN wind observations and ERA5 reanalysis by deriving GW kinetic energy (Ek) distributions and examining their temporal and spatial variability throughout the tropical UTLS. A prominent hotspot of enhanced GW activity is identified by Aeolus, migrating from the Indian Ocean in boreal summer to the Maritime Continent in boreal winter, closely matching outgoing longwave radiation minima and, thus, highlighting convective origins. Results show that ERA5 consistently underestimates Ek in convective regions, especially over the Indian Ocean, where conventional wind measurements are sparse. Additional comparisons with Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements of GW potential energy (Ep) corroborate these findings and suggest a significant underrepresentation of convection-driven wave activity in reanalyses. A multi-instrumental exploratory analysis also allows one to verify the empirical grounding of the established Ek/Ep ratio. By providing direct wind measurements in otherwise data-sparse regions, Aeolus offers a valuable dataset for evaluating and potentially improving the representation of GWs in reanalyses, particularly in remote tropical areas. The combination of Aeolus and GNSS-RO data allows for an observationally based examination of the partitioning between kinetic and potential energy, highlighting discrepancies with reanalysis products that could inform future model parameterization development."

The results showed that the joint effect of the considered tropical oscillations, originating in low latitudes, significantly affect the structure of planetary waves, not only in the regions of their climatic maximum but also throughout the middle atmosphere and thermosphere of both hemispheres. 
 We performed a series of numerical experiments to study the main patterns of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation phase of the zonal wind in the equatorial stratosphere (QBO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence on stationary and westward travelling atmospheric planetary waves (PWs) with different zonal wave numbers and periods. The simulation was carried out for boreal winter conditions using the Middle and Upper Atmosphere Model (MUAM). The results showed that the joint effect of the considered tropical oscillations can significantly up to tens of percent change the amplitudes of the PW in the areas of their maxima. Under the El Niño regardless of the QBO phase the amplitude maxima of the stationary PW with wave number 1 (SPW1) shift toward high latitudes. The amplitude structure of SPW2 is basically opposite to the SPW1 structure. Increases of the upward wave activity fluxes of quasi- 5, 10, 7 d PWs, as well as the amplitudes of 10 and 7 d PWs are modelled when easterly QBO phase is superimposed on El Niño phase. Conversely, attenuations of the individual PW amplitudes and wave activity fluxes are typically observed under the westerly QBO, as well as under La-Niña/westerly QBO conditions combination in special cases, such as SPW1. The PW study is important due to their significant influence on the middle and upper atmosphere circulation, including the configuration of the stratospheric polar vortex whose deformation can influence the occurrence of extreme weather events, in particular, in the Arctic and Asia-Pacific region during the boreal winter."

Uncertainties of meteorology-driven ozone trends in China were examined. Multi-dataset analysis shows the largest meteorology-driven ozone trend with the best consistency occurs in spring. Multi-method analysis shows the best (worst) consistency occurs in winter (summer). Overall, meteorology boosts ozone growth in all seasons, with uncertainty from multi-method larger than that from multi-dataset. 
 China has witnessed notable increases in surface ozone (O3) concentrations since 2013, with meteorology identified as a critical driver. However, meteorological contributions vary with different meteorological datasets and analytical methods, and their uncertainties remain unassessed. This study leveraged decadal observational maximum daily 8-hour average O3 records (2013–2022) across China, revealing intensified nationwide O3 pollution with increasing O3 trends of 0.79–1.31 ppb yr−1 during four seasons. We gave special focus on uncertainties of meteorology-driven O3 trends by using diverse meteorological datasets (ERA5, MERRA2, FNL) and diverse analytical methods (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, GEOS-Chem model). A useful statistic (coefficient of variation, CV) was adopted as an uncertainty quantification metric. For multi-dataset analysis, models driven by different meteorological datasets exhibited the maximum meteorology-driven O3 trend (+0.55 ppb yr−1, multi-dataset mean) with the highest consistency (CV = 0.25) in spring. The FNL-driven model always obtained larger trends compared to ERA5 and MERRA2, which could be attributed to inability to accurately evaluate planetary boundary layer height in FNL dataset. For multi-method analysis, three methods demonstrated optimal consistency in winter (CV = 0.40) and the worst consistency in summer (CV = 2.00). The meteorology-driven O3 trends obtained from GEOS-Chem model were almost smaller than those obtained by other two methods, partly resulting from higher simulated O3 values before 2018. Overall, all analyses driven by diverse meteorological datasets and analytical methods drew a robust conclusion that meteorological conditions almost boosted O3 increases during all seasons; the uncertainties caused by different analytical methods were larger than those caused by diverse meteorological datasets."

Using air sensors and data analysis, researchers identified cargo ships as key polluters and created a cost-effective monitoring method for global ports. Findings warn that shipping expansion risks air quality progress, urging smarter policies while supporting trade. 
 The expansion of maritime trade has made ship emissions a significant target for SO2 reduction policies. However, there is still a lack of observational data to reflect the long-term changes in SO2 emission from ships. This study conducted continuous observational experiments using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) from 2018 to 2023 in a shipping channel in Shanghai, China. By employing machine learning for gap filling and meteorological normalization, the trends of ambient SO2 related to ship emissions (Ship_related_SO2) over the 6-year period were revealed. Furthermore, whether ships in the channel were using low-sulfur fuels was determined by a decomposition of SO2-rich plume signals (which reflect high-emission ships) and baseline variations. The findings indicate that ship activities increased ambient SO2 concentrations in the channel by 0.48±0.25 ppbv (43.24 % of urban background levels). During the policy adjustment phase (2018 to 2020), Ship_related_SO2 levels declined steadily due to low-sulfur fuel regulations. Meanwhile, from 2021 to 2023 (the policy stabilization phase), increased ship activity became the dominant driver of rising Ship_related_SO2 levels. Despite policy effectiveness, excessive emissions from cargo ships persisted throughout the study period. This study quantified the contribution of ship emissions to ambient SO2 during 2018–2023 based on observations, evaluating the effectiveness of low-sulfur policies and supporting ongoing efforts to mitigate SO2 pollution from maritime activities. The methodology developed here can be adapted to other global shipping channels, providing a framework for monitoring and regulating ship emissions worldwide."

If we can measure them using satellite-based instruments, we greatly increase the amount of available data on their concentrations. In this study, we find that including information about particle size is most important to measure them accurately from such satellite-based instruments. This can inform future studies on how to obtain more accurate information about small particles. 
 Understanding the vertical distribution of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations is crucial for reducing uncertainty associated with aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) and their effective radiative forcing. Many studies take advantage of widely available remote sensing observations to develop proxies, parameterizations, and relationships between CCN concentration and aerosol optical properties (AOPs). Such methods generally provide a good constraint for CCN concentration, but many uncertainties and limitations exist, generally related to high relative humidity (RH), environments with internal or external mixtures of several different aerosol types, and differences in parts of the aerosol size distribution relevant to both CCN and AOPs. In this study, we use in situ observations of the aerosol size distribution and chemical composition in a recent airborne field campaign to inform theoretical calculations of CCN concentration (CCNtheory) and aerosol backscatter at 532 nm (BSCtheory) with the purpose of understanding the dominant governing factors of the CCNtheory–BSCtheory relationship. Estimates from random forest models indicate that, for smoke, marine, and urban aerosols, the aerosol size distribution, as parameterized by the effective radius (Reff), is the most important predictor of the CCNtheory–BSCtheory relationship. We further investigate how Reff impacts CCNtheory : BSCtheory and find an exponential relationship between the parameters. We find that modeling CCNtheory : BSCtheory using this exponential Reff relationship can explain about 68 %–79 % of the variance in the CCNtheory–BSCtheory relationship. These findings suggest that including information about aerosol size is critical for future studies in constraining CCN concentration from AOPs."

The forward operator uses the new InDEpendent column local halF-sphere ApproXimation (IDEFAX). Polarized radiances simulated with IDEFAX and the forward operator were validated against full 3D radiative transfer simulations with MYSTIC and show a significantly improved representation of 3D radiative effects compared to the plane-parallel independent column approximation at comparable computation times. 
 Clouds generally have a complex three-dimensional geometry. However, realistic three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations of clouds are computationally expensive, so most retrievals of cloud properties assume one-dimensional clouds, which introduces retrieval biases. In this work, a fast forward operator for polarized 3D radiative transfer in the visible wavelength range is presented. To this end, a new approximation for 3D radiative transfer, the InDEpendent column local halF-sphere ApproXimation (IDEFAX), is introduced. The basic idea behind this approximation is similar to the independent column approximation assuming plane-parallel clouds. However, every column is approximated by an independent field of 3D half-spherical clouds instead of a plane-parallel homogeneous cloud. This field of half-spherical clouds is defined by the local cloud surface orientation angles and the cloud fraction. Thus, the IDEFAX has only three more parameters compared to the plane-parallel approximation. To obtain a fast forward operator, artificial neural networks are trained for both the plane-parallel and the half-spherical cloud assumptions. The IDEFAX and the neural network forward operators are validated against polarized 3D radiative transfer simulations with MYSTIC for low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds using a realistic cloud field simulated with the WRF model. The use of the IDEFAX significantly improves the representation of 3D radiative effects in the simulated radiance fields compared to the plane-parallel independent column approximation. Due to the implementation of the forward operator with neural networks, the computation time for both approximations is comparable and about 5 orders of magnitude faster than full 3D radiative transfer simulations for the shown example. The introduced neural network forward operators are constructed to be used in retrievals of cloud properties with the specMACS instrument. However, the methods are also applicable to other measurements in the visible wavelength range and to model data."

This includes temperature, salinity, pressure, and currents recorded by instruments deployed in icy, challenging conditions. Our analysis highlights the dominance of tidal currents and separates these from other patterns to study regional energy distribution. This unique dataset offers a foundation for future research on Antarctic ocean dynamics and ice interactions. 
 Continuous moored time series of temperature, salinity, pressure and current speed and direction are of great importance for understanding the continental shelf and under-ice-shelf dynamics and thermodynamics that govern water mass transformations and ice melting in and around Antarctic marginal seas. In these regions, icebergs and sea ice make ship-based mooring deployment and recovery challenging. Nevertheless, over decades, expeditions around the fringe of Antarctica sporadically deployed and recovered hundreds of moored instruments, including those facilitated through ice shelves boreholes. These datasets tend to be archived in a wide range of data centres, with, to our knowledge, no clear format standardisation. As a result, systematic analysis of historical mooring time series in the marginal seas is often challenging. Here we present the first version of a standardised pan-Antarctic moored hydrography and current time series compilation, with broad international contributions from data centres, research institutes and individual data owners. The mooring records in this compilation span over five decades, from the 1970s to the 2020s, providing an opportunity for a systematic study of the pan-Antarctic water mass transport and shelf connectivity. As a demonstration of the utility of this compilation, we present spectral analysis of the compiled current velocity time series, which unsurprisingly shows the dominating presence of tidal variability within most records. This component of the variability is fitted using multi-linear regression to tidal frequencies, and the tidal fit is removed from the original time series to leave de-tided variability. Given the limited record durations to months to years, de-tided variability is dominated by synoptic (3–10 d period), intraseasonal (10–80 d) and seasonal (∼6 months–1 year) signals. The spatial distribution of the kinetic energy integrated within frequency bands is presented and discussed within respective regional contexts, and future avenues of research are proposed.

Our study introduces HDNTL, a daily NTL dataset for 653 major cities (population >1 M by 2025) from 2012–2024, enhancing NASA's VNP46A2 accuracy by correcting spatial mismatches, angular effects, and filling small data holes via spatiotemporal interpolation. Validated against high-resolution NTL datasets and ground-truth records, HDNTL enables precise monitoring of nighttime human activities. 
 Nighttime light (NTL) data at daily scales presents an innovative foundation for monitoring human activities, offering vast potential across various research domains such as urban planning and management, disaster monitoring, and energy consumption. The daily moonlight-adjusted nighttime lights product (VNP46A2), sourced from Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS), has been providing globally corrected daily NTL data since 2012. However, persistent challenges, such as fluctuations in the daily NTL series due to spatial mismatch and angular effects, as well as data holes, have significantly impacted the accuracy and comprehensiveness of extracting daily NTL changes. To address these challenges, a dataset production framework focusing on error correction, interpolation, and validation was developed. This framework led to the creation of a high-quality daily NTL (HDNTL) dataset from 2012 to 2024, which specifically targets 653 cities with populations predictably exceeding one million in 2025. A comparative analysis with the VNP46A2 dataset revealed promising results in spatial mismatch correction for two sample areas – the airport and highway (angular effect can be ignored). These areas exhibited reduced fluctuations in HDNTL time series and enhanced spatial consistency among pixels with homogeneous light sources. Furthermore, the correction of angular effects across various urban building landscapes demonstrated sound improvements, mitigating angular effects in different directions and reducing periodicity from the angular impacts. The spatiotemporal interpolation of data holes shows high similarity with the reference data, as indicated by a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99, and it increased the valid pixels of all cities by about 2 %. The HDNTL dataset exhibited enhanced consistency with high-resolution Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) NTL data regarding the NTL change rate. Also, it showed high alignment with ground truth data of power outages, showcasing superior performance in short-event detection. Overall, the HDNTL dataset effectively mitigates instability in daily series caused by spatial mismatch and angular effects observed in VNP46A2, improving data comparability across both time and space. This dataset enhances the ability of the NTL to reflect the ground events, providing a more accurate reference for daily-scale nighttime light research. Additionally, the dataset production framework facilitates easy updates from future VNP46A2 products to HDNTL. The HDNTL is openly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17079409 (Pei et al., 2025)."

 Measurements of stable water isotopes in the atmospheric water vapour can be used to better understand the physical processes of the atmospheric water cycle. In polar regions, the atmospheric water vapour isotopic composition is a key parameter to understand the link between the precipitation and snow isotopic compositions and interpret isotope climate records from ice cores. In this study we present a novel 2.5-month accurate record of the atmospheric water vapour isotopic composition during the austral summer 2023–2024 (6 December 2023 to 14 February 2024) at Concordia Station (East Antarctica), from two laser spectrometers based on different measurement techniques, which are independently calibrated and both optimised to measure in low humidity environments. We show that both instruments accurately measure the summertime diurnal variability in the water vapour δ18O, δD, and d-excess, when the water vapour mixing ratio is consistently higher than 200 ppmv. We compare these measurements to outputs of the isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ6-iso and show that the model exhibits biases in both the mean water vapour isotopic composition and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, consistent with previous studies.

 As key components of agricultural management, planting and harvesting schedules have strongly influenced crop production by defining the length of the crop growing season and shaping the environmental conditions crops experience. Accurate knowledge of these management data is crucial for enhancing crop yield estimates by capturing the timing of crop development relative to weather and soil conditions, assessing climate adaptation by tracking shifts in farming practices over time, and supporting agricultural carbon accounting. Yet, existing planting and harvesting date datasets are largely based on state-level statistics or rule-based calendars that overlook intra-regional variability and the influence of human decision-making. The absence of long-term, high-resolution planting and harvesting date information hinders our ability to reconstruct historical agricultural practices and assess their agronomic and environmental consequences. In this study, we introduce CropPlantHarvest, the first dataset of annual corn and soybean planting and harvesting dates across the U.S. Midwest at 500 m resolution from 2001 to 2024. Planting dates are estimated using CropSow, an integrative remotely sensed crop modeling system that aligns simulated crop growth trajectories with satellite observations to retrieve field-level planting dates. Harvesting dates are retrieved using the Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI), a novel index that integrates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance to detect harvesting events by capturing the distinct spectral transition from senescent crops to exposed crop residues. Validation against USDA crop progress reports and field-level dataset demonstrates high accuracy of CropPlantHarvest, with a mean absolute error of approximately 5 days for both crop species. This large spatial and temporal dataset captures management-driven variability in crop season timing and duration, supporting improved modeling of crop yields, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource use. It could also serve as a benchmark for refining remote-sensing phenology products and evaluating the agro-environmental impacts of evolving crop management decisions.

 This paper introduces REMO2020, a modernised version of the well-known and widely used REgional climate MOdel (REMO). REMO2020 has undergone fundamental changes in its code structure to provide a more modular, operationally focused design, facilitating the inclusion of new components and updates. Here, we describe the default configuration of REMO2020, which includes the following updates compared to the previous version, REMO2015: (i) the FLake lake model, (ii) a state-of-the-art MACv2-SP aerosol climatology, (iii) a newly developed three-layer snow module, (iv) a prognostic precipitation scheme, (v) an updated time filter, and (vi) a new tuning approach. Additionally, we describe some optional modules that can be activated separately, such as the interactive MOsaic-based VEgetation model iMOVE. REMO2020 outperforms its predecessor REMO2015 with regard to nearly all evaluation metrics used to evaluate simulations of Europe's climate. The persistent warm-temperature bias over central Europe and the cold-temperature bias over northern Europe have been significantly reduced in REMO2020. Similarly, the previously modelled dry bias in central Europe has been nearly eliminated, and the extent of the wet bias in eastern Europe has been reduced. The precipitation distribution in REMO2020 is much more realistic, especially in terms of heavy-precipitation extremes. Statistically, REMO2020 aligns better with long-term measurements than with older versions. Mountainous areas still present a challenge in REMO2020, especially with a higher vertical resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate why REMO2020 will be our new model version for future dynamical downscaling activities."

 Tensor fields, as spatial derivatives of scalar or vector potentials, offer powerful insight into subsurface structures in geophysics.

Subsequently, the improvements and limitations are investigated aided by observations in real case simulations. 
 Understanding and modeling the turbulent transport of surface layer fluxes are essential for numerical weather forecasting models. The presence of heterogeneous surface obstacles (buildings) that have dimensions comparable to the model vertical resolution requires further complexity and design in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. In this study, we develop a numerical method to couple a recently validated PBL scheme, TKE-ACM2, with multi-layer Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Subsequently, the performance of TKE-ACM2+BEP is examined under idealized convective atmospheric conditions with a simplified building layout. Furthermore, its reproducibility is benchmarked with a state-of-the-art large-eddy simulation model, PALM, which explicitly resolves the building aerodynamics. The results indicate that TKE-ACM2+BEP outperforms another operational PBL scheme (Boulac) coupled with BEP by reducing bias in both the potential temperature (θ) and wind speed (u). Following this, real case simulations are conducted for a highly urbanized domain, namely the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China. High-resolution wind speed LiDAR observations suggest that TKE-ACM2+BEP reduces overestimation in the lower part of the boundary layer compared with the Bulk method, which lacks an urban scheme, at a LiDAR site located in a densely built environment. In addition, the surface temperature and relative humidity given by TKE-ACM2+BEP at surface stations in urbanized areas are more accurate than those given by TKE-ACM2 without BEP. However, it is revealed that BEP does not always improve the accuracy of the surface wind speed, as it can introduce excessive aerodynamic drag."

The addition of geomagnetic forcing led to significant ozone losses in the polar upper stratosphere of both hemispheres due to the catalytic cycles involving NOy. In addition to the particle precipitation effect, accounting for solar UV variability in the ICON-ART model leads to the changes in ozone in the tropical stratosphere. 
 We extended the Linearized ozone scheme – LINOZ in the ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) – ART (the extension for Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) model system to include NOy formed by auroral and medium-energy electrons in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and the corresponding ozone loss, as well as changes in the rate of ozone formation due to the variability of the solar radiation in the ultraviolet wavelength range. This extension allows us to realistically represent variable solar and geomagnetic forcing in the middle atmosphere using a very simple ozone scheme. The LINOZ scheme is computationally very cheap compared to a full middle atmosphere chemistry scheme, yet provides realistic ozone fields consistent with the stratospheric circulation and temperatures, and can thus be used in climate models instead of prescribed ozone climatologies. To include the reactive nitrogen (NOy) produced by auroral and radiation belt electron precipitation in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere during polar winter, the so-called energetic particle precipitation indirect effect, an upper boundary condition for NOy has been implemented into the simplified parameterization scheme of the N2O/NOy reactions. This parameterization, which uses the geomagnetic Ap index, is also recommended for chemistry-climate models in the CMIP6 experiments. With this extension, the model simulates realistic “tongues” of NOy propagating downward in polar witner from the model top in the upper mesosphere into the mid-stratosphere with an amplitude that is modulated by geomagnetic activity. We then expanded the simplified ozone description used in the model by applying LINOZ version 3. The additional ozone tendency from NOy is included by applying the corresponding terms of the version 3 of LINOZ. This NOy, coupled as an additional term in the linearized ozone chemistry, led to significant ozone losses in the polar upper stratosphere in both hemispheres which is qualitatively in good agreement with ozone observations and model simulations with EPP-NOy and full stratospheric chemistry. In a subsequent step, the tabulated coefficients forming the basis of the LINOZ scheme were provided separately for solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. These coefficients were then interpolated to ICON-ART using the F10.7 index as a proxy for daily solar spectra (UV) variability to account for solar UV forcing. This solar UV forcing in the model led to changes in ozone in the tropical and mid-latitude stratosphere consistent with observed solar signals in stratospheric ozone."

We propose methods to identify evaluable parameters via field measurements and found inconsistencies between physics and its code implementation. Simulations reveal small errors can significantly impact outputs. 
 The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model includes urban schemes that simulate the influence of urban surfaces on the atmosphere using parameterizations for flux, and radiative exchanges. Three core schemes – the Bulk urban parameterization, Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM), and Multi-Layer Urban Canopy Model (MLUCM) – represent increasing levels of complexity. Although the parameterizations within these urban schemes are described in the literature, their specific implementation remains poorly documented, thus slowing down model development efforts.This manuscript provides a roadmap to the three urban schemes in WRF version 4.5.2, presenting equations using the same symbols as in the model code, along with references to code lines, and including graphics and explanations that connect the code to its physical foundations. Our thorough review of the urban parameterizations implemented in WRF version 4.5.2 highlighted a handful of parameters that may introduce discontinuities in simulations: (i) in the SLUCM, a 1 mm h−1 rain rate threshold is employed to switch between two minimum moisture availability parameterizations, thus impacting latent heat flux calculations; (ii) in the SLUCM a threshold is used to partition shortwave radiation into direct and diffuse components; (iii) in all three urban schemes, the bulk Richardson number is employed to select the similarity function, which influences the vertical distribution of heat and momentum. We also identified a highly simplified treatment of the radiative balance on roof surfaces. The implications of these simplifications can be assessed through targeted observations across relevant conditions, including varying precipitation rates, cloud cover, and transitions between stability regimes. Furthermore, the widespread application of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in these urban schemes warrants model evaluation under highly stable and unstable conditions and in heterogeneous urban settings with variable land cover and building heights on scales finer than model resolution. To address these challenges, we offer guidance on observational strategies, emphasizing the need for multi-parametric measurements to capture potential compensating biases and multi-height measurements that align with the levels where quantities are diagnostic and prognosed in the model (i.e., the lowest atmospheric level of the WRF model). Finally, our inspection of the code revealed implementation bugs that have now been corrected in WRF versions 4.6.0 and 4.6.1. Sensitivity tests over the Atlanta urban area show that these corrections affect surface temperatures, underscoring the importance of performing rigorous documentation and verification of the implementation of parameterizations in model code."

This study clarifies that the multigrid beta filter-based localization makes it several times faster than the conventional recursive filter-based one without significantly changing the analysis if a coarser filter grid is applied and filters except for the coarsest resolution are omitted. 
 This study applies a multigrid beta filter (MGBF) for covariance localization in ensemble-variational (EnVar) data assimilation instead of the conventional recursive filter (RF) to achieve faster computation in a large number of processors. The parallelization efficiency of the MGBF is higher than that of the RF because all-to-all communication to change the computational region of each processor is not necessary. However, the MGBF-based localization additionally requires horizontal variable exchange between processors; its computational cost is proportional to the number of grid points and to the ensemble size, and is generally more expensive than the RF. In this study, we implement the MGBF-based localization both for the single-scale localization and for the scale-dependent localization in the regional atmospheric EnVar data assimilation system. In addition, we clarify that applying a coarser filter grid and omitting filtering except for the coarsest resolution make the computation of the MGBF-based localization several times faster than that of the RF-based one without significantly changing the EnVar analysis."

Mørk;Tor Nordam;Siren Rühs,Handling discontinuities in numerical ODE methods  for Lagrangian oceanography,"A common task in applied oceanography is to calculate the trajectories of floating objects in the ocean. We propose an alteration to some common numerical methods to improve their performance in such computations, and compare results with and without this alteration. This will help researchers to ensure they obtain a higher accuracy in their results without compromising on computer resources. 
 In Lagrangian oceanography, numerical methods for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are used to model particle transport. In many common applications, the velocity field driving the particle transport is provided as output from ocean models, on a discrete grid of points. Hence, the velocity field must be interpolated. Depending on the choice of interpolation, the velocity field or its derivatives may have discontinuities. These discontinuities have implications for the accuracy of the numerical ODE methods employed.We demonstrate that by using information about the location of the discontinuities, we can take these into account, and improve numerical accuracy over standard integration methods that do not take discontinuities into account. The commonly used combination of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and linear interpolation of the velocity field, in fact, only yields second-order accuracy with the standard method. By accounting for discontinuities, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy with the same timestep. The implementation makes use of a combination of known methods from the field of numerical integration of ODEs. The implementation is quite flexible, agnostic to grid layout and order of interpolation, and contributes only modestly to the code complexity. Hence, the proposed technique for handling discontinuities in interpolated velocity fields could easily be adopted to a range of applications where numerical accuracy or efficiency is of importance.As an example where numerical accuracy is important, we run a backtracking case for particles with known initial conditions, and show that the method with discontinuity handling is to a larger degree able to recover the correct initial positions of the particles, compared to standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta."

Results showed nearly 50% of Fe originated from anthropogenic sources, primarily industrial processes (30%) and coal combustion (17%). Although PM2.5 concentrations decreased significantly, the Fe component of PM2.5 did not show a significant decline. Instead, annual source contributions changed with dust source rising from 45% to 61%, while combustion sources decreased from 27% to 12%.

The use of maximum latewood density (MXD) proxy mitigates many biases, but intra‐annual measurement resolution remains a limitation. We develop a quantitative wood anatomy (QWA)‐based temperature reconstruction from the Firth River in northeastern Alaska from 1150 CE to 2021 CE to improve regional past temperature estimates and to test the sensitivity of MXD‐based climate reconstructions to measurement constraints. We find that high‐resolution wood‐anatomy measurements reduce biological noise and enhance the representation of low‐frequency variability, resulting in stronger temperature signals and a larger magnitude of preindustrial to modern change.

Additionally, the jet axis in GCMs is too straight in the vertical compared to reanalyses. Both biases have posed a long‐standing challenge to GCMs. Here, we use a development version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with different horizontal resolutions. The high‐resolution simulations exhibit a smaller bias in the representation of the SH polar vortex. Motivated by these results we introduce a gravity wave source parameterization to represent frontal gravity waves that have been missing in CAM. In this parameterization fronts are represented by their vorticity. Both, the amplitude and the phase speed of the launched waves are dependent on characteristics of the frontal systems.

Using radar observations and a 1‐D model, the results reveal that microphysical properties, namely geometric mean diameter (Dg) and raindrop concentration, primarily control evaporation processes under conditions of limited thermodynamic variability. Thermodynamic factors like cloud base height and relative humidity exert a smaller influence due to their narrow observed ranges. Small Dg leads to rapid increases in rain evaporation fraction (REF), as small drops evaporate completely, while larger Dg yields slower, more gradual REF changes. Frequent weak‐rain cases reduce the mean evaporation flux, whereas infrequent intense‐rain events substantially enhance it. These findings highlight the pivotal role of microphysical variability in shaping sub‐cloud evaporation in this trade cumulus regime, while thermodynamic effects may be more important in other environments."

Previous work also noted a fast‐get‐faster response and connected it diagnostically to the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Here we derive a moist adiabatic scaling that explains the upper‐level jet stream wind response. Given the daily surface air temperature distribution and assuming a moist adiabatic atmosphere, the upper‐level mean and fast jet stream wind increase by ∼ ${\sim} $2%/K and the jet stream shear increases by ∼ ${\sim} $4%/K across a climate model hierarchy. The scaling shows the increase of the surface moisture gradient following the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation dominates the response. The scaling connects the increasing surface moisture gradient to the upper‐level temperature gradient thereby reconciling dry and moist perspectives. The results show record‐breaking upper‐level jet stream wind and increased clear‐air turbulence are tied to the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation and are therefore robust and well‐understood consequences of climate change."

Unlike typical northwest‐southeast alignment in quiet conditions, the EMSTID exhibited an unusual northeast‐southwest orientation. Challenging Minisatellite Payload neutral wind and ROCSAT‐1 ion drift measurements showed significant thermospheric wind and electric field variations from quiet‐times. The study reveals a unique disturbance dynamo‐driven electrodynamical mechanism that triggers Perkins instability, generating unusually aligned nighttime EMSTID. Notably, low electron density and weak inhomogeneity in sporadic‐E layers in both locally (Wakkanai, Japan) and over conjugate regions (Townsville, Australia) reveal that Perkins instability can be enhanced sufficiently to generate EMSTIDs, even with weak E‐F regions coupling within or across hemispheres. Additionally, penetration electric fields during a substorm's expansion and recovery phases instantaneously modulated EMSTID amplitudes. Such nighttime EMSTID, comprising unique features and near‐instantaneous amplitude modulation caused by substorm‐induced electric fields, represents the novel observation of this study."

We examine anvil cloud formation by performing simulations with a GCM with a hierarchy of cloud fraction schemes ranging from a complex prognostic Tiedtke scheme to a simple binary scheme. All schemes consistently reproduce the anvil peak. The robust anvil peak arises because extremely cold temperatures at the upper troposphere facilitate frequent saturation events, producing clouds that disproportionately influence mean cloud fraction. Sensitivity experiments with enhanced evaporation of cloud condensate unexpectedly show increased anvil coverage, highlighting how slight evaporative moistening reinforces local saturation in cold upper‐tropospheric conditions. These results demonstrate that the tropical anvil cloud peak emerges from fundamental thermodynamic constraints, rather than specific cloud fraction parameterization choices."

Magnetofossils, produced by magnetotactic bacteria, are sensitive to redox conditions in various environments. However, the relationship between magnetofossils and BWO has not been well‐established. Here, we present the first calibration of the magnetofossil‐hosted BWO proxy using surface sediments along oxygen gradients in the Southeast Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. Our results show that magnetofossil dimensional features and magnetic properties are linearly correlated with known BWO profiles (60–230 μmol/kg). Specifically, higher proportions of cuboctahedral magnetofossils coupled with more biogenic soft components are associated with higher BWO levels, and vice versa.

However, how the global change affects smaller‐scale ionospheric phenomena remains unclear. This study investigates for the first time the impact of increasing CO2 on the formation of sporadic‐E layer, a key space weather element links to HF/VHF communications. Using the Ground‐to‐topside model of Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy (GAIA), simulations were conducted for normal (315 ppm) and doubled CO2 (667 ppm) levels to evaluate changes in the vertical ion convergence (VIC). Simulation results reveal that the VIC is enhanced in the 100–120 km altitude range globally. Furthermore, VIC hotspots shift downward by approximately 5 km and exhibit changes in their diurnal pattern. The reduction of the ion‐neutral collision frequency alongside changes in the zonal wind shear contributes significantly to these changes. Our study suggests that, as CO2 concentrations continue to rise, future Es layers may become more intense, last longer, and form at lower altitudes compared to present‐day conditions. These changes could potentially challenge the reliability of HF communication systems in the future."

In contrast, reintensifying ERC storms can achieve higher intensities when moving over warmer seas with greater ocean heat content and reduced vertical wind shear. The scarcity of storms at intermediate intensities (85–105 kt) arises from rapid intensification (RI), which drives systems quickly through this range.

This study shows that the smaller moons—Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel—are the most viable candidates and should support thick oceans through a process of “self‐tuned resonance.” In self‐tuned resonance, a system dynamically adjusts both its resonance conditions (maximizing stored energy) and its dissipation efficiency (approaching critical damping), resulting in increased dissipation/heating and long‐term stabilization against secular trends (in this case, freezing.)

Analysis of TC genesis and landfall indicates that CHAZ reasonably captures the spatial distribution of TC activity during the Northern Hemisphere TC season in the tropical western Pacific, eastern Pacific, and Atlantic Ocean basins. The CHAZ simulation of TC genesis, track distribution, and landfall latitude is most accurate in the North Atlantic, where interannual variability is also best represented. Observed interannual correlation coefficients between TC genesis and landfall generally exceed 0.5 in the western Pacific and North Atlantic, but are lower in the eastern Pacific; CHAZ simulates higher correlations across all three basins than observations. Further analysis examines the influence of seven climate modes: El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM), Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), Tropical Upper‐Tropospheric Trough in the Pacific (TUTT_Pac) and Atlantic (TUTT_Atl), Western Pacific Subtropical High, and North Atlantic Subtropical High. In the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean basins, heightened TC activity is observed during positive PMM and negative TUTT_Pac phases. In the Atlantic, La Niña, positive AMM, and negative TUTT_Atl phases enhance TC activity. Interactions between modes can amplify or dampen their individual effects; notably, the combination of negative TUTT_Atl and positive AMM phases increases TC landfall occurrence in the Atlantic by over 50% relative to climatological norms in both observations and CHAZ."

For all Rossby modes, except for the s = 1 first symmetric Rossby mode, GPH amplitudes exhibit enhancement in the pre‐ and post‐summer solstice periods. It is inferred that the enhancements of the s = 3 and s = 4 Rossby‐gravity modes around the summer solstice as well as those of Rossby modes in the post‐summer solstice share a common feature: Eliassen‐Palm (EP) flux divergence is positive near the critical line over the region with a negative latitudinal gradient of potential vorticity q‾y ${\overline{q}}_{y}$. This feature strongly suggests that dynamical instability commonly plays a key role in the excitation and/or amplification of these modes. In contrast, characteristics of the Rossby modes in the pre‐summer solstice suggest a common but different mechanism from the above‐described acting to their enhancement: strong upward EP fluxes are observed from the middle stratosphere to the upper mesosphere on the equatorward side of the negative q‾y ${\overline{q}}_{y}$ region at high summer latitudes in the mesosphere.

Although our results overall confirm the lack of robust response, one model, HadGEM3‐GC31‐MM, has a statistically significant equatorward shift in vortex latitude, deceleration of vortex winds, and increase in sudden stratospheric warmings. Its response is found to be highly state‐dependent, significant only in the easterly phase of the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO). Though we cannot comprehensively conclude why models simulate this range of responses, our analysis does highlight areas for consideration in future work to better constrain the stratospheric response to Arctic sea‐ice loss.

Based on the correspondence of fire incidence and burned areas to QFWI, we proposed a classification scheme indicative of low‐, medium‐, and high‐fire dangers in China, and further examined the historical variability of wildfire dangers accordingly. The results show that China's wildfire risks did not increase monotonically with warming, but exhibited an inter‐decadal variability modulated synergistically by changes in multiple climate variables. From 1961 to 1990, the high‐risk days decreased at −0.98 ± 0.71 days yr−1 primarily driven by the slowdown of daily maximum wind speed (WSmax). After 1990, broad swathes of the country experienced significant increases (0.64 ± 0.54 days yr−1) in high‐risk days, particularly in southwest China, contributed mainly by warming of daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) and drying of daily minimum relative humidity (RHmin).

This behavior is elegantly described by Maxwell's equations, which account for material‐specific permittivity and permeability. According to the principle of superposition, the net electromagnetic wave within a dielectric medium results from the combination of the incident wave and secondary waves generated by the medium's interaction with the incident wave. Notably, both the incident wave and the secondary waves propagate at the speed of light in a vacuum. The Ewald‐Oseen extinction theorem explains that secondary waves, emitted by atoms in the dielectric medium, interfere with the incident wave in such a way that they cancel the original wave and produce a resultant wave propagating at a reduced speed determined by the dielectric constant of the medium. In this paper, we extend the application of the Ewald‐Oseen theorem to electromagnetic wave propagation in transmission lines and demonstrate that the principles used to model lightning return strokes align closely with those predicted by the theorem."

We performed theoretical analyses and regional model simulations to evaluate how different sets of reaction rate coefficients affect the formation of sulfate and organic acids from SCI reactions. Our results reveal that both summer and winter conditions result in high organic acid yields and low sulfate yields, leading to increases in hourly formic acid and higher organic acids by as much as 1–3 ppb regardless of the set of reaction rate coefficient used, which can contribute to significant increases in water‐soluble secondary organic aerosol under typical ambient conditions in forested areas in China and Southeast Asia. Comparison of modeled SCI concentrations with estimated ambient SCI concentrations in forested areas in northern Europe provides the first regional modeling evidence that larger SCIs may react more slowly with H2O than small SCIs such as HCHO2, implying that reactions of larger SCIs with SO2 may also lead to increased sulfate concentrations, especially in highly polluted areas."

Knowledge of contrail cirrus lifetimes is required to estimate their lifecycle‐average radiative effect, but lifetime statistics inferred from observations are incomplete, hampering model validation. Contrail cirrus ice crystal size distributions are mainly impacted by entrainment and plume dilution, ice deposition growth and sublimation, and gravitational settling. Changes in the size distributions are due to synoptic and mesoscale air motions that affect sign and magnitude of ice supersaturation experienced by contrail particles. Driven by internal gravity waves, rapid growth/sublimation cycles and sedimentation lead to a selection of ice crystal sizes enabling long lifetimes for persistent contrails whose evolution is not limited by synoptic warming. Wave‐induced mesoscale supersaturation fluctuations lead to a wide spectrum of lifetimes with mean values of 24 $24$ hr and maxima up to 16 hr in large‐scale ice‐saturated conditions. Even longer maximum lifetimes as seen in some observations are possible within deep ice‐supersaturated layers, enhanced microscale turbulent temperature fluctuations, and new ice formation at the top of contrail cirrus. We conceptualize lifetime statistics and define initial adjustment, intermediate stabilization, and final dissipation regimes. Our analysis of contrail cirrus lifetimes and ice crystal size distributions will aid future satellite analyses and model development."

White;Valentina Radić,Linking Atmospheric Waviness to Extreme Temperatures Across the Northern Hemisphere: Comparison of Different Waviness Metrics,"Large meanders in the atmospheric jet stream (Rossby waves) are strongly related to extreme temperature events. It has been theorized that changes in such waves, or “waviness,” may have played a role in observed changes in the frequency of extreme temperature events. There is, however, no consensus on how atmospheric waviness will change in response to climate change; the existence of different metrics used to quantify waviness may be contributing to this lack of consensus. Here, we perform a waviness metric comparison, focusing on their association with extreme daily temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Using a probability ratio, we quantify the association between high waviness and colocated extreme temperatures. We find large differences in association strength across different metrics, highlighting that different metrics are associated with very different aspects of waviness, and are not all equally associated with extremes. A composite analysis highlights some differences. We find that the local wave activity (LWA) metric has the strongest associations with temperature extremes, particularly when separated into its cyclonic and anticyclonic components. We also conduct similar analysis using a neural network model to simulate links between metrics and temperature anomalies. We find that probability ratios can be increased through this method of including nonlinear, and not just colocated, connections, but the result of the LWA metric providing the strongest connection to extremes holds. We also show that a simple geopotential height zonal anomaly method provides overall very high associations and may be sufficient for many studies connecting waviness to extremes."

Methane has a warming potential 28 times that of carbon dioxide on a 100‐year timescale, and carbon monoxide is a precursor to ozone in the troposphere. Modeling trace gas concentrations in the Arctic atmosphere can be challenging due to Arctic conditions and sensitivity to long‐range transport, and comparing model outputs to remote sensing measurements is essential for ensuring that models are performing well. Ground‐based Arctic measurements are spatially sparse, so it is important to make use of all such available data sets.

In this study, the impact and corresponding mechanisms of tropical Pacific SSTAs on compound extreme high temperature and drought events (CHTDE) and related wildfire are investigated based on the observed and reanalysis data sets. The results indicated that the relationship between the boreal summer tropical Pacific SSTAs and a Eurasian quadrupole atmospheric teleconnection has been enhanced since the mid‐1980s. After the mid‐1980s, the warm SSTAs in central‐eastern Pacific lead to the extremization of CHTDE and increasement of wildfire in Western Europe and Northern Central Asia, while cold SSTAs have similar effects in Eastern Europe and East Asia. This is primarily related to the westward shift of tropical Pacific SSTAs, which could trigger enhanced poleward and eastward propagation of Rossby waves and accelerate the circumpolar jet over the Kara Sea and the Laptev Sea and subtropical jet over southeastern Europe, leading to an intensification of the summer double jets event. The double jets could create favorable dynamic modulation of thermodynamic and water vapor transport in Eurasia. Therefore, this ocean‐atmosphere coupled mode results in a quadrupole pattern of disaster in Eurasia, which also has been verified by climate models. This study underscores the enhanced influence of the summer tropics on extreme events in Eurasia, offering valuable references for extreme events and wildfire early warning in Eurasia."

However, the maximum height of its temperature profile product is only 125 km. To improve the spatial coverage, this study proposes a machine learning (ML) method called Bayesian genetic backpropagation neural network (BGBN) to achieve high‐precision and large spatial‐coverage of the temperature profile retrieval through combing O2b1Σg+ ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}\left({\mathrm{b}}^{1}{{\Sigma }}_{g}^{+}\right)$ airglow data observed by the instrument with its existing temperature products. By comparing and analyzing with the official temperature product (MIGHTI v05) and other ML/deep learning models, the reliability and scientificity of the BGBN model were verified. The accuracy of the BGBN was analyzed by comparing independent results of two vertical fields of view. With the help of the interpretability analysis method, the relative variation characteristics consistent with the theory of molecular energy level in the model results were further revealed. On this basis, the model was optimized to improve the spatial coverage of its temperature retrieval results. The results indicate that the average deviation between BGBN retrieval results and MIGHTI‐v05 temperature is less than 5 K, and the self‐consistency is improved by 6.31%. The optimized model extends temperature profiles to 140 km, as validated against MIGHTI v06 data, and provides effective temperature data to some extent for nighttime observations and in extreme regions (like South Atlantic Anomaly). This methodology is expected to establish an effective paradigm for synergistic fusion of machine learning with MLT retrieval."

For this study, we quantify radiation variations through obscuration, which is defined as the fraction of the solar disk obscured by the Moon during SEs. Using Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations, we analyze the changes in the average ozone mixing ratio at the upper stratosphere and the lower mesosphere during multiple SEs since July 2004. The results show that during SEs, ozone at the upper stratosphere and the lower mesosphere is sensitive to short‐term solar radiation changes and increases to about twice the normal daytime ozone mixing ratio. The ozone increase tends to level off with increasing obscuration during SEs, especially near the totality. We estimate that the effect of water vapor photolysis, the primary photochemical process of mesospheric ozone depletion, is greatly suppressed during SEs. Furthermore, we detect O3 changes at 0.46 hPa, which cannot be explained solely by changes in temperature or solar radiation. However, CO observation, a long‐lived tracer, did not reveal any common characteristics in dynamical behavior related to O3 changes near the stratopause."

In this study, we explore how temporally averaged hourly TEMPO column NO2 observations compare to surface‐level concentrations from monitors in the US EPA Air Quality System (AQS). Monthly averaged hourly TEMPO vertical column densities (VCDs) correlate to surface‐level NO2 moderately (R2 = 0.42); however, there is notably stronger correlation for monitors that are not defined as “near road” across hourly annual‐average equivalent timescales (R2 = 0.61). During the TROPOMI overpass (approximately 13:30 LT), annual‐average TEMPO slant column densities (SCDs) at “not near road” sites are better correlated with surface‐level NO2 (R2 = 0.72) than tropospheric VCDs from TROPOMI (R2 = 0.65) and TEMPO (R2 = 0.66) due to added uncertainty with a priori inputs in the AMF. In the future, a more accurate AMF could improve TEMPO VCDs correlation to the level of the TEMPO SCDs. TEMPO column NO2 are most poorly correlated in the early morning at 6:00 (R2 = 0.23) and 7:00 (R2 = 0.35) LT when TEMPO is less sensitive to near‐surface pollution due to a longer sunlight path through the atmosphere and the subsequent increased sensitivity to retrieval assumptions. Ultimately, this analysis identifies conditions and characteristics that affect the correlation between TEMPO and ground‐level monitoring that has implications for applying TEMPO remote sensing data to derive or interpret surface‐level NO2."

The retrievals are based on Meteosat thermal infrared observations. Therefore, rain can be monitored constantly, minutes after input data dissemination. Despite this low latency, RoA accuracy is comparable to estimates requiring hours or more to obtain. Consequently, RoA is of particular interest where a rapid response is critical, such as for disaster preparedness. RoA retrievals employ a convolutional and quantile regression neural network: the latter enables detailed case‐specific descriptions of the retrieval uncertainty. Four years of data from the calibration satellite in the GPM mission were used as training and evaluation labels. With this setup, limitations in earlier near‐real‐time retrievals for Africa were overcome. Moreover, the RoA network runs on regular workstations. With a 30‐km effective resolution, RoA retrievals over land are more timely and detailed than the established IMERG precipitation estimates. RoA is also applicable over the surrounding ocean regions, maintaining a similar performance. However, there IMERG exhibits a better effective resolution, at least for its more favorable conditions. Additionally, RoA's probabilistic nature enables addressing the inherent uncertainties of satellite precipitation retrievals by using probabilities of exceeding precipitation thresholds. Further assessment reveals similar diurnal cycles between RoA and IMERG, although IMERG shows some instability. Visual inspection of rain evolution patterns also indicates that RoA is more consistent. Finally, an annual mean analysis including CHIRPS estimates shows regional differences among the three, with no clear outlier behavior for RoA."

Based on radar data collected during warm seasons from 2012 to 2023, this study explores the evolution, diurnal variation, organization, and movement of convective systems (CSs) initiated by boundary layer convergence lines that formed due to vegetation contrast between the irrigated oasis and adjacent Kubuqi and Ulan Buh deserts in different synoptic patterns in the Hetao area. A total of 228 CSs formed primarily along vegetation contrast lines in arid areas under synoptic patterns featuring adequate moisture and substantial instability, with ∼35% exhibiting linear organization and ∼20% propagating far downstream. These features were also compared across the borders between the Oasis and the Kubuqi Desert versus the Ulan Buh Desert, which have different sharpness of vegetation heterogeneity. Due to the sharper vegetation contrast, CSs over the Kubuqi Desert were nearly 11.7 times more prevalent with a higher prevalence of stronger linear organizational mode, greater intensity, and more frequent downstream propagation than those over the Ulan Buh Desert with a less sharp vegetation gradient, where stronger cellular organizational mode was dominant. These findings hold important implications for the nowcasting of severe weather in the semiarid Inner Mongolia and potentially in other desert‐oasis border regions worldwide."

The climatology and variability of spring cold front frequency show the highest center in the mid‐low reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR), based on the objective identification method. The spring cold front frequency over the MLRYR is strongly associated with the variation in U.S. east coast trough axis during preceding winters. During the winters with eastward‐shifted U.S. east coast trough axis, the positive (negative) geopotential height anomalies are detected over the high‐latitudes and tropics (mid‐latitudes) in North America and the North Atlantic. Such atmospheric circulations can induce tripole SST anomalies in the North Atlantic via altering surface heat fluxes. The tripole SST anomalies persist well from the preceding winter to spring and induce a meridional tripole circulation mode over the North Atlantic, further triggering a wave train which propagates downstream and induces negative geopotential height anomalies over Northeast China, intensifying the East Asia trough. The enhanced East Asia trough favors more southward cold and dry flow, consequently enhancing the equivalent potential temperature gradient over the MLRYR. Such atmospheric changes correspond to more cold front activities over the MLRYR. Leave‐one‐out cross‐validation shows that the preceding winter U.S. east coast trough axis might act as a potential predictor for the spring cold front frequency over the MLRYR."

Owing to their exposed coastal locations, ports are expected to face increasing climate‐related risks, such as sea‐level rise (SLR) and changes in storminess. However, there is a gap in current literature evaluating how ports are addressing climate‐related risks through implementation of adaptation actions. This study explores if, and how, some of the largest commercial ports in the UK are adapting to risk in practice. Evidence of implemented adaptation action is extracted from Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) reports, as mandated under the UK Climate Change Act 2008. Evidence of incremental adaptation was identified, in response to an increasingly diverse range of perceived climate‐related risks. However, uncertainty around future changes in some climate‐related risks, and different risk perceptions, meant ports were also coming to different judgments on when and how they should adapt. A discord between short and longer‐term planning was also identified. Consequently, there remains the need to shift thinking from business‐as‐usual toward a more systematic and integrated consideration of short‐ and longer‐term climate risks, adaptation and wider benefits to support decision making. This would align with a more transformational adaptation approach. This could include exploiting the renewal and investment cycle so new port infrastructure is climate‐proofed when constructed. The framework presented here, to identify, catalog and evaluate implemented adaptation actions in the UK, could be applied to other regions. This would provide a more comprehensive picture of how ports are implementing adaptation globally."

Here, combining a high‐resolution state‐of‐the‐art cryosphere‐hydrology model with observations and the latest climate projections, we project significant increases in annual‐maximum TFFs across all TP basins from 1981 to 2100. By 2100, even under the intermediate‐emission scenario (SSP245), the frequency of peak‐over‐threshold TFFs is projected to rise by 1.2 ± 1.1 to 13.5 ± 4.1 times compared to historical levels (1981–2020) in TP, with intensity increases ranging from 23% ± 30%–106% ± 39%. Although this increase is primarily driven by more frequent rainfall extremes, meltwater will still contribute over 20% to at least one peak‐over‐threshold TFF in 7 of 10 TP basins. For the Indus basin that has the largest glacier area, the number of peak‐over‐threshold TFFs with meltwater contribution exceeding 20% will increase by 3.2 ± 2.2 times by 2100 under SSP585; particularly in the years with heavy snowfall and less rainfall, the meltwater contribution could reach 80%. Moreover, the future ranges of meltwater contributions to the TP's TFFs become much wider than historical levels. By 2100, the exposed population and GDP to TP's TFFs are projected to increase by 6.2 ± 3.2 and 18.0 ± 12.6 times under SSP245, respectively, due to rising flood risk and socio‐economic development. Further, increasing TFFs will threaten over 120,000 km2 cropland downstream.

 Amines are among the most common functional groups in bioactive molecules1. Despite this prevalence, conventional means of converting aromatic amines rely heavily on diazonium intermediates2, which pose significant safety risks due to the explosive nature of these salts3,4. Here, we report a direct deaminative strategy through the formation of N-nitroamines, allowing the direct conversion of inert aromatic C−N bonds into an array of other functional groups, C−X (C−Br, C−Cl, C−I, C−F, C−N, C−S, C−Se, C−O) and C−C bonds. This operationally simple, general protocol establishes a unified strategy for one-pot deaminative cross-couplings by integrating deaminative functionalization with transition-metal-catalyzed arylation, thereby streamlining synthesis and late-stage functionalization. The key advantages of this transformation over other deaminative functionalization methods lies in its versatility across nearly all classes of medicinally relevant heteroaromatic amines, as well as electronically and structurally diverse aniline derivatives, regardless of the position of the amino group. Mechanistic studies, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, suggest that the aryl cation equivalent reactivity of N-nitroamines is generally favoured in this deaminative process. This study highlights the significant potential of the direct deamination approach in synthetic chemistry, offering a safer alternative to the traditionally explosive and hazardous aryldiazonium chemistry."

 Metal halide perovskites with remarkable optoelectronic properties have become a competitive candidate for supporting the efficiency progression of photovoltaics. As the latest record on power conversion efficiency (PCE) of research-cells being comparable to the commercialized silicon cells1-3, the industrialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is on the horizon4,5. Most high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells using self-assembled molecules (SAMs) face the challenges due to their aggregation and hydrophobicity. Here we report a “SAM-in-matrix” strategy to distribute partial SAMs into a stable matrix of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, which could break the original molecular stacking-induced aggregation. 2D lattice Monte Carlo simulation and experimental results reveal that such strategy can form efficient charge transport channels. This SAM-in-matrix hole transport layer (HTL)-based devices demonstrate universally higher efficiencies for various SAMs with compact surface coverage, decent conductivity, and greatly reduced buried nanovoids. Moreover, this strategy shows prominent applicational potential for scalable production. The SAM-in-matrix HTL on FTO/NiOx substrate facilitates the formation of large-area perovskite films with good crystalline quality and enhanced conductivity of NiOx. 1 m × 2 m large-area perovskite solar module is thus achieved with a certified record efficiency of 20.05%."

 Non-radiative recombination loss at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface in the narrow-bandgap (NBG) subcell constrains the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells 1,2. Minimizing charge recombination at the buried interface of lead-tin (Pb-Sn) based NBG perovskite solar cells have proven particularly challenging, as conventional long-chain amine-based passivation strategies often induce carrier transport losses, thereby limiting both the fill factors (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) 3–5. Here, we developed a dipolar passivation strategy that reduces the trap density at the buried interface of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite while simultaneously enabling precise energy level alignment at the HTL/perovskite interface. This dipolar-induced passivation enhances ohmic contact, facilitating efficient hole injection into the HTL and repelling electrons from the HTL/Pb-Sn perovskite interface. This approach extends the carrier diffusion length to 6.2 μm and enables a substantial enhancement in the PCE of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving 24.9% along with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.911 V, a Jsc of 33.1 mA cm-2 and a high FF of 82.6%.

 A phytoplankton bloom spanning 1 million km2 is consistently observed in the western Indian Subantarctic Zone. This oceanic region between the Subtropical and Subantarctic fronts in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean contributes 20–40% of Southern Ocean carbon export to the deep ocean. However, aeolian inputs of iron, the key limiting nutrient for primary production, support only half of the phytoplanktonic iron demand of this bloom. Here we show that primary production in the western Indian Subantarctic Zone is sustained by long-range transport of iron via the Agulhas Current, one of the strongest ocean currents, which flows southwestward along the southern African coast. Float trajectories and high-resolution model diagnostics indicate that these waters, enriched with iron over the African margin, cross the Subtropical Front via the region’s intense mesoscale eddy variability. Removing the African sedimentary iron source in the model decreases surface iron concentrations in the western Indian Subantarctic Zone by 55%, reducing annual primary production and carbon export by 25% and 26%, respectively. Strengthening of the Agulhas Return Current over the past 130 kyr may therefore have increased iron supply and palaeoproductivity in the Indian Subantarctic Zone, potentially leading to enhanced atmospheric CO2 drawdown.

Here, authors develop thick, dense electrodes with synthetic boundaries, improving mechanical robustness and specific, areal, and volumetric capacities as high as 497 mAh cm−3. 
 High energy density lithium-ion batteries are essential for sustainable energy solutions, as they reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing electrode thickness is an effective strategy to raise energy density at the device level, but it poses inherent scientific challenges. Thick electrodes typically require a highly porous structure (over 40% porosity) to maintain sufficient charge transport. Such porosity sharply lowers volumetric energy density, limiting use in space-constrained applications. Conversely, direct densification of thick electrodes intensifies charge diffusion limitations and exacerbates mechanochemical degradation. To overcome these trade-offs, we explore a geology-inspired, transient liquid-assisted densification process that produces dense, thick electrodes with multifunctional synthetic secondary boundaries. These boundaries provide three key benefits: (1) strain resistance that mitigates mechanochemical degradation, as demonstrated by operando full-field strain mapping; (2) enhanced charge transport across boundary phases in thick and dense electrodes (thickness > 200 μm, relative density > 85 %), leading to improved comprehensive electrochemical performance with a volumetric capacity of 420 mAh cm−3, an areal capacity of 23 mAh cm−2, and a specific (gravimetric) capacity of 195 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2; and (3) tailored conducting phases that increase active material content to 92.7 % by weight, further elevating volumetric capacity to 497 mAh cm−3.

 Van der Waals (vdW) magnets provide a rich landscape for innovative spintronic applications at atomic thickness. Among them, chromium sulfide bromide (CrSBr) stands out as a semiconducting antiferromagnet with the potential for magnetoelectric manipulation. However, the detection and electrical control of 2D magnetism in CrSBr are constrained by its centrosymmetric structure and in-plane antiferromagnetism. To address this challenge, we construct heterostructure devices composed of trilayer CrSBr and monolayer graphene, where interfacial charge transfer breaks the inversion symmetry of both magnetic order and crystallographic structure. The inversion symmetry breaking by charge transfer thus allows a full discrimination of the otherwise degenerate magnetic states using optical second harmonic generation, including the charge transfer induced intermediate magnetic states that consist of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic vdW interfaces. Furthermore, gate voltage enables the tuning of charge transfer, effectively modulating the interlayer magnetic coupling and magnetic transitions. Our findings deepen the understanding of optospintronic interaction and magnetoelectric manipulation in vdW magnets, paving the way for electrically tunable 2D spintronic devices.

Positive and negative feedback can act cell-autonomously to establish PCP asymmetry, revealing that PCP shares core logic with single cell systems. 
 As epithelial cells polarize in the tissue plane, the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling module segregates two distinct molecular subcomplexes to opposite sides of cells. Homodimers of the atypical cadherin Flamingo form bridges linking opposite complexes in neighboring cells, coordinating their direction of polarization. Feedback is required for cell polarization, but whether feedback requires intercellular and/or intracellular pathways is unknown. Using novel tools, we show that cells lacking Flamingo, or bearing a homodimerization-deficient Flamingo, polarize autonomously, indicating that functional PCP subcomplexes form and segregate cell-autonomously. Furthermore, we identify feedback pathways and propose an asymmetry amplifying mechanism that operate cell-autonomously. The intrinsic logic of PCP signaling is therefore more similar to that in single cell systems than was previously recognized.

 The passive membrane permeation of small-molecule drugs and small hydrophobic peptides is relatively well understood. In contrast, how long polar peptides can pass through a membrane has remained a mystery. This process can be achieved with permeation enhancers, contributing significantly to the oral transcellular absorption of important peptide drugs like semaglutide — the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic, which is used as Rybelsus in a successful oral formulation. Here we now provide a detailed, plausible molecular mechanism of how such a polar peptide can realistically pass through a membrane paired with the permeation enhancer salcaprozate sodium (SNAC). We provide both simulation results, obtained with scalable continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations, and experimental evidence (NMR, DOSY, and DLS) to support this unique permeation mechanism. Our combined evidence points toward the formation of permeation-enhancer-filled, fluid membrane defects, in which the polar peptide can be submerged in a process analogous to quicksand.

 Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2 homobilayers at filling ν = − 1, considerable interest has arisen in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model.

 Wave reflection and refraction at a time interface follow different conservation laws compared to conventional scattering at a spatial interface. This study presents the experimental demonstration of refraction and reflection of flexural waves across a temporal boundary in a continuum-based mechanical metabeam, and unveils opportunities that emerge by tailoring temporal scattering phenomena for phononic applications. We observe these phenomena in an elastic beam attached to an array of piezoelectric patches that can vary in time the effective elastic properties of the beam. Frequency conversion and phase conjugation are observed upon a single temporal interface. These results are consistent with the temporal Snell’s law and Fresnel equations for temporal interfaces. Further, we illustrate the manipulation of amplitude and frequency spectra of flexural wave temporal refraction and reflection through multi-stepped temporal interfaces. Finally, by implementing a smooth time variation of wave impedance, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capabilities of the temporal metabeam to realize waveform morphing and information coding. Our findings enable precise control over wave amplitude and frequency through temporally modulated mechanical systems, providing a concrete framework for designing time-mechanical metamaterials and time-phononic crystals.

 Children born to women living with HIV (WLWH) suffer increased morbidity and, in low-income settings, have two to three times the mortality of infants born to women without HIV. The basis for this increase remains elusive. In low-income settings, breastfeeding is recommended because health benefits outweigh the risk of transmission, especially when maternal antiretroviral therapy is provided. We profile the milk metabolome of 326 women with and without HIV sampled longitudinally for 18 months postpartum using global metabolomics. We identify perturbations in several metabolites, including tryptophan, dimethylarginine, and a recently discovered antiviral ribonucleotide, that are robustly associated with maternal HIV infection. Quantitative tryptophan and kynurenine levels in both milk and plasma reveal that these perturbations reflect systemic depletion of tryptophan and alterations in tryptophan catabolism in WLWH. Finally, we validate these signatures of maternal HIV infection in an independent cohort of healthier WLWH. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that milk tryptophan content and availability decrease among WLWH, which may indicate perturbations in milk tryptophan catabolism. The link between this perturbation and the increased morbidity and mortality of children born to WLWH merits further investigation.

 Pure iodide formamidinium (FA) based-perovskite has emerged as highly promising candidates for perovskite photovoltaics, but it remains challenging to achieve long-term phase-stabilized FA-based perovskites. Herein, we present a physics-driven strategy of interfacial ferroelectricity, achieved by the integration of ferroelectric CsMnBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) into FA-based perovskites. The ferroelectric field generated by these NCs promotes FA+ cation ordering, modulates Pb–I framework, and enhances the structural regulation of the perovskite lattice. This synergistically increases the kinetic barrier for the undesired Pb-I octahedral transformation and raises the energy barrier for ion migration. The resulting perovskite materials exhibit high structure stability, enabling perovskite solar cell (PSC) minimodule to retain 99% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours’ stability testing under 85% relative humidity at 85 °C. Owing to the improvement at the interface, the PSCs yield an efficiency of 26.62% (certified 26.40%), and the minimodules reach 24.67% (certified 23.23%).

 Building damage poses serious safety risks, causing substantial financial losses worldwide. Engineering shortcomings are commonly cited as the cause of long-term structural failures, often neglecting the exacerbating role of land subsidence. Here we used satellite radar observations during 2015–2023 to estimate differential settlements at 5 fast-growing Indian megacities, including more than 13 million buildings and 80 million people. Our analysis reveals 878 km² of land subsiding, exposing ~1.9 million people to subsidence rates of more than 4 mm yr−1. An estimated 2,406 buildings across Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are at high risk of structural damage from ongoing land subsidence. Sustained over 50 years, current subsidence rates could place as many as 23,529 buildings at very high risk of structural damage in Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. Our results highlight the compounding risk of infrastructure damage from subsidence, assisting policymakers to develop resilience plans and adaptation strategies that prioritize mitigation and maintenance spending.

 The transition to a circular plastics economy is critical for mitigating plastic pollution and advancing global sustainability goals. As one of the most widely used synthetic polymers worldwide, the recycling of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) remains impeded by inefficient dechlorination and toxic chlorinated by-product formation. Here we show that a tailored LaFe0.3Al0.7O3 catalyst significantly enhances peroxymonosulfate activation to achieve stepwise PVC depolymerization. This system achieves complete conversion of PVC into CO2 and liquid organic products. Thus, valuable hydrocarbon compounds are obtained in high yields exceeding 90% among these liquids. Mechanistic studies reveal a cascade process: preferential chlorine removal mediated by singlet oxygen (1O2) followed by hydroxyl radical (⋅OH)-driven polymer backbone oxidation. The synergistic effect of 1O2 and ⋅OH resolves the key challenge of toxic by-products generated during dechlorination. A life-cycle assessment confirms that the process reduces carbon emissions by 45–99% and eco-costs by 51–99% across impact categories compared with conventional PVC waste treatment methods. Our approach enables the conversion of persistent waste plastics into valuable hydrocarbons through a safer and cleaner process with a notably reduced environmental footprints, thus opening opportunities for a more sustainable future.

 Substantial ecological ramifications of moisture stress in ecosystems is called ecological droughts, and are largely unexplored for India. Here, we investigate ecological droughts, their drivers and implications in Indian Summer Monsoon during 2000–2019 based on remote sensing and machine learning. Ecological droughts are increasing in the ecologically fragile pristine forests and croplands that decline vegetation health in India. Meteorological aridity (23.9%) and ocean warming (18.2%) primarily drive the ecological droughts, as suggested by the Random Forest model. Causal analysis reveals that ocean warming indirectly triggers ecological droughts in India. The human intervention in forests also leads to their degradation. The rising ecological droughts due to changing vegetation-climate-human nexus in a shifting monsoon system is a concern for sustainability, food security and climate change mitigation in India. It is thus imperative to consider the ecological repercussions of droughts in policy making and combat their threats through judiciously engineered nature-based solutions.

 Ecosystem resilience represents the capacity to withstand and recover from perturbations, an important property for ecosystem function in an era of escalating disturbances. Whilst studies relate large-scale forest resilience to abiotic factors, knowledge gaps remain regarding the link to aspects of functional diversity, such as forest structural diversity (FSD), a factor controllable through management. Here we use spaceborne lidar-derived FSD to quantify its role in determining resilience in Southern and Central European forests. A random forest isolates the FSD-resilience interplay by disentangling confounding environmental factors. Results show a positive FSD-resilience relationship in 80% of forests. Canopy complexity is a better predictor of resilience than spatial variability in canopy height. This emergent relationship is explored as an adaptation measure to preserve resilience under warming scenarios, with the decline associated with 1 ∘C of warming compensated by a 10% increase in canopy complexity. The findings suggest that management promoting canopy complexity potentially compensates warming-driven declines in resilience.

 Volcanic eruptions are major perturbations to Earth’s biogeochemical cycles, yet their long-term effects on nutrient dynamics and ecosystem recovery remain unclear. Here we present high-resolution geochemical records from Late Ordovician marine and Middle Triassic lacustrine successions to investigate how airborne volcanic ash influenced carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our results reveal that volcanic ash deposition triggered contrasting redox responses in marine and lacustrine systems. In marine systems, ash input promoted persistent anoxia, suppressed nitrogen cycling, and delayed ecosystem recovery for millennia, and was further amplified by enrichment in toxic elements. In lacustrine systems, ash enhanced water-column oxygenation, reduced toxic stress, which stimulated nitrogen fixation and the growth of cyanobacteria, facilitating ecological recovery within decades. These findings demonstrate that volcanic ash drives contrasting biogeochemical responses in marine and lacustrine ecosystems, provide mechanistic insights into past ecosystem resilience, and offer a framework for predicting recovery under future volcanic and climatic disturbances.

 Achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals of holding global temperature rise well below 2 °C with efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C requires rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The built environment embodies substantial emissions, posing a challenge to meeting these goals. We quantify the carbon cost of constructing the global built-environment over the past three decades and project it to 2050. Our findings indicate that the global construction carbon footprint has doubled over the past three decades and is projected to more than double by 2050. In 2022, over half of the construction industry’s carbon emissions stemmed from cementitious materials, bricks, and metals, while glass, plastics, chemicals, and bio-based materials contributed 6%, and the remaining 37% arose from transport, services, machinery, and on-site activities. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the construction carbon footprint alone will exceed the per-annum carbon budget for the 1.5 °C and 2 °C goals in the next two decades. It will use up all remaining carbon budget for the 1.5 °C goal by 2050, as our analysis highlights. Therefore, we advocate for a material revolution, such as replacing traditional materials with biobased materials, which leverages economies of scale and paves the way for a transformative and sustainable future in construction.

 The high-quality global wave mode (WV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vignettes routinely collected by Sentinel-1 are today extensively exploited for various oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Yet, these observations remain largely untapped for iceberg monitoring in the Southern Ocean. As a follow-up to our previous work, a dedicated SAR image classifier is built to detect icebergs of sizes from meters to kilometers in length that are commonly underrepresented in current recording systems. It has been fine-tuned from the Inception-v3 deep convolutional neural network using a curated dataset of 2,062 iceberg and 15,338 non-iceberg cases. Independent evaluations, based on three additional datasets, achieve high precision and recall rates of over 90%. Applied to all WV images acquired between 2016 and 2018 unveils iceberg occurrences around Antarctica. About ∼7.5% of the detected icebergs drift into 40°S to 50°S latitudes, while the majority are concentrated poleward of 55°S. The seasonal patterns of SAR icebergs are generally consistent with altimeter-detection estimates and exhibit advances over the sea ice regions. Linking these WV SAR icebergs to the reported large icebergs reveals that the former are more likely to be located to the east of larger iceberg trajectories, suggesting that the primary driver of their drift is the underlying ocean currents. Although precise identification of the shape and position of these km-sized icebergs remains challenging, WV SAR vignettes provide added value to iceberg investigations at scales beyond current operational reports. Not only relevant for the precise monitoring of icebergs across a wider range of sizes, but it can also become instrumental for our understanding of iceberg tracking, associated dissolution, along with freshwater transport, and their broader impact on global and local climate processes."

 Tropical peatlands storing ∼18–25 % of global peat volume contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. To balance preservation and protection of tropical peatlands requires assessment of their ecohydrological conditions and continuous monitoring through seasons. This is challenging to achieve using in situ sampling, but there is a great promise to use C-band Sentinel-1 data for this due to its weather-independence, and particularly its increased acquisition capacity and spatial/temporal resolution compared to L- and P-band current sensors. Acknowledging that Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometry using C-Band Sentinel-1 data has been shown previously to be useful for retrieving peatland surface displacement, but also that the amplitude and phase of the SAR signal are dependent on surface hydrology; there remains a critical question about the extent to which the efficacy of SBAS approaches is themselves sensitive to surface hydrological conditions. This is a particular methodological concern in tropical peatlands due to the dynamically changing hydrological conditions arising from significant rainfall events, which can cause groundwater level (GWL) to vary from 1 m to −2 m. The research area was situated in lowland Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the 2017–2022 period. We used SBAS-derived ground displacements and compared to groundwater level (GWL) and peat surface elevation acquired from local networks of monitoring sites. Our work shows that the prevailing hydrological condition affects the area efficacy of the SBAS approach using C-band SAR data. When surface water significantly floods above the ground surface during the wet season, the coherence is not sustained for a long time. This is the opposite of the dry season, when coherence is preserved in longer intervals between acquisitions. Additionally, the range of correlation values between SBAS-derived displacements and in-situ peat surface and ground water table measurements is higher for the dry season than for the wet and whole hydrological year. We show that the SBAS approach can retrieve surface displacement for 34.4 % to 59.8 % on the peat soils of the tested area (391 to 826 km2), excluding areas of dense forests and open water, due to C-band SAR limitations, i.e. volume scattering mechanism and/or loss of signal coherence on water bodies. We show that appropriate hydrological conditions must be met to determine the change in water level above the ground surface. Too large fluctuations in water level may not be detected because of wavelength limitations, and outliers from the assumed linear model may be filtered out or removed due to the specific properties of this approach. These findings underpin the application of Sentinel-1C-band SAR for monitoring tropical peatlands' ecohydrological conditions."

 Groundwater is a critical resource for supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Mongolian Plateau (MP), which accounts for over 82 % of total water usage in Mongolia; however, its spatiotemporal dynamics remain underexplored. In this study, aiming to enhance the connection between the Groundwater Storage (GWS) and local SDG implementation, we established an integrated analytical framework encompassing groundwater change detection, driving force analysis, and groundwater sustainability assessment. This framework quantifies groundwater storage changes across the MP from April 2002 to December 2023. Results reveal an overall groundwater change rate of −2.96 mm/yr in the MP, which increases in the west and north and decreases in the east, center, and south. The Gobi area has shown increase trends in GWS. Attribution analysis reveals that areas with increasing GWS are more influenced by climatic conditions such as higher precipitation and lower evapotranspiration, while regions with significantly decreasing GWS are associated with insufficient natural recharge and stronger human activity intensity. By contrast, winter precipitation recharge played a crucial role in slowing down the decrease in groundwater storage. In the five major basins of the MP, the dominant factors leading to groundwater depletion varied and were driven by various social factors, such as population, livestock, agriculture, and mining. A dual-index classification combining precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P−ET) and GWS trends provides a convenient, interpretable and objective approach to assessing groundwater sustainability, offering strong correspondence with the Reliability–Resilience–Vulnerability (RRV) framework. This combined strategy not only captures groundwater trends but also enhances interpretability by linking local sustainability levels to both environmental and anthropogenic drivers, underscoring the need for targeted management to support SDG 6.6. The findings of the present study provide an accurate assessment framework and valuable scientific evidence for groundwater resource management in arid and semi-arid regions."

Satellite synergies between the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) and optical imagery reveal that these waves propagate for long distances within the Pacific Cold Tongue (PCT). A selection of 21 cases shows that waves propagate on average for at least 19 h and may endure up to more than 48 h. These ISW trains may travel from one edge of the PCT, across its meridional width, to the other edge.

 The world is facing increasing land scarcity due to growing demand for agricultural products and urban expansion. At the same time, farmland abandonment is emerging as a widespread global land-use change phenomenon. Remote sensing plays a critical role in identifying abandonment across diverse farming systems. Here, we synthesized current knowledge through a systematic literature review of 131 publications to assess progress in remote-sensing-based monitoring of farmland abandonment. Our review highlights the growing use of remote sensing techniques and the increasing utility of multisource satellite data. However, research remains primarily skewed toward publicly available optical Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, with limited integration of other sources and a lack of global-scale assessments. We propose research directions to guide future studies, focusing on underrepresented land-use types, such as grasslands, terraces, and plantations, as well as regions like Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and South America. We emphasize the importance of diversifying data sources and integrating ancillary information, including cadastral data and historical land-use records, to better understand abandonment processes and associated vegetation changes. We advocate for multi-scale, temporally explicit analyses to improve scalability and enable the development of regional and continental products. As most studies focus on biophysical changes, future work should also consider socio-economic contexts and integrate remote-sensing-based proxies of land-use change. Finally, we recommend improving communication by clearly defining abandonment, providing visual examples, validating with diverse reference data, documenting uncertainty, and sharing data, code, and outputs."

 The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is widely used in forest ecosystem research. Photon cloud classification is crucial for ICESat-2's application in sub-canopy topography and forest structure parameter estimation. However, steep topography, complex canopy structure, and dense canopy cover are important error factors affecting the results of photon cloud classification in forest areas. The existing basic photon cloud classification methods classify ground and canopy photons based on the spatial distribution of photons in the elevation direction. However, in areas of steep topography, it is difficult for the existing photon cloud classification methods to distinguish ground photons from canopy photons because ground photons and some canopy photons will have the same elevation, making their characteristics unclear. In addition, the complex canopy structure and dense canopy cover cause the distribution of photons in the elevation direction to have complex multi-peak characteristics, increasing the difficulty of distinguishing ground photons from canopy photons. In this paper, we propose a novel photon cloud classification method coupling slope and complex canopy structure to account for the abovementioned error factors in photon cloud classification. The proposed model describes the spatial distribution of photons under various slopes and canopy structures based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the photon cloud elevation. The proposed model generates PDFs with simple or complex canopy structures under every slope to characterize the photons' spatial distribution in the elevation direction. A slope lookup table is then introduced to find the most appropriate PDF based on the constructed essential criteria with physical meaning. Finally, the coupling of the proposed model is solved by the most appropriate PDF, and the slope and photon cloud classification results can be obtained. The proposed model was tested in 130 forest plots covering various topographies and canopy structures. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved slopes, the RMSE of the classified ground photons, and the F-value of the ground photons classified by the proposed model reach 1.95°, 1.4 m, and 0.82, respectively. These accuracy indicators illustrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing basic models in the case of steep topography and complex forest structure. This study will substantially improve the accuracy of ground elevation and forest structure parameter estimation through the use of ICESat-2 data worldwide."

 Over the past four decades, forests have experienced major disturbances, highlighting the need for Near Real-Time (NRT) monitoring. Traditional optical-based detection is cloud-sensitive, whereas Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based frameworks enable all-weather observation. Yet, SAR monitoring has mainly focused on humid tropical forests, with reduced performance in regions showing strong seasonal backscatter variation, such as tropical savannas. Detecting small-scale forest loss also remains difficult due to the spatial resolution loss from speckle filtering. This paper presents an unsupervised SAR-based disturbance detection method with NRT capabilities, using Bayesian inference. Building on an existing methodology, the approach processes single-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR time series through Bayesian conjugate analysis. Forest disturbance is framed as a changepoint detection problem, where each new observation updates the probability of forest loss using prior information and a data model. The algorithm uses a hidden Markov chain to adapt recursively to seasonal variation and bypasses spatial filtering, preserving native data resolution and enhancing small-scale forest loss detection. Additionally, a methodology accounts for proximity to past disturbances. The method is tested on two 2020 reference datasets from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado savanna. The first covers small validation polygons (0.1–1 ha, excluding selective logging), totaling 2,650 ha in the Amazon and 450 ha in the Cerrado. The second includes larger clearings totaling 11,200 ha in the Amazon, and 12,700 ha in the Cerrado. A further comparison is conducted with operational NRT forest loss monitoring approaches. Results show substantial gains in detecting small-scale disturbances with reduced false alarms. In the Amazon, the method achieves an F1-score of 97.3% versus 93.1% for the current leading NRT approach. In the Cerrado, it reaches an F1-score of 97.4%, far exceeding the 33.3% of the optical-based method. For larger clearings, performance matches existing SAR approaches in the Amazon. While combined optical-SAR monitoring increases true positives, it also raises false alarm rates. In the Cerrado, the proposed method clearly outperforms optical monitoring, and in both regions it improves timeliness relative to individual operational approaches."

 Glaciers serve as sensitive indicators of climate change, influencing both regional water supplies and global sea-level rise. Contrasting to the global tendency towards retreat, glaciers in the Karakoram exhibits an unusual pattern of stability and modest thickening. However, the spatial variability and underlying causes of the mass balance anomalies remain insufficiently understood, primarily due to the limitations in previous measurement methods. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive geodetic analysis of glacier elevation changes in the central and eastern Karakoram, covering 681 glaciers of over 10,000 km2 between 2011 and 2019. The elevation was measured exclusively with TanDEM-X InSAR data to reduce penetration bias and temporal ambiguities. The geodetic analysis was conducted using a three-module DEM Differencing framework. In this framework, the first module generates high-quality InSAR DEM with an iterative approach to address the challenges of mountainous terrain for InSAR processing; the second module employed an innovative voids filling method using Gaussian Process Regression for robust elevation change mapping; and the third module incorporates a non-stationary uncertainty analysis for rigorous uncertainty quantification. The results reveal a regional mean elevation change rate of 0.0038±0.0042myr−1 and a specific mass balance of 0.0032±0.0052mw.e.yr−1, indicating slight overall thickening during the study period. The spatial patterns of elevation change display pronounced heterogeneity and clear differences between surge-type and non-surge glaciers, reflecting the complex interplay of dynamic, climatic, and morphological factors in the region. This study demonstrates the capability of high-resolution TanDME-X InSAR DEM for accurate geodetic mass balance analysis in challenging mountain environments.

 Long-term time series of global leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) are required for characterizing vegetation dynamics in global change studies. The recently developed Copernicus Land Monitoring Service GEOV2-CLMS products were demonstrated to outperform other existing LAI and FAPAR products in terms of completeness, temporal smoothness, consistency across variables and accuracy. However, these GEOV2-CLMS products are derived from the SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V constellation with temporal coverage from 1999 to 2020 which limits its applicability for global change studies. We present here an adaptation of the GEOV2-CLMS algorithm to AVHRR to extend these time series and generate long-term global vegetation products from July 1981 to December 2022. The GEOV2-AVHRR algorithm was specifically designed to maximize the temporal consistency over the successive AVHRR sensors on board NOAA and MetOp-B satellites while keeping high agreement with GEOV2-CLMS products. Neural networks first transform AVHRR surface reflectance into LAI and FAPAR values at the daily time step. The daily estimates are then filtered, smoothed, gap filled and composited every 10-day.GEOV2-AVHRR showed accuracy error between −0.2 and 0.3 LAI and ∼ −0.03 FAPAR and uncertainty <1 LAI and ∼ 0.10–0.15 for woody and non-woody sites of both DIRECT2.1 and GBOV V3 datasets. GEOV2-AVHRR agreed well with GEOV2-CLMS (MODIS): 92 % (76 %) of land pixels are within ±max(20 %, 0.5) LAI and 71 % (34 %) within ±max(10 %, 0.05) FAPAR uncertainty requirements. The gap filling and temporal filters applied in GEOV2-AVHRR proved effective in improving the completeness (only 1 % of missing data) and temporal precision (smoothness) of LAI and FAPAR time series as compared to MODIS. The intra-annual consistency of GEOV2-AVHRR highly agree with GEOV2-CLMS, indicating it is mostly driven by the algorithm. On the contrary, the inter-annual consistency of LAI and FAPAR datasets appears to be very sensitive to the consistency of the input surface reflectance. GEOV2-AVHRR showed high stability as evaluated with MODIS LAI/FAPAR and improves the stability of GEOV2-CLMS. Some residual inter-annual inconsistencies from the transition to sensors are observed for GEOV2-AVHRR as well as for other long term AVHRR datasets (i.e. GIMMS, GLASS and C3S). GEOV2-AVHRR shows overall greening trends in ∼70 % (∼50 % significant at p < 0.05) of land pixels, and the magnitude and spatial pattern of trends highly agree with those of GIMMS."

 The Arctic Ocean constitutes a globally significant carbon sink, where carbon sequestration is predominantly mediated by the biological carbon pump (BCP). Quantifying BCP magnitude and efficiency persists as a key challenge in marine carbon cycle research. Net community production (NCP) serves as a critical proxy for quantifying carbon export fluxes and assessing carbon sequestration efficacy. This study introduces the Nitrate-based Semi-Analytical Model (NSAM), an innovative framework advancing Arctic NCP quantification through synergistic integration of satellite-based observations, biogeochemical model and hydrodynamic processes. By integrating seasonal nitrate budgets derived from satellite-based observations and reanalysis data using a machine learning algorithm, the NCP is computed by applying Redfield stoichiometry (C: N = 6.6) to convert seasonal nitrogen changes into carbon export estimates. Results demonstrate strong agreement between satellite-derived NCP and in situ measurements (RMSD = 9.52 mmol C m−2 d−1), underscoring the utility of NSAM for quantifying the Arctic BCP.

 Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images has become increasingly popular for a wide range of natural resource and urban application, yielding promising results. To an operational semantic segmentation mapping project, having more samples generally enables the model to better extract target features, achieving higher accuracies. However, annotating remote sensing image samples for model training is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Strategic sampling aims to minimize the efforts in collecting new training samples for a mapping project, which has been not well studied yet for semantic segmentation. To approach this topic, we employed a hybrid way for combining meta-analysis and case studies to investigate the best practices for strategic sampling. Three factors relating to strategic sampling will be investigated: sample size, distribution and transferring methods. We first reviewed 334 recently published papers that adopted semantic segmentation for operational mapping projects to summarize the current status of training sample design from various mapping scenarios. Subsequently, we constructed a large dataset of over 12,000 high-quality annotated image patches for cropland parcel mapping across five study sites, and evaluated various sampling strategies using a baseline segmentation model. We also proposed a novel balanced sampling method, which leveraged patch-based entropy and edge complexity to classify sample diversity. Our findings revealed that (1) both meta-analysis and the case studies suggested that ∼4 % of the total mapping patches were the optimal training sample size under random sampling, i.e., the minimum size to reach accuracy saturation; (2) compared to random sampling, the newly proposed balanced sampling was superior due to its decreasing the required sample size from ∼4 % to 2.5 % of the total patches in mapped areas; (3) sample transfer and model transfer present identical performance for relaxing the average local sample demand from 2.5 % to 0.5 % of total patches, with sample transfer being slightly more accurate than model transfer (Global Total-Classification errors: 0.298 vs 0.308).

 Urban environments are characterized by continuous transformation, with new buildings, innovative infrastructures, evolving landforms, and emerging vegetation constantly reshaping the urban fabric. These dynamic changes create previously unannotated land cover classes that modify surface albedo, alter drainage patterns, and influence carbon storage, thereby affecting local climates, resource flows, and ecosystem services. Therefore, traditional land cover mapping methods based on static semantic labels are inherently limited. Even the most meticulously annotated datasets cannot comprehensively account for the full spectrum of urban classes. As urban environments continue to evolve, these static methods fail to capture the continual appearance of previously unannotated classes. This limitation leads to maps that quickly become outdated, incomplete, and imprecise, thereby impeding accurate environmental monitoring. To address this critical challenge, we propose Land Cover Discovery Mapping (LCDM), which integrates novel class discovery with land cover mapping, and we present an innovative end-to-end hybrid supervision framework, 3DLCDM, to implement LCDM in 3D remote sensing. The system has been tested on two high-resolution 3D point cloud datasets: one acquired via airborne LiDAR in Canada and the other obtained primarily using UAV-based LiDAR in Germany. Experimental results reveal that our 3DLCDM framework increases the mIoU for novel classes by up to 16.95% on the DALES dataset and up to 24.43% on the H3D dataset compared to baseline methods, demonstrating effective discovery capabilities under evaluation conditions that are procedurally equivalent to encountering genuinely novel urban features in practice. The proposed 3DLCDM framework demonstrates the potential to enable the continuous generation of up-to-date land cover maps that capture dynamic changes in urban morphology, thereby significantly advancing land cover discovery mapping. Furthermore, strong generalization across multiple datasets and urban feature types demonstrates the robustness of the framework’s discovery mechanisms and its capability to deliver high-fidelity maps that scale across diverse urban environments."

 Accurate topographic phase removal in Differential InSAR (DInSAR) processing relies on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), yet limitations in DEM accuracy and currency hinder precise surface displacement measurement. Although modern SAR satellites feature a relatively narrow orbit tube, the phases induced by DEM errors cannot be safely ignored especially in areas under rapid urbanization. Current Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) methods, which estimate DEM errors alongside deformation, suffer from potential biases due to inaccurate deformation models and high computational cost from per-point processing. We present here a novel detection-and-estimation strategy for efficient DEM error mitigation. Our key innovation is a phase gradient direction consistency (GDC) criterion, which provides a direct and intuitive visualization of pixels affected by DEM errors (PEEs)—a capability not previously available. This is a significant advancement as it allows targeted correction instead of exhaustive estimation. We further develop a generalizable framework for DEM error retrieval applicable to various scenarios. Validation with simulated and real-world data from urban and mountainous environments demonstrates effective separation of DEM errors from various spatiotemporal deformation signals. In addition, the proposed method achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in processing efficiency compared to conventional approaches. By directly identifying and estimating DEM errors from wrapped phases, our approach streamlines deformation retrieval and is readily integrated into existing MT-InSAR workflows."

 Crown base height (CBH) is essential for characterizing forest vertical structure over time for sustainable forest management and serves as a key input in fire model and growth model. At plot level, the average CBH (CBHa) is mainly used to assess tree growth and construct biomass models while the minimum CBH (CBHmin) can indicate the fire risk and fire behaviour. However, there are currently few CBH products available at a national or global scale. Close-range light detection and ranging (Lidar) has shown great potential in collecting plot-level forest structure parameters and can be easily scaled up to national or global scale. But considering the integrity of point clouds, CBH estimation utilizing airborne Lidar data would be always overestimated compared with other close-range Lidar data such as TLS data or backpack data. This is mainly because of the significant difference in density between the upper and lower point clouds, as well as lacking considering the tree shape. By filling the point clouds with the same density and lowering the CBH condition which considers the tree shape, we proposed an improved CBH estimation method to reduce the overestimation when using airborne Lidar data. Verified by field-measured data in six plots, the proposed method improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by nearly 50 % compared with the original method. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.694 m, R2 was 0.777 and the RMSE was 1.039 m for the validation trees. Facing different sensors and point densities, this method generally generates stable CBH estimation results. Then, we developed a newly tree-based framework that uses machine learning and multiple source remote sensing data for generating CBH products across China. We collected over 1117 km2 close-range Lidar data and used the proposed method for estimating CBH. The CBH estimation results were converted to average value and minimum value in a 1 km × 1 km plot and served as training data to generate CBH maps across China at 1 km resolution. To our best knowledge, this is the first CBH map across China, and also the first national-scale average and minimum CBH maps around the world. The results showed that the average CBHa and CBHmin were 6.76 m and 2.70 m with standard deviations of 1.59 m and 0.85 m. The methods and maps would provide a new dimension in monitoring changes in forest structure, assessing fire risk and constructing biomass models in future studies."

 The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Global Land Surface Phenology (GLSP) product (VNP22Q2 C2) has been operationally produced since 2013, and is designed to provide annual measurements of the phenologies of vegetated land surfaces at the global scale, succeeding the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product (MCD12Q2 C61), which was first produced in 2001. Although separate validations have been conducted locally to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the detected phenometrics for each product, a comprehensive understanding of the differences between these two operational products is important for downstream applications. Therefore, this study conducted critical analyses and cross-comparisons of the land surface phenology (LSP) products to ensure long-term continuity in the global phenological dynamics. Specifically, we compared five LSP products at 500 m spatial resolution: two NASA operational products of MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2, as well as three other LSP products that were generated by applying the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm to different time series from NOAA-20 VIIRS only, both SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, and MODIS on Aqua and Terra. First, we cross-validated the five products at 500 m using a high-quality reference LSP dataset at 30 m that was generated by fusing the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with near-surface PhenoCam time series across diverse ecosystems in North America, Europe, and Japan. Second, cross-comparisons were conducted between the five LSP products at 500 m across 12 golden tiles. Third, the long-term comparability and continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and the VNP22Q2 C2 products were assessed globally. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that the VNP22Q2 C2 product provides overall global continuity for the MCD12Q2 C61 record. Compared to independent reference data from the HLS-PhenoCam LSP product, the four LSP products derived from the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm produced highly comparable results with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of ∼ 11 days and mean systematic bias (MSB) of ∼ 7 days. The cross-comparisons indicated a strong agreement among the five 500 m LSP products in the 12 selected golden tiles with MADs < 7 days; however, their agreement with the MCD12Q2 C61 was slightly lower with MADs ∼ 9–10 days. The global-scale evidence of continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2 products was an absolute difference of < 15 days, except in arid/semiarid, tropical, and high-latitude ecosystems. Finally, it is suggested that (1) the continuity from MODIS to VIIRS LSP products would be enhanced if the same phenological detection algorithm was applied to the MODIS data, and (2) the quality of the VIIRS GLSP product could be improved by integrating data from multiple VIIRS sensors."

 Sand ripples, shaped by fluid flow like wind or water, are common on dunes on Earth and Mars. Their patterns reveal local transport conditions, offering insights into wind regimes where direct observations are lacking. Since manual mapping is slow and subjective, automated methods are essential for consistent large-scale analysis. This study presents two novel and complementary methods for mapping ripple patterns on Martian dunes using high-resolution imagery: a U-Net model for pattern classification and a 2D semi-variogram for measuring ripple spacing and orientation. Tested on 42 barchan dunes across six Martian regions, the U-Net showed reliable ripple classification (F1-score 79 %), while the variogram method achieved high accuracy for ripple spacing (R2 = 0.78) and orientation (R2 = 0.98). Together, these approaches enable efficient, large-scale analysis of ripples for sediment transport on any planetary surface and can be applied to other patterned features."

 Timely and reliable building damage assessment is essential for effective disaster response and humanitarian assistance. However, the diversity of disaster types, geographic regions, and data distributions poses significant challenges to transferring building damage assessment models to new disaster scenarios (i.e., target domains). In addition, limited availability of post-disaster training imagery in target domains further hinders progress. Recent approaches, such as single-temporal change adaptation, enable adaptation using only target pre-disaster images by constructing pseudo bitemporal damage samples at an unexplainable embedding level. While effective, these methods produce representations that are difficult for human experts to interpret, inspect for errors, or adjust categorical distributions to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we propose Neural Disaster Simulation (NeDS), a deep disaster generative model that synthesizes realistic post-disaster image from pre-event image and customizable disaster information (i.e., disaster types and disaster intensity). Thanks to damage data generation based solely on pre-event imagery, NeDS enables adaptation at any time, effectively bypassing the limitation of post-disaster training image availability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling disaster effects at the image level, NeDS mitigates distribution shifts between historical training data and unseen disaster events, enhancing both model transferability and visual interpretability. Extensive experiments conducted on both global-scale and local-scale study areas demonstrate that NeDS adaptation outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving a 4.3% improvement in average performance on a global dataset, as well as 3.6%, 7.9%, and 18.5% gains in damage classification performance for the 2025 Eaton fire, the 2025 Palisades fire in Los Angeles, and the 2025 Nigeria flooding, respectively."

As a multifaceted urban intervention, roof greening involves complex stakeholder coordination and requires comprehensive assessments across various urban development dimensions.

Here, using geospatial big data, we conduct an urban-scale assessment of roof greening at a single building level in Hong Kong from a sustainable development perspective. We identify that 85.3 % of buildings reveal potential and urgent demand for roof greening (average priority>0.6).

 The VIIRS was designed in recognition of the need for long-term observations in support of global-change science and to provide MODIS observation continuity. The NASA MODIS burned area (BA) product (MCD64A1) has been generated systematically for nearly 25 years and maps globally the approximate day of burning at 500-m resolution. We describe the follow-on NASA Collection 2 VIIRS BA product (VNP64A1) that became available in October 2024 and provides global BA mapping from 2012 into the next decade. The product is derived using an adaptation of the Collection 6.1 MCD64A1 BA mapping algorithm and using the same sinusoidal grid and 500-m reporting resolution. Annual and monthly intercomparisons of the VPN64A1 and MCD64A1 products at global and continental/regional scales indicate high product BA reporting consistency. Approximately 2.6 % of the land surface was mapped as burned annually; VNP64A1 mapped slightly more than MCD64A1 but with 0-day median burn-date reporting differences. A global (Stage-3) product validation, using 561 interpreted Landsat image pairs, was undertaken and the VNP64A1 product had estimated 36.7 % commission and 72.4 % omission errors, compared to MCD64A1 34.2 % commission and 71.5 % omission errors. Product accuracies were also characterized using metrics derived from the weighted regression (to incorporate sample inclusion probabilities) between 5-km BA proportions in the products and the Landsat data. The omission and commission errors observed at 30-m were largely compensated at 5-km, with coefficient of determination (0.70), slope (0.83), and intercept (−0.0006) terms for the VNP64A1 product nearly identical to those of MCD64A1. With respect to global temporal reporting accuracy, 38 % of VNP64A1 burned grid cells had burn dates that matched the date of a MODIS active fire, versus 46 % for MCD64A1, and 71 % of VNP64A1 burned grid cells had burn dates within two days (72 % for MCD64A1).

 Models to simulate solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are widely used to interpret fluorescence observations across scales. However, leaf fluorescence spectra models often mix-use the plate model and Kubelka-Munk (KM) model, which differ in their assumptions in the internal scattering within a leaf and brings in uncertainty in explaining SIF observations. Additionally, fluorescence photons are not conserved in spectral models due to their use of a sigmoid function to adjust the fluorescence emission spectrum dependent on excitation wavelength. To resolve these problems in SIF simulation, we present a new spectral model, Platespect. It is based on the plate model that can compute backward and forward leaf fluorescence spectra and also rescales the raw fluorescence emission spectrum to conserve fluorescence photons. We theoretically compared the fluorescence simulations from Platespect and Fluspect, which adopts the commonly used KM model, at the leaf and canopy scales; we also evaluated them with leaf-level backward fluorescence observations. At the leaf level, although Platespect predicted fluorescence magnitudes similar to those of Fluspect, it showed substantial differences in the backward and forward fluorescence spectra. Accounting for scattering among leaf plates in Fluspect helps reduce the difference. Platespect predicted a higher far-red fluorescence due to the rescaled fluorescence spectra emitted by longer wavelength light. When fitted against leaf-level observations, Platespect performed slightly better in the red fluorescence region, but all models showed a systematically biased fluorescence spectrum. Assessed at the canopy level, Platespect-based simulations predicted a higher SIF and higher sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll content. Our results highlight the necessity of better representing the scattering among plates, improving the raw fluorescence emission spectrum, and conserving emitted fluorescence photons to improve the simulation of SIF across scales."

 The timing of harvesting is crucial for determining crop yield potential as it influences the final stages of the crop growth cycle and affects crop grain quality. Early harvesting can lead to yield losses from excessive moisture and insufficient dry matter, while delayed harvesting can degrade grain quality due to over-maturation and increased susceptibility to weather, pests, and diseases. Accurate monitoring of harvest timing is essential to assess yield gaps, support profitable and sustainable farming practices, and optimize agricultural supply chains. However, remote sensing-based harvesting date detection methods often suffer from biases due to the inconsistent relationship between end-of-season (EOS) metrics in vegetation index (VI) time series and actual harvesting dates. This inconsistency occurs because harvesting decisions are often influenced by human factors such as equipment availability, labor constraints, and fuel costs, rather than plant condition alone. In this study, we develop a novel Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI) that integrates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance to accurately monitor whether fields of corn and soybean have been harvested. Leveraging the distinct separability of NIR reflectance for corn and soybean before harvesting (senescent plants) and after harvesting (crop residue), combined with the contrasting trends between NIR and NDVI during this transition, the NIR-to-NDVI ratio amplifies the harvesting signal in its time series, making it a robust indicator of harvesting events. As the first spectral index designed for scalable identification of crop harvesting stage, the developed NHPI is applied to map harvesting dates for corn and soybean fields across the U.S. Midwest from 2020 to 2023 using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery via Google Earth Engine (GEE). At the field level, the NHPI-based harvesting date estimation method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4 days and an R2 of 0.85 when compared against field-recorded harvesting dates, significantly outperforming all advanced harvesting date estimation benchmarks (i.e., EOS phenometric-based method, shape model fitting method (SMF), and shape model fitting by the separate phenological stage method (SMF-S). The NHPI-based harvesting date mapping also shows strong alignment with the state-level cumulative distribution of harvesting dates of the USDA crop progress reports, achieving an average MAE of 3 days. Further analysis of NHPI values before and after harvesting events reveals its strong adaptability to diverse weather conditions at large scales, highlighting its efficiency and robustness."

 The prediction of fire-induced tree mortality is important for evaluating potential timber volume losses, replanting costs, and for assessing how mortality will impact long-term yield and carbon dynamics. However, current methods do not provide spatially explicit predictions, limiting the use of this data for proactive forest management, such as thinning and reducing fuel load to reduce tree mortality. In this study we assess whether the incorporation of individual tree inventory data derived from airborne laser scanning and modeled and observed fire intensity data can provide accurate spatially explicit tree mortality predictions. Specifically, tree-level mortality was predicted for over 1.9 million trees within six wildfires in mixed coniferous forest in northwestern Montana, USA, and validated using high resolution imagery for each segmented tree crown. Random forest classification models utilizing observed fire intensity metrics derived from VIIRS observations were the most accurate (overall accuracy: 77.2 %), followed by random forest classification models utilizing modeled fire intensity (64.5–66.1 %) and those that utilized existing logistic regression relationships (55.7–59.0 %). The random forest tree mortality models also produced lower RMSE (6.3–10.2 %) and bias (1.7–3.7 %) compared to the logistic regression approach (RMSE: 38.4 %, bias: −29.6 %) when mortality accuracy was assessed across tree size class. The predictor variable importance quantification showed that fire intensity metrics were more important than species and structural variables in the mortality classification.

A framework for estimating the volumetric moisture content of sandy beaches using satellite-based HH-polarized X-band synthetic aperture radar imagery is presented and used to test the applicability of three theoretical scattering models: Oh, Dubois, and the Integral Equation Model (IEM). The developed framework relies on the measured backscatter coefficient, soil surface root-mean square (RMS) height, and the geometric characteristics of the image. Models for estimating the RMS height were developed based on field measurements for two distinct sites composed of predominately quartz sand and approximately uniform beach slopes: Duck, North Carolina and Cannon Beach in Yakutat, Alaska. The models were developed and tested for incidence angles of 23.3°-54.2° using data obtained from the Cosmo-SkyMED and TerraSAR-X satellites. Four sets of RMS height models were tested: Oh with moisture contents greater than 0 %, Oh with moisture contents greater than a very dry threshold, Dubois, and the IEM. Unique RMS height models, specific to a moisture content model, were developed for incidence angles ranging from a single incidence angle to a range of consecutive incidence angles. Applying the RMS height models, the root mean square error (RMSE) of moisture content was 0.7–6.9 %. Images with incidence angles of 30°- 46° and 40°-50° resulted in the best estimates of moisture content when compared to other ranges of incidence angles for the models tested. Deviations generally represented underestimates of the moisture content (0.1 %–1.3 %), with greater underestimates observed for the IEM. Spatial estimates of moisture content resulted in two distinct zones, one with low moisture contents and a second with slightly elevated moisture contents for all models except the IEM. Challenges associated with differences in scattering mechanisms, a lack of data with high moisture content, and sensitivity of models to small changes in RMS height are discussed."

 Phenolics are a rarely quantified plant biochemical trait that plays a vital role in plant physiology and ecosystem functioning, contributing to plant's chemical defence and influencing nutrient cycling and soil microbial compositions. Spatially continuous information on foliar phenolics is essential for assessing plant health and ecosystem functional diversity. However, previous efforts to predict and map phenolics have been confined to aircraft-based hyperspectral data in limited biomes. The potential of next-generation imaging spectroscopy, whether airborne- or spaceborne-based, for mapping phenolics remains underexplored, particularly in structurally complex and heterogeneous ecosystems such as European mixed temperate forests. Furthermore, much is still unknown about the consistency and uncertainties of predicting forest canopy phenolics across different acquisition levels (airborne vs. spaceborne), limiting our ability to generalise and upscale local trait estimates to broader spatial extents. In this study, we sampled sunlit top-of-canopy leaves from three dominant tree species across mixed temperate forests in southeast Germany. Leveraging next-generation airborne (AVIRIS-NG) and spaceborne (PRISMA) imaging spectroscopy (400–2400 nm), we modelled two ecologically important phenolics (total phenol and tannin) expressed in three forms (foliar mass-based, foliar area-based, and canopy-based). The predictive accuracy of two data-driven approaches, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR), was compared to assess performance across different spatial scales. Our results demonstrate that phenolics in sunlit canopy leaves can be accurately estimated from both airborne and spaceborne data, with foliar area-based phenolics showing the strongest relationship with spectral reflectance (total phenol: R2 = 0.64–0.69, NRMSE = 13.28%–15.65%; tannin: R2 = 0.49–0.65, NRMSE = 15.86%–21.29%). We observed several similar patterns in model coefficients across airborne and satellite levels, with informative wavelengths aligning with known phenolic features. While the model accuracy declined slightly when scaling from canopy to landscape scale, phenolic maps derived from AVIRIS (aggregated to 30 m) and PRISMA showed good spatial agreement and linearity (GPR: r = 0.68, slope = 0.86; PLSR: r = 0.57, slope = 0.49). These maps successfully captured inter- and intra-species phenolic variability across the test site with low prediction uncertainty. Our findings provide valuable insights into mapping canopy traits across different observational scales, demonstrating how next-generation imaging spectroscopy can characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant phenolics. This research paves the way for improved global monitoring of ecosystem functioning, as well as the pattern of phenolics across forested landscapes and trees' potential ‘chemical’ defences against herbivory and other environmental stressors."

 Reliable flood inundation modelling in complex river systems that are poorly instrumented is often limited by inaccuracies in open source DEMs, particularly near river channels and vegetated regions. This study proposes a methodology to correct and enhance resolution of satellite based DEMs in floodplain areas with ICESat-2 land elevation, Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, and a simple artificial neural network (ANN). FabDEM (30-m) is selected as the base DEM, and the ANN is trained to correct elevation errors at 10-m resolution using spectral bands from Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 ATL03 elevation. The corrected ANN DEM reduces the mean squared error by 7 cm on average and up to 38 cm in the areas closer to the main river channel. MIKE 21 is used to simulate 2D flood extent maps for four different events, that consider in-situ discharge values at high, medium and low flow, comparing modelled flood extent with observed surface water extent (SWE) maps derived from Sentinel-2 at the selected dates. To ensure that improvements are attributed to DEM corrections rather than hydraulic parametrization, simulations are performed with different uniform values of the Gauckler-Strickler coefficient Ks, which are kept consistent across FabDEM and ANN DEM based scenarios. The critical success index (CSI), F1- score and bias are calculated for simulations with FabDEM and ANN DEM. Across all events, the ANN DEM improves flood simulation accuracy, increasing the Critical Success Index (CSI) and F1 score by up to 19 % and 13 %, respectively, and reducing bias by up to 25 %. This workflow demonstrates a scalable and efficient approach to improve hydraulic model inputs in data-scarce floodplain environments, offering valuable insights for flood risk assessment and water resource management in remote regions."

 This paper investigates a crossover adjustment method for spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) phase altimetry and demonstrates its capability for precise surface elevation mapping through a case study of Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe and exhibits unmodeled gravitational effects on its water surface. GNSS-R phase altimetry measures relative surface height with a constant but unknown offset and may also include errors in the retrieved surface gradients due to factors such as the residual atmospheric propagation error after model correction. The crossover adjustment method estimates the offsets between multiple GNSS-R tracks and each track’s surface gradient errors by formulating and solving a constrained least-squares problem to minimize differences at intersections. Additionally, this method evaluates the accuracy of GNSS-R altimetry retrievals by comparing the consistency of each track with others, enabling the identification of measurement outliers with respect to stable geophysical features. In the case study, we utilize 871 sets of Spire grazing-angle GNSS-R data collected from 2020 to 2023, containing signals coherently reflected off Lake Ladoga, to map the unmodeled gravitational effects on the lake’s water surface. The mapping results are validated using 16 ICESat-2 altimetry datasets, demonstrating a high accuracy with a root-mean-square (RMS) difference of about 3 cm."

 Mangroves play a crucial role in coastal ecosystem, providing indispensable benefits such as sustaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and supporting global productivity. Nevertheless, the long-term survival of these critical habitats is jeopardized by a combination of anthropogenic pressures and natural disturbances. Accurate monitoring of vegetation functional traits, specifically Leaf Area Index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (CHL), is imperative for evaluating the physiological condition of mangrove stands. However, the interaction between LAI and spectral resolution (Spr) in CHL retrieval remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study developed a first-order derivative-weighted spectral angle mapping (FWS) method to quantify the relationships of spectral reflectance across three CHL grades (CHL-Low, CHL-Middle, CHL-High) and three LAI gradients (LAI-Low, LAI-Middle, LAI-High). Our results revealed that spectral reflectance in the 400–800 nm range was negatively correlated with CHL, which stood in contrast to its positive correlation with LAI. We subsequently optimized a mean resample correlation analysis (MRCA) method to identify CHL-sensitive spectral domains, and our results confirmed that these domains were predominantly distributed in the ranges of 466–780 nm (CHL-L), 520–776 nm (CHL-M), and 520–779 nm (CHL-H). To identify optimal wavelengths, we applied the central wavelength matching method (CWMM). Results confirmed that these optimal wavelengths matched the central wavelengths of SDGSAT-1 and Sentinel-2 spectral bands, and we subsequently constructed 84 inversion schemes. This study constructed two mechanism-guided active learning hybrid models (PROSAIL-AL-RF and PROSAIL-AL-NGB). These models achieved robust CHL estimation for the high chlorophyll content grade (CHL-H), with R2 values ranging from 0.441 to 0.894. Notably, PROSAIL-AL-RF exhibited more robust and consistent accuracy than PROSAIL-AL-NGB in most scenarios. Cross-regional inversion experiments for CHL showed that the hybrid models exhibited reliable performance, with R2 values of 0.748 for PROSAIL-AL-NGB and 0.740 for PROSAIL-AL-RF. This study elucidates the LAI-Spr interaction mechanisms in CHL inversion and validates the scalability of hybrid models, providing a powerful approach for precisely monitoring the different growth status and stages of mangroves all over the world."

 Groundwater is an important resource for sustainable crop growth and agricultural productivity, and groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations directly influence agroecosystems. However, GWL data for most regions is unavailable because of spatial scarcity and discontinuous groundwater observations. In recent studies, machine learning techniques have proven to be a useful tool for producing GWL estimates, but these techniques may not necessarily take into account distances and observations from the nearest points to unmonitored sites as covariates. In this study, we explored the potential of these additional spatial covariates by implementing Random Forest for Spatial Interpolation (RFSI) to generate high-resolution (1 km2) GWL estimates on a monthly scale. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RFSI model, we performed a thorough comparison of the RFSI model with a conventional Random Forest (RF) model, a Random Forest for spatial data (RFsp) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The framework was implemented using GWL observation data for the period 2001 to 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany. The RFSI model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy for GWL predictions at testing points, achieving an R2 value of 0.86, surpassing the performance of RF, RFsp and SVM with R2 values of 0.75, 0.72 and 0.67, respectively. Incorporating nearby-well information substantially improved 1 km GWL predictions: RFSI achieved the lowest RMSE (3.77 m), as compared to RF (4.85 m), RFsp (5.04 m), and SVM (5.59 m). Notably, among the models tested, RF, RFsp, and SVM showed notable inaccuracies, substantially underestimating groundwater levels (GWL) in deeper wells (>10 m) and overestimating levels in shallow wells (1–10 m). In contrast, RFSI performed better, with smaller overestimations (up to ∼1.1 m) and less severe underestimations (up to ∼−3.9 m). Furthermore, the RFSI model demonstrated significantly higher computational efficiency compared to RFsp and SVM, particularly for large training datasets and high-resolution prediction mapping."

 Mesoscale eddies can be captured not only by sea surface height (SSH) imageries derived from satellite altimetry missions, but also by ocean color and sea surface temperature (SST) imageries derived from the visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal bands of satellite sensors. Satellite SSH and SST data have been used for eddy detection in the past. With the development of the gap-free ocean color datasets, researchers have recently started to use satellite chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data for eddy detection. In addition, satellite-derived diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm [Kd(490)], which measures the water turbidity, is also found to be sensitive to the effect of mesoscale eddies. However, it has been found that a single parameter of SSH, SST or Chl-a is often not reliable to accurately detect ocean eddies. In this study, we propose a deep convolution neural network (CNN)-based model that incorporates three parameters, Chl-a, Kd(490), and SST, for eddy detection. In our implementation of neural networks, the image of each parameter of Chl-a, Kd(490), and SST runs through a separate encoding–decoding path to obtain its single-parameter based feature map of oceanic eddies. The three feature maps are then concatenated and convolved by a convolution layer, before the final “softmax” activation layer is applied to perform pixel-wise classification for eddy detection. The networks are tested in the Gulf of America (GoA) and the Gulf Stream Extension (GSE) region. It is found that the single-parameter of SST model does not always detect eddies in the GoA, while the single-parameter model of Chl-a or Kd(490) sometime misses eddy detections in the GSE region. However, three-parameter combined model is always reliable to accurately detect the anticyclone and cyclonic eddies of interests in the GoA and GSE. The eddy detection of the single-parameter models and the combined model are quantitatively evaluated, showing that the three-parameter combined model performed significantly better than all single-parameter models."

 Estimating landslide volumes remains challenging because of the limited availability of high-resolution terrain data. Traditional methods often rely on empirical area-to-volume conversion formulas, which introduce significant uncertainties due to terrain variability and simplified assumptions. This study proposes a deep learning framework that integrates multitemporal satellite imagery, LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), terrain attributes, and a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to simulate the DEM of Difference (DoD) and estimate landslide-induced volumetric changes. The input DEMs were resampled to 20-meter resolution for publicly available coverage exceeding 78,183 km2. A total of 2,881 map frames contained two DEM epochs, and 348 frames had three epochs, with time intervals typically ranging from 5 to 8 years. From these, 198 deep-seated landslide cases were extracted for analysis, covering approximately 7.12 km2, including 4.89 km2 of erosion area and 2.23 km2 of deposition area. The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 0.66, with F1-scores of 0.46 for erosion, 0.30 for deposition, and 0.78 for background. Volumetric estimations revealed a consistent underestimation trend, with median erosion errors of approximately − 50 % and deposition errors approaching − 100 % across the five-fold cross-validation. The framework effectively captures three-dimensional spatial distributions and enables accurate volumetric estimation without the need for post-event DEMs, offering a practical solution for data-scarce regions. Additionally, it enhances sediment volume assessments that are crucial for disaster prevention and sediment management, bridging the gap between empirical estimation and modern deep learning techniques."

 In 2024, China experiences frequent and severe hydrological extremes, including record-breaking rainfall and widespread droughts, reflecting the intensifying impacts of climate change. The significant changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) caused by these extreme precipitation events require more detailed analysis to assess short-term hydrological dynamics. Here, we first analyze precipitation anomalies (PA) and percentage of PA (PPA) across mainland China from April to August 2024. The results reveal that PA and PPA in most regions exhibit extreme values in different months, resulting in severe droughts, floods, and abrupt drought-to-flood transitions. To assess the associated water storage changes, we define and apply the terrestrial water flux (TWF), the differenceof GRACE/GRACE-FO-derived TWS anomalies in two adjacent months, as a diagnostic indicator of short-term hydrological variability. Relative to 2002–2024, the grids with TWF percentiles within the 0-10th and 90-100th ranges respectively account for 36.52%, 46.22%, 44.79%, and 46.48% of the total grids from April to August in China. Additionally, 19.89% of grids have the maximum TWF value in 2024. These extremes closely align with variations in precipitation, suggesting that intensified TWF is primarily driven by meteorological factors rather than GRACE-FO data uncertainties. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of TWF in capturing rapid hydrological changes under climate extremes. The findings provide critical insights into the impacts of climate change on regional hydrological processes and offer a valuable reference for future climate risk management and adaptation strategies at both national and global scales."

 Snow and ice are among the most important components of the cryosphere; therefore, accurate identification of snow and ice is key to improve the understanding of the influence of various studies on global warming, e.g., studies on global water cycling, climate change and the radiation budget balance. The spectral information at single-view, e.g., the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) has been widely used in the recognition of snow cover at both local and global scales. However, special information sources related to the angular pattern of snow reflectance have rarely been considered in such applications. In this study, we proposed an angular index named the snow anisotropic reflectance index (SARI) based on the RossThick–LisparseReciprocal–Snow (RTLSRS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to achieve snow identification. The POLarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances (POLDER) database is one of the most widely-used multiangular database because of the abundant measurements and the pixels marked as “snow” are served as the data foundation in this study. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of multiangular information to differentiate these pixels over Arctic in various situations. First, we preprocess the POLDER snow database to select the pixels with a good BRDF sampling distribution. Then, the SARI is used to preliminarily classify these POLDER datasets as snow and nonsnow, together with the classification result derived by single-view reflectances as comparison in the red and NIR bands. Next, the classification result is validated by using the MODIS MOD10A2 product. Finally, further analysis of the BRDF variations, regarding the SARI, for the classification results is performed by using the ArcticDEM and the Arctic Vegetation Map, a more detailed snow BRDF database over Arctic is obtained. The main results are as follows: (1) The potential of multiangular information (SARI) in recognizing snow had been confirmed according to MOD10A2 product as indirect validation data, the overall accuracy can reach to 86.9%, higher than the conventional single-view method (81.7%). (2) Within–pixel variations in surface terrain and components have a significant influence on the variability in BRDF shapes in the forward and backward scattering directions; in turn, these variations can be easily captured by using several simple thresholds for subcategorization for this POLDER snow database in Arctic Circle. Finally, this study provides a detailed POLDER database over Arctic and explain BRDF variations in various situations, facilitates the future potential applications of the remote sensing community."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for understanding land–atmosphere interactions, hydrology, and ecological dynamics. While thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has traditionally been used for LST retrieval, its effectiveness is limited by cloud cover and atmospheric interference. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing offers a significant advantage by enabling all-weather LST retrieval, as microwave signals can penetrate clouds and precipitation. However, PMW-based LST observations from a single satellite platform suffer from significant orbital gaps, particularly in middle and low latitudes, due to the limited swath width of current sensors. Additionally, the intraday revisit frequency of PMW LST is constrained to a maximum of two times per day (ascending and descending modes), which is insufficient for capturing rapid diurnal temperature variations or supporting high-temporal-resolution applications.In this study, therefore, we address these limitations by proposing an innovative framework for intraday LST estimation with enhanced spatial coverage. This is achieved by fusing PMW data from two polar-orbiting satellites, Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) and Fengyun-3F (FY-3F), which operate at different equatorial crossing times. A sophisticated gap-filling algorithm is introduced, leveraging temporally adjacent LST estimates from intraday brightness temperature (TB) observations. Results demonstrate that the gap-filled LST from the optimal data fusion scheme exhibits a minimal positive bias of approximately 0.1–0.2 K compared to the original LST retrievals, while achieving an intraday revisit frequency of up to four times per day in middle latitudes. This represents a significant improvement over the pre-gap-filling frequency of 2.5 times per day. The framework not only enhances the spatial coverage of PMW-based LST but also provides a foundation for future satellite missions to further improve global LST monitoring. By enabling all-weather, high-frequency LST observations, this framework advances our understanding of land–atmosphere interactions, supports climate modeling, and enhances environmental monitoring capabilities."

 The centimeter level deformation generated by small and medium-sized earthquakes contains rich information on tectonic activity, which is of great value for improving the coseismic deformation database and fault dynamics models. InSAR is an important means of observing coseismic deformation, but there is a problem of insufficient observation accuracy for centimeter level coseismic deformation in complex environments. Time-series InSAR advances achieve millimeter-scale deformation monitoring, yet detecting subtle coseismic signals from Mw 5.0–6.5 earthquakes remains challenging in complex environments by computational limits and step-like model discontinuities. We develop a method incorporating SBAS-InSAR and a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) step function to overcome these barriers. Simulations based on Sentinel-1 and MintPy demonstrate 15–55 % RMSE reductions (0.08–0.45 cm) in coseismic fields versus conventional DInSAR/Stacking methods. Applied to the 2021 Yangbi Mw5.9 event, our approach reveals: (1) The tanh-based model maintains phase continuity during abrupt deformation and decouples linear tectonic motion. (2) It enhances displacement field accuracy with 18–61 % noise suppression and the reliability of finite fault inversion. The model enables seconds deformation estimation for single earthquakes on standard hardware, advancing detection thresholds to sub-centimeter levels in high-coherence region. These breakthroughs expand InSAR’s capability in small-magnitude earthquake mechanics analysis.

 Forests play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration, and the varying carbon storage capacities of tree species underscore the need for accurate vegetation classification. This study introduces 3D-M2C-ResNet, a deep learning model for high-resolution, fine-scale tree species classification. The model leverages fused remote sensing inputs, combining Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery with phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 time-series data. A Multi-Scale Cascaded Dilated Convolution (MCDC) module was developed to expand the receptive field through a three-branch architecture, enabling comprehensive spectral–spatial feature extraction. Additionally, a Multi-level Feature Enhancement Strategy (MFES) adaptively refines shallow and deep features, enhancing semantic–spatial integration across layers. The model was evaluated against support vector machine (SVM), VGG16, and ResNet50 on a test set of 22,380 pixels. 3D-M2C-ResNet achieved an overall accuracy of 98.08% and a Kappa coefficient of 97.88%, outperforming baseline methods. Ablation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the MCDC and MFES modules.

 The concept of city image plays a pivotal role in urban branding, serving as a strategic tool for promoting sustainable urban development. A city’s image not only shapes its identity but also enhances its global competitiveness, attracting tourism, investment, and new residents. Traditional media such as newspapers and television offer limited perspectives on city image, whereas emerging platforms like short video apps provide richer and more diverse insights. Nevertheless, existing studies remain dominated by traditional media analysis, with insufficient examination of how short video platforms represent the spatial, landscape, social, and emotional dimensions of a city’s image. This study proposed a novel approach by leveraging the diverse and extensive short video data from Douyin to thoroughly deconstruct Shanghai’s comprehensive city image. We constructed a geotagged short video database, categorizing landscape and social images based on visual features and assessing emotional tones through audio-text analysis. The findings revealed distinct spatial patterns, with core areas highly concentrated and peripheral areas more dispersed. The analysis further identified nine core image areas, three major development axes, and ten prominent zones that defined Shanghai’s unique geographic and cultural identity. This approach could provide a quantitative characterization of city image, highlighting the potential for improved public space design and enhanced citizen engagement through short videos. Moreover, these results underscored the significant role of social media platforms, especially short video apps, in shaping public perception of cities. Such insights could also offer new perspectives for city image research and valuable guidance for urban planning and branding strategies."

 Accurate tree species mapping is essential for effective forest management but is often constrained by manual, labour-intensive workflows that limit scalability. While airborne laser scanning (ALS) supports large-scale forest attribute prediction, species classification remains difficult in complex, multi-species forests. To address this, we propose an automated, data-driven dual-stream deep learning framework that integrates ALS data with point-cloud metrics to identify individual tree species. Our framework incorporates an automated approach to individual tree segmentation and species labelling using existing forest inventory and field data, resulting in a dataset of 16,269 labelled individual tree point-clouds of four species across a 630,000 ha boreal mixed species forest in Ontario, Canada. Our dual-stream deep learning model integrates a Point Extractor to generate feature representations from raw ALS point-clouds and a complementary Metrics Network to process the point-cloud metrics. Results, based on the split test set of 2441 trees, showed that the inclusion of the Metrics Network improved tree species classification accuracy by approximately 11 % compared to models that rely solely on the Point Extractor. A weighted F1-score of 0.70 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 was achieved using this dual-stream approach, along with enhanced predictive probabilities for all species thus improving the reliability of the predicted results. This approach reduces the manual processing bottleneck of individual tree segmentation and labelling and demonstrates the value of combining raw point-clouds and point-cloud metrics into a deep learning framework, offering a scalable and operational solution for reliable species predictions."

 Forests are a key element for reaching the EU climate neutrality targets, but natural disturbances, climate change and human activities, make it urgent to set up a continuous monitoring system of the main parameters affecting forest ecosystems. A key parameter is the annual felling: the volume of trees felled during a given reference period.We combine National Forest Inventory data, based on direct field measurements, with yearly time series data derived by remote sensing, to assess the amount of fellings carried out in Italy between 2000 and 2023. Italy was selected as a representative case study as harvest statistics are missing or partially inconsistent, which is also the case for other European countries.We highlighted that no data source, considered individually, can provide a comprehensive estimate of the harvest level and its evolution in time.Between 2000 and 2023, total fellings ranged from a peak of 16.5 million m3 in 2006 to a low of 10.4 million m3 in 2014.A near real-time assessment of the harvest level, such as estimated within our study, is increasingly important to quantify the impact of human activities on forest ecosystems. According to our results, the fellings rate, i.e. the ratio between fellings and increment, was about 0.38 within the latest years. Nevertheless, considering the uncertainty of all input data, the total fellings ranged by about ± 50 %, and the corresponding fellings rate could be significantly larger. From this arises the urgent need to set up a continuous monitoring system, integrating National Forest Inventory surveys and remote sensing data reliably, not only in Italy, but across the EU."

Existing approaches typically treat DEMs as digital grids or triangulated irregular networks, solving numerical fitting problems to densify points through learning models. However, these methods often overlook the spatial context and structural textures inherent in the terrain. To address this limitation, we propose utilizing relative depth maps derived from open-source remote sensing images by a foundational Depth Anything Model (DAM), which provide complementary structural information about the terrain and enhance the elevation details in DEMs. A novel DEMSR dataset, DEM-OPT-Depth SR, is constructed, pairing open-source remote sensing images, DEMs, and their corresponding relative depth maps.

Spatiotemporal data encompasses the locations, states, and interrelationships of objects within specific temporal and spatial contexts. It is characterized by dynamic properties, high dimensionality, and large data volumes, which pose significant challenges for storage, querying, and analysis. To address the challenges associated with managing large-scale spatiotemporal data, geospatial grid subdivision, grid encoding, grid indexing, and grid storage technologies offer essential support and have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. In the past, existing reviews have typically focused on a single aspect, such as the fundamental methods of grid subdivision, the implementation details of encoding and indexing techniques, or solely on spatiotemporal databases. Although these reviews provide in-depth discussions of specific technologies, they lack a systematic analysis of the interrelationships among multiple technical modules, resulting in an inability to fully reveal the collaborative potential between modules.

 Opuntia stricta is a globally widespread invasive species that degrades dryland ecosystems and threatens pastoral livelihoods. Accurate, high-resolution distribution maps are essential for effective management, but its spectral similarity to native vegetation complicates remote sensing-based classification.

 The rapid urbanization of urban riverbank soft ground poses significant geotechnical challenges, particularly in densely populated coastal areas like the Yangtze River Delta. This study employs an enhanced multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) approach to reveal decadal deformation patterns (2015–2024) in soft ground along the Yangtze River in Nanjing, China. Leveraging 275 Sentinel-1 SAR images and improved data processing strategies, we reconstruct the subsidence dynamics and validate them against leveling measurements with an accuracy of 6.5 mm/a. Results reveal that while the overall Nanjing’s urban riverbank remains stable, localized deformations are concentrated in urban riverbank development zones: Jiangbei New Area (JBA) and Hexi New Town (HXT). The highest intensity of development in JBA shows a cumulative settlement of more than 600 mm over ten years. The soft ground deformation is driven by engineering activities, specifically (i) groundwater drawdown during foundation pit dewatering and (ii) consolidation under surcharge loads from riverbank urban infrastructure. The earlier-developed HXT provides a valuable reference for predicting surface deformation trends in JBA. Furthermore, decadal InSAR deformation analyses of critical urban riverbank infrastructure (river-crossing bridges) confirm the effectiveness of bedrock anchoring in mitigating soft ground settlement. Wavelet analyses reveal that temperature fluctuations primarily drive cyclic displacement in the metal truss main spans of the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

First, we propose a systematic geographical factor classification method that categorizes elements into dynamic, static, and categorical factors, enabling standardized integration of heterogeneous data within a unified paradigm. Second, we design a selective encoder module based on Mamba architecture that leverages its linear complexity and scanning mechanism to establish selective state spaces for geographical inputs, revealing intricate associations between diverse feature types. Third, we incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers as intermediate components replacing multilayer perceptron linear layers, enhancing numerical regression accuracy in geographical applications. Experimental validation across three tasks demonstrates Geo-Mamba’s effectiveness: in net ecosystem exchange modeling (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.37 μmol·m–2·s–1), groundwater storage anomaly downscaling (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.916 cm), and land cover classification (accuracy = 88.12 %, F1-Score = 84.27 %). These results confirm Geo-Mamba as an efficient unified framework for complex Earth science modeling, while establishing its viability for geographical data processing and factor integration."

 Recent advancements in hyperspectral satellite technology, including sensors like EnMAP, are promising for monitoring grassland ecosystems at the landscape scale. These developments include detailed vegetation analysis capabilities, crucial for understanding plant traits and species composition. However, technical restrictions of recent hyperspectral satellite missions can hinder comprehensive coverage of research areas resulting in a temporal mismatch of field measurements and satellite data.Here we utilize hyperspectral data from the DESIS, PRISMA, and EnMAP mission, along with field measurements from 74 grassland plots of the German Biodiversity Exploratories in Schorfheide-Chorin and Hainich, collected in May 2020 and 2023. We focus on the impact of different satellite sensors and their acquisition timing grouped within five phenological seasons (early April to August) on the accuracy of biomass and species composition models using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Procrustes randomization tests. Additionally, we are evaluating the effectiveness of two spectral transformations in improving model accuracy and reliability.Our findings reveal significant differences in the relationship of hyperspectral satellite data with grassland biomass and species composition. Even though comparison of DESIS biomass models indicated that sensor data from the beginning of April achieved best results for biomass (R2 = 0.48), sensor data covering the SWIR from late April and June showed slightly better modeling results (EnMAP: R2 = 0.51, PRISMA: R2 = 0.53). Species composition was significantly related to spectral composition, with sensor data from late April showing the strongest relationships. The performance of sensors, including VNIR and VNIR-SWIR, was almost equal (e.g., DESIS: R2 = 0.54, PRISMA: R2 = 0.59). Overall, the results highlight the benefit of SWIR bands for biomass modeling, while their importance was minor in relation to species composition. A trend of improved model performance was observed with mean normalization for EnMAP and PRISMA data, while continuum removal led to a decrease in performance. Our study underscores the critical role of temporal and spectral data selection in improving grassland models, suggesting potential pathways for refining remote sensing approaches in ecological monitoring and management."

 Digital twin systems for transportation are widely regarded as a core technology for enabling full life-cycle management of traffic information and providing intelligent decision support, with the goals of improving traffic efficiency and reducing accident risks. However, existing research primarily focuses on simulation and prediction of traffic flow, lacking a unified framework that integrates static infrastructure, dynamic states, and microscopic behaviors. To address this gap, this paper proposes a lightweight behavior-cognitive architecture for high-definition (HD) maps to support multiscale information representation in transportation digital twin. It consists of three layers: (1) a global road network layer that models transportation infrastructure and static geographic features; (2) a dynamic target layer organizing the real time status and trajectory of traffic participants; (3) a behavioral cognition layer for behavior interpretation and understanding. Based on this architecture, a construction method for transportation digital twin systems is developed and validated through experiments conducted in real-world traffic scenarios and simulation environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high adaptability and accuracy, offering effective support for building digital twin systems in complex traffic environments."

 LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is the foundation of numerous practical applications. Recently, the Mamba, as a promising alternative to Transformer, has been getting intense attention in this field. However, the most of existing Mamba-based methods have to crop the input point clouds into patches, which limits its global modeling ability and hinders its further application in large-scale LiDAR point cloud processing. To this end, we thoroughly investigate the difficulties of Mamba in large-scale LiDAR point cloud learning and resolve this bottleneck by combining Mamba with convolution. Specifically, we introduce convolution as an information propagator to address the long-range collapse issue, which effectively enhances the global modeling ability of Mamba and enables it to handle the large-scale point clouds without patches. Besides, we redesign the bidirectional Mamba and serialization strategy to expand the receptive field of Mamba for point cloud semantic segmentation task. Furthermore, we further investigate the selectivity of Mamba, and exploit Mamba in the down-sampling stage for feature aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on two indoor and two outdoor public point cloud datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art networks."

 Mapping standing dead trees is critical for assessing forest health, monitoring biodiversity, and mitigating wildfire risks, for which aerial imagery has proven useful. However, dense canopy structures, spectral overlaps between living and dead vegetation, and over-segmentation errors limit the reliability of existing methods. This study introduces a hybrid post-processing framework that refines deep learning-based tree segmentation by integrating watershed algorithms with adaptive filtering to enhance instance separation and boundary precision. Leveraging a dual-task learning architecture with a Self-Attention U-Net, the framework simultaneously predicts segmentation masks, centroid heatmaps, and hybrid boundary maps, optimizing for both pixel-level accuracy and instance-level detection. Tested on high-resolution aerial imagery from boreal forests, the framework, compared to the U-Net baseline, improved instance-level segmentation accuracy by 41.5% (Tree IoU of 0.3810 vs. 0.2694) and reduced positional errors by 57% (centroid error of 3.70 pixels vs. 5.10 pixels), demonstrating robust performance in the densely vegetated boreal forest regions tested. By balancing detection accuracy (F1-score of 0.5895) and over-segmentation artifacts, the method enabled the accurate identification of individual dead trees, which is critical for ecological monitoring. The framework’s computational efficiency supports scalable applications, such as wall-to-wall tree mortality mapping over large geographic regions using aerial or satellite imagery.

Subsequently, we focus on decorrelation caused by volume scattering and conduct a sensitivity and application analysis of volume decorrelation with respect to forest and building height, as well as penetration depth in desert and snow-/ice-covered areas. This analysis offers a valuable reference for its application in corresponding specific scenarios.

 Deforestation is gaining increasing importance due to its strong influence on the surrounding environment, especially in developing countries where the population has a disadvantaged economic condition and agriculture is the main source of income. In Ivory Coast, for instance, where the cocoa production is the most remunerative activity, it is not rare to assist the replacement of portions of ancient forests with new cocoa plantations. To monitor this type of deleterious activity, satellites can be employed to recognize the disappearance of the forest. In this study, Forest-Non-Forest map (FNF) has been refined (from 25m/px to 10m/px) to be used as target for models based on Sentinel images input. State-of-the-art models U-Net, Attention U-Net, Segnet and FCN32 are compared over different years, combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and cloud probability to create forest/non-forest segmentation. Although Ivory Coast lacks of local forest coverage datasets and is partially covered by Sentinel images, it is demonstrated the feasibility of creating models classifying forest and non-forest pixels over the area using open datasets to predict where deforestation could have occurred. Although a significant portion of the deforestation research is carried out on visible bands, SAR acquisitions and the cloud probability layer are employed to overcome the limits of RGB images over areas often covered by clouds.

 Extreme flood disasters are intensified by climate change, exposing an increasing share of the global population to flood hazards. Accurate monitoring of inundation extents during floods is crucial for disaster management and impact assessment. While remote sensing can provide strong support for flood monitoring, optical satellite images often face significant challenges due to weather conditions and infrequent revisits, particularly in cloudy and rainy regions. To address this limitation and achieve seamless flood mapping with cloudy satellite images, this paper proposes TerrainFloodSense, a novel method that fuses water occurrence with terrain data to enhance the reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas, especially under extreme and unprecedented flood scenarios. Specifically, TerrainFloodSense first generates enhanced water occurrence data by Bayesian fusion of terrain indices, including Digital Surface Model (DSM) along with Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), and historical water occurrence data. Then, enhanced water occurrence data are used to fill gaps caused by clouds in water maps derived from optical satellite images, guided by the submaximal stability assumption. The basic idea is that prior terrain information can be incorporated into the initial water occurrence data to enhance the ability to predict the inundation probabilities for both regular pre-flood water and extreme floodwater and to help reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas even under extreme flooding scenarios. Simulated experiments and applications in large-area flood mapping cases confirmed that TerrainFloodSense significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements of 2.95%–8.86% in overall accuracy and 0.038–0.087 increases in F1-Score under extreme flooding scenarios.

 Tree decline affects many perennial orchards with potentially heavy impacts on production. In five years 3 % of national production of kiwifruit orchards were lost in France, leading to economic issues and jeopardizing the value chain. Some specific management practices could help to mitigate kiwifruit decline, but rapid and simple tools are needed to assess the development of the decline in response to these practices. As kiwifruit decline is characterized by a low-vigor canopy along with changes in canopy color and density, Sentinel-2 images were used to detect vine decline over large areas. We first selected 28 orchards, with varying characteristics (e.g. row grass cover, hail protection nets, fertilization practices) and characterized each vine (14000 in total) according to its agronomic status (i.e. vigor and presence of decline symptoms). Sentinel-2 images are made up of 10 x 10 m pixels. To classify them we fitted two models using a random forest procedure. The spectral model (SM) used only spectral inputs, while the agronomic and spectral model (ASM) used both spectral inputs from satellite images and agronomic inputs obtained from orchard characteristics. Spectral inputs included raw spectral bands (e.g., red, near-infrared, green) and vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, GNDVI). Results show that vigorous and dead areas were well detected (more than 80 % of correct predictions). Declining areas were correctly detected when patches of decline were larger than 500 m2. Mixed pixels containing vines with different agronomic status were poorly predicted. Accuracy improves when agronomic information, such as soil texture, is incorporated into the model. Both models (SM and ASM) could enable growers to adjust their practices in real time according to the health status of their vines."

 Rainfall measurement inherently contains uncertainty in the accuracy of the collected data. Theoretical terminal velocity models are used to filter drop size distributions (DSDs) collected by measurement devices to remove physically unlikely data. This filtration process decreases the number of drops and further influences the calculation of bulk rain parameters. This study compared the impact of different drop velocity models on the DSD and rain parameter calculations for both natural and artificial rain. A total of ten natural rainfall events were observed with a Parsivel2 disdrometer on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Triangle Park (RTP) campus in Durham, North Carolina, during June–July 2024. In addition, 732 min of artificial rainfall were generated using four nozzles at the U.S. EPA Fluid Modeling Facility (FMF) in Durham, North Carolina. The results showed that for artificial rainfall, the rain rate calculated from the instruments' ‘raw’ DSD data (terminal output %93) was on average 38.73 % higher across four nozzles compared to the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. The rain rate calculated directly from ‘raw’ data more closely matched the volume of water collected in a bin than the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. For natural rainfall, the research found that the investigated terminal velocity models performed similarly. The average reduction in drop count across the six drop velocity models tested was 0.14 %, with the highest reduction observed in the Atlas (1977) model at 0.36 %. For the accumulated DSD of ten rainfall events, the ranking of models by the number of filtered drops, from highest to lowest, was: Atlas (1977) > Uplinger (1981) > Atlas et al. (1973) > Beard (1976) > Van Dijk et al. (2002) > Gunn and Kinzer (1949). In contrast to artificial rain, both rain intensity and kinetic energy measured by Parsivel2 were higher than those calculated from the ‘raw’ DSD, and applying a filter reduced these values. The study also identified the microphysical characteristics of the natural precipitation, with peak values of liquid water content (W) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) observed at 0.6–0.7 g m−3 and 30 dBz, respectively. The average mass-weighted diameter Dm (normalized intercept parameter log10Nw) values for convective, mixed, and stratiform rain were 1.81 mm (5.40), 1.15 mm (4.18), and 1.35 mm (4.53), respectively. Filters had a more pronounced effect on the Dm values compared to the log10Nw values and appeared to have a larger influence on convective rain compared to stratiform rain. The study illustrated how various theoretical terminal drop velocity models used to filter the number of raindrops in a DSD affect the calculation of bulk rain parameters and how they are applicable to natural rainfall but not artificially produced rainfall. This research is valuable for gaining a deeper understanding of precipitation microphysics and improving the accuracy of rainfall assessments."

 Utilizing airborne measurements to investigate the response of microphysics to glaciogenic cloud seeding is instrumental in understanding and evaluating the seeding effect. In this study, the changes in microphysical characteristics of a supercooled liquid cloud induced by aircraft-based cloud seeding is analyzed. The data was collect in North China on Dec. 12, 2023, by using an S-band ground-based weather radar and airborne in-situ measurements. The results show that after cloud seeding, the cloud droplet number concentration and the supercooled liquid water content decreased by 48.5 % and 28.5 %, respectively, while the ice crystal number concentration increased from 0 to 100.8 L−1 on average, leading to a significant broadening of the ice particle spectrum. The ground-based weather radar observed distinct radar echo bands after the cloud seeding was completed. The enhanced radar reflectivity lasted for approximately 30 min before dissipation. A comparative analysis of five previous aircraft-based glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments in the same region revealed that the cloud seeding effect is sensitive to seeding-level temperature, cloud droplet number concentration, and supercooled liquid water content."
