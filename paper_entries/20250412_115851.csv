N-footprint tools offer a valuable method for predicting Nr emissions, helping to identify leakage points across the entire production chain, from farm to plate. This study estimates the N-footprint of an average Danish individual based on population-based consumption patterns. The results indicate an annual N-footprint of 27.5 kg N cap−1 yr−1. Food production and consumption account for 82% of the N-footprint, with agricultural production and consumption at 22.7 Kg N cap−1 yr−1. Goods and services constitute 12% of the footprint (3.2 kg N cap−1 yr−1), followed by transport at 4% (1.1 kg N cap−1 yr−1) and housing at 2% (0.5 kg N cap−1 yr−1). Denmark has implemented extensive environmental policies that have successfully mitigated part of the Nr load to the environment. While top–down regulatory frameworks play a crucial role, this study emphasizes the significance of individual agency in shaping consumption patterns and reducing Nr emissions. A holistic approach to Nr management is essential, integrating stringent regulations with community-driven initiatives. The study highlights three key abatement strategies for Denmark: (1) shifting Danish meat and meat derived consumption (71% of the diet) towards more plant-based alternatives, (2) improving nitrogen use efficiency at the farm gate level and (3) reducing waste and enhancing recycling throughout the entire farm-to-plate supply chain. By combining policy-driven measures with individual actions, Denmark can further mitigate the environmental impact of Nr."

The impact of forest degradation on the forest’s sensitivity to climate extremes has not been fully explored because of a lack of data and the complex interplay of forest structure and climate drivers. Here, we combined forest structure data from 545 airborne lidar transects (375 ha each) across the Brazilian Amazon with the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED2). We explore the forest’s functional response to near-present (1981–2019) climate extremes under observed forest structure from lidar (Control) and two forest structure change scenarios: (1) forest recovery by excluding all future deforestation and degradation (Recovery) and (2) expansion of selective logging and deforestation (Degradation). Using the Control simulation, we found a close and positive association between local forest aboveground biomass and the predicted gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Moreover, both GPP and ET respond negatively to extremes in vapor pressure deficit and downwelling shortwave irradiance in degraded forests in Eastern and Southern Amazon, indicating high sensitivity to droughts. Locally high-biomass forest patches showed little or no negative response of GPP and ET to extreme drought conditions whereas low-biomass forest patches in the same locations—typically degraded forest canopies—responded negatively to higher moisture stress. The results from the Recovery scenario showed similar results to simulations with observed structure; however, under the Degradation scenario, low-biomass forest patches became more abundant, resulting in more regions where GPP and ET are negatively impacted by hot drought conditions according to the ED2 model. Our results suggest that local forest structure is a critical determinant of an ecosystem’s response to climate variability, and that the loss of canopy trees in the Amazon through forest degradation could increase and expand forest vulnerability to droughts."

In this study, we evaluate the influence of decadal-scale climate change on the net primary production (NPP) in the SNP by performing a hindcast experiment for 1979–2016 using an ice–ocean coupled model with a simple biogeochemical model with iron cycle. Simulation results show a significant NPP decrease in the subtropical–subarctic gyre boundary (SGB) region since the 1990s; the trend is −48 mgC m−2 d−1/37 years with a magnitude that is 14.3% of the climatological mean NPP. The NPP decrease in the SGB is prominent during the spring, indicating weakening of the spring bloom. Diagnostic analysis of simulation data reveals that the NPP decrease in the SGB can be explained by the decrease in both dFe and light availability. Sensitivity experiments indicate that wind-driven circulation change mainly explains both the reduction in dFe and the light availability through the northward expansion of oligotrophic subtropical water, but the thermohaline change in the Sea of Okhotsk also has a non-negligible effect on the dFe reduction. Results from our numerical model simulations suggest the importance of lateral and vertical advection of dFe on the decadal-scale changes of NPP in the SNP."

Reliance on rudimentary and inefficient biomass cookstoves results in high pollutant concentrations that adversely affect the health of those exposed to indoor air pollution, the environment, and the climate. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature on aerosol and particle properties from biomass cookstoves of relevance to health, climate and the environment. We identified 187 articles reporting aerosol characterization (i.e. particulate mass or number concentrations, or particle size distributions). Of these, 82 presented detailed particle characterization (e.g. chemical composition), thus selected for further analysis. Articles were classified based on the reported particle properties and the study type and location, which allowed mapping research efforts to date and identifying major knowledge gaps. Most reviewed studies (39 articles) on particle properties reported particulate organic and elemental carbon composition. Despite considerable variability, the EC/TC ratio generally varied in the range of 0.1–0.4 for all cookstove technologies, indicating that organic carbon is the dominating PM fraction in biomass cookstove emissions. Findings from this systematic review highlight the need for further studies on particle properties from biomass cookstoves that use a multidimensional approach simultaneously combining several properties and different cookstove-fuel combinations. We also assessed the policy landscape, including the three main global policies concerning biomass cookstove emissions, and evaluated whether those policies included the state of the knowledge on particle properties and their adverse effects on human health, climate, and the environment. We finally identify key aspects that future policies should integrate, and critical knowledge gaps that must be filled to advance the overall development of the field. Notable was that field studies consistently report particle emission factors (PM2.5) higher than the ones determined under laboratory conditions, for example, an average of 8.9 g/kgfuel (field) compared to 5.2 g/kgfuel (lab) for traditional cookstoves and 4.0 g/kgfuel (field) compared to 1.3 g/kgfuel (lab) for advanced cookstoves. Cookstove manufacturers, practitioners, policymakers, and society in general will benefit from a solid knowledge base regarding particle properties from biomass cookstoves and their related adverse effects on human health, climate, and the environment."

Using an air-sea-wave coupled model, we evaluate changes due to sea spray effects in the simulated intensity and structure of Typhoons Lingling (2019) and Maysak (2020). Enabling sea spray effect enhances surface turbulent heat fluxes considerably around the typhoon centers (74% increase for Lingling, 92% for Maysak), leading to a better representation of typhoon intensification phases. Analysis of thermodynamic processes reveals that sea spray-induced warming emerges before rapid intensification, with enhanced temperature and moisture profiles throughout the troposphere supporting stronger secondary circulation. As a result, key aspects of typhoon prediction exhibit significant improvements: root-mean-squared errors decreased by 63% in minimum central pressure and 60% for maximum wind speed in the case of Maysak. The results demonstrate that sea spray effects are strongly modulated by sub-surface ocean conditions, with a greater surface heat flux enhancement for Maysak that moved along warmer Kuroshio and Tsushima currents than for Lingling which passed over Yellow Sea Bottom Cold Water. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential to improve typhoon predictions in the YECS region by incorporating sea spray effects."

However, gaps exist in our understanding of the responses and feedbacks of the Earth system to the deployment of CDR. In this study, we compare two complementary approaches that enhance the terrestrial and marine carbon sinks with afforestation and reforestation (A/R) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), respectively, under the high emission scenario SSP5-8.5. Eight CMIP6 Earth system models are utilized, enabling a quantification of both inter-model and internal variability. By mid-century, simulated large-scale deployment of A/R and OAE individually reduces atmospheric CO2 concentrations by up to 20 ppm. For both methods, while carbon removal from the atmosphere is robust, it is difficult to detect the effects on global mean temperature, posing challenges for monitoring, reporting and verification of mitigation efforts. To quantify the carbon cycle feedbacks, we define the carbon cycle feedback ratio of A/R (OAE) as the ratio of changes in the marine (terrestrial) sink to changes in the terrestrial (marine) sink. We show that the carbon cycle feedback ratios of A/R and OAE have similar magnitudes, which are −16% and −13%, respectively. Moreover, although inter-model differences of the simulated amounts of carbon removal due to A/R are large, the corresponding carbon cycle feedback ratios of A/R are similar."

As global demand for critical minerals accelerates in association with the energy transition, there is a growing imperative to secure mineral access while improving environmental and social outcomes. However, mining activities face significant resistance worldwide, posing major challenges to the justice and viability of the energy transition. Using an original dataset derived from the GDELT Project between 2015 and 2022, we provide the first systematic global mapping of conflict and cooperation in mining regions, spanning diverse socio-political contexts and offering novel insights into the economic, environmental, and justice-related drivers of these dynamics. Our findings reveal that resistance to mineral extraction is not confined to poorer, emerging economies but is instead widespread, occurring wherever mineral deposits are found, regardless of a country’s income level. This resistance frequently reaches high levels of polarisation, often leading to costly delays and project cancellations. Although cooperation sometimes accompanies conflict, high-commitment cooperative actions are limited and less frequent in highly polarised situations. These insights highlight the need to move beyond traditional Corporate Social Responsibility approaches and existing public participation efforts within Environmental Impact Assessments. A just, sustainable, and democratic transition requires a deeper democratisation of investment decisions through inclusive governance frameworks that tackle the several injustices associated with mineral resource extraction."

Regionally, the association between floods and their driving factors/descriptors is complex. This necessitates a deeper understanding of flood generation to enhance forecasting, modeling, and risk analyses—critical aspects of effective flood management. Thus, to better understand flood generation in India, we investigate the dominant flood-generating descriptors and their relationship with watershed characteristics across central and southern peninsular India using circular statistics. We find that flood generation is primarily influenced by soil moisture and precipitation excess, dominating 89% of the analyzed (231) watersheds. In particular, larger watersheds (>70000 km2) are predominantly influenced by soil moisture, while smaller ones (<16000 km2) are influenced by precipitation. Interestingly, watersheds covering similar areas produce higher flood flows if predominantly influenced by soil moisture. The explicit evaluation suggests a positive influence of antecedent soil moisture (ASM) on flood flows across all watersheds. An attempt to relate the morphological characteristics with flood descriptors reveals a positive (negative) influence of the topographic wetness index (TWI) on annual maximum flows for soil moisture-dominated (precipitation-dominated) watersheds. This indicates that ponding/accumulation is a driving (limiting) factor for soil moisture (precipitation) dominated watersheds. The relative importance of the ASM compared to precipitation decreases when the precipitation intensity (PI) increases, implying exchanges of influence at certain levels of PI. Further exploration could reveal insights into the interplay between ASM and precipitation, crucial for flood magnitude and hazard assessments. Given that flood behavior is significantly influenced by dominant descriptors, it is advisable to adopt a segregated approach in analyzing flood escalation under climate change. In addition, incorporation of dominant flood descriptors into cascade flood modeling is essential for enhancing flood hazard and risk modeling."

Under continued global warming, snow droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense, which likely increases the occurrence of succeeding streamflow droughts. However, we still know little about the rate at which snow droughts propagate to subsequent streamflow droughts, the spatial patterns of these concurrent events, the influence of snow drought characteristics on the occurrence, deficit, and duration of streamflow droughts, and temporal changes in snow drought propagation. To address these research gaps, we developed a novel dynamic bi-directional snow-to-streamflow drought propagation scheme, that resulted in a unique dataset of concurrent snow and streamflow droughts for 207 catchments in Switzerland and Austria. We found that in the period from 1961 to 2020, 18% of the snow droughts propagated to a streamflow drought, and that 21% of the spring/summer streamflow droughts were preceded by a snow drought. Snow-to-streamflow droughts are most common in catchments at high elevations without glaciers and among the snow droughts with the largest deficits and longest durations. In general, snow droughts lead to streamflow droughts with higher deficits, longer durations, and earlier occurrences. In the last six decades, the number of snow droughts has increased, which resulted in a doubling of snow-to-streamflow drought events in 1991–2020 compared to 1961–1990. As snow droughts are expected to further increase due to climate change, the propagation of snow-to-streamflow droughts will likely increase in medium to high elevation catchments and lead to more frequent and intense spring and summer droughts in the Alps."

As the accuracy of surveillance camera-based rain gauges (SRGs) continues to improve, surveillance camera-based rainfall observation networks (SRN) have received increasing attention worldwide. Limited by the availability of surveillance data, there is little investigation into the performance of SRNs. In this study, a simulated SRN construction model is proposed, which employs meteorology and geography research as a priori knowledge and the state-of-the-art achievements of SRG as the basis, bringing the simulated SRNs closer to their practical performance. Regional rainfall observations from SRNs were compared with those from ground gauge network (GRN), real-time and calibrated radars. The experimental results show that (1) SRNs can significantly improve correlation with real-time and calibrated radar observations over GRN; (2) an SRN consisting of 700 SRGs whose estimation accuracy is higher than 80% or 500 SRGs whose estimation is accuracy higher than 90% could achieve a comparable precision performance to that of GRN; (3) as the number of SRGs reaches 900 (the spatial density of SRGs is about 0.47 per km2), the performance of the SRNs tend to be stable. Although increasing the number of cameras helps alleviate the problem of insufficient accuracy of a single SRG during heavy/violent rainfall, excessive cameras may reduce the accuracy due to the inherent measurement errors of SRG. Therefore, developing a robust SRG filtering strategy to find the optimal number of SRGs is essential. Our research provides an important reference for researchers who are holding a sceptical view of the availability of surveillance camera rainfall networks while shedding light on building a new low-cost and high-resolution SRN based on the existing surveillance camera resources."

Ultimately, the structure evolved into the more familiar concentric eyewall (CE). Our findings indicate that the transition from an eccentric to a CE structure in Doksuri (2023) coincided with its preceding weakening stage and subsequent rapid intensification (RI) stage, facilitated by a favorable large-scale environmental context over the South China Sea. Unlike previous observations, this RI involved the simultaneous strengthening of both eyewalls rather than a typical eyewall replacement cycle. Simultaneously, the vortex centers in the upper, middle, and lower troposphere showed counterclockwise rotation and gradually aligned vertically, providing evidence of enhanced tropical cyclone (TC) vortex axisymmetry.

The socio-environmental impacts of resource extraction in the Global South to support the low-carbon energy transition in the Global North represent a significant blind-spot in mainstream North-centric climate mitigation frameworks and discourses of just transition. Scholarship on environmental justice (EJ) offers a conceptual entry into this terrain, helping to unpack the unequal spatial distribution of hazards created by the boom in critical minerals required for ‘clean energy’ initiatives. We first illustrate this problem using the concepts of distributive and procedural (in)justices and empirical work on Indonesia’s nickel extraction and processing sectors which are growing to feed a corresponding global rise in electric vehicles. Secondly, we draw on fieldwork with communities in Morowali and Weda Bay region of Indonesia to examine ways communities negotiate justice and adapt to live under extractivism. We propose a justice concept that is centred on the lived experiences of communities, that goes beyond the binary frameworks of ‘community resistance versus compliance’ in the EJ literature."

Despite fire being a known disturbance agent in this ecosystem, little is known about the frequency and trends in these high-elevation landscapes. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a novel burned area database, the Paramo Fire Atlas, spanning from 1985 to 2022 at 30 m resolution, quantifying the fire’s impacts on the Paramo ecosystem across Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. Using the complete Landsat archive, our database reveals that approximately 6370 km2 has been affected by fires over 37 years, representing 15% of the total paramo area. Comparing these findings with estimates from the widely used MODIS MCD64 burned area product, we found that MODIS detected only 989 km2 of burned area. This represents only one-fourth of the burned area detected by the Paramo Fire Atlas. This significant underestimation by MODIS underscores the limitations of existing data sources in assessing the fire impacts of this complex ecosystem. Contrary to the prevailing notion of increasing fire frequency, our analysis shows a significant decrease in burnt areas across the Colombia paramos, contrasting with heterogeneous trends observed in Ecuador and Peru and a recent peak in fire occurrence in Venezuela. While fires have largely disappeared from certain paramos, others exhibit varying degrees of change. These findings raise important questions about the role of fire disturbances in shaping the ecological functioning of the paramo and the future dynamics of fire in the paramo ecosystem under ongoing global climate change and socio-economical dynamics."

At the local scale, climate regulating functions are co-determined by land cover composition and configuration, i.e. the proportions and the spatial arrangement of land cover types. However, research on the relationship between LULCC and climate often focuses individually either on compositional or configurational aspects. As a result, there is a gap in our knowledge about the spatiotemporal distribution of land cover composition and configuration patterns influencing the local climate regulating functions. Here, we used a range of LULCC metrics between 1992 and 2015 and applied Self-Organizing Maps to characterize dominant land cover composition and configuration trajectories in Europe. We then tested the climate relevance of the five most dominant trajectories with a high-resolution regional climate model. Land cover composition and configuration simultaneously changed in more than 20% of the European landmass, with cropland transition to forest patches and bare soil representing the major trajectory. Climate model simulations predict a general increase in the topsoil temperature due to only changes in land cover composition and configuration. All trajectories showed increasing topsoil temperature variability during the crop growing season, with forest transition trajectories showing a greater increase. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of changes in both land cover composition and configuration for the local climate and warrant further empirical and model-based research with an explicit focus on quantifying the effects of simultaneous changes in both these LULCC dimensions."

The extent and spatial distribution of AR differ substantially between the CMIP6 models ranging from −197 to 363 Mha of tree cover change by 2100 in the low-emission scenario SSP1-2.6 that has the highest AR among all future scenarios. The variability in simulated tree cover distributions, in combination with different representations of the carbon cycle, causes a high uncertainty in future land carbon uptake. Here, we disentangle the input information used to represent AR by CMIP6 models and differences in the carbon uptake process to explain the variable simulated potential of carbon sequestration due to AR. We provide recommendations on how AR might be implemented more consistently in future model intercomparison studies, especially regarding more consistent tree cover input (e.g. aligning present-day tree cover, consistent transition between land use and land cover types), and carbon-cycle-related processes (e.g. nitrogen cycle and disturbances). Adoption of these recommendations would increase the relevance of ESMs in terms of providing more accurate estimates of future land carbon uptake through AR."

Here, the toxicity of CB to phytoplankton (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) was evaluated; upon exposure, the median effective concentration for 72 h was 23.4 mg/L. CB underwent significant photooxidation during 15 days of light irradiation, although phototransformation was generally completed by day 7. Algal growth inhibition induced by phototransformed CB (TCB) at 1 mg/L was 64.1% greater than that induced by parent CB. Mechanistically, 1) phototransformation triggered the release of highly toxic byproducts, which inhibited algal growth by 18.9%; 2) metabolomic results demonstrate that the suppression of carbon and nitrogen assimilation in algal cells induced by TCB was 13.2–53.7% greater than that induced by CB; 3) TCB exhibited reactive oxygen species production ability, which triggered more significant algal membrane damage. A full-factorial experiment (26+1 runs) showed that the combined effect of temperature and suspended mineral particles, as well as electrical conductivity, was the primary environmental factor that mediated CB and TCB toxicity, respectively. The predicted toxicity of CB and TCB in Taihu Lake exhibited significant regional distribution, and TCB posed a greater environmental risk in aquatic ecosystems than CB.

However, recent studies reveal inhibitory effects, sparking debates about their overall impact. We hypothesized that the physical contact between bacteria and carbon is an overlooked yet critical factor in determining whether carbon promotes or inhibits microbial Fe(III) reduction. Using systems containing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, activated carbon, and ferrihydrite, we investigated how carbon–iron oxide aggregate structure affects Fe(III) reduction kinetics. At low activated carbon-to-iron oxide ratios (C/Fe = 5:7 by mass), ferrihydrite aggregated with carbon, forming carbon-encapsulated particles that suppressed Fe(III) reduction rates. Conversely, at higher ratios (C/Fe = 100:7), the ferrihydrite dispersed on the carbon surface, enhancing both the rate and extent of Fe(III) reduction. Tests with 11 different carbonaceous materials (activated carbon and biochar) all confirmed that the microstructure of iron oxides─whether encapsulating or dispersed─on carbon surfaces is critical for determining Fe(III) reduction rates. This insight resolves the debate on whether carbonaceous materials promote or inhibit Fe(III) mineral reduction and enhances our understanding of their roles in biogeochemical processes and environmental remediation."

However, the distinctions between the properties of Fe(V) and Fe(IV) remain poorly understood due to the challenges of distinguishing them. Herein, using pyrophosphate as a model ligand, we comprehensively investigated the influence of oxo-ligands on the reactivity of high-valent iron(VI, V, IV) species. An innovative strategy to selectively generate Fe(IV) using the Fe(VI)-initiated system was proposed, enabling an in-depth investigation of the interaction between Fe(IV) and pyrophosphate. The results reveal that pyrophosphate strongly inhibits Fe(V) oxidation, while it has minimal impact on the reactivity of Fe(VI) and Fe(IV). Based on ligand field theory, pyrophosphate complexation can induce iron 3d orbital resplitting, leading to spin electron rearrangement. Specifically, the hexa-coordinated Fe(V)-oxo complex ligated by pyrophosphate exhibits higher orbital energy, reducing its stability and effective collisions with contaminants, whereas, the potential Jahn–Teller distortion of the Fe(IV)-oxo complex could enhance its stability and preserve its significant reactivity. Given its selective inhibition of Fe(V) oxidation, pyrophosphate can emerge as a promising targeted quenching agent for Fe(V) species.

However, observational data inherently exhibit spatiotemporal gaps, and high costs and equipment requirements further exacerbate these limitations, particularly for in situ measurements. While particle-resolved models can simulate individual particle composition and size changes and serve as benchmarks, they face challenges in real-world applications due to a combination of factors. One of the major challenges is the limited availability of detailed input data (e.g., emission inventories) that accurately reflect actual environmental conditions. In this study, we frame the emulation of aerosol simulation as a general task and treat the estimation of real-world mixing states as a downstream task. We developed a foundation model pretrained on particle-resolved simulations and fine-tuned it using observational data from the field campaign. The fine-tuned model consistently outperformed baseline models, showing greater stability and robustness across various data sets.

Solving modified mixing equations that account for respiration reveals that less than 50% of the oxygen changes along mode water ventilation pathways are due to respiration within the water mass, the rest being due to mixing with oxygen‐poorer surrounding waters. Consequently, measured changes in oxygen or Apparent Oxygen Utilization overestimate respiration by a factor of up to two, as do derived biogeochemical quantities such as remineralized carbon. Measured nitrate changes either overestimate or underestimate remineralization depending on surrounding concentrations. Mean true respiration rates in mode waters range from −0.1 to −0.4 μ ${\upmu }$mol kg−1yr−1 ${\text{kg}}^{-1}{\text{yr}}^{-1}$.

The associated severe snowfall can cause adverse effects on the social, economic, and ecological well‐being in the affected areas. Therefore, understanding the changes of JPCZ and its associated snowfall under warmer climate conditions is of high importance. In the present study, pseudo global warming (PGW) experiments, considering the 2050s under SSP5‐8.5 scenario, were carried out to evaluate these thermodynamic and dynamic changes. The amount of PGW experiment‐simulated snowfall in 13 historical cases during 2015–2024 were in good agreement with ground observations. Warmer climate conditions can potentially reduce the amount of heavy snowfall as statistically supported by the t test, though increase the rainfall mainly due to the shift in hydrometeors in the convective zone. On the other hand, total precipitation does not significantly change, likely due to almost no changes in the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes. Further, dynamic changes are not significant as the position of the convergence zone seems not to be different between PGW and historical climate, though local shifts in the convergence zone were simulated probably due to the changes in the geopotential fields and perturbed wind velocity in the lateral boundary. Our study shows that thermodynamic changes of the JPCZ can be significant, and it has the potential to change the ratio of snowfall within the total precipitation from 57.7% under historical condition to 34.7% under warmer climates."

Given the common issue of cloud cover contamination in optical remote sensing, microwave remote sensing is explored as a viable alternative due to its ability to penetrate clouds. Our approach is substantiated with in situ GPP measurements from 18 eddy covariance flux sites and comparative analysis against four satellite‐derived GPP products. At a daily scale, EDVI‐GPP demonstrated proficiency in capturing day‐to‐day variations of GPP on a regional scale, exhibiting a strong correlation with in situ measurements. When extended to an 8‐day temporal resolution, EDVI‐GPP correlations (R2 = 0.51) are comparable to MODIS‐GPP (R2 = 0.59), FLUXCOM‐GPP (R2 = 0.66), GLASS‐GPP (R2 = 0.53), and VODCA2‐GPP (R2 = 0.13), with a reduced bias of −0.84 gC/m2/day. Notably, under moderate to heavy cloud cover, the method maintained superior performance, suggesting resilience to cloud interference. On a regional scale, EDVI‐GPP exhibited spatial consistency and high spatiotemporal correlation with the compared GPP products (R = 0.69–0.83). Such robust correlations lay the groundwork for the method's application across broader geographical extents. The annual averaged EDVI‐GPP of China was 6.00 Pg C yr−1, which was in close agreement with other published estimates and thereby supported China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives.

The initial mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that seeded both disturbances formed near the Panama Bight and developed into EWs near the Papagayo jet exit region. In the MCS stage, both disturbances were characterized by top‐heavy vertical motions and midlevel vorticity near the maximum vorticity center. The deep convection caused strong latent heating and eddy available potential energy (EAPE) generation and conversion to eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the upper levels. When the disturbances moved to the south of the Papagayo jet, they interacted with the low‐level shear vorticity there, enhancing low‐level stretching and vorticity. Subsequently, the top‐heavy upward motion intensified and led to enhanced stretching and vorticity intensification at midlevels. The enhanced stretching on the southwest side also favored the formation of southwest‐northeast tilted vorticity at midlevels that characterizes EWs. After the EWs formed near the jet exit, the vertical motion weakened and became more bottom‐heavy, with the maximum vorticity shifting to lower levels. This change in the vertical motion profile near the jet exit region is likely modulated by the lower sea surface temperature, reduced moisture, and weaker convective instability. While EAPE‐to‐EKE conversion weakened during this period, the low‐level barotropic conversion of EKE in the jet exit served as the primary energy source for the EWs."

 Grafting is an agricultural technique that joins tissues from different plants to obtain useful rootstock traits. However, cellular processes involved in joint tissue repair remain poorly understood. We analyzed Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) and Arabidopsis thaliana (At) interfamily heterografting as a high-stress model and At homografting as a low-stress model. Transmission electron micrographs reveal the formation of autophagic structures in cells near the graft boundary over a long period in Nb/At interfamily grafts and in a short period of a few days in At homografts. Using a GFP-ATG8 marker line, the autophagosomes were observed in the cells near the graft boundary, especially on the scion side, where nutrient depletion occurred. Grafting of At autophagy-defective mutants decreases grafting success rates and post-grafting growth. NbATG5 knockdown suppresses graft establishment in Nb/At interfamily heterografts. Moreover, At autophagy-defective mutants show reduced callus formation directed to wounds under the nutrient-deficient conditions.

In addition, early optic nerve axonal injury and retinal ganglion cell oxidative stress, but not loss of post-synaptic density protein 95, are ameliorated by selective deletion of C3 in myeloid cells. These data suggest that in addition to C3b opsonization of post synaptic proteins leading to neuronal demise, C3 activation is a contributor to reactive glia in the optic nerve. Excessive complement C3 causes synaptic stripping and neurodegeneration. Here, the authors used the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis and single-cell RNA sequencing to show that C3 expression defines disease-associated reactive glia. C3 deletion abrogated these pro-inflammatory glia and protected neurons."

 When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency f, the most sensitive detector counts single quanta of energy hf. Single photon detectors have been demonstrated from γ-rays to infrared wavelengths, with ongoing efforts to extend their range to microwaves.

Here an optimized current collector interphase enables unprecedented cyclability and energy density. 
 Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, their widespread application is hindered by the low energy density and high cost of hard carbon anodes. Anode-free designs offer a potential solution but typically suffer from poor cycling performance due to uncontrolled Na plating and inefficient stripping. Here we report a hard-carbon-derived interphase on an aluminium current collector to construct an anode-less sodium battery (ALSB) that maintains high energy density, reduces costs and enhances cycling stability. Remarkably, the interphase layer with a low dielectric constant and strong Na interaction enables homogeneous Na nucleation, crack-free plating and efficient stripping, thereby minimizing active Na loss during cycling. As a result, our ALSB maintains good stability for up to 900 cycles and 2.3-Ah-level ALSBs show an energy density of 203 Wh kg−1. Our findings pave the way for more sustainable batteries with competitive energy density, extended cycle life and lower costs.

 Fluid-flux melting is increasingly recognised as a key mechanism for continental crust growth and recycling, but the abundance and sources of the external fluids involved in this process are typically uncertain. Here we use zircon and garnet oxygen isotope data, geochronology, and petrological analysis of mid- to lower-crustal rocks from the Georgetown Inlier, Australia, to explore the composition and origin of anatexis-triggering fluids. Tonalite veins and garnetite residues show higher zircon δ18O values (~6‰) than their amphibolite source (~2–3‰), whereas sediment-derived granites show lower values (6‰) than those of typical siliciclastic sources (10–20‰). Mass balance modelling suggests that these isotopic shifts result from the interaction with mantle-derived fluids. Asthenospheric mantle upwelling beneath the Georgetown crust during slab rollback or break-off provided heat and fluids, generating hydrous mafic underplates that exsolved mantle-derived water, promoting crustal anatexis. This process may have been key in shaping Earth’s early buoyant sodic continental crust.

 Remotely-sensed vegetation greenness exhibits obvious differences before and after the short-term heavy rainfall event. This short communication reports that residual water film on the canopy caused by precipitation directly affects the spectral signal of vegetation, which in turn biases observed vegetation greenness. We combined ground measurements, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measurements, three-dimensional radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations, and satellite observations to assess this phenomenon and investigate the impact of water film on vegetation indices (VIs) across different scales and vegetation types. Our findings demonstrate that precipitation exerts a quick and significant influence on the spectral characteristics of canopy components. The presence of water can lead to reflectance attenuation in soil and vegetation components across the entire visible and infrared spectrum, particularly in the near-infrared (NIR) band, with reductions of up to 0.12. The reduction in VI measures after precipitation can be explained by an imbalance in the magnitude of visible and NIR reflectance attenuation caused by the canopy water film. Taking the difference vegetation index (DVI) as an example, the decrease in NIR reflectance is more pronounced than that of red reflectance in the presence of water, resulting in DVI decreasing after a rainfall event. Satellite observations indicated that NDVI and EVI could decrease even exceeding 0.3 in some pixels after short-term rainfall. This work reveals the water film as a possible factor contributing to the bias between true and observed vegetation greenness. The spatial distribution of rainfall seasonality exhibits variation across different regions worldwide, and mitigating the impact of water film on vegetation greenness is essential for enhancing the precision and reliability of global vegetation dynamics monitoring."

 Satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) offer a promising approach for monitoring plant heat and water stresses across spatial scales. Most studies have focused on seasonal responses of satellite-observed SIF and its physiological component, fluorescence efficiency (Φf), to heat and water stresses. However, their diurnal responses remain poorly understood. Besides, polar-orbiting satellites typically use a daily correction factor to upscale fixed-time SIF observations into daily averages (SIFdaily). Given the diurnal SIF variations, the reliability of this approach under stress conditions is uncertain. In this study, we used the ratio of SIF to near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRvR) as a a linear approximation of Φf. Then, we applied the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to model hourly observations of summer (June–August) SIF and Φf from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) data. Our modeling was constrained to mainland China from 2019 to 2022. We calculated anomalies in SIF and Φf at different times of the day and conducted linear regressions on them with daily air temperature or soil moisture anomalies. Our results showed that the responses of SIF and Φf to stresses varied significantly with time of day and vegetation type. On days experiencing high water and heat stresses, morning and afternoon SIF exhibited weaker declines than midday. In contrast, morning Φf generally exhibited stronger increases than midday, whereas afternoon Φf showed weaker increases. Such diurnal differences in SIF and Φf responses were more pronounced in forests than in grasslands and intensified with rising water and heat stress levels. Additionally, we found that morning polar-orbiting satellite SIF observations tended to overestimate SIFdaily changes, whereas midday observations tended to underestimate them. These biases also intensified with rising stress levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of diurnal satellite SIF observations in deepening our understanding of plant responses to water and heat stress, as well as in improving the monitoring of plant stresses."

 Under global warming, the Yellow River Basin (YRB), serving as an ecological barrier and climate-sensitive region in northern China, faces severe challenges such as frequent extreme droughts and floods, as well as intensifying water resource supply–demand conflicts. To systematically assess the evolution of droughts and floods in the YRB, this study utilizes observational data from 137 meteorological stations and CMIP6 scenario models, employing the dual-index system of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to quantitatively analyze historical drought and flood characteristics, and project future trends under different scenarios. The results indicate that both SPI and SPEI effectively identify drought and flood events, with SPEI demonstrating superior sensitivity to extreme droughts and floods due to its integration of evapotranspiration effects. From 1956 to 2020, the basin’s drought index increased at a rate of 0.003–0.025 per decade, while the flood index changed at a rate of −0.006–0.039 per decade. Droughts were frequent in the middle and upper reaches (30.61 % severe droughts), while flood risks were prominent in the lower reaches (6.25 % extreme floods). Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, drought-dominated patterns intensified (severe droughts reaching 62.92 %), and extreme floods showed an increasing trend in the middle and lower reaches. Therefore, the middle and upper reaches should prioritize building drought-resilience systems; the southern and lower reaches should enhance flood-defense infrastructure. Reservoir operations should be optimized using 1–6 months of drought and flood warnings and coupled with groundwater replenishment strategies for 12–24 months of drought cycles."

 Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an important hydrological variable for agricultural planning and water resources management. The Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 4 (SMAP L4) data demonstrates great value in RZSM estimation. Accurate sub-seasonal RZSM prediction based on SMAP L4 holds great significance for agricultural management and drought assessment. Current deep learning-based RZSM prediction models tend to accumulate error in long-term forecasting and the limited SMAP RZSM samples may result in insufficient model generalization. To address these issues, this study proposes a multi-head self-attention-based autoregressive transfer learning model based on long short-term memory (MAATL) model for sub-seasonal RZSM prediction. The proposed MAATL model is evaluated over the Continental United States (CONUS) for 1- to 60-day RZSM prediction and compared with some ablation and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The results showed that compared with LSTM, the skills of the MAATL model were significantly improved, with an average correlation coefficient increase of 18.26% and a root mean square error (RMSE) reduction of 42.55%. Furthermore, 118 in-situ soil moisture stations are used for predictive validation and the proposed MAATL model demonstrates higher accuracy compared to the Global Forecast System (GFS) and the LSTM model, with an average correlation skill improvement of 16.02% and 15.08% for MAATL over GFS and LSTM, respectively. These findings indicate superior performance for the proposed MAATL model in sub-seasonal RZSM prediction, which has great potential for agricultural drought preparations."

 High-resolution land cover (LC) data are essential for ecological monitoring and resource management, especially in heterogeneous landscapes containing diverse LC types. With the growing of available LC products, a comprehensive evaluation of their classification accuracy and spatial consistency is important for users’ selection and application. In this study, we compared eight widely used LC products in China, including ESA World Cover (ESA20), ESRI GLC10 (ESRI17, ESRI20), FROM-GLC10 (FROM-GLC17), CLCD (CLCD20), GlobeLand30 (GLB20), GLC_FCS30 (GLC_FCS20), and GLC_FCSD30 (GLC_FCSD20), to examine their performances at both national and regional scales. We employed pixel-wise overlay analysis, visually interpreted validation samples, and classical landscape metrics to assess overall consistency and classification accuracy. The results show that the 30m_combination (CLCD20, GLB20, GLC_FCS20, and GLC_FCSD20) exhibits higher overall consistency at the national scale, with perfect consistency exceeding 60 %. In contrast, the 10m_combination (ESA20, ESRI17, ESRI20, and FROM_GLC17) captures finer regional details but displays greater inconsistencies in central and western regions. ESA20 achieves the highest overall accuracy (OA) at 88.5 % (CI: 88.44 %–88.56 %), while FROM_GLC17 records the lowest at 82.79 % (CI: 82.73 %–82.85 %). Cropland, forest, water, and snow/ice demonstrate higher consistency and classification accuracy (F1-scores > 80 %), whereas wetland, grassland, impervious surfaces, and bare land underperform in fragmented regions. Furthermore, spatial consistency is strongly associated with landscape metrics such as the aggregation index (AI) and contagion (CONTAG), which enhance consistency in large, contiguous patches (e.g., Northeast China Plain). Conversely, edge density (ED) and patch density (PD) show negative associations with consistency, highlighting persistent mapping challenges in fragmented regions (e.g., Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau). These findings offer actionable insights for improving LC mapping in complex terrains and underscore the critical role of landscape metrics in advancing ecological monitoring and resource management."

 Reservoirs play a significant role in the mobilization of water resources in Burkina Faso, contributing to the management and availability of water for various purposes. Operational management of reservoirs requires accurate and timely water level information, which remote sensing can provide cost-effectively and with limited resources. In this study, the surface area of 20 reservoirs is first determined using a Random Forest classifier and Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2015 and 2022. The accuracy of the classified surface water areas is evaluated by calculating 5 accuracy assessment metrics. The classifications were validated using manually digitized water areas from high-resolution Google Earth images and compared to the Dynamic World (DW) land cover dataset. Afterward, the spatial variation in the areal extent of the reservoirs is analyzed over time. A linear relationship is established between the estimated surface area and the corresponding observed water level of the reservoirs. The results indicate that reservoir surface areas were accurately classified with Sentinel-2 images (Kappa above 90.35%) for all dates. Moreover, validation with high-resolution images provided an R2 of 0.99 and a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 3.53%. Smaller reservoirs exhibit significant variations in surface areas over time as compared to larger ones, which are more stable. The relationship between surface area and water level is satisfactory (R2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.97) for 14 of the 20 analyzed reservoirs. The remaining six reservoirs are affected by aquatic plant intrusion which leads to an underestimation of the surface area. The high accuracy and operational feasibility of the proposed approach demonstrate that Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning techniques can be recommended for reservoir mapping within the framework of water level monitoring in Burkina Faso."

 Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for effective water resource management, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. Advancements in remote sensing technology have made ET models indispensable, offering high-resolution spatial and temporal assessments. Contextual models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) are particularly valuable for ET estimation. However, one major challenge for these models is the identification of endmembers representing the wet and dry extremes within the AOI. Furthermore, the influence of AOI size on endmember selection raises important considerations for model performance. This work examines how the size of the AOI and endmember selection impact heat flux estimation using the SEBAL model. The research was conducted in an olive orchard at the Agdal site in Marrakech, from May 2022 to April 2023, and at a rainfed wheat field at the Sidi Rehal site from August 2017 to March 2019, using Landsat imagery (L8 and L9) and ERA5 land reanalysis data. For that, SEBAL was applied to six different AOI, ranging from small and homogeneous areas to the full extent of the Landsat imagery. Based on comparisons of SEBAL estimates with eddy covariance data collected from the Agdal site, the analysis shows that difficulties in accurately identifying endmembers are influenced by the size of the AOI. For homogeneous areas, the model struggles to capture the full range of heat fluxes, leading to poor regression relationships. Conversely, applying a shapefile that covers the entire Landsat imagery led to a more uniform distribution of latent heat flux, especially in winter/spring (when the climatic demand is low), which reduced the model’s ability to capture spatial variability. The AOI, which includes a mix of agricultural areas, bare soil, water bodies, and small towns, and whose boundary is relatively close to the measurement station, yielded the best results.

 Timely monitoring of crop conditions is essential for optimizing and assessing agricultural management. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from remote sensing data can be useful for assessing crop conditions on a large spatial scale. Traditional crop condition assessments compare a VI in the current year to a baseline VI, averaged over multiple years. However, comparing VIs across years by calendar day may not capture the general crop condition at the same development stage due to interannual variability in planting date and weather. This study proposes a phenological alignment approach for assessing differences in corn and soybean crop condition at commensurate growth stages rather than by day of year. The analysis was conducted in central Iowa, U.S. from 2018 to 2023, which included periods of drought and excess rainfall, providing a high interannual variability in crop phenology and condition. Weekly crop condition and seasonal yield data reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were compared with aggregated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) anomalies to evaluate relationships both spatially and temporally. Three EVI2 anomaly time series were computed with temporal alignment based on: day of the year (DOY), days after emergence (DAE), and accumulated growing degree day (AGDD), with a scaled time axis aligned at the emergence date. For the DAE- and AGDD-aligned EVI2 time series, emergence date was determined using a within-season emergence detection approach based on remote sensing. Results showed that EVI2 anomalies perform well in crop condition assessment at 30-m resolution, and correlations improved with DAE and AGDD corrections to the EVI2 time series, reducing the effects of yearly differences in crop phenology. The proposed method has potential for improving within-season crop condition monitoring and yield prediction."

 The wave phenomena in SAR images are able to provide water depth information. SAR ocean images are often characterized by unclear wave texture and strong speckle noise, which will hinder the bathymetric inversion. Denoising and texture enhancement are two strategies to improve image quality. However, noise reduction may blur textures, while texture enhancement may amplify noise. To address this, we propose a wave texture enhancement method to balance noise reduction and texture preservation. First, an adaptive total variation bounded Hessian method removes noises from SAR ocean images while preserving texture. Next, an improved Frankle-McCann Retinex method enhances ocean wave features in the denoised image without adding noises. Finally, the resulting image is used for wave-based bathymetric inversion experiments conducted at Car Nicobar Island, Chowra Island, and Dongdao Island, covering depths up to 40 m. The proposed method improved bathymetric accuracy, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) by up to 4.69 m and mean relative error (MRE) by up to 18 %. In addition, the proposed method has a positive effect on the estimation of wavelength and period parameters. Experimental results show that blurred ocean surfaces in SAR images significantly affect bathymetric inversion. Thus, wave enhancement is an important step prior to performing bathymetric inversion."

 Precipitation is an essential component of the water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in cold seasons. Investigating the impacts of various terrain resolutions in simulations on the precipitation distribution and rain-snow phase transition on the TP helps to understand the sources of simulation error and contributes to assessment and improvement. In this study, three types of terrain resolutions were used to conduct simulation experiments (namely WRF30s, WRF2m and WRF5m) on a large-scale extreme precipitation process over the TP under the influence of a storm over the Bay of Bengal in October 2008 near the Himalayas and the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, which serve as representative regions influenced by northward moisture. The results indicate that the terrain resolutions affect the precipitation amount and phase distribution. On the north of the Himalayas, a snowfall-dominated “phase bias” based on “wet bias” is observed above 3 km, which strengthens as the terrain resolution reduces, relating to the stronger water vapor flux transport and larger cold bias resulting from the terrain smoothing. The Bomi station, which is located in the canyon, undergoing a snow-to-rain phase transition influenced by the storm received further attention. The study not only shows the cloud microphysical characteristics of the precipitation on the TP under the influence of storms, but further reveals the snow melting phase transition weakening, manifested as the increase of snowfall accompanied by the decrease of terrain resolution. Further detailed analysis of cloud microphysical process in Bomi shows that the latter is related to the decrease melting rates of snow and graupel caused by the compression of the melting layer when the terrain near canyon increases with terrain resolution decrease. Consequently, the distribution and phase transition of precipitation on the TP induced by terrain resolutions requires attention during the simulation."

After decades of studies, Rayleigh scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency,Γ∝ωd+1, became generally accepted. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. It is unclear how to define glass defects. Here, we use a particle level contribution to sound damping to determine areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas, which allows us to define defects. Over a range of stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultrastable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine forces that arise after macroscopic deformation. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses, one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a different paradigm of sound damping in glasses."

Here, we show that female sex is a risk factor for worsened outcomes in a model of retinal degeneration and that this susceptibility is caused by the presence of female-specific sex hormones. The adverse effect of female sex hormones was specific to diseased retinal neurons, and depletion of these hormones ameliorated this phenotypic effect, while reintroduction worsened rates of disease in females. Transcriptional analysis of retinas showed significant differences between genes involved in pyroptosis, inflammatory responses, and endoplasmic reticulum stress–induced apoptosis between males and females with retinal degeneration. These findings provide crucial insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and how sex hormones can affect disease severity.

Our results demonstrate that these plasmas spontaneously generate coherent linearly polarized radiation in a wide range of parameters via the electron cyclotron maser instability, with radiative losses altering the saturation mechanism. Thus, the plasma continuously amplify coherent radiation for substantially longer durations of time.

However, robust methods and analysis guidelines, vital to address the complexity of metabolomic data, remain to be established. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing and metabolomic data from two independent studies to compare different approaches. We adopted three popular data transformation methods for metabolite levels—(i) log10transformation, (ii) rank inverse normal transformation, and (iii) a fully adjusted two-step procedure—and compared population-based versus family-based analysis approaches. For validation, we performed permutation-based testing, Huber regression, and independent replication analysis. Simulation studies were used to illustrate the observed differences between data transformations. We demonstrate the advantages and limitations of popular analytic strategies used in mGWASs where especially low-frequency variants in combination with a skewed metabolite measurement distribution can lead to potentially false-positive metQTL findings. We recommend the rank inverse normal transformation or robust test statistics such as in family-based association tests as reliable approaches for mGWASs."

Telomere biology disorders (TBDs) such as dyskeratosis congenita (DC) are rare, inherited diseases with known mutations in at least 16 different genes encoding components of the telomere maintenance complexes. The precise role of TEN1, part of the CST complex (CTC1, STN1, and TEN1), and the consequences of its loss of function in vivo are not yet known. We investigated the first viable murine model ofTen1deficiency created by CRISPR-Cas9–mediated exon 3 deletion.Ten1homozygous knockout mice present with telomere attrition, short life span, skin hyperpigmentation, aplastic anemia, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Molecular analyses revealed a reduction of proliferating cells, increased apoptosis, and stem cell depletion with activation of the p53/p21 signaling pathway. Our data demonstrate that Ten1 deficiency causes telomere shortening and associates with accelerated aging."

Here, we design and synthesize a compound of TPA2PyBu that kills both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with an undetectably low drug resistance. Comprehensive analyses reveal that the antimicrobial activity of TPA2PyBu proceeds via a unique dual mechanism by damaging bacterial membrane integrity and inducing DNA aggregation. TPA2PyBu could provide imaging specificity that differentiates bacterial infection from inflammation and cancer. High in vivo treatment efficacy of TPA2PyBu was achieved in methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureusinfection mouse models. This promising antimicrobial agent suggests that combining multiple mechanisms of action into a single molecule can be an effective approach to address challenging bacterial infections."

Yet, there remain critical areas for improvements of these vaccines in durability and breadth of humoral responses. In this work, we explore a modular strategy to target mRNA/LNPs to antigen-presenting cells with an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel technology, which recruits key immune cells and forms an immunological niche in vivo. We characterize this niche on a single-cell level and find it is highly tunable through incorporation of adjuvants like MPLAs and 3M-052. Delivering commercially available severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mRNA vaccines in PNP hydrogels improves the durability and quality of germinal center reactions, and the magnitude, breadth, and durability of humoral responses. The tunable immune niche formed within PNP hydrogels effectively skews immune responses based on encapsulated adjuvants, creating opportunities to precisely modulate mRNA/LNP vaccines for various indications from infectious diseases to cancers."

Furthermore, resistance fatigue in current silicon-based integration remains a critical issue. Understanding this fatigue mechanism in semiconductor-integrated FTJ is essential yet unresolved. Here, we systematically investigate the fatigue performance of ultrathin bismuth ferrite BiFeO3(BFO)–based FTJs integrated with various semiconductors. Notably, the BFO/gallium arsenide FTJ exhibits superior fatigue resistance characteristics (>108cycles), surpassing the BFO/silicon FTJ (>106cycles) and even approaching epitaxial oxide FTJs (>109cycles). The atomic-scale fatigue mechanism is revealed as lattice structure collapse caused by oxygen vacancy accumulation in BFO near semiconductors after repeated switching. The enhanced fatigue-resistant behavior in BFO/gallium arsenide FTJ is due to gallium arsenide’s weak oxygen affinity, resulting in fewer oxygen vacancies. These findings provide deeper insights into the atomic-scale fatigue mechanism of semiconductor-integrated FTJs and pave the way for fabricating fatigue-resistant oxide FTJs for practical applications."

DiffuCpG goes beyond conventional methods by leveraging both short-range interactions including nearby CpGs from both latitude and longitude of the dataset, local DNA sequences, and long-range interactions, including three-dimensional genome architecture and long-distance correlations, to comprehensively model the methylome. Compared to previous methods, through extensive independent validations across different tissue types, cancers, and technologies (whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, single-cell bisulfite sequencing, and methylation arrays), DiffuCpG has demonstrated superior performance in accuracy, scalability, and versatility.

The Gofar OTF of the East Pacific Rise has gained attention due to its predictable, yet enigmatic, earthquake cycle. Here, we present results from the first ever controlled-source electromagnetic survey of an OTF, which sampled Gofar. We find that the fault is characterized by a subvertical conductor, which extends into the lower crust and thus implies deep fluid penetration. We also image subhorizontal crustal conductors distributed asymmetrically about the fault. We interpret these subhorizontal anomalies as crustal brines, and we suggest that the high permeability of the fault combined with the influence of melt in the transform domain can promote hydrothermal circulation and brine condensation at OTFs."

These landscapes serve as weathering reactors whereby particles eroded from mountains undergo chemical and physical alteration before being exported to oceans. The time a particle spends in floodplain reservoirs regulates the style and extent of continental chemical weathering and the fate of terrestrial organic carbon. Despite its importance for the global carbon cycle, we still lack a quantitative understanding of floodplain storage timescales. Using a combination of geomorphic mapping, radiocarbon and luminescence dating, and numerical simulations of meander dynamics, we identify well-conserved scaling laws that describe floodplain storage times. Our results reveal that, to first order, floodplain storage durations are set by the ratio of river width to migration rate. The fact that most rivers erode about 1% of their width per year leads to a typical floodplain storage duration of ~5 thousand years."

Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) is the world’s rarest primate species; however, insufficient data on its habitat suitability and genetic status impede evidence-based decisions for habitat restoration. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Hainan gibbons’ energy intake and expenditure, reproductive parameters, and genetic diversity based on field research (March 2021 to December 2022) and long-term historical data (2003 to 2024). By comparing our results with those of captive gibbons and other free-feeding captive primates, we found that Hainan gibbons can obtain sufficient energy for growth and reproduction in their existing habitats. Furthermore, we identified an additional D-loop haplotype indicating that the current population is more genetically diverse than previously thought. However, recently formed adult male-female pairs are increasingly related, signaling a high risk for inbreeding within this small population. Based on these findings, we highlight an urgent need to expand available habitat by building corridors."

In existing stretchable battery designs, increasing the active material to yield higher capacity often leads to thicker and stiffer solid electrodes with poor mechanical properties. Here, we present a concept that transfers the physical property of a battery electrode from a conventional solid into a fluid state. The mechanical and electrochemical properties of the electrode rely on the viscosity of fluids rather than Young’s modulus of solids. Fluids conform easily into any shape with minimal force, making them intrinsically deformable. This decouples the electrochemical and mechanical property of the redox-active electrofluid, leading to higher capacities with more active material loading without stiffening the cell. The cell showed excellent capacity retention over 500 charge-discharge cycles and mechanical robustness up to 100% strain. Our work provides a technological solution for stretchable batteries that balances capacity and mechanical performance."
