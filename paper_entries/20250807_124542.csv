By analyzing global observations and chemical reanalysis outputs, key bias drivers, such as meteorological conditions and precursor emissions, were identified. This provides actionable insights to improve chemical transport models, observation systems, and emissions inventories, ultimately enhancing ozone reanalysis for better air pollution management. 
 This study employs an explainable machine learning (ML) framework to examine the regional dependencies of surface ozone biases and their underlying drivers in global chemical reanalysis. Surface ozone observations from the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) network and chemical reanalysis outputs from the multi-model multi-constituent chemical (MOMO-Chem) data assimilation (DA) system for the period 2005–2020 were utilized for ML training. A regression-tree-based randomized ensemble ML approach successfully reproduced the spatiotemporal patterns of ozone bias in the chemical reanalysis relative to TOAR observations across North America, Europe, and East Asia. The global distributions of ozone bias predicted by ML revealed systematic patterns influenced by meteorological conditions, geographic features, anthropogenic activities, and biogenic emissions. The primary drivers identified include temperature, surface pressure, carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH2O), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) reservoirs such as nitric acid (HNO3) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). The ML framework provided a detailed quantification of the magnitude and variability of these drivers, delivering bias-corrected ozone estimates suitable for human health and environmental impact assessments. The findings provide valuable insights that can inform advancements in chemical transport modeling, DA, and observational system design, thereby improving surface ozone reanalysis. However, the complex interplay among numerous parameters highlights the need for rigorous validation of identified drivers against established scientific knowledge to attain a comprehensive understanding at the process level. Further advancements in ML interpretability are essential to achieve reliable, actionable outcomes and to lead to an improved reanalysis framework for more effectively mitigating air pollution and its impacts."

 In April 2020, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center introduced a Level 2 provisional Aquatic Reflectance (AR) product for the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), marking the initial phase in developing a standardized global product for Landsat-derived surface water measurements. The goal of USGS EROS aquatic product research and development is to prepare for an operational processing architecture for Landsat Collection 3 in the late 2020s that will enable use of quality-controlled data for emerging Landsat aquatic science applications. To achieve this, we examine the general performance of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR product through the Science Algorithms to Operations (SATO) framework alongside quantitative assessment using community driven inland water data records (GLObal Reflectance community dataset for Imaging and optical sensing of Aquatic environments, GLORIA) and radiometric coastal validation platforms (NASA’s Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network, AERONET-OC). Variability within the validation datasets indicate that the performance of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR retrieval is highly context-dependent; errors are minimal in optically simple waters (e.g., clear to moderately turbid coastal waters) but increase considerably in optically complex waters where factors such as elevated levels of turbidity, chlorophyll concentrations, or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominate the water column. Additionally, this paper examines key algorithmic considerations for atmospheric correction, highlighting factors that influence accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency necessary for collection processing in the operational Landsat Product Generation System (LPGS). The purpose of this paper is to communicate with aquatic scientists, satellite oceanographers, and the broader Earth observation community on the origins, requirements, challenges, successes, and future objectives for operationalizing global AR data products for Landsat satellite missions."

The dataset shows significant spatiotemporal variations of fire PM2.5 in the past decades, serving a useful tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health. 
 Fires are a significant disturbance in Earth's systems. Smoke aerosols emitted from fires can cause environmental degradation and climatic perturbations, leading to exacerbated air pollution and posing hazards to public health. However, research on the climatic and health impacts of fire emissions is severely limited by the scarcity of air pollution data directly attributed to these emissions. Here, we develop a global daily fire-sourced PM2.5 concentration ([PM2.5]) dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.25° for the period 2000–2023, using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven with two fire emission inventories, the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 with small fires (GFED4.1s) and the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.5r1 (QFED2.5). Simulated all-source [PM2.5] is bias-corrected using a machine learning algorithm, which incorporates ground observations from over 9000 monitoring sites worldwide. Then the simulated ratios between fire-sourced and all-source [PM2.5] at individual grids are applied to derive fire-sourced [PM2.5]. Globally, the average fire-sourced [PM2.5] is estimated to be 2.04 µg m−3 with GFED4.1s and 3.96 µg m−3 with QFED2.5. Both datasets show consistent spatial distributions with regional hotspots in central Africa and widespread decreasing trends over most areas. While the mean levels of fire-sourced [PM2.5] are much higher at low latitudes, fire episodes in the boreal regions can cause PM2.5 levels that are comparable to those of the tropics. This dataset, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15493914 (Hu et al., 2025a) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15496596 (Hu et al., 2025b), serves as a valuable tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health, enabling accurate assessments and support for decision-making in environmental management and policy."

Researchers generally take for granted that the dense polyamide rejection film dictates the overall hydraulic resistance of these membranes, neglecting the contributions of the substrate and the transverse transport of water to reach substrate pores. To address this critical gap, we developed a resistance-in-series model to quantify the resistances from the polyamide film, substrate, and transverse transport. Calibration with multiple experimental data sets revealed that the polyamide film resistance varied over a wide range of 2.90 × 1012 to 40.15 × 1012 m–1, strongly correlating to film thicknesses (correlation coefficients >0.95), with a thickness-normalized resistance of (0.44 ± 0.12) × 1012 m–1 nm–1. Contrarily, the intrinsic water permeability of polyamide material showed less variation (0.53 × 103 to 1.56 × 103 LMH bar–1 nm). Contrary to common belief, both the substrate and transverse transport contributed significant resistances of (2.4 ± 1.3) × 1012 and 5 × 1012 m–1, respectively. These two resistances became particularly non-negligible for membranes with thinner polyamide films. Our study provides the first detailed quantitative analysis of key contributors to hydraulic resistance and provides valuable insights for high-permeable NF membranes."

However, the sources and drivers of these microorganisms remain unclear. This study integrated global metagenomic analysis, field sampling, and laboratory experiments to investigate their sources and driving mechanisms in sewage. Large-scale public metagenomic analyses revealed that external microbial sources, such as drinking water and feces, contribute negligibly to Hg-methylating communities in sewage. Consistently, in our field sampling, sewage discharged directly from building drainage stacks─prior to entering sewer systems─ contained almost no detectable hgcA genes. However, as sewage flows through sewer systems, hgcA gene abundance increased by 19- to 58-fold, with sequences identical to those in sewer biofilms, suggesting biofilm detachment as the primary source. Laboratory-scale sewer reactor experiments further demonstrated that biofilm maturation was accompanied by an increased hgcA abundance and elevated MeHg production rates. Metabolic profiling of hgcA-bearing MAGs revealed their key adaptive strategies in sewer environments. These findings suggest that urban sewers unexpectedly act as incubators for Hg-methylators, facilitating their prevalence in sewage and increasing the risk of downstream MeHg production. This finding underscores the urgent need to optimize sewer infrastructure and management strategies to address this emerging public health threat."

Free chlorine (FC), widely used in disinfection, poses significant ecological risks when overdischarged. However, achieving reliable long-term FC monitoring at discharge points remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we developed a continuously responsive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor for long-term on-site FC monitoring. The sensor integrated a flexible SERS probe functionalized with 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) for selective FC detection and a compact floating roller device for continuous signal acquisition. The sensor exhibited a low detection limit of 4.16 ppb and accurately quantified FC concentrations in real-world water samples, showcasing high sensitivity and reliability. Long-term deployment at sewage treatment plant (STP) outfalls further validated its robust monitoring capabilities under actual environmental conditions.

The present work addresses the United States (US) diesel fleet. EVT confirms that high emitters contribute disproportionately to adverse air quality. It further reveals that high emitter emissions have responded differently to progressively tighter emissions standards compared to fleet averages. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) high emitter emissions fell in concert with the fleet average after widespread implementation of the diesel oxidation catalyst to meet US environmental protection agency (EPA) Tier 1 emissions standards, but remained unchanged after the introduction of Tier 2 and 3 standards, even as fleet averages continued to decline. Whereas fleet average diesel nitric oxide (NO) emissions saw a steep decline following EPA’s 2010 diesel engine NOx standard, the mean 99th percentile emissions showed no impact. These results, combined with our previous gasoline vehicle high emitter study, demonstrate a growing disparity between fleet average and high emitter emissions. Addressing this disparity may present a more productive route to improved air quality than continued tightening of new vehicle emissions standards."

However, traditional methods often fall short, either lacking the sensitivity required for trace-level detection or the ability to quantify multiple ions concurrently. Here, we propose an AI-enhanced surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) approach that combines advanced spectral analysis with tailored probe combinations, enabling precise identification and quantification of four coexisting metal ions, even in complex environmental water. By using chelating agents used in spectrophotometric assays as probes, we constructed a high-dimensional spectral array that generates comprehensive “super profiles” of 84 combinations of coexisting metal ions at various concentrations. A self-attention-based deep learning architecture was applied to leverage this extensive data set, addressing challenges associated with spectral overlap and nonlinear responses. Validation across various environmental samples, including river water, industrial effluents, and domestic sewage, demonstrated exceptional accuracy, with prediction errors for mixtures of four ions consistently below 10%.

Field observations have identified significant concentrations of C5-alkene triols, yet no air quality models currently account for the formation pathways of these compounds. Simultaneously, the 2-MT concentrations are usually overestimated by 4–5 times compared to field observations due to the lack of the C5-alkene triols formation pathway. In this study, we expanded the isoprene-SOA scheme and implemented it into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with the latest Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism version 2 (CRACMM2) mechanism. The missing formation of C5-alkene triols via the low NOx isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) pathway, the gas-particle partitioning of isoprene-derived SOA tracers, and the high NOx SOA formation pathway are comprehensively considered in this expanded isoprene-SOA scheme. Results indicate that the C5-alkene triols contribute to 68% of all isoprene-derived SOA tracers, with approximately 50% in the gas phase and the remainder in the particle phase. The 2-MT concentrations are better represented in the new scheme compared to the default CRACMM2 based on the field observations. The overall SOA is improved by 0–4 μg/m3 in China with the expanded scheme. The isoprene-derived SOA is highly influenced by anthropogenic emissions, especially SOx (SO2 + SO42–), and the reduction in SOx reduces both isoprene aerosol tracers and organosulfates significantly, while a similar reduction in NOx leads to small increases in these species for both particle and gas phases."

The OSs and the nonalpha carbonyl substituted ONs were found to exclusively undergo a hydrolysis mechanism which is like that previously found for monofunctional and alpha hydroxy substituted ONs and OSs. However, the nonalpha carbonyl-substituted ONs were also found to undergo hydrolysis via sulfate catalysis (in addition to the previously found Brønsted acid catalyzed pathway), which has not been previously reported for any ONs. The alpha carbonyl-substituted ONs were found to react predominantly according to the ECO2 mechanism (via both Brønsted acid and sulfate catalyzed pathways) which has also not been previously reported for any atmospherically relevant ONs. Because the ECO2 mechanism leads to alpha-substituted dicarbonyl compounds, this process could be a precursor to accretion reactions which are needed to explain low volatility ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The kinetics data indicate that the Brønsted acid catalyzed pathways could be relevant for SOA with pH < 1, while the sulfate catalyzed pathways are predicted to be relevant for SOA well below efflorescence point for (NH4)2SO4."

The negative disturbances extended to mid‐latitudes around the midnight sector. Interestingly, the westward current pulse (negative disturbance) penetrated deep into low‐latitudes (up to 24.49°N and 28.92°S) in both hemispheres, but exclusively on the dawn side.

This pause is robust across observational data sets, metrics, and seasons. Large‐ensemble CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations reveal that such periods with minimal sea ice decline under increasing greenhouse gas emissions are not unusual. Analysis of ensemble members that simulate analogs of the observed pause indicates that the current slowdown could plausibly persist another five to 10 years, although the chances of a faster‐than‐average decline are increased in the near‐future. The modeling evidence suggests that internal variability has substantially offset anthropogenically forced sea ice loss in recent decades. Overall, this observed pause in Arctic sea ice decline is consistent with simulated internal variability superimposed on the long‐term trend according to the bulk of the climate modeling evidence."

Here we evaluate if observations from the EUREC4A campaign support ideas behind two common closures. All closure parameters are diagnosed at the mesoscale from dropsonde data and turbulence measurements. The closure models are compared to the observed mass flux estimated as a residual of the sub‐cloud layer mass budget from the same dropsonde arrays. Both closures capture the magnitude of the reference mass flux. However, the closure based on the surface‐based convective velocity scale strongly underestimates mass flux variability, whereas the closure using a convective inhibition based area fraction and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) based vertical velocity scale strongly overestimates it. TKE alone explains nearly 80% of mass flux variability, suggesting that TKE aggregates information of area fraction and vertical velocity of cloud‐base updrafts."

Aerosols are found to be the dominant factor explaining LWP variability, surpassing meteorological factors (MFs). By isolating aerosol effects from meteorological influences, the ML reveals a negative linear relationship between LWP and cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) in log space, likely driven by entrainment drying via evaporation‐entrainment feedback. This aligns with the negative regime of the inverted‐V relationship reported in previous studies, while no positive LWP responses are found due to a limited number of precipitating cases in EPCAPE. Furthermore, the sensitivity of LWP to Nd shows a non‐linear dependence on MFs like moisture contrast between surface and free troposphere and lower‐tropospheric stability. This occurs due to the interplay between the MFs' direct effects on entrainment drying and indirect effects through LWP adjustments."

Notably, we notice a progressive decrease in bulk magnetic susceptibility, largely due to the change in concentration of magnetite nanolite particles. Superparamagnetism is apparent in particular during the early stages of the volcanic activity, and the behavior is progressively masked upsection due to the abundance of Ti‐magnetite SD and PSD particles. We hypothesize that the reported edifice collapse occurred on 25 September and a coeval, abrupt change of magnetic properties, are both related to the viscosity change of the magma feeding the volcano."

Conventional satellite‐based Nd retrieval methods typically assume adiabatic clouds (cloud adiabatic fraction (fad) = 1), leading to significant underestimations, particularly in environments characterized by low fad. Furthermore, conventional methods retrieve Nd near cloud tops, often much lower than near the cloud base. This study applies the recently developed fad retrievals to retrieve cloud base Nd accurately. The retrieval is based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard polar orbiting satellites. The validation was done against ship‐based measurements over the ocean at the Australian Great Barrier Reef. The results indicate that the traditional adiabatic assumption resulted in cloud base Nd underestimations by a factor of 2.73. To resolve this, we implemented two averaged‐fad methods and one pixel‐level fad correction. Averaged‐fad‐based corrections improve Nd accuracy but yield higher root mean square errors (RMSE) and lower correlation coefficients (R) due to mean − value reliance. Pixel‐level fad‐based correction minimizes bias by avoiding error amplification from fad spatial averaging. When Nd retrieved by pixels with cloud optical depth larger than the 50th value, the correction optimizes the following results: slope ∼1 (0.983 ± 0.088), lowest RMSE (30.365 ± 12.212 cm−3), highest R (0.728, P < 0.05), narrowest metrics confidence intervals, and ±30% validated error. This study underscores the importance of pixel‐level fad correction in satellite‐based Nd retrieval, offering improved accuracy for climate modeling and weather forecasting. Future work should expand validation to diverse regions and seasons to further assess the method's generalizability and limitations."

The presence of objects such as trees, buildings, and mountains, also known as clutter, can significantly contaminate the reflectivity echoes. In complex terrains, signal processing techniques are often inadequate in completely resolving ground clutter. This study focuses on developing an algorithm to mitigate persistent ground clutter based on long‐term radar data. A composite ground clutter probability map was constructed using a texture‐based approach (Gabella filter), accessing persistent ground clutter across multiple scans. Otsu's thresholding method was then applied to determine an optimal threshold that separates clutter from non‐clutter regions. This results in a static binary clutter mask, which was further refined by morphological dilation. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated on data from the C‐band DWR installed at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The DWR observations from January and February 2017–2024 are used, characterized by the lowest average monthly rainfall over Kerala, maximizing clear‐air echoes. A total of 13,892 plan position indicator (PPI) scans (at 2‐degree elevation) were considered to generate the clutter map. The quantitative analysis of the clutter removal ratio Prm $\left({P}_{rm}\right)$ indicates that the proposed technique effectively eliminates ground clutter, achieving Prm ${P}_{rm}$ of 0.98, compared to the standalone Gabella filter Prm=0.54 $\left({P}_{rm}=0.54\right)$ and fuzzy logic‐based methods Prm=0.95 $\left({P}_{rm}=0.95\right)$ for non‐rainy cases.

The budget analysis reveals that NP blocking develops mainly through the quasi‐barotropic process, which reinforces the NP ridge from the lower troposphere to the upper troposphere by low‐frequency vorticity fluxes. Although relatively minor, high‐frequency eddies and their interactions with low‐frequency eddies also support the barotropic development of NP blocking. Additionally, the development of NP blocking is enhanced by both baroclinic and diabatic processes. While the former deepens the upstream trough in the lower troposphere, the latter induces the divergent outflows in the upper troposphere. These processes are well captured by the models, although the models overestimate NP blocking frequency and exaggerate low‐frequency vorticity fluxes. A multi‐model analysis further shows that the overestimation of NP blocking frequency is closely related to a weaker meridional wind shear in the model, due to a stronger wind in high latitudes and a weaker wind in midlatitudes. This result indicates that the model bias in NP blocking frequency is not likely caused by a misrepresentation of blocking dynamics but is likely caused by the biases in mean flow. This suggests that NP blocking can be better represented in the model by improving the model mean biases."

Here, we quantify semi‐controlled sea‐to‐air net fluxes of isoprene (0.50 ± 0.30 ng m−2 s−1), monoterpenes (0.93 ± 0.73 ng m−2 s−1), and oxygenated organics (methanol: 2.50 ± 1.13 ng m−2 s−1) using in situ mesocosm studies of natural seawaters in the south‐west Pacific Ocean. Under wind speeds <3 m s−1, flux compositions varied between Frontal, Subtropical, and Subantarctic seawaters, with several VOCs exhibiting fluxes comparable to or exceeding DMS (0.75 ± 0.86 ng m−2 s−1). Significant associations were observed among biogenic VOC fluxes and phytoplankton groups, notably with nanophytoplankton. The impact of atmospheric ozone changes was tested by introducing additional ozone into one mesocosm, which increased methanol emissions while decreasing monoterpene and acetaldehyde fluxes, making the ocean a sink for the latter. Such studies provide quantitative links between natural phytoplankton assemblages and emissions of climatically relevant marine VOCs, offering the potential to use satellite oceanographic data to improve the representation of these emissions in chemistry‐climate models."

Aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) accounted for ∼50% of measured VOCs (molar ratio), while methanol and ethanol accounted for ∼34%. The total wintertime VOC burden and contribution from aromatics were much higher than other US urban areas. Based on diel cycles and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses, we find traffic was the largest source of NO, CO, black carbon, and aromatic VOCs. Formic and acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, furanoids, and other VOCs were primarily attributed to residential wood combustion (RWC). Formaldehyde was one of several VOCs featuring significant contributions from multiple sources: RWC (∼35%), aging (∼30%), traffic (∼21%), and heating oil combustion (HO, ∼14%). PMF solutions assigned primary fine particulate matter to RWC (10%–30%), traffic (25%–40%), and HO (30%–60%), the latter likely reflecting high sulfur emissions from older furnaces and fast secondary chemistry. Despite cold and dark conditions, secondary processes impacted many trace gas and particle species' budget by ±10%–20% and more in some cases. Transport of O3‐rich regional air into Fairbanks contributed to aging, specifically NO3 radical formation. This work highlights a long‐term trend observed in Fairbanks: increasing traffic and decreasing RWC relative contributions as total pollution decreases. Fairbanks exports a relatively fresh pollutant mixture to the regional arctic, the fate of which warrants future study."

However, the absence of direct measurements of fluid and snow particle motions has limited the understanding of the mechanisms underlying snow cornice development. Here, we carried out numerical simulations under conditions identical to those of the wind‐tunnel experiments. Wind profiles, snow deposition/erosion rates, surface friction velocity, and particle collision rates before and after cornice formation are quantitatively analyzed. The formation of snow cornices is primarily influenced by the shear stress on the surface, which is crucial for determining their development, while the net deposition rate on the edge plays a significant role in influencing the growth rate of these cornices. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the presence of snow cornices enhances the likelihood of airborne snow particles adhering to the windward side of the edges, promoting downstream development. The growth of the snow cornice is predominantly influenced by the adhesion of settling particles at the edge, with only a small fraction of snow particles captured on the leeward side due to the effects of the return vortex (wake region). As snow cornices grow, the wind speed at the edge gradually decreases. While the collision rate of particles with the edge increases, further facilitating cornice growth. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of snow cornice dynamics and their implications for snow stability in mountainous regions."

In this paper we intend to give guidance on processing uncertainty information depending on application‐specific needs. In a high‐resolution initial‐condition regional climate model ensemble, we investigate the signal‐to‐noise problem for precipitation changes in major river basins in Western Europe, focusing on how it depends on different methods of spatial aggregation. This is motivated by the common need for spatially aggregated climate change information. We find that the forced climate signal is only moderately dependent on spatial aggregation. However, uncertainties (and likewise the signal‐to‐noise ratio) strongly depend on the aggregation method. Computing uncertainties at the grid scale—as typically provided in maps in climate change studies—and averaging those to larger areas, leads to large uncertainty estimates and corresponding low signal‐to‐noise ratios. This method does not account for spatiotemporal dependencies in the underlying data, and is representative for the uncertainties at a specific location. Computing changes at the grid scale, spatially averaging those per ensemble member, and computing the uncertainty in these spatial averages results in much smaller uncertainty estimates, up to a factor of 2 for 1‐day precipitation maxima in summer. This information is useful for stakeholders with an aggregated uncertainty perspective, for example insurance. Spatial aggregation of precipitation itself and computing uncertainties in basin‐scale precipitation changes—relevant for example river flooding—also yields smaller uncertainties, up to a factor of 1.5 for 1‐day summer maxima."

Many available AR catalogs have regional extent, although only global AR catalogs can record large‐scale heterogeneities in AR transport. However, identification of ARs at a global scale presents substantial challenges caused by regionally and temporally varying atmospheric conditions, for example, (high) low atmospheric moisture content in (low‐) high‐latitudes. Here, we introduce the PIK Atmospheric River Trajectories (PIKART) catalog, a global and comprehensive compilation of AR activity covering 84 years (1940–2023) at a high spatiotemporal resolution of 0.5° and 6 hr. Building on a previously developed image processing technique, PIKART identifies ARs in an unsupervised fashion that exploits characteristics of endogenous synoptic‐scale IVT variability. It tracks ARs prioritizing large and strong features, allowing for physically sound temporal gaps which ultimately improves the representation of long‐lived ARs. PIKART identifies a considerable number of high‐latitude ARs, matching current best estimates on polar AR frequencies while still maintaining a physically sound frequency of tropical ARs. It furthermore substantially extends the scope of previous catalogs by providing secondary AR properties such as a novel index of inland penetration, land‐intersecting locations, and AR ranks. Available as a compilation of AR conditions and AR trajectories, PIKART facilitates the study of ARs from both the Eulerian and Lagrangian perspective. As a first overview of the catalog's scope, we use PIKART to reveal (a) additional hotspots of AR activity, particularly at the poles and in the tropics, (b) exposure to considerable AR impacts in less‐studied continents (e.g., South and East Asia, Antarctica and Oceania), (c) inland penetration of ARs into less‐studied regions (e.g., Northwest Africa), and (d) a significant intensification of AR‐related moisture transport.

During these peak months, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index anomalies exceeded −1.5 standard deviations, indicating the extreme seasonal drought. Analysis revealed that anomalous descending motion and suppressed moisture transport resulted in precipitation deficit and enhanced potential evapotranspiration, further causing the prolonged drought. Specifically, in January 2023, reduced snow cover in southern Europe induced mid‐upper tropospheric high‐pressure anomalies over the Tibetan Plateau and SWC and enhanced Ural blocking high, contributing to anomalous northerly cold winds and subsidence. Simultaneously, cold sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical western Indian Ocean weakened the south branch trough (SBT), further limiting moisture supply. These factors resulted in cold and dry conditions across SWC. In April, decreased snow cover in northern Europe excited upper‐level Rossby waves, favoring positive geopotential height anomalies and anomalous descending motions over SWC. These conditions, combined with a weakened SBT linked to warm SST anomalies in the Arabian Sea, suppressed precipitation in SWC. Additionally, strong local land‐atmosphere interactions and subsidence‐induced diabatic warming increased surface air temperature, exacerbating high temperature and drought conditions in April. In May, mid‐upper tropospheric high‐pressure anomalies over SWC linked to dry soil moisture in western Siberia and a weakened SBT associated with southern Indian Ocean SST anomalies, together with local land‐atmosphere coupling, sustained dry and hot conditions in SWC.

Utilizing a previously calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, the effects of replacing corn with perennial bioenergy crops of Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus × giganteus on soil erosion, biomass yield, and biofuel production potential were analyzed with varying slope gradients (0%–2%, 2%–4%, and >4%) over a 35‐year period (1984–2018) across 14 zones of the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Simulated results showed that the average annual soil erosion increased from upstream to downstream zones across the UMRB. Notably, Miscanthus produced approximately twice as much biomass as switchgrass in upstream zones with higher latitudes, with these differences diminishing in downstream zones due to their temperature preference. The single‐harvest scenario for switchgrass annually in all 14 zones and the two‐harvest scenario for Miscanthus in upstream Zones A–G and single‐harvest scenario for downstream Zones H–N were identified as the optimal harvest frequencies. In contrast to corn land use, switchgrass and Miscanthus reduced soil erosion by more than 90% for the selected high‐risk slope gradients under the optimized harvest frequencies. Furthermore, both Miscanthus and switchgrass substantially reduced organic N, nitrate N, and total N losses across all zones. Among these optimized scenarios, Miscanthus emerged as a better alternative to corn for selected sloping farmland, owing to its superior biofuel production (9,101 L ha−1) and total biofuel price (4.16 billion US$). These findings provide insights into transitioning from corn to perennial bioenergy crops in the sloping farmland of the U.S. Corn Belt, promoting sustainable biofuel production while mitigating environmental burdens."

 Migration of transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells into the brain following systemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transplantation (HCT) holds great promise as a therapeutic modality to correct genetic deficiencies in the brain such as lysosomal storage diseases.1–3 However, the toxic myeloablation required for allogeneic HCT can cause serious, life-threatening side effects limiting its applicability. Moreover, transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells are highly vulnerable to rejection even in an immune-privileged organ like the brain. Here we report a brain-restricted, high-efficiency microglia replacement approach without myeloablative preconditioning. Unlike previous assumptions, we found that hematopoietic stem cells are not required to repopulate the myeloid compartment of the brain environment. In contrast, Sca1- committed progenitor cells were highly efficient to replace microglia following intracerebral injection. This finding enabled the development of brain-restricted preconditioning and avoided long-term peripheral engraftment thus eliminating complications such as graft-vs-host disease. Evaluating its therapeutic potential, we found that our allogeneic microglia replacement method rescues the murine model of Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by hexosaminidase B deficiency. In support of the translational relevance of this approach, we discovered that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells display a similar engraftment potential following brain-restricted conditioning. Our results overcome current limitations of conventional HCT and may pave the way for the development of allogeneic microglial cell therapies for the brain."

 As tissue resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, microglia perform diverse essential functions during homeostasis and perturbations1. They primarily interact with neurons via synaptic engulfment and through the rapid elimination of apoptotic cells and nonfunctional synapses2. Here, by combining unbiased lipidomics and high resolution spatial lipid imaging, deep single-cell transcriptome analysis and novel cell type-specific mutants, we identified a previously unknown mode of microglial interaction with neurons. During homeostasis, microglia deliver the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) to neurons for the degradation of the ganglioside GM2 that is integral to maintaining cell membrane organization and function. Absence of Hexb, encoding the β subunit of Hex, in both mice and patients suffering from neurodegenerative Sandhoff disease leads to a massive accumulation of GM2 derivatives in a characteristic spatiotemporal manner3. In mice, neuronal GM2 gangliosides subsequently engage the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)2 receptor on microglia via N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, leading to lethal neurodegeneration. Notably, replacement of microglia with peripherally derived microglia-like cells (MLCs) is able to break this degenerative cycle and fully restore CNS homeostasis. Our results reveal a novel mode of bidirectional microglia-neuron communication centred around GM2 ganglioside turnover, identify a novel microgliopathy and offer novel therapeutic avenues for these maladies."

 Whole-genome sequencing provides an unbiased and complete view of the human genome and enables the discovery of genetic variation without the technical limitations of other genotyping technologies. Here we report on whole-genome sequencing of 490,640 UK Biobank participants, building on previous genotyping effort1. This advance deepens our understanding of how genetics associates with disease biology and further enhances the value of this open resource for the study of human biology and health. Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. Although most associations with disease traits were primarily observed in individuals of European ancestries, strong or novel signals were also identified in individuals of African and Asian ancestries. With the improved ability to accurately genotype structural variants and exonic variation in both coding and UTR sequences, we strengthened and revealed novel insights relative to whole-exome sequencing2,3 analyses. This dataset, representing a large collection of whole-genome sequencing data that is available to the UK Biobank research community, will enable advances of our understanding of the human genome, facilitate the discovery of diagnostics and therapeutics with higher efficacy and improved safety profile, and enable precision medicine strategies with the potential to improve global health.

 The standard scenario for the origin of jawed vertebrates depicts a transition from benthic grazers to nektonic predators1–3, facilitated by a suite of anatomical innovations, including elaborate sensory systems, a high-flow heart and the integration of jaw-opening muscles with the craniothoracic hinge4–7. However, the lamprey-like internal anatomy8–13 reconstructed for osteostracans, the sister group of jawed vertebrates, seem to lack these gnathostome traits, implying a morphological gap despite phylogenetic proximity. Here, using synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography on the model osteostracan Norselaspis glacialis, we reveal derived gnathostome traits straddling a uniquely ossified head–trunk interface in this jawless fish. The inner ear of Norselaspis shows sensory elaborations (enlarged pars inferior and sinus superior) acquired well before the origin of jaws. As in crown gnathostomes, paired venous drainage channels blood into a high-volume cardiac tract. We also confirm a feature not yet demonstrated in any other vertebrate, to our knowledge: the most anterior trunk nerve extends its single trunk to the pectoral fin. In this respect, our reconstruction challenges the hypotheses14–16 that the gnathostome shoulder evolved from the gill apparatus. Our observations highlight Norselaspis as a prelude to the intercalation of the muscular neck and throat that would power the early jaw apparatus. Therefore, the vertebrate jaw—often considered the functional driver for ‘gnathostome’ innovations1–3—evolved instead as a follower to the sensory enhancement, increased cardiac output and greater locomotory control now inferred in the jawless sister group.

 The dispersal of archaic hominins beyond mainland Southeast Asia (Sunda)1 represents the earliest evidence for humans crossing ocean barriers to reach isolated landmasses2–4. Previously, the oldest indication of hominins in Wallacea, the oceanic island zone east of Sunda, comprised flaked stone artefacts deposited at least 1.02 ± 0.02 million years ago (Ma) at Wolo Sege on Flores5. Early hominins were also established on the oceanic island of Luzon (Philippines), as indicated by both stone artefacts and cut marks on faunal remains dating to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago (ka) at Kalinga6. Moreover, fossils of extinct, small-bodied hominins occur on Flores (Homo floresiensis)7–12 and Luzon (Homo luzonensis)13. On Sulawesi, the largest Wallacean island, previous excavations revealed stone artefacts with a minimum age of 194 ka at the open site of Talepu in the Walanae Depression14, long preceding the earliest known presence of modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the region (73–63 ka in Sunda)15. Here we show that stone artefacts also occur at the nearby site of Calio in fossiliferous layers dated to at least 1.04 Ma and possibly up to 1.48 Ma, using palaeomagnetic dating of sedimentary rocks and coupled Uranium-series (U-series) and electron-spin resonance (US–ESR) dating of fossil teeth.

 Glycosylation is central to the localization and function of biomolecules1. We recently discovered that small RNAs undergo N-glycosylation2 at the modified RNA base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U)3. However, the functional significance of N-glycosylation of RNAs is unknown. Here we show that the N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs. We found that de-N-glycosylation of cell-culture-derived and circulating human and mouse glycoRNA elicited potent inflammatory responses including the production of type I interferons in a Toll-like receptor 3- and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that N-glycans on cell surface RNAs prevent apoptotic cells from triggering endosomal RNA sensors in efferocytes, thus facilitating the non-inflammatory clearance of dead cells. Mechanistically, N-glycans conceal the hypermodified uracil base acp3U, which we identified as immunostimulatory when exposed in RNA. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of an enzyme (DTWD2) that synthesizes acp3U abrogated innate immune activation by de-N-glycosylated small RNAs and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, synthetic acp3U-containing RNAs are sufficient to trigger innate immune responses. Thus, our study has uncovered a natural mechanism by which N-glycans block RNAs from inducing acp3U-dependent innate immune activation, demonstrating how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses.

 Animals have developed many different solutions to survive, and these abilities are inspiring technological innovations in a wide range of fields including robotics1–3. However, biologically inspired robots, especially those mimicking octopus locomotion4,5, are based on limited in situ behavioural data owing to the complexity of collecting quantitative observations. Here we describe deployments of a remotely operated vehicle, equipped with a suite of imaging systems, to study the mechanics of locomotion in the octopus Muusoctopus robustus at the recently discovered 3,000-m deep Octopus Garden. Using a recently developed light-field imaging system called EyeRIS and an ultra-high-definition science camera, we were able to capture wide and zoomed-in views to characterize whole-animal gaits in a completely unconstrained environment across multiple individuals. Furthermore, the real-time volumetric data captured using EyeRIS yielded quantitative kinematics measurements of individual octopus arms during crawling, showing regions of high curvature and strain concentrated at distinct arm locations. Our results indicate that M. robustus crawling patterns showed several elements of simplified control, with implications for the design of future octopus-inspired robots. Further developments and deployments of technologies such as EyeRIS, coupled with capable robotic vehicles, will enable mining of the deep ocean for biological inspiration.

 GABAergic neurons are essential cellular components of neural circuits. Their abundance and diversity have increased significantly in the human brain, contributing to the expanded cognitive capacity of humans1. However, the developmental mechanism underlying the extended production of GABAergic neurons in the human brain remains elusive. Here we uncovered the microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We showed that microglia are preferentially distributed in the proliferating zone and identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the predicted top ligand–receptor pair underlying microglia–progenitor communication in the prenatal hMGE. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimic the hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrated that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem-cell-induced microglia abolish the induced microglia-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings revealed a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting the proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons in the human brain.

 NSD2 catalyses the epigenetic modification H3K36me2 (refs. 1,2) and is a candidate convergent downstream effector of oncogenic signalling in diverse malignancies3–5. However, it remains unclear whether the enzymatic activity of NSD2 is therapeutically targetable. Here we characterize a series of clinical-grade small-molecule catalytic NSD2 inhibitors (NSD2i) and show that the pharmacological targeting of NSD2 constitutes an epigenetic dependency with broad therapeutic efficacy in KRAS-driven preclinical cancer models. NSD2i inhibits NSD2 with single-digit nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration potency and high selectivity over related methyltransferases. Structural analyses reveal that the specificity of NSD2i for NSD2 is due to competitive binding with S-adenosylmethionine and catalytic disruption through a binary-channel obstruction mechanism. Proteo-epigenomic and single-cell strategies in pancreatic and lung cancer models support a mechanism in which sustained NSD2i exposure reverses pathological H3K36me2-driven chromatin plasticity, re-establishing silencing at H3K27me3-legacy loci to curtail oncogenic gene expression programs. Accordingly, NSD2i impairs the viability of pancreatic and lung cancer cells and the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumours. Furthermore, NSD2i, which is well-tolerated in vivo, prolongs survival in advanced-stage autochthonous KRASG12C-driven pancreatic and lung tumours in mouse models to a comparable level as KRAS inhibition with sotorasib6. In these models, treatment with both a NSD2 inhibitor and sotorasib synergize to confer sustained survival with extensive tumour regression and elimination. Together, our work uncovers targeting of the NSD2–H3K36me2 axis as an actionable vulnerability in difficult to treat cancers and provides support for the evaluation of NSD2 and KRAS inhibitor combination therapies in a clinical setting. A highly potent and selective small-molecule catalytic inhibitor of the protein lysine methyltransferase NSD2 shows therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer and lung cancer."

Swartz,Structural basis of fast N-type inactivation in K<sub>v</sub> channels,"This paper explores how voltage-gated potassium channels can plug the pore to prevent the conductance of ions during inactivation. 
 Action potentials are generated by opening of voltage-activated sodium (Nav) and potassium (Kv) channels1, which can rapidly inactivate to shape the nerve impulse and contribute to synaptic facilitation and short-term memory1–4. The mechanism of fast inactivation was proposed to involve an intracellular domain that blocks the internal pore in both Nav5,6 and Kv7–9 channels; however, recent studies in Nav10,11 and Kv12,13 channels support a mechanism in which the internal pore closes during inactivation. Here we investigate the mechanism of fast inactivation in the Shaker Kv channel using cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and electrophysiology. We resolved structures of a fully inactivated state in which the non-polar end of the N terminus plugs the internal pore in an extended conformation. The N-terminal methionine is deleted, leaving an alanine that is acetylated and interacts with a pore-lining isoleucine residue where RNA editing regulates fast inactivation14. Opening of the internal activation gate is required for fast inactivation because it enables the plug domain to block the pore and repositions gate residues to interact with and stabilize that domain. We also show that external K+ destabilizes the inactivated state by altering the conformation of the ion selectivity filter rather than by electrostatic repulsion. These findings establish the mechanism of fast inactivation in Kv channels, revealing how it is regulated by RNA editing and N-terminal acetylation, and providing a framework for understanding related mechanisms in other voltage-activated channels. This paper explores how voltage-gated potassium channels can plug the pore to prevent the conductance of ions during inactivation."

 Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is associated with poor cancer prognoses1. Large numbers of excised signal circles (ESCs) are produced as by-products of antigen receptor rearrangement during V(D)J recombination2,3. However, current dogma states that ESCs are progressively lost through cell division4. Here we show that ESCs replicate and persist through many cell generations and share many properties in common with circular extrachromosomal DNAs. Increased ESC copy numbers at diagnosis of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were highly correlated with subsequent relapse. By taking advantage of the matching recombination footprint that is formed upon the generation of each ESC, we measured ESC persistence and replication and found increased ESC replication in patients who later relapsed. This increased replication is controlled by cell-intrinsic factors and corresponds to increased expression of DNA replication- and repair-associated genes. Consistent with high ESC levels having a role in disease progression, the number of mutations typical of those caused by the V(D)J recombinase–ESC complex was significantly increased at diagnosis in patients who later relapsed. The number of such mutations in genes associated with relapse increased between diagnosis and relapse, and corresponded to clonal expansion of cells with high ESC copy numbers. These data demonstrate that the by-product of V(D)J recombination, when increased in abundance, potently associates with the V(D)J recombinase to cause adverse disease outcomes.

 Despite significant advances in microbiome research across various environments1, the microbiome of Earth’s largest biomass reservoir—the wood of living trees2—remains largely unexplored. Here, we illuminate the microbiome inhabiting and adapted to wood and further specialized to individual host tree species, revealing that wood is a harbour of biodiversity and potential key players in tree health and forest ecosystem functions. We demonstrate that a single tree hosts approximately one trillion bacteria in its woody tissues, with microbial communities distinctly partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining unique microbiomes with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or ecosystem components. The heartwood microbiome emerges as a particularly unique ecological niche, distinguished by specialized archaea and anaerobic bacteria driving consequential biogeochemical processes. Our findings support the concept of plants as ‘holobionts’3,4—integrated ecological units of host and associated microorganisms—with implications for tree health, disease and functionality.

 There is ongoing debate about the vulnerability of arthropods to climate change1,2. Long-term impacts of climate change on arthropod communities could manifest through short-term weather patterns3. Arthropods in the tropics are hyper-diverse4,5 and contribute many crucial ecosystem functions6,7, but are comparatively less studied than in temperate regions1,8,9. Tropical forest arthropods and the functions that they provide may be vulnerable to intensified El Niño events under climate change10–12. Here we perform time-series analysis of data from primary tropical forests, which reveal long-term declines in arthropod diversity and function that were linked to El Niño occurrence. In the Americas, species losses correlated with El Niño sensitivity, and abundant species fluctuated according to feeding traits and level of ecological specialization. Parallel declines in butterflies in Southeast Asia suggested that impacts spanned continents. Predicted arthropod diversity changes correlated with observed rates of invertebrate-mediated decomposition and leaf herbivory, which were oscillating and crashing, respectively, across the tropics. Our analyses suggest that an intensified El Niño immediately threatens tropical forest arthropods and the ecosystem functions that they provide. The broader consequences remain unknown, but such widespread changes could fundamentally alter tropical forest ecosystems13. Long-term monitoring of arthropod diversity and forest functioning across the tropics is paramount, as is researching the potential mechanisms that underly this novel threat. Time-series data from tropical forests tracking weather and declines in arthropod diversity and function show that fluctuations in species were largely dependent on their El Niño sensitivity and ecological specialization."

 Tunability in active metasurfaces has mainly relied on shifting the resonance wavelength1,2 or increasing material losses3,4 to spectrally detune or quench resonant modes, respectively. However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as a limited Q factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on–off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far field. Here we demonstrate temporal symmetry breaking in metasurfaces through ultrafast optical pumping, providing an experimental realization of radiative-loss-driven resonance tuning, allowing resonance creation, annihilation, broadening and sharpening. To enable this temporal control, we introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum. Even though their unit cells are geometrically asymmetric, coupling to the radiation continuum remains fully suppressed, which, in this work, is achieved by two equally strong antisymmetric dipoles. By using selective Mie-resonant pumping in parts of these unit cells, we can modify their dipole balance to create or annihilate resonances as well as tune the linewidth, amplitude and near-field enhancement, leading to potential applications in optical and quantum communications, time crystals and photonic circuits.

 The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are poorly understood1–5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-β and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3β. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD. Lithium has an essential role in the brain and is deficient early in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be recapitulated in mice and treated with a novel lithium salt that restores the physiological level."

 The aridity index is widely used to indicate water availability on land. Balancing climatic water supply (precipitation, P) against demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), it is often expressed as the P/PET ratio1 or humidity index. Water also flows laterally by rivers and groundwater, from hills to valleys and from mountains to plains, subsidizing the receiving lowlands2. Here, we show that this lateral subsidy reduces aridity in the receiving lowlands. We first estimate monthly subsidies (Qlat) by surface and groundwater at 30″ global grids with a global hydrology model. We then calculate the conventional global humidity index (GHI) as P/PET and a new GHI including Qlat as (P + Qlat)/PET. Termed GHI_topo, the latter reflects land topography, higher in hydrologically convergent lowlands. It also exhibits a delayed and dampened seasonality (relative to P) owing to delayed and diffused Qlat arrival at the receiving lowlands. Such spatiotemporal features of Qlat, arising from both the climate and the terrain, make GHI_topo a more realistic indicator of local water availability in downgradient societies and ecosystems, enabling life in arid locations and times. Global land area with GHI_topo ≥ 1 (supply meets or exceeds demand) is 33% greater than GHI ≥ 1 and far higher in arid and season-arid climates.

 Epidemiological data have identified Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection as the main environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis, the predominant autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS)1. However, how EBV infection initiates multiple sclerosis pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that EBV expands oligoclonal T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells that home to the CNS in humanized mice. Effector memory CD8+ T cells and CD4+ TH1 cells as well as CD4+ TH17 cells co-migrate to the brain of EBV-infected humanized mice. T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells can colonize submeningeal brain regions in the absence of other lymphocytes and attract T cells. Depletion of B cells with rituximab or blocking of CXCR3 significantly decreases lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS. Thus, we suggest that symptomatic primary EBV infection generates B cell subsets that gain access to the CNS, attract T cells and thereby initiate multiple sclerosis.

 Predicting the social and behavioural impact of future technologies before they are achieved would enable us to guide their development and regulation before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method that uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviours of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method ‘science fiction science’. We suggest that the reason that this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work that faces such serious validity threats. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the types of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that it may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, the benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.

 Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations1,2 that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions3. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems—the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin–orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars4, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is ‘primordial’—imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages—including the Sun’s modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System—could originate from initial conditions of their formation. Assessment of the stellar obliquities of a sample of resolved protoplanetary disk systems indicates that one-third of Sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks, suggesting that the origin of star–planet configurations, including many misaligned planetary orbits, may be primordial."

 Parent-of-origin effects (POEs) occur when the effect of a genetic variant depends on its parental origin1. Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, POEs are believed to occur due to parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, resulting in opposing parental influences2. Despite their importance, POEs remain underexplored in complex traits, owing to the lack of parental genomes. Here we present an approach to infer the parent of origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging interchromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and X chromosome data, and sex-specific crossover in siblings. Applied to the UK Biobank, this enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 109,385 individuals. Genome-wide association study scans for 59 complex traits and over 14,000 protein quantitative trait loci contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 POEs and confirmed more than 50% of known associations. More than one third of these showed opposite parental influences, especially for traits related to growth (for example, IGF1 and height) and metabolism (for example, type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels). Replication in up to 85,050 individuals from the Estonian Biobank and 42,346 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) validated 87% of testable associations. Overall, our findings highlight the contribution of POEs to complex traits and support the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon. A novel multistep strategy reveals how parent-of-origin effects shape complex traits in large-scale biobanks."

 Cross-scale coupling from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to non-MHD scales is important in interpreting observations of explosive events in nature, such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms1,2. Experiments and observations also link it to the emergence of energetic particles and X-rays3. However, how this multi-scale physics affects the abrupt onset of reconnection remains unknown. Here we report observations from laboratory experiments involving two flux ropes with electron beams that induce magnetic turbulence and then abruptly merge into a single structure, altering the magnetic topology in the MHD regime. Two separate electron beams are launched along magnetic field lines and form individual flux ropes with a drift velocity higher than the ambient Alfvén velocity, effectively driving magnetic turbulence through beam-driven instabilities, as inferred from the increased level of the turbulent power spectrum. Experimental observations, including the appearance of energetic particles, increased ion temperature and changes in the characteristics of the flux ropes, suggest that beam-driven turbulence drives three-dimensional (3D) reconnection. 3D particle-in-cell simulations are performed, which successfully reproduce the key aspects of the experiment. These results directly explain how non-MHD kinetic processes progress through multiple scales to induce global MHD changes.

 Magnetic soft robots offer considerable potential across various scenarios, such as biomedical applications and industrial tasks, due to their shape programmability and reconfigurability, safe interaction, and biocompatibility1–4. Despite recent advances, magnetic soft robots are still limited by the difficulties in reprogramming their required magnetization profiles in real time on the spot (in situ), which is essential for performing multiple functions or executing diverse tasks5,6. Here, we introduce a method for real-time, in situ magnetization reprogramming that enables the rearrangement and recombination of magnetic units to achieve diverse magnetization profiles. We explore the applications of this method in structures of varying dimensions, from one-dimensional (1D) tubes to three-dimensional (3D) frameworks, showcasing a diverse and expanded range of configurations and their deformations. This method also demonstrates versatility in diverse scenarios, including navigating around objects without undesired contact, reprogramming cilia arrays, managing multiple instruments cooperatively or independently under the same magnetic field, and manipulating objects of various shapes. These capabilities extend the range of applications for magnetic actuation technologies. Furthermore, this method emancipates magnetic soft robots from the sole reliance on external magnetic fields for shape change, facilitating unprecedented modes and varieties of deformation while simultaneously reducing the need for complex magnetic field generation systems; thereby, opening new avenues for the development of magnetic actuation technologies."

 Submarine groundwater discharge—the flow of groundwater into the ocean—plays an important role in shaping coastal biogeochemical cycles. The absence of temporal constraints on offshore groundwater dynamics driven by proximal glacial loading hinders our assessment of how its circulation may vary in conceivable ice-free polar regions. Here we estimate residence times of saline groundwater at an active submarine groundwater discharge and methane seep site off the coast of northern Norway, near the continental shelf break. The subsurface hydrology in this area experienced drastic changes due to Fennoscandian Ice Sheet dynamics, offering insights into the consequences of glacial–interglacial transitions for offshore groundwater. Using radiocarbon dating of dissolved inorganic carbon in the upwards-advected groundwater, we determined saline groundwater residence times of 11.5 to 8.8 kyr and 4.8 to 2.6 kyr at two distinct discharge sites. The presence of a meteoric water component in sediment porewaters confirms offshore groundwater freshening driven by past glacial loading. This indicates that, as the ice sheet retreated and sea levels rose, seawater began to infiltrate the subsurface, replacing freshwater recharge. Our results provide observational evidence pinpointing the onset of seawater infiltration following deglaciation of the margin. These findings suggest that retreating marine-terminating glaciers will profoundly alter offshore groundwater composition and reduce discharge rates.

 Along the northern rim of the Southern Ocean, the transformation of upwelled deep waters into less-dense Subantarctic Mode Waters forms a critical link between the deep and shallow layers of the global ocean. In the Indian sector, mode waters comprise a key component of Agulhas Leakage, which today conveys salt to the Atlantic basin necessary for sustaining deep water formation. The salinity of Indian-sourced mode waters may therefore represent an upstream influence on Atlantic overturning, with implications for global climate. Here we reconstructed the temperature and salinity of these waters across the Last Deglaciation using the geochemistry of two planktic foraminiferal species from a south Indian Ocean sediment core. Approximately 20,000 years ago (~20 ka), deglaciation was marked by an abrupt ~2–2.6 practical salinity unit increase that persisted until ~16 ka. This event coincided with an increase in water mass age reconstructed from the same core. We argue this coherence is evidence for an aged, salty glacial bottom water mass that, once upwelled, modified the salinity of Indian-sourced mode water. Model experiments suggest this salt had the potential, if leaked into the Atlantic, to nudge overturning towards its modern-day configuration, highlighting an underappreciated deep ocean influence on the deglacial dynamics. Increased salinity of Subantarctic Mode Water during the initial phase of the Last Deglaciation could have enhanced deep water formation in the North Atlantic, according to proxy records from a sediment core in the southern Indian Ocean."

Here, the authors investigate the crosstalk between these two prophages and reveal its contribution to biofilm formation, maintenance of polylysogeny and pathogenicity. 
 Polylysogeny, the harboring of multiple prophages within a single bacterial genome, is common among bacterial pathogens and enhances virulence and genome plasticity. Inoviruses (filamentous phages) are often present in multiple copies in major pathogens, leading to polylysogeny. Two highly similar filamentous phages (Pf4 and Pf6) are integrated into the widely distributed model Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, and both prophages are activated during biofilm formation. It remains unclear whether the two prophages function competitively or cooperatively. Here, we show a crosstalk between Pf4’s core region protein RepG4 (PA0717) and Pf6’s accessory KKP (kinase-kinase-phosphatase) toxin-antitoxin module that coordinates their propagation. RepG4, involved in Pf4 phage replication, triggers kinase-mediated toxicity of KKP in a dose-dependent manner by degrading the phosphatase antitoxin. This crosstalk serves as a molecular brake, preventing excessive Pf4 production and coordinating the release of both Pf4 and Pf6 phages during biofilm maturation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the significance of the tight regulation between phage core genes and accessory genes in establishing a mutualistic interaction between co-resident prophages. Filamentous phages Pf4 and Pf6 are integrated into Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Software is publicly available to support future cross-cohort rare disease discovery efforts. 
 Genomics for rare disease diagnosis has advanced at a rapid pace due to our ability to perform in-depth analyses on individual patients with ultra-rare diseases. The increasing sizes of ultra-rare disease cohorts internationally newly enables cohort-wide analyses for new discoveries, but well-calibrated statistical genetics approaches for jointly analyzing these patients are still under development. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) brings multiple clinical, research and experimental centers under the same umbrella across the United States to facilitate and scale case-based diagnostic analyses. Here, we present the first joint analysis of whole genome sequencing data of UDN patients across the network. We introduce new, well-calibrated statistical methods for prioritizing disease genes with de novo recurrence and compound heterozygosity. We also detect pathways enriched with candidate and known diagnostic genes. Our computational analysis, coupled with a systematic clinical review, recapitulated known diagnoses and revealed new disease associations. We further release a software package, RaMeDiES, enabling automated cross-analysis of deidentified sequenced cohorts for new diagnostic and research discoveries. Gene-level findings and variant-level information across the cohort are available in a public-facing browser (

Here, the authors present a selective 1,4-cyano translocation to alkenyl C(sp2)–H sites via radical cation catalysis. 
 Achieving the direct translocation of a functional group to unactivated C–H sites within a molecule, while maintaining its structural integrity, presents a notable challenge in the realm of organic synthesis. Here, we report that photocatalytic quinuclidine-based radical cation catalysis can enable selective 1,4-cyano translocation to alkenyl C(sp2)–H sites without imparting any extraneous modifications. The approach leverages N-centered radical cations as catalysts to facilitate both radical translocation and ionic elimination, thereby restoring the double bond and enabling positional exchange between a CN group and a C(sp2)–H bond. This results in the formation of alkenyl cyanide, a versatile linchpin that can easily undergo substitution reactions with a wide range of nucleophiles then lead to diverse difunctionalizations of alkenes. Consequently, this CN translocation approach complements the existing state-of-the-art method of radical-induced alkene 1,2-difunctionalization via functional group translocation.

 The modern biology toolbox continues to evolve, as cutting-edge molecular techniques complement some classic approaches and replace others. However, statistical literacy and experimental design remain critical to the success of any empirical research, regardless of which methods are used to collect data. This Perspective highlights common experimental design pitfalls and explains how to avoid them. We discuss principles of experimental design that are relevant for all biology research, along with special considerations for projects using -omics approaches. Established best practices for optimizing sample size, randomizing treatments, including positive and negative controls, and reducing noise (e.g., blocking and pooling) can empower researchers to conduct experiments that become useful contributions to the scientific record, even if they generate negative results. They also reduce the risk of introducing bias, drawing incorrect conclusions, or wasting effort and resources on experiments with low chances of success. Although experimental design strategies are often covered in undergraduate- and graduate-level courses and in textbooks, here we provide a succinct overview and highlight their relevance to modern biology research. This Perspective can be used in training of early-career scientists and as a refresher for seasoned scientists.

Incorporating shade trees into cocoa farms offsets the industry’s carbon cost, but existing coverage is low. Expanding coverage could substantially boost carbon stocks without reducing yield. 
 Reconciling agricultural production with climate change mitigation is a formidable sustainability problem. Retaining trees in agricultural systems is one proposed solution, but the magnitude of the current and future potential benefit that trees contribute to climate change mitigation remains uncertain. Here we help to resolve these issues across a West African region that produces ~60% of the world’s cocoa, a crop contributing one of the highest carbon footprints of all foods. Using machine learning, we mapped shade-tree cover and carbon stocks across the region and found that the existing average shade-tree cover is low (~13%) and poorly aligned with climate threats. Yet, increasing shade-tree cover to a minimum of 30% could sequester an additional 307 MtCO2e, enough to offset ~167% of contemporary cocoa-related emissions in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire—without reducing production. Our approach is transferable to other shade-grown crops and aligns with emerging carbon market and sustainability reporting frameworks.

 Seagrass meadows are renowned for their associated ecosystem services and carbon sequestration capacity, with microorganisms playing a crucial role. However, the invasion of microplastics may disrupt these processes. Here, we conducted a one-month in-situ incubation of three prevalent types of microplastics in the seagrass meadow of Swan Lake, China. The results showed significant differences in microbial communities between the plastisphere and natural matrices. Cyanobacteria exhibited a strong preference for polyethylene terephthalate, and microplastic shape and their contact area with water may be key factors in shaping microbial communities. Meanwhile, microplastic invasion can shift carbon- and nitrogen-fixing microbes and related genes, thereby changing seagrass meadows’ carbon and nitrogen cycles. This may impact the carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass meadows and pose potential risks of water blooms. Additionally, the potential ecological risks posed by the large number of resistance genes adsorbed by microplastics in the ecosystem are also worthy of attention.

 Soil protists are key contributors to ecosystem functions. The impacts of transitions within agricultural systems on the soil biota and functionality receive less attention than that among distinct ecosystems including forest, grassland, and cropland. Here, we investigated the impacts of transitioning from open field (OF) to greenhouse (GH) agriculture on soil protist communities and multifunctionality across multiple paired sites. Our results revealed that the transition from OF to GH reduced protist phylogenetic diversity, with a greater impact on rare protists (42.1% reduction). Latitude was the strongest predictor of phagotrophic protist community variation in paired OF and GH soils across regions. The soil multifunctionality index declined by an average of 17.7%, mostly due to the loss of rare protists in GH soils. Reconstitution experiments confirmed that inoculating GH soils with rare protists from OF soils significantly restored multifunctionality. Our work highlights the critical role of low-abundant protists in modulating soil functioning.

 Forests not only regulate the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide but also shape local biophysical conditions by creating microclimates that buffer temperature extremes. However, ongoing deforestation and fragmentation are transforming forest interiors into edge environments, which may differ markedly in their microclimatic conditions and undermine local climate-regulating functions. Here, we quantify how proximity to forest edges alters thermal conditions across biomes and seasons using global satellite-derived surface temperature data from nearly 13 million sites. We find that forest edges are consistently warmer on average than interiors, with the magnitude of warming varying with biome type and season. During summer months, surface temperature at edges frequently exceeds the optimal temperature for vegetation productivity, particularly in tropical forests. These results suggest that continued loss of interior forest will reduce the capacity of remnant forests to buffer local climate conditions, potentially hampering ecosystem productivity and resilience.

 Atmospheric and marine heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, increasingly co-occurring with significant impacts on ecosystems and society. Despite their significance, the effects of their concurrence remain poorly understood, particularly the influence on air-sea heat exchange—a key driver of weather patterns and climate variability. Using ERA5 reanalysis data (1940–2022), here we analyse heat flux variations and the marine heatwave intensification during concurrent atmospheric and marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean, a climate change hotspot. We find a sharp increase in latent heat release from the ocean to the atmosphere after concurrence end. This could be linked to the observed marine heatwave intensity dissipation at concurrence end. This effect has strengthened over recent decades, suggesting a transient thermoregulation mechanism linked to atmospheric blocking and ocean stratification changes. Our findings underscore the crucial role of air-sea interactions in modulating marine heatwave dynamics, with implications for climate projections and extreme event predictability.

 Issuing a tsunami warning rapidly is crucial to maximize the lead time for evacuation and other response actions. However, in the first minutes after an earthquake, no tsunami observations are available, and forecasts rely on rapid but uncertain estimates of earthquake location and magnitude. As more data become available, forecasts can be updated for more distant coastlines or near-source immediate post-event assessments. Here we present a method for real-time updating of Probabilistic Tsunami Forecasting that continuously integrates new seismic and tsunami observations. We apply it to the 2010 Mw8.8 Maule event and to several synthetic and real Mw 6.5–8.5 events in the Mediterranean Sea, demonstrating that it consistently preserves accuracy and generally reduces uncertainty, especially when using local tsunami data rather than focal mechanisms. Based on reweighting the initial scenario ensemble, this evolutionary approach enables fast updates and synchronization of forecast uncertainty with evolving information.

 Rapid urbanization has driven extensive coastal land reclamation worldwide. However, the soils used often contain geogenic contaminants, particularly arsenic, posing a largely unrecognized but substantial threat to the environment and human health. Here we present a comparative analysis of arsenic speciation in naturally contaminated coastal soils, revealing distinct risk profiles between reclaimed and natural environments. Analysis of 1029 soil samples from the Pearl River Delta, with detailed characterization of 29 high-arsenic samples using integrated chemical and microscale techniques, identifies two contrasting arsenic occurrence patterns: reclaimed soils dominated by unstable arsenic sulfide species versus natural hilly soils characterized by stable arsenic oxide species. The findings demonstrate that land development activities, hydrological dynamics and sea-level rise can trigger arsenic release in reclaimed soils. To mitigate these risks, an integrated risk management framework is proposed. This research provides valuable insights to inform sustainable land reclamation management across rapidly urbanizing coastal regions.

Global emissions were estimated at 11.5 (0.1–94.3) Tg yr−¹, contributing 0.63 (0.005–5.19) Tg yr−¹ to secondary organic aerosol production and a burden of 0.008 (0.00007–0.07) Tg. This corresponds to 13%, 6.4%, and 19% of the aerosol burden from isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, respectively. These results demonstrate that diterpenes are a previously underestimated, but potentially important, source of secondary organic aerosol, with implications for biosphere-atmosphere interactions. Diterpenes are an underestimated source of secondary organic aerosol, accounting for up to 13% of the secondary organic aerosol burden from isoprene, according to combined chamber experiments and chemical transport modelling."

 Savanna fires are a dominant ecological force in West Africa, shaping land systems, carbon dynamics, and biodiversity. Yet, their impacts on ecosystem productivity and recovery remain poorly quantified at meaningful spatial and temporal scales. This study presents a decadal assessment (2014–2023) of fire activity and post-fire vegetation response across a ∼ 229,000  km2 transboundary region of Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire. Using Harmonized Landsat–Sentinel (HLS) imagery and VIIRS active fire detections, we mapped burned areas (BA) at 30  m resolution—capturing extensive small fires often missed by global datasets. Fire-induced Net Primary Productivity (NPP) losses were estimated using downscaled MODIS productivity data, and post-fire recovery times were tracked at monthly and annual scales. Fires were highly seasonal, with > 80 % of BA occurring between November and January, peaking in December. Despite a dip around 2017, interannual BA remained relatively stable (0.29 % yr−1 increase, p > 0.05). Immediate NPP losses averaged ∼ 11 × 10–2 Mg C ha−1 per year, with higher per-hectare losses in forested and high-biomass zones. Roughly 65 % of BA recovered to pre-fire NPP levels within a year, primarily in grasslands and croplands. However, recovery in woody and mesic areas was slower and more variable. We emphasize that recovery was assessed in terms of NPP (carbon uptake), not structural biomass or species composition—functional recovery does not necessarily imply full ecological recovery. Using machine learning, we identified soil moisture (dry-season NDMI) and temperature as dominant predictors of recovery time, with soil fertility (nitrogen content) and water retention capacity emerging as key drivers. Interestingly, fire frequency and land cover type had limited predictive power once climate and soil factors were accounted for, suggesting that environmental factors, more than fire regime characteristics, shape recovery. These findings support the idea that well-timed, low-intensity fires—particularly early-season burns—can promote carbon resilience in fire-adapted landscapes. This underscores the value of high-resolution remote sensing and soil data in guiding fire-smart management and balancing ecological and livelihood goals under climate change."

 Oriented object detection plays a pivotal role in remote sensing image monitoring and understanding, such as traffic monitoring and urban construction.

 Australian dust storms have principally been studied using ground observations that are limited in being spatially sparse, and low Earth orbit satellites in turn limited by their relatively poor temporal resolution. In this study, the high temporal resolution of geostationary satellite monitoring was harnessed to assess the ability of Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) at detecting and mapping five case study Australian dust storm events between 2019 and 2020. AHI thermal bands (9μm,10μm and 11μm) were used to create Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) indices which were then applied to a Threshold-based Dust Detection Algorithm (TBDDA). Event-specific index thresholds were tuned for each event at the time of the highest dust concentration as recorded by a ground observation network. Selection of event-specific thresholds showed considerable variation and subsequent evaluation of dust storm detection revealed a low average Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.01 and a False Alarm Ratio (FAR) of 0.3 for the five events. The variability within the thresholds for each index across the five dust storms emphasises the lack of a singly suitable threshold set for event detection. It highlights inefficiency in the TBDDA when observing individual Australian dust events. A method that does not rely on event-specific thresholds is seen as the next step in advancing dust storm detection in Australia."

This systematic review examines 84 publications (2014–2024) on the application of UDTs for enhancing built-environment perception and facilitating public participation in urban planning. Results indicate a rapid increase in UDT research post-2020, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia, led by the United States, China, and Germany.

UDT studies primarily focus on visual and functional perception, with limited attention to auditory and risk perception dimensions. Additionally, most research concentrates on meso-scale (neighbourhood or city-level) contexts, revealing scale-specific limitations. Public participation varied widely, with academia and government predominantly driving initiatives, while direct citizen engagement remained comparatively limited. Interactive participation through immersive visualization technologies (e.g., VR, AR) effectively enhanced stakeholder involvement and perceptual understanding, yet raised equity concerns regarding accessibility and technological inclusivity.

 Against the backdrop of global warming, springtime ozone (O3) pollution in the Sichuan Basin, China, has become increasingly prominent. To identify the characteristics and causes of frequent springtime O3 pollution events, two severe episodes during May 2020 and 2024 were investigated using ground-based monitoring data, ERA5 reanalysis datasets, satellite observations, and a random forest model. During these two episodes, 17 and 12 O3 exceedance days were recorded across 18 and 16 cities, respectively. The megacity Chengdu recorded the most exceedance days (28) and the highest maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentration (245 μg/m3). O3 pollution tended to occur in Chengdu when temperature surpassed 29 °C, relative humidity was below 60 %, boundary layer height exceeded 800 m, surface net solar radiation was greater than 400 W/m2, surface pressure dropped below 94,500 Pa, and wind speed was between 1 and 2 m/s. During the O3 episodes, meteorological parameters predominantly fell within the ranges, influenced by surface low-pressure systems and high-pressure ridges. Elevated formaldehyde columns and a recent significant decline in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were observed. Under current precursor levels, weather-normalized MDA8 O3 concentrations ranged from 98 to 126 μg/m3. However, unfavorable meteorological conditions drove a 38–122 μg/m3 increase, while favorable conditions led to a 9–82 μg/m3 reduction. Crucially, enhanced solar radiation, rising temperatures and boundary layer heights, decreasing humidity, and concurrent NO2 reduction with high volatile organic compounds levels were key factors contributing to spring O3 formation.

 This study analyzes the temporal variations of dust-related traffic fatalities across the United States (U.S.), with a focus on the Southwestern region from 2007 to 2022. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events Database and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are utilized to assess these variations. The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Aerosol Detection Product (ADP) and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data are examined to quantify dust occurrence frequencies, their spatial distributions, and the environmental factors contributing to the temporal variations of dust-related fatalities. Results indicate that dust storm events and fatalities are concentrated in the arid and semiarid states of the Southwestern U.S. (SWUS), particularly in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. The findings reveal a modest decline in dust storm-related fatalities from 2007 to 2022. However, the most deadliest years (2017 and 2021) occurred in the latter half of the study period. Satellite retrievals show a decrease in dust occurrence frequency from 2012 to 2022 over the SWUS, which may partially explain the observed decline in dust-related fatalities. NARR data suggest that a change in soil moisture may substantially influence dust emissions. Given that wind speeds remained relatively stable throughout the study period, the observed decline in dust storm frequency is more likely driven by increased soil moisture (0–200 cm) rather than changes in wind conditions. These results highlight the importance of environmental conditions in modulating dust-related transportation safety risks, and the needs of integrating satellite observations, ground-based measurements, and reanalysis data to improve understanding of trends in dust-related fatalities and their driving factors."

 The heterogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by organic peroxides (POs) in aerosol represents an important pathway for atmospheric sulfate formation. However, the reactivity of SO2 with POs arising from anthropogenic sources and the resulting sulfate formation characteristics remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the heterogeneous reaction of SO2 with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from the photooxidation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB), one of major precursors of anthropogenic SOA. The reactive uptake coefficient (γSO2) of SO2 on 1,3,5-TMB-derived SOA was determined to be on the order of 10−4, depending markedly on aerosol liquid water content and particulate PO concentration. The second-order reaction rate constant (kobs) between 1,3,5-TMB-derived POs and dissolved SO2 is estimated to range between 352 and 3.3 × 104 M−1 s−1 at pH of 3–5, which are comparable to the kobs values previously determined for monoterpene-derived POs under similar conditions. Furthermore, 1,3,5-TMB-derived peroxides efficiently convert S(IV) into inorganic sulfate (30–88 %) and organosulfates (12–70 %).

 To improve the initial vortex structure for tropical cyclones (TCs) in numerical predictions, this study proposes a dynamic vortex initialization procedure that combines the inversion of PV-ω equation with the Grid Nudging technique. A statistical relationship between precipitation rate and latent heating profiles is first derived from numerical model simulations. In practice, the GPM-IMERG satellite-retrieved precipitation rate is used to derive the heating rate, which then drives the PV-ω equation to obtain the secondary circulation of the TC. In order to construct a physically realistic thermodynamic field in the initial TC set up, the Grid Nudging technique is employed. In this process, the momentum fields are anchored, enabling the adjustment between the thermodynamic and the momentum fields to occur through model integration.Application of this dynamic initialization procedure on the simulation of Typhoon Lekima (2019) successfully improves the prediction of Lekima's rapid intensification. The asymmetrical secondary circulation, constrained by satellite-retrieved precipitation rates, along with the reasonable thermodynamic structure and momentum fields, contribute to forecast improvement. Furthermore, during the rapid intensification phase, the model simulation captures key characteristics of upper-level asymmetric convective activity under vertical wind shear, such as strong upward motion in the upshear-left quadrant, which could result in an “outflow blocking” mechanism consistent with observations."

However, efforts to map chromatin states in complex, heterogeneous samples are hindered by the lack of methods that can profile multiple histone modifications together with transcriptomes in individual cells. Here, we describe single-cell multitargets and mRNA sequencing (scMTR-seq), a high-throughput method that enables simultaneous profiling of six histone modifications and transcriptome in single cells. We apply scMTR-seq to uncover dynamic and coordinated changes in chromatin states and transcriptomes during human endoderm differentiation. We also use scMTR-seq to produce lineage-resolved chromatin maps and gene regulatory networks in mouse blastocysts, revealing epigenetic asymmetries at gene regulatory regions between the three embryo lineages and identifying Trps1 as a potential repressor in epiblast cells of trophectoderm-associated enhancer networks and their target genes. Together, scMTR-seq enables investigation of combinatorial chromatin landscapes in a broad range of heterogeneous samples, providing insights into epigenetic regulatory systems."

Here, we examine whether the acquisition of neural crest in the vertebrate lineage played a role in the elaboration of the endostyle. CM-DiI lineage tracing reveals a neural crest contribution to the endostyle, and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis of key neural crest genes causes endostyle defects including formation of a single rather than bilobed structure. RNA sequencing reveals gene profiles characteristic of embryonic neural crest cells and Schwann cell precursors in the developing endostyle. Contrasting with the prevailing view that the endostyle is an endoderm-derived organ, we propose that the acquisition of the neural crest played a critical step in promoting thyroid evolution from chordate endostyle."

The periosteum is a bilayered tissue composed of inner cambium and outer fibrous layers. Typically quiescent, periosteal progenitor cells proliferate upon fracture; however, the underlying transcriptional mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that deletion of the transcriptional regulators, yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ), from Osterix-expressing cells, which reside in the cambium, impairs periosteal expansion. YAP activation increases chromatin accessibility, preferentially at TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) binding sites, and regulates both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cellular functions. We identify bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) as a YAP-TEAD target gene expressed in the cambium. In YAP/TAZ knockout mice, BMP4 delivery increased periosteal expansion through matrix accumulation and fibrous layer cell proliferation. Conversely, in wild-type mice, BMP4 delivery increased osteogenic activity and angiogenesis. Together, these data identify YAP-mediated transcriptional programs that promote layer-specific periosteal expansion."

NAR-loaded passive nanoparticles [P2Ns(NAR)] and dual-acting systems [P2Ns-NAR(NAR)] showed notable advantages over unformulated NAR, reducing the required dose by up to 57 and 79%, respectively. These nanoparticles modulated immune responses, restored T cell function, and shifted macrophage polarization from proinflammatory M1 to tissue-repairing M2. In addition, P2Ns-NAR(NAR) alleviated AKI by reducing fibrosis and lowering Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor κB levels in the kidneys. Notably, P2Ns-NAR(NAR) outperformed other formulations, providing a 50% lower effective dose.

Widespread volcanic features suggest that volcanic outgassing may have played a pivotal role in the transformation of Venus. However, the formation of volcanic units on Venus by basaltic lavas can only outgas a minor fraction of the CO2in the current atmosphere. Here, we model the erosion of long, meandering channels on Venus called canali and show that carbonatite lavas have the unique properties required to erode the canali. Our results suggest that eruption of these carbonatites may have delivered a total mass of CO2comparable to that of the modern atmosphere, resolving challenges to the formation of Venus’ atmosphere within the recent past and suggesting that exoplanets in the “Venus zone” may exhibit the potential for prolonged habitability."

Fano resonance, an example of quantum interference between discrete and continuous states, is marked by an asymmetric lineshape. While photon-based Fano resonance has enabled high-sensitivity molecule sensing, phonon-based Fano resonance remains underexplored because of ineffective interference between discrete phonons and electronic continuum. In this work, we report phonon-based Fano resonance in a graphene/2D Ag/SiC heterostructure, arising from frequency and lifetime matching between discrete and continuous phonons of SiC. The observed Fano asymmetry is tunable over two orders of magnitude, surpassing previously reported phonon-based systems. The 2D Ag layer restructures the interfacial SiC and facilitates resonant scattering to enhance Fano asymmetry, which is unattainable in conventional Ag. We further demonstrated that this Fano resonance allows ultrasensitive molecule detection at the single-molecule level.

The largest baleen whales use a high-drag lunge-feeding strategy that is hypothesized to come at a high energetic cost, thus requiring exceptional calorie intake. We used biologging tags to measure respiratory rates in foraging rorquals and demonstrate that their field metabolic rates are less than half that predicted by prey consumption estimates and by scaling predictions from smaller marine mammals. The relative cost of rorqual foraging decreases with increasing size as larger whales spend disproportionately longer time filtering prey from engulfed water. By decoupling active swimming and filtration, the largest rorquals forage with limited movement costs. The evolution of lunge feeding confers an energetic advantage that is unique among filter feeders and may have provided an evolutionary pathway to the largest body sizes."

We found that, with age, mutations increased in blood and saliva but not in oocytes. In oocytes, mutations with high allele frequencies were less prevalent in coding than noncoding regions, whereas mutations with low allele frequencies were more uniformly distributed along the mtDNA, suggesting frequency-dependent purifying selection. Thus, mtDNA in human oocytes is protected against accumulation of mutations with aging and having functional consequences.

Here, we show that the unstructured N-terminal region of PrPCinduces rapid and lethal neurodegeneration in mice, accompanied by the hallmark of prion disease, spongiosis. The neurotoxic N-terminal PrP is soluble, associates peripherally with lipid membranes, and induces neurotoxicity only when a critical threshold is exceeded. Both the N-terminally localized KKRPKP sequence and octarepeats contribute to neurotoxicity, with KKRPKP being essential. Without it, the N-terminal PrP is innocuous but exacerbates either neurodegeneration caused by N-terminal PrP or neurodegeneration in prion disease induced by intracerebral prion inoculation in mice.

To uncover the atomistic basis of voltage gating in TREK K2Pchannels, we integrated large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with extensive mutagenesis and patch-clamp electrophysiology, including sucrose-based experiments. Simulations revealed an asymmetric stability difference along the SF that results in a water-permeable extracellular side and a watertight intracellular side. Inactivation during inward flux occurs when water penetrates into the inner binding site and halts ion permeation, followed by the unbinding of three K+ions, consistent with gating charge analysis.

By combining data from 1046 hydrological stations with ISIMIP3a reconstructions, we provide a comprehensive national assessment showing that streamflow has declined across more than 70% of stations over the past six decades. Although regional heterogeneity exists, these declines are primarily concentrated in the north and driven by land use and cover change, further exacerbated by water abstraction, diversion, and regulation. In contrast, climate change and variability dominate the increases in streamflow, primarily in the south.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate surface acoustic wave control using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure, exhibiting characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leads to broad-range acoustic transmission reduction and bandgap-like regions of particularly strong suppression. By integrating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern, we achieve efficient waveguiding at frequencies within these bandgaps.

H. Liew;Rui Su,Exciton polariton condensation in a perovskite moiré flat band at room temperature,"Moiré superlattices exhibit fascinating moiré flat bands when two layers of van der Waals materials are twisted at specific magic angles, providing unparalleled opportunities to explore unconventional correlated quantum phenomena. Exciton polaritons, hybrid quasiparticles of excitons and photons, have emerged as promising synthetic platforms for exploring moiré physics beyond conventional systems. However, the realization of moiré exciton-polariton flat bands and their condensation remains challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a moiré exciton-polariton flat band with condensation in a perovskite moiré superlattice at room temperature. By engineering a 21.79° magic-angle moiré superlattice potential with enhanced interlayer coupling, we experimentally observe a polaritonic moiré flat band near the corresponding monolayer’s Dirac points position in the perovskite microcavity. Under a nonresonant pulsed excitation, polaritons with proper detuning condense into the moiré flat band at room temperature. Our work provides a unique platform for investigating exotic moiré phenomena and unlocks promising avenues toward advanced polaritonic devices."

Here, we combine recombinase polymerase amplification with Cas13a and Cas12a detection to create two parallelized one-pot assays that detect two conserved elements ofMtb(IS6110andIS1081) and a human DNA internal control. These assays are compatible with lateral flow and can be readily lyophilized. Our final assay showed a limit of detection of 69.0 CFU per milliliter forMtbH37Rv and 80.5 CFU per milliliter forMycobacterium bovisBCG in spiked sputum, with no cross-reactivity to diverse bacterial or fungal isolates. Clinical tests on 13 blinded sputum samples revealed 100% (six of six) sensitivity and 100% (seven of seven) specificity compared to culture. SHINE-TB streamlines TB diagnosis from sample to answer by combining amplification and detection while being compatible with lateral flow and lyophilization."

Tarditti;Rodolfo Ostilla Monico;Varghese Mathai,Fluid dynamical pathways of airborne transmission while waiting in a line,"Waiting in a line (or a queue) is an unavoidable social interaction that occurs frequently in public spaces. Despite its wide prevalence and rich parametric variability, few studies have addressed the risks of airborne infection while waiting in a line. Here, we use a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations to assess the flow patterns in a simplified waiting line setting. From observations of the transport of breath-like expulsions, we reveal the presence of fluid dynamical counter-currents —due to the competing effects of line kinematics and thermal gradients. Depending on the walking speed, an intermediate temperature range can potentially heighten the infection risks by allowing the breath plume to linger; however, colder and warmer ambients both suppress the spread. Current guidelines of increasing physical separation appear to have a limited impact on reducing aerosol transmission. This work highlights the need for updated transmission mitigation guidelines in settings where physical separation, interaction duration, and periodicity of movements are factors."
