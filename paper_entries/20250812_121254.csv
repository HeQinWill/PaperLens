10.5194/acp-25-8719-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注中国北方内陆和沿海城市冬季硝酸盐的形成机制。通过空气质量模型和同位素分析，研究确定了硝酸盐的主要形成途径，并探讨了减少氮氧化物、挥发性有机物和氨对降低硝酸盐水平的影响。虽然该研究与大气成分有关，但它侧重于化学过程和减排策略，而不是直接使用遥感技术进行大气环境监测或成分分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['Nitrate formation', 'Air quality modeling', 'Isotope analysis', 'WRF-CMAQ model', 'NOx', 'VOCs', 'NH3', 'Air pollution control']",Zhenze Liu;Jianhua Qi;Yuanzhe Ni;Likun Xue;Xiaohuan Liu,Enhanced atmospheric oxidation and particle reductions driving changes to nitrate formation mechanisms across coastal and inland regions of north China,"Our research investigated nitrate formation in air pollution across inland and coastal cities in northern China during the winters of 2013 and 2018. Using air quality models and isotopic analysis, we identified regional differences, with coastal cities showing more contribution from the dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) heterogeneous reaction. Reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ammonia (NH3) was crucial for lowering nitrate levels and improving air quality. 
 Nitrate (NO3-) has surpassed sulfate as the dominant secondary inorganic ion, posing a significant challenge to air quality improvement measures in China. We utilized the WRF–CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting and Community Multiscale Air Quality) model and isotope analysis to investigate the nitrate formation mechanisms driving regional changes in inland and coastal cities in north China during the winters of 2013 and 2018. Among the nitrate formation pathways, the oxidation reaction of OH radicals with NO2 (OH+NO2) and the heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 (hetN2O5) were determined to be the dominant pathways (88 %–95.5 %), whereas the other pathways contributed less than 12.4 % to the total amount of nitrate formation. In inland cities, 63.7 %–85.6 % of nitrate was formed via OH+NO2 and 8.3 %–27.7 % was formed from hetN2O5. In coastal cities, approximately half of the nitrate (48.2 %–56.5 %) was produced from OH+NO2, whereas hetN2O5 contributed 37.0 %–45.7 % due to higher N2O5 concentrations and longer NO3 radical lifetimes. Compared with that in 2013, the OH+NO2 contribution in 2018 increased by 7.6 % in inland cities and 3.6 % in coastal cities due to the increased atmospheric oxidizing capacity. Scenario simulations indicated that a 60 % reduction in NOx emissions led to a 4.5 % decrease in nitrate concentrations in Beijing. The reduction reached 32.4 % reduction in Qingdao. A 60 % combined reduction in NH3, NOx, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) yielded 44.2 % and 60.0 % reductions in nitrate in Beijing and Qingdao, respectively, underscoring the necessity of multipollutant control strategies."

Mitra;Miklós Szakáll,Measurement report: Influence of particle density on secondary ice production by graupel and frozen drop collisions,"Laboratory studies on the fragmentation of ice particles by collision are presented. Graupel particles were created by riming at –7 and –15 °C, also simulating rotation and tumbling. Frozen ice drops were generated by freezing water in 3D-printed spherical molds. The number of fragments generated by collision was between 1 and 20 and was strongly dependent on the density of the graupel. We also showed that the number of fragments approaches zero when the particle suffers more than three collisions in a row. 
 Collision-induced fragmentation of atmospheric ice particles is a crucially important but understudied secondary ice production mechanism in clouds. We present a laboratory study dedicated to fragmentation due to graupel–graupel and frozen drop–frozen drop collisions and the role of these collisions in augmenting the ice particle concentration in clouds. For this, graupel particles of different sizes and densities were created utilizing dry growth conditions in a cold chamber at −7 and −15 °C using a setup that simulates the natural rotation and tumbling motion of freely falling graupel. Ice spheres, as proxies for frozen drops and ice pellets, were generated by freezing purified water in 3D-printed spherical molds. We conducted collision experiments inside the cold chamber utilizing a fall tube that ensures the central and repeatable collision of ice particles at different collision kinetic energies. The number of fragments generated in the collisions was analyzed, following a theoretical framework, as a function of the collision kinetic energy. The detection limit of our experiments was 30 µm; thus, fragments with sizes lower than 30 µm could not be detected. The observed number of fragments varied between 1 and 20 and was, thus, comparable to or higher than the number of fragments resulting from drop freezing experiments. Our results revealed a strong dependency of the fragment number on the density of the colliding ice particles, which can be attributed to the particles' structure. The sizes of the fragments that we detected were in the submillimeter range for graupel and up to 3 mm for ice spheres. Another set of experiments, focusing on the multiple collision of graupel revealed that the number of fragments generated decreases significantly and approaches zero when a particle undergoes more than three collisions in a row."
10.5194/acp-25-8657-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注气溶胶与云之间的相互作用，特别是气溶胶浓度如何影响云中的含水量，进而影响云的反射太阳辐射的能力。研究使用了简单的夹带参数化方法来分析弱降水或无降水层积云中气溶胶对云水的影响。虽然云的特性与大气环境有关，但该研究并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'cloud water content', 'droplet concentration', 'entrainment', 'stratocumulus clouds']",Fabian Hoffmann;Yao-Sheng Chen;Graham Feingold,On the processes determining the slope of cloud water adjustments in weakly and non-precipitating stratocumulus,"Clouds reflect a substantial portion of the incoming solar radiation back into space. This capacity is determined by the number of cloud droplets, which in turn is influenced by the number of aerosol particles, forming the basis for aerosol–cloud–climate interactions. In this study, we use a simple entrainment parameterization to understand the effect of aerosol on cloud water in weakly and non-precipitating stratocumulus. 
 Cloud water adjustments are a part of aerosol–cloud interactions, affecting the ability of clouds to reflect solar shortwave radiation through processes altering the vertically integrated cloud water content L in response to changes in the droplet concentration N. In this study, we utilize a simple entrainment parameterization used in mixed-layer models to determine entrainment-mediated cloud water adjustments in weakly and non-precipitating stratocumulus. At lower N, L decreases due to an increase in entrainment in response to an increase in N suppressing the stabilizing effect of evaporating precipitation (virga) on boundary layer dynamics. At higher N, the decrease in cloud droplet sedimentation sustains more liquid water at the cloud top, and hence stronger preconditioning of free-tropospheric air, which increases entrainment with N. Using this idealized framework that neglects interactive surface fluxes, changes in boundary layer depth, and the diurnal cycle of solar radiation, we are able to show that cloud water adjustments weaken distinctly from dln(L)/dln(N)=-0.48 at N=100cm-3 to −0.03 at N=1000cm-3, indicating that a single value to describe cloud water adjustments in weakly and non-precipitating clouds is insufficient. Based on these results, we speculate that cloud water adjustments at lower N are associated with slow changes in boundary layer dynamics, while a faster response is associated with the preconditioning of free-tropospheric air at higher N."
10.5194/acp-25-8683-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了北京地区焚风事件的识别、特征及其对空气污染的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及大气环境遥感技术，但它与空气质量监测密切相关，特别是PM2.5的浓度变化。研究结果可以为利用遥感数据进行空气质量评估和预测提供地面验证数据，并帮助理解大气边界层结构对污染物扩散的影响。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术间接相关，可以为相关研究提供参考。,"['air pollution', 'PM2.5', 'air quality', 'temperature increase', 'boundary-layer structure']",Ju Li;Jingjiang Zhang;Mengxin Bai;Jie Su;Qingchun Li;Xingcan Jia,Identification and characterization of foehn events in Beijing and their impact on air pollution episodes,"This research examines foehn events in Beijing using weather station data from 2015 to 2020. We found an average of 56.5 foehn days annually, primarily in winter. These winds can raise temperatures significantly and are associated with air pollution levels. Strong foehn winds tend to reduce pollution, while weaker winds may increase it. Our study highlights the impact of foehn events on air quality, providing valuable insights for urban planning and environmental management. 
 This study proposes a method for identifying foehn events in Beijing using automatic weather station (AWS) data, considering upper-air wind direction, topography, meteorological changes, and foehn propagation. Analysis of AWS data from 2015 to 2020 revealed an annual average of 56.5 foehn days, with these days occurring most frequently in winter and least frequently in summer. High-frequency foehn areas exhibit a band-like distribution from the northwestern mountainous region to the southeastern plains, while low-frequency areas are primarily concentrated in the northeastern plains. The horizontal extent of the foehn influence is maximal in spring and minimal in summer. Foehn-induced hourly temperature increases can exceed 11 °C, peaking from night to early morning. Approximately 67 % of pollution episodes are accompanied by foehn events, with foehn duration negatively correlated to pollution episode duration. 60.4 % of foehn events coincide with decreasing concentrations of particulate matter of 2.5 µm diameter (PM2.5), while 39.6 % show increases. Rapid PM2.5 concentration increases (>50 µgm-3h-1) primarily correspond to weak foehn events (temperature increase <2 °C). Foehn winds influence pollution through direct and indirect effects. The direct effect, associated with strong northwesterly pressure gradients, can rapidly decrease pollutant concentrations. The indirect effect, linked to weak pressure gradients, alters the boundary-layer structure, causing rapid increases in pollutant concentrations following the termination of foehn. This foehn identification method, applicable to long-term historical surface observations, not only facilitates a deeper understanding of how foehn phenomena evolve and contribute to temperature increases under global warming, but also advances an in-depth exploration of the relationships between foehn events and high-impact weather phenomena."

Cohen;Glenn M. Wolfe;Xiaomeng Jin,Impacts of wildfire smoke aerosols on near-surface ozone photochemistry,"This study shows large chemical and radiative effects of smoke aerosols from fires on near-surface ozone production. Aerosol loading and NOx levels are identified as the primary factors influencing these effects. Furthermore, we show that the ratio of surface PM2.5 to NO2 tropospheric column can be used as an indicator for identifying aerosol-dominated regimes, facilitating the assessment of aerosol impacts on ozone formation through satellite observations. 
 Wildfires have been an increasing concern for the environment, yet the ozone (O3) production from wildfires remains poorly characterized. Here, we aim to elucidate the role of aerosols from wildfire smoke in near-surface O3 photochemistry by integrating insights from a 0-D box model (F0AM) to a 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). While smoke aerosols typically inhibit O3 production through heterogeneous chemical and radiative pathways, we find that for most fires, the O3 enhancement driven by precursor emissions outweighs these aerosol-driven suppression effects. The relative importance of the two aerosol effects varies, with the heterogeneous chemical effect generally overshadowing the radiative effect in the far field of fires. However, near the sources of extremely large fires, the radiative effect dominates, leading to an overall suppression of O3 production. By assessing the chain termination of hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx) and introducing the “light-limited” regime determination in GEOS-Chem, we find that a significant portion of O3 production occurred within light-limited and heterogeneous chemistry-inhibited regimes during the 2020 wildfire season in California. Building on the discovery that both aerosol and nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations modulate aerosol influence, we demonstrate that the ratio of surface PM2.5 to tropospheric NO2 column – a metric retrievable from satellite – can serve as an indicator for identifying aerosol-dominated regimes through observations."

GEMS provides hourly data, improving the time resolution compared to the daily overpasses by other satellites. For the prediction of hourly surface NO2 over South Korea from GEMS observations and meteorological data, this study shows that machine learning models benefit from this higher time resolution. This is achieved by using observations from previous hours as additional inputs. 
 Launched in 2020, the Korean Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the first geostationary satellite mission for observing trace gas concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere. Observations are made over Asia. Geostationary orbits allow for hourly measurements, which lead to a much higher temporal resolution compared to daily measurements taken from low-Earth orbits, such as by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) or the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). This work estimates the hourly concentration of surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from GEMS tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and additional meteorological features, which serve as inputs for random forests and linear regression models. With several measurements per day, machine learning models can use not only current observations but also those from previous hours as inputs. We demonstrate that using these time-contiguous inputs leads to reliable improvements regarding all considered performance measures, such as Pearson correlation or mean square error. For random forests, the average performance gains are between 4.5 % and 7.5 %, depending on the performance measure. For linear regression models, average performance gains are between 7 % and 15 %. For performance evaluation, spatial cross-validation with surface in situ measurements is used to measure how well the trained models perform at locations where they have not received any training data. In other words, we inspect the models' ability to generalize to unseen locations. Additionally, we investigate the influence of tropospheric NO2 VCDs on the performance. The region of our study is South Korea."

Discrepancies between observations and forecasts at and above the melting layer highlighted issues in both the radar forward operator and the microphysics. To overcome some of these issues, different parameterizations of the operator were suggested. This work aligns with the future integration of polarimetric data into assimilation systems. 
 Thunderstorm forecasting remains challenging despite advances in numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. The microphysics scheme that represents clouds in the model partly contributes to the introduction of uncertainties in the simulations. To better understand the discrepancies, synthetic radar data simulated by a radar forward operator (applied to model outputs) are usually compared to dual-polarization radar observations, as they provide insight into the microphysical structure of clouds. However, the modeling of polarimetric values and radar signatures such as the ZDR column (ZDRC) remains a complex issue, despite the diversity of microphysics schemes and forward operators, especially above the freezing level where values that are too low are often found.The aim of this work is to assess the ability of the AROME NWP convective model, when coupled with two distinct microphysics schemes (ICE3 one-moment and LIMA partially two-moment; LIMA: Liquid Ice Multiple Aerosols), to accurately reproduce thunderstorm characteristics. A statistical evaluation is conducted on 34 convective days of 2022 using both a global and an object-oriented approach, and a ZDRC detection algorithm is implemented. Simulations performed with LIMA microphysics showed  good agreement with observed ZH, ZDR, and KDP below the melting layer in convective cores. Moreover, it demonstrated a remarkable capacity to generate a realistic number of ZDRCs, as well as a distribution of (1) the ZDRC area and (2) the first ZDRC occurrence, very close to the observations. Enhancements in the forward operator have also been suggested to improve the simulations in the mixed phase and cold phase regions.These findings are highly encouraging in the context of data assimilation, where one could leverage the combination of advanced microphysics schemes and improved forward operators to improve storm forecasts."

The merged datasets exhibit significantly improved accuracy compared to the original satellite data. These results can provide more reliable estimates of aerosol scattering and absorption properties, essential for improving climate modeling and assessing aerosol climate effects. 
 Accurate global aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA) data are critical for assessing aerosol radiative effects and identifying aerosol composition. However, current satellite-based SSA retrievals are both limited and highly uncertain, whereas the more accurate ground-based observations lack global coverage. In this study, we employ an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data synergy technique to construct two monthly mean SSA datasets over land by synergizing the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) instrument with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, namely, the Merged-OMI and Merged-POLDER datasets. The background ensemble is constructed with 231/106 members using all monthly mean OMI/POLDER SSA available to represent the variability of the SSA field. Then, AERONET measurements are assimilated into each satellite dataset using the EnKF approach. The merged datasets show substantial improvements against the original products, with the correlation coefficient increased by up to 100 % and the mean absolute bias (MAB) and root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by more than 30 % compared with the AERONET results. Cross-validation using independent AERONET observations shows an average increase of 64 % in correlation, an 11 % reduction in RMSE, and a 10 % reduction in MAB for the Merged-OMI dataset, as well as similar – although weaker – improvement for Merged-POLDER mainly due to the smaller sample size. This study confirms the effectiveness of the EnKF technique in extending the information obtained from ground stations to larger regions. The two merged datasets generated in this study, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14294462 (Dong, 2025), can offer more accurate SSA estimates for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and improving climate modeling, serving as an important resource for advancing global aerosol research."

The geospatial data presented in the article correspond to the contextual indicators of the monitoring framework of the Common Agricultural Policy. Our exploratory analysis reveals several interesting patterns which contribute to the broader debate on the future of European agriculture. 
 International organizations have voiced the need to integrate geographical information from agricultural holdings into official statistics to gain a better understanding of the spatial dynamics of the European agricultural sector. This paper presents a set of thematic maps based on the European 2020 agricultural census to explore the major structural differences between regions and countries. To comply with the confidentiality requirements associated with the census data, we applied a multi-resolution gridded approach by varying the resolution of the grid cells as a function of the density, dominance, and quality of individual observations. The datasets contain a mixture of grid resolutions ranging from 1 to 40 km, preserving a hierarchical structure where higher-resolution grid cells are aggregated into lower resolutions until the statistical disclosure requirements are met. The variables presented here correspond to the Contextual Indicators of the Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and are divided into three broad categories: structural components (i.e., agricultural holdings, land use, livestock patterns, and labor input); the demographics of farmers (i.e., age, gender, and skills); and agricultural production methods (i.e., irrigation and organic farming). Our exploratory analysis indicates that high farm density occurs in plains, lowlands, and fertile soil in valleys; that high shares of organic farming tend to be concentrated in certain areas with high proportions of grassland; and that agricultural holdings managed by young farmers are located in a belt stretching from France through to Switzerland, Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland. These novel datasets are highly versatile, not only allowing policies to evaluate funding schemes at more local levels, but also offering researchers new opportunities to draw causal spatial inference from the multi-resolution gridded data. The dataset is the first attempt to create an unprecedented harmonized view of European agriculture with high spatial resolution and is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14852709 (Eurostat, 2025)."

Here we present the Global Forest Cover map of year 2020, derived from the combination of most recent publicly available land cover and land use datasets. The map is a globally-consistent representation of the presence/absence of forests based on EUDR definitions, but its use is not mandatory, not exclusive and not legally binding. 
 Earth observation (EO) data are used to map tree cover extent, estimate canopy height, detect disturbances, and classify land cover and land use. However, comprehensive global information on forest cover, capturing both physical characteristics and land use components as defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), remains limited. Here, we present a harmonized and globally consistent map of forest presence or absence at 10 meter spatial resolution for the year 2020, hereafter referred to as GFC2020. Our approach combines multiple spatial datasets, primarily derived from EO, to harness their complementary strengths within a transparent, flexible, and open science framework. GFC2020 maps 4,562 million hectares (Mha) of forests globally, which is 12 % more than the estimate from latest FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). Approximately 11 % (~578 Mha) of tree cover is excluded from forest area in GFC2020, primarily because it does not meet the height threshold or occurs on agricultural or urban land. Conversely, around 0.6 % (~25 Mha) of the area classified as forest in GFC2020 is unstocked, due to forest management practices or natural disturbances such as fire. Based on the reinterpretation of an existing reference set of 21,752 sample units, GFC2020 achieves an overall accuracy of 91 %, with 18 % probability of overestimating the forest area and 8 % for underestimation. Future improvements in EO products, such as better detection of trees in dry and open landscapes, distinguishing natural from human drivers of forest disturbance, mapping tree crops at high spatial resolution or identifying agroforestry systems, will contribute to enhancing future versions of GFC2020. The shift from tree cover to forest cover mapping is not only essential for ecological and climate related applications but also provides new opportunities to support policy needs. GFC2020 (https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/GFC) is one of many tools to inform the deforestation risk assessments under supply chain oriented regulations such as the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

 Peatlands are globally important carbon stores that face increasing threats from human activities and climate change impacts. Comprehensive peatland data are essential for understanding ecosystem responses to these stressors and mapping their past and current characteristics. Current peatland datasets remain limited due to poor representation in global soil mapping initiatives and the absence of a recognized, coordinated central repository for peat depth data. Existing compilations often contain errors, duplicates, and outdated observations, requiring researchers to repeatedly gather and harmonize data on a study-by-study basis.

It features a detailed resolution of the emissions in different subsectors, transport-specific quantities like non-exhaust emissions, and aviation-specific parameters. The ELK dataset is complemented with uncertainty scores and is validated against other well-established global inventories. 
 The transport sectors, comprising land transport, shipping and aviation, are major contributors to climate change and have a detrimental impact on air quality, with adverse consequences for human health. The emissions from transport, already contributing 23 % of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions in 2019, are projected to continuously grow in the future, challenging the achievement of climate protection and pollution reduction targets. A major goal of transport research on climate and air quality is the accurate assessment of its impacts, which requires detailed emission data to drive atmospheric models and calculate projections for future scenarios. This paper presents the ELK global emission inventory for the transport sectors. The inventory is developed using a consistent bottom-up approach fed with a wide range of input data to model the transport fleets of land transport, shipping and aviation. It provides several major improvements over existing datasets, such as the explicit resolution of the emissions at the subsector level, the consideration of transport-specific quantities and emission species, and the quantification of the transport-related emissions from the energy sectors. The emission data is complemented by a quantitative uncertainty score, based on a detailed expert-judgement analysis along the modelling chain, from the activity data to the emission factors. The emission data is validated by comparing it with other, well-established global inventories, and biases are discussed and, where possible, explained in terms of the different assumptions and features of the underlying emission models. The ELK dataset is released under an open-source licence to encourage their use in the atmospheric modelling community."

We recommend small modifications to functions in the algorithm to improve its performance. Implementing the changes in the UK Met Office climate model reduced average bias in simulated global droplet number concentrations, leading to more reflected solar radiation and a net cooling effect. 
 The representation of aerosol activation is a key source of uncertainty in global composition-climate model simulations of aerosol–cloud interactions.  The Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (ARG) activation parameterization is used in several global and regional models that employ modal aerosol microphysics schemes. In this study, we investigate the ability of the ARG parameterization to reproduce simulations with a cloud parcel model and find its performance is sensitive to the geometric standard deviations (widths) of the lognormal aerosol modes. We recommend adjustments to three constant parameters in the ARG equations, which improve the performance of the parameterization for small mode widths and its ability to simulate activation in polluted conditions. For the accumulation mode width of 1.4 used in the Met Office Unified Model (UM), the modifications decrease the mean bias in the activated fraction of aerosols compared to a cloud parcel model from −6.6 % to +1.2 %. We implemented the improvements in the UM and compared simulated global cloud droplet concentrations with satellite observations. The simulated cloud radiative effect changes by −1.43 W m−2 (6 %) and aerosol indirect radiative forcing over the industrial period changes by −0.10 W m−2 (10 %)."

Using spatially varying parameters for tree mortality and photosynthesis, we improved predictions of biomass, productivity, and tree mortality. Our findings highlight the critical role of wood density and water availability in forest processes, offering insights to use in refining global carbon cycle models. 
 Uncertainty in the dynamics of the Amazon rainforest poses a critical challenge for accurately modeling the global carbon cycle. Current dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), which use one or two plant functional types for tropical rainforests, fail to capture observed biomass and mortality gradients in this region, raising concerns about their ability to predict forest responses to global change drivers. Here we assess the importance of spatially varying parameters to resolve ecosystem spatial heterogeneity in the ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms) DGVM. Using satellite observations of tree aboveground biomass (AGB), gross primary productivity (GPP), and biomass mortality rates, we optimized two key parameters: the alpha self-thinning (α), which controls tree mortality induced by light competition, and the nitrogen use efficiency of photosynthesis (η), which regulates GPP. The model incorporating spatially optimized α and η parameters successfully reproduces the spatial variability of AGB (R2 = 0.82), GPP (R2 = 0.79), and biomass mortality rates (R2 = 0.73) when compared to remote sensing observations in intact Amazon rainforests, whereas the model using spatially constant parameters has R2 values lower than 0.04 for all observations. Furthermore, the relationships between the optimized parameters and ecosystem traits, as well as climate variables, were evaluated using random forest regression. We found that wood density emerges as the most important determinant of α, which is in line with existing theory, while water deficit conditions significantly impact η. This study presents an efficient and accurate approach to enhancing the simulation of Amazonian carbon pools and fluxes in DGVMs by assimilating existing observational data, offering valuable insights for future model development and parameterization."

Herein, we report the spatiotemporal patterns of the oxic CH4 photoproduction potential in global lakes and its contribution to diffusive CH4 fluxes via a remote sensing based photochemical model and lab-determined photoproduction molar ratio of CH4 to CO (ΔCH4/ΔCO). During the years 2011–2020, the oxic CH4 photoproduction potential in China’s lakes (>100 km2) ranged from 2.21e-7 to 5.97e-6 mol (CH4) m–2 day–1. Deep oligotrophic lakes in western China, particularly the Tibetan Plateau, exhibited a higher CH4 photoproduction potential compared to shallow eutrophic lakes in the eastern regions. Globally, the oxic photoproduction potential of CH4 from lakes (>100 km2) averaged 1.27e-6 mol (CH4) m–2 day–1 during 2011–2020. Lakes in higher latitudes (>60°) exhibited generally lower CH4 photoproduction rates, whereas those in equatorial regions (−20° ≤ latitude ≤ 20°) and high-altitude areas (>4000 m) showed overall higher rates. It was estimated that the oxic CH4 photoproduction process of inland lakes accounted for 0.1–22% of diffusive CH4 fluxes on a global scale, and the total oxic CH4 photoproduction budget of global lakes is estimated to be 0.0104 Tg CH4/year.

These ashes are characterized through ecotoxicological assays, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Within the ecotoxicology screen, produced urban ash leachates induce a greater toxic response to the microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata, while the crustacean Daphnia magna exhibited greater immobilization from synthetic wildland ash. No substantial toxicity was observed in either the activated sludge inhibition test or the seedling germination test, suggesting that ecotoxicological effects from wildfire runoff may be highly species specific. When characterizing the ashes, ICP-MS and SEM-EDS reveal that nanoparticulate copper from pressure-treated wood likely contribute to growth inhibition in Raphidocelis subcapitata.

However, increasing evidence suggests that SFX poses a threat to aquatic organisms. To investigate the toxic effects and potential risks in amphibians, bioaccumulation and elimination experiments were conducted at environmentally relevant concentrations. The results indicate that although SFX exhibits low acute toxicity and accumulation, it demonstrates neurotoxicity and endocrine-disruptive properties. SFX alters regulatory patterns of growth-related genes and interferes with the regulation of thyroid hormones and its genes, promoting the tadpoles’ growth. Additionally, SFX induces oxidative stress, leading to inflammation and immune regulation in the tadpoles. It also affects neurotransmitter transmission as well as the genes associated with neural synapses, receptor, and signal transmission and interferes with tadpole behavior. These toxic effects persisted until the elimination stage. Compared with other NNIs, SFX has the most binding sites with AChR and a weak interaction, and binding to β-agonists is similar in molecular docking. Risk assessment suggests that SFX has a potential risk and impact on aquatic amphibians, which  may be underestimated. The result provides valuable reference and new perspective for the ecological safety assessment and supervision of SFX, NNIs, and insecticides of low acute toxicity."

In this study, the effects of biocalcification on the settling behavior of buoyant MPs in the presence of Microcystis aeruginosa and Ca2+ were investigated via incubation experiments. Here, we show that the formation of biogenic calcite on the surface of MPs resulted in an increase in density and, subsequently, the settling of MPs, with its effect varying significantly with the size and aging of MPs. Specifically, biogenic calcite preferentially facilitated the sinking of smaller MPs compared to larger ones, mainly due to their different adsorption affinities for extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which provide nucleation sites for calcite. Notably, aging further enhanced this size-dependent settling of MPs, which was primarily attributable to differences in the selective binding of macromolecules in EPS. Compared to the pristine MPs, the aged ones tend to acquire more polar macromolecules from EPS, which resulted in greater complexation interactions between the MPs and Ca2+ and consequently increased biogenic calcite precipitation and enhanced settling of MPs. The findings of this study highlight the importance of biogenic calcite-mediated settling of MPs in freshwater environments."

Furthermore, jets convert kinetic energy to thermal energy. Our hybrid simulations also suggest that while jets can form downstream of the quasi‐perpendicular shock, their volume and energy content are much small compared to jets downstream of the quasi‐parallel bow shock.

A 9‐year event‐based fog isotope data set (2014–2022) from the Namib Desert was used to classify three different fog types with isotopically distinct moisture origins. We further examined the daily amount of three types of fog in El Niño and non‐El Niño years and their influencing mechanisms. The results showed an overall reduction in fog water availability after 1996. A positive correlation was observed between the simple moving average (SMA) of the annual mean air temperature and the SMA of the annual fog amount from 1970 to 1996, followed by a negative correlation from 1996 to 2022. The 9‐year event‐based fog amount data set revealed an increase in fog formation in El Niño years. Furthermore, the unique fog isotope data set showed that the daily amounts of both ocean‐ and locally generated fog were intensified during the El Niño years over the past decade. We attributed the intensification of advection fog to more frequent and stronger northwesterly winds in El Niño years. Plant transpiration could provide a critical water source for intensifying locally generated fog in El Niño years.

Designing adaptive measures to mitigate these risks is challenging due to large uncertainties in modeling future hazards and the associated sectoral responses. Here, we help address this challenge in a hydrologic context by examining the combined role of meteorological forcing and hydrologic parameter uncertainties in shaping projections of future soil moisture. By encoding a simple conceptual water balance model in a differentiable programming framework, we facilitate fast runtimes and an efficient calibration, enabling an improved uncertainty analysis. We characterize uncertainty in model parameters by calibrating against different target data sets and by using several loss functions. We then convolve the resulting parameter ensemble with a set of Earth system model projections to produce a large ensemble (2,340 members) of daily soil moisture simulations. Focusing on the eastern United States, we find that most ensemble members project a drying of soils across the region, although some simulate wetter conditions throughout this century. Our ensemble shows an increase in the frequency and intensity of dry extremes while there is less agreement for wet extremes. We conduct sensitivity analyses on several soil moisture signatures to measure the relative influence of meteorological and hydrologic uncertainties across space and time. Both meteorological and hydrologic factors contribute consistently to uncertainty surrounding long‐term trends, while changes to both wet and dry soil extremes are typically more sensitive to hydrologic parameter uncertainty. Our results underscore the need to account for varied sources of uncertainty when developing long‐term hydrometeorological projections."

Results from the coal production estimate indicate a decline in production from Federal leases; with known production of 240 million short tons (mtn) in 2023 and a projected decline to 34.0 mtn by 2051, which represents a reduction to 14.2% of the 2023 value. In parallel with this projection, total GHG emissions are estimated to decrease from 402.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2 eq.) in 2024 to 55.0 MMT CO2 eq. in 2051, a decline to 13.7% of 2024 emissions estimates. The reductions in coal production and emissions are mainly the result of planned coal combustion power plant closures, with major projected closures in 2037 and 2048. However, GHG emissions estimates for future years can be uncertain as they rely heavily on coal production estimates from operators' public business plans and other publicly available resources. Forward looking plans of this type are subject to significant changes if economic and political factors deviate from current information. Results suggest that average GHG emissions over the time series breakout to 95% end point combustion, 3.7% transportation combustion emissions, and 1.3% fugitive emissions, although there is uncertainty associated with these figures. Uncertainty stemming from production projections, sector distributions, and emissions factors on the future emissions estimates increases with time, ranging from −28% to +48% within the 2024–2051 timeframe."

Small modifications to the basic catalyst system were used to broaden the scope of the reaction to substrates containing ester, amide, phosphine oxide, and ketone functionalities.

Here, the authors reveal that DNA polymerase actively and sequentially displaces stationary SSB proteins. The SSB C-terminal tail facilitates this process by reducing energy barriers for displacement to ensure DNA replication. 
 Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) protect transiently exposed ssDNA, yet how DNA polymerase (DNAp) displaces them during replication remains unclear. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, dual-color imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations on bacteriophage T7 DNAp and SSB, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying SSB displacement. T7 SSB modulates replication in a force-dependent manner: enhancing it at low tension by preventing secondary structures while impeding it at high tension. Dual-color imaging shows SSBs remain stationary as DNAp advances, supporting a sequential displacement model. Molecular dynamics suggests that DNAp actively lowers the SSB dissociation energy barrier through interactions mediated by the SSB C-terminal tail. FRET confirms close protein proximity during encounters. Optimal replication requires SSB saturation of ssDNA, establishing a delicate balance between protection and efficiency. This spatiotemporal coordination between DNAp and SSB is critical for resolving molecular collisions and may represent a general mechanism for resolving molecular collisions, ensuring both processivity and genomic integrity.

 Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis, but charge carrier separation remains a critical challenge. Donor-acceptor COFs enhance charge separation, but the slow kinetics of water oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions lead to carrier accumulation, thereby decreasing efficiency. Here, we report T-C type COFs (T = trap units, C = catalytic units), demonstrating that units with keto-enol tautomerism can serve as dynamic electron/hole traps (T) to mitigate Coulomb forces. This design effectively facilitates swift charge transfer and extends carrier lifetimes, thereby enhancing reactions at the C units.

The genetic and ecological analysis provides insight on the potential contribution of this element in adaptation against multiple oral environmental stressors. 
 Survival strategy of bacteria is expanded by extrachromosomal elements (ECEs). However, their genetic diversity and functional roles for adaptability are largely unknown. Here, we discover a novel family of intracellular ECEs using 56 saliva samples by developing an efficient microbial DNA extraction method coupled with long-read metagenomics assembly. Even though this ECE family was not hitherto identified, our global prevalence analysis using 476 salivary metagenomic datasets elucidates that these ECEs reside in 74% of the population. These ECEs, which we named, “Inocles”, are giant plasmid-like circular genomic elements of 395 kb in length, including Streptococcus as a host bacterium. Inocles encode a series of genes that contribute to intracellular stress tolerance, such as oxidative stress and DNA damage, and cell wall biosynthesis and modification involved in the interactions with oral epithelial cells. Moreover, Inocles exhibit significant positive correlations with immune cells and proteins responding to microbial infection in peripheral blood. Intriguingly, we examine and find their marked reductions among 68 patients of head and neck cancers and colorectal cancers, suggesting its potential usage for a novel biomarker of gastrointestinal cancers.

 Type II-D Cas9 proteins (Cas9d) are more compact than typical Type II-A/B/C Cas9s. Here, we demonstrate that NsCas9d from Nitrospirae bacterium RBG_13_39_12 derived from a metagenomic assembly exhibits robust dsDNA cleavage activity comparable to SpCas9 in vitro. Unlike typical Cas9 enzymes that generate blunt ends, NsCas9d produces 3-nucleotide staggered overhangs. Our high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the NsCas9d-sgRNA-dsDNA complex in its catalytic state reveals the target and non-target DNA strands positioned within the HNH and RuvC catalytic pockets, respectively. NsCas9d recognizes the 5′-NRG-3′ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), with 5′-NGG-3′ showing the highest cleavage efficiency. Its sgRNA structure, resembling the 5′ end of IscB ωRNA, along with structural features shared with other Cas9 variants, suggests that Cas9d are hypothesized to resemble evolutionary intermediates between other Cas9 sub-types and IscB. These findings deepen our understanding of Cas9 evolution and mechanisms, highlighting NsCas9d as a promising genome-editing tool due to its compact size, DNA cleavage pattern, and efficient PAM recognition.

 During the early and mid Holocene deep lakes existed in the Tibesti volcanic complex, the highest mountain in the Sahara, but it is still unclear why they formed. Here, we combine sedimentary data analyses, high-resolution climate modelling and water balance modelling to provide a quantitative and differentiated estimate of the mid-Holocene water balance of the Trou au Natron (Doon Orei) and Era Kohor crater lakes and to discuss the underlying atmospheric circulation. During the mid-Holocene, the Tibesti received at least an order of magnitude more precipitation than the surrounding plains due to strong orographic uplift of moist air masses, which were surprisingly brought in by north-easterly winds from the Mediterranean, not by the stronger West African monsoon from the south. This may explain differences in the water levels between the Trou au Natron in the north-western part of the Tibesti and the Era Kohor in the south-eastern, leeward part. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of orographic precipitation for evaluating the hydroclimate of the central part of the Sahara – a factor grossly underestimated in the global climate models commonly used for palaeo and future climate simulations.

 Subduction initiation is a pivotal process in the Wilson cycle, yet its mechanisms remain elusive. Using 3D coupled thermo-mechanical and surface processes models, we investigated how the duration of the plate motion reversal from rifting to plate convergence and the structural versus thermal inheritance influence the location of compression-induced subduction initiation. Our results reveal that abrupt plate motion changes lead to ridge inversion-driven subduction, controlled by the inherited thermal- and melt-induced weakening. In contrast, transitions exceeding a few million years localize strain along inherited continental lithospheric-scale weak zones, enhanced by rifting-induced grain size reduction. These findings, supported by lithospheric strength and strain analysis, align with observations from inferred subduction initiation sites, such as the Algerian margin and eastern Japan Sea, highlighting the interplay between structural and thermal inheritance in controlling compression-induced subduction initiation.

 Rooftop Photovoltaics (RPV) offer a sustainable solution for renewable energy integration, leveraging urban landscapes to address environmental challenges such as carbon emissions and resource management. This study introduces a novel methodology for mapping and estimating RPV potential in Karachi, Pakistan, using earth observation data derived from satellite imagery.

Through weighted majority voting, the ensemble model achieved superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to individual models, enhancing the reliability of geospatial mapping under variable urban and weather conditions. To estimate photovoltaic yield, we integrated spatiotemporal solar irradiance data with surface meteorological measurements, including ambient temperature, wind speed, and humidity, yielding an annual RPV potential of 602.83 GWh for Karachi, with a potential reduction of 0.37 megatons of CO2 equivalent.

The PROSPECT + SAIL (PROSAIL) RTM was employed to simulate spectral (reflectance) data, and fourteen ML algorithms were assessed for implementation into a hybrid model. Kernel Ridge regression (KRR) was combined with Euclidean-based Diversity (EBD) algorithms to retrieve crop characteristics due to their exceptional accuracy and reduced uncertainty. Spectral profiles were further used to train hybrid models using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) feature selection, and combined techniques (ML + AL) were applied to retrieve LCC, Car, and LAI. Afterwards, biophysical and biochemical spatial large-scale estimation were provided through atmospherically corrected, and noise-removed EnMAP hyperspectral data with the help of a trained and tested hybrid (ML + AL) model and validated with the ground-measured datasets. The performance indicators showed significantly very high values of correlation during calibration (LCC = 0.99, Car = 0.74, and LAI = 0.99) and validation (LCC = 0.66, Car = 0.57, and LAI= 0.88).

None,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该论文主要关注非均匀表面上的辐射传输和能量平衡的追踪系统。虽然辐射传输是大气研究中的一个重要组成部分，但从标题和摘要来看，该研究更侧重于地表过程，而不是直接的大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['radiative transfer', 'energy balance', 'heterogeneous surfaces']",Tengyuan Fan;Zunjian Bian;Jean-Louis Roujean;Huaguo Huang;Hua Li;Junhua Bai;Biao Cao;Yongming Du;Qing Xiao;Qinhuo Liu,STREAM: a system for tracing radiative transfer and energy balance in heterogeneous surfaces,
None,False,Atmospheric Environment,由于只提供了标题“编委会”和摘要“摘要”，没有足够的信息来判断该研究论文是否与大气环境遥感技术相关。 编委会通常负责期刊的政策和方向，而不是特定的研究主题。 因此，无法确定该论文是否涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等内容。,[],,Editorial Board,
None,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注加拿大落基山脉降水事件发生前，利用多普勒激光雷达对精细尺度的气流场进行表征。虽然使用了遥感技术（多普勒激光雷达），但其核心是气象学研究，侧重于降水前的气流模式分析，而非大气环境遥感，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Doppler lidar', 'flow fields', 'precipitation', 'Canadian Rockies', 'meteorology']",Aurélie Desroches-Lapointe;Zen Mariani;Julie M.
