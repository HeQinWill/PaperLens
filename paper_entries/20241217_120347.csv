10.5194/acp-24-13913-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了利用无人机观测数据改进空气质量预测的方法。它使用了一种名为4D-Var的数据同化技术，将无人机采集的臭氧和氮氧化物垂直廓线数据同化到高分辨率空气质量模型EURAD-IM中。结果表明，同化无人机数据可以显著改善模型中空气污染物的垂直分布和地面浓度，并有助于评估局部排放。该研究突出了无人机观测数据在增强空气质量分析方面的潜力，为利用新型遥感技术改进空气质量预测提供了新的思路。,"['Air quality monitoring', 'Drone observations', 'UAV', '4D-Var data assimilation', 'Ozone', 'Nitrogen oxides', 'Planetary Boundary Layer', 'Emission evaluation', 'Atmospheric composition']",Hassnae Erraji;Philipp Franke;Astrid Lampert;Tobias Schuldt;Ralf Tillmann;Andreas Wahner;Anne Caroline Lange,The potential of drone observations to improve air quality predictions by 4D-Var,"Four-dimensional variational data assimilation allows for the simultaneous optimisation of initial values and emission rates by using trace-gas profiles from drone observations in a regional air quality model. Assimilated profiles positively impact the representation of air pollutants in the model by improving their vertical distribution and ground-level concentrations. This case study highlights the potential of drone data to enhance air quality analyses including local emission evaluation. 
 Vertical profiles of atmospheric pollutants, acquired by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, known as drones), represent a new type of observation that can help to fill the existing observation gap in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). This article presents the first study of assimilating air pollutant observations from drones to evaluate the impact on local air quality analysis. The study uses the high-resolution air quality model EURAD-IM (EURopean Air pollution Dispersion – Inverse Model), including the four-dimensional variational data assimilation system (4D-Var), to perform the assimilation of ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxide (NO) vertical profiles. 4D-Var is an inverse modelling technique that allows for simultaneous adjustments of initial values and emissions rates. The drone data were collected during the MesSBAR (automated airborne measurement of air pollution levels in the near-earth atmosphere in urban areas) field campaign, which was conducted in Wesseling, Germany, on 22–23 September 2021. The results show that the 4D-Var assimilation of high-resolution drone measurements has a beneficial impact on the representation of regional air pollutants within the model. On both days, a significant improvement in the vertical distribution of O3 and NO is noticed in the analysis compared to the reference simulation without data assimilation. Moreover, the validation of the analysis against independent observations shows an overall improvement in the bias, root mean square error, and correlation for O3, NO, and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) ground concentrations at the measurement site as well as in the surrounding region. Furthermore, the assimilation allows for the deduction of emission correction factors in the area near the measurement site, which significantly contributes to the improvement in the analysis."
10.5194/acp-24-13889-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文介绍了名为TOST（平流层和对流层轨迹映射臭氧探空仪数据集）的改进、更新和验证。TOST数据集提供了一个全球范围、长期且水平和垂直分辨率的臭氧气候学数据。该数据集利用臭氧探空仪数据，通过轨迹映射方法构建，并与卫星数据（如SAGE和MLS）以及飞机观测数据进行了比较验证。论文指出，更新后的TOST数据集在1970年至2021年期间的数据覆盖范围更广，精度更高，并且与其他数据集的一致性更好。该数据集可用于研究臭氧的时空变化特征，例如对流层和平流层臭氧的变化趋势，以及自20世纪90年代末以来低平流层臭氧的变化停滞现象。TOST数据集对大气环境遥感技术，特别是臭氧监测和大气成分分析具有重要意义，因为它提供了一个长期、高质量的臭氧气候学数据集，可以帮助科学家更好地理解臭氧层的变化及其对气候和环境的影响。,"['Ozone', 'Ozonesonde', 'Stratosphere', 'Troposphere', 'Satellite Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE)', 'Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Air Quality', 'Remote Sensing', 'Trajectory Mapping', 'Data Validation', 'Climatology']",Zhou Zang;Jane Liu;David Tarasick;Omid Moeini;Jianchun Bian;Jinqiang Zhang;Anne M.

Kollonige,"The improved Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST): update, validation and applications","The Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST) provides a global-scale, long-term ozone climatology that is horizontally and vertically resolved. In this study, we improved, updated and validated TOST from 1970 to 2021. Based on this TOST dataset, we characterized global ozone variations spatially in both the troposphere and stratosphere and temporally by season and decade. We also showed a stagnant lower stratospheric ozone variation since the late 1990s. 
 A global-scale horizontally and vertically resolved ozone climatology provides detailed insights into ozone variability. Here, the seasonal, annual and decadal monthly Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST) ozone climatology is improved and updated over 1970–2021. TOST is gridded at 5°×5°×1 km (latitude, longitude and altitude) from the surface to 26 km by the geometric coordinate and from the surface to 20 hPa at 26 pressure levels by the pressure coordinate, with the most recent ozonesonde data re-evaluated following the ASOPOS-2 guidelines (Smit and Thompson, 2021). Comparison between ozonesonde and trajectory-derived ozone shows good agreement for each decade, altitude and station, with relative differences (RDs) of 2 %–4 % in the troposphere and 0.5 % in the stratosphere. TOST also aligns well with aircraft, the Satellite Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) datasets. The updated TOST improves data coverage in all latitude bands and altitudes and reduces RD by 14 %–17 % compared to the previous version, taking advances in trajectory simulations and twice as many ozonesonde profiles. Higher uncertainties in TOST are where data are sparse, i.e., southern high latitudes, tropics and pre-1980s, and where variability is high, i.e., at the surface and upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS). Caution should therefore be taken when using TOST in these spaces and times. TOST captures global ozone distributions and temporal variations, showing an overall non-significant change in lower stratospheric ozone after 1998. TOST offers users a dataset with a long record, global coverage and high vertical resolution."
10.5194/acp-24-13935-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了混合相云中冰晶聚类现象及其与凇附过程的关系。混合相云同时包含冰晶和过冷水滴，其微物理过程复杂，对天气和气候有着重要影响。论文利用机载测量数据，结合云雷达和原位测量，分析了中纬度和高纬度地区混合相云中冰水含量（IWC）的空间变异性。研究发现，凇附过程（过冷水滴冻结到冰晶上）增强了冰晶的聚类。在北极地区，凇附导致了3-5公里尺度的冰晶聚类，这主要与上升气流有关，而不是液态水含量。研究结果表明，凇附对混合相云的微物理结构和演变有重要影响，可以用于改进云模式对混合相云的模拟。论文中使用的云雷达和原位测量技术属于大气环境遥感技术的范畴，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['mixed-phase clouds', 'ice water content', 'riming', 'cloud radar', 'in situ measurements', 'airborne measurements', 'remote sensing', 'spatial variability', 'clustering']",Nina Maherndl;Manuel Moser;Imke Schirmacher;Aaron Bansemer;Johannes Lucke;Christiane Voigt;Maximilian Maahn,How does riming influence the observed spatial variability of ice water in mixed-phase clouds?,"It is not clear why ice crystals in clouds occur in clusters. Here, airborne measurements of clouds in mid-latitudes and high latitudes are used to study the spatial variability of ice. Further, we investigate the influence of riming, which occurs when liquid droplets freeze onto ice crystals. We find that riming enhances the occurrence of ice clusters. In the Arctic, riming leads to ice clustering at spatial scales of 3–5 km. This is due to updrafts and not higher amounts of liquid water. 
 Observations show that the ice water content (IWC) in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) tends to occur in clusters. However, it is not sufficiently understood which ice crystal formation and growth processes play a dominant role in IWC clustering in clouds. One important ice growth process is riming, which occurs when liquid water droplets freeze onto ice crystals upon contact. Here we use airborne measurements of MPCs at mid- and high-latitudes to investigate the spatial variability of ice clusters in clouds and how this variability is linked to riming. We use data from the IMPACTS (mid-latitudes) and the HALO-(AC)3 (high-latitudes) aircraft campaigns, where spatially and temporally colocated cloud radar and in situ measurements were collected. We derive riming and IWC by combining cloud radar and in situ measurements. Ice cluster scales in clouds are quantified using pair correlation functions.During all analyzed flight segments, riming is responsible for 66 % and 63 % of the total IWC during IMPACTS and HALO-(AC)3, respectively. In mid-latitude MPCs, riming does not significantly change IWC cluster scales but increases the probability of cluster occurrence. In cold-air-outbreak MPCs observed during HALO-(AC)3, riming leads to additional in-cloud IWC clustering at spatial scales of 3–5 km due to the presence of mesoscale updraft features. An increased liquid water path might increase the effect, but it is not a necessary criterion. These results can be used to evaluate and constrain models' representations of MPCs."
10.5194/acp-24-13865-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了高海拔偏远地区云凝结核（CCN）的估算，重点关注有机气溶胶（OA）变异性和吸湿性的作用。该研究地点受附近城市污染的影响，这使得研究更具现实意义，因为它可以帮助我们更好地理解气溶胶-云相互作用如何影响气候模型。研究人员使用正矩阵分解（PMF）对OA进行了来源解析，并定义了不同的OA吸湿性方案来预测CCN浓度。结果表明，不同的方案在一天中的不同时段预测精度不同。最终，他们使用神经网络模型，结合了N80（直径大于80 nm的颗粒物数量浓度）、OA比例、f44（OA氧化水平指标）和太阳总辐照度等参数，获得了更准确的CCN预测结果。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注大气成分（OA）及其对CCN浓度的影响，这对于改进空气质量监测和气候模型至关重要。虽然论文没有直接使用卫星观测数据，但其研究结果可以为卫星遥感反演CCN和OA提供 valuable insights。,"['CCN', 'organic aerosol', 'hygroscopicity', 'high-altitude remote site', 'air quality', 'aerosol-cloud interactions', 'climate model', 'atmospheric composition', 'OA source apportionment', 'PMF']",Fernando Rejano;Andrea Casans;Marta Via;Juan Andrés Casquero-Vera;Sonia Castillo;Hassan Lyamani;Alberto Cazorla;Elisabeth Andrews;Daniel Pérez-Ramírez;Andrés Alastuey;Francisco Javier Gómez-Moreno;Lucas Alados-Arboledas;Francisco José Olmo;Gloria Titos,CCN estimations at a high-altitude remote site: role of organic aerosol variability and hygroscopicity,"This study provides valuable insights to improve cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) estimations at a high-altitude remote site which is influenced by nearby urban pollution. Understanding the factors that affect CCN estimations is essential to improve the CCN data coverage worldwide and assess aerosol–cloud interactions on a global scale. This is crucial for improving climate models, since aerosol–cloud interactions are the most important source of uncertainty in climate projections. 
 High-altitude remote sites are unique places to study aerosol–cloud interactions, since they are located at the altitude where clouds may form. At these remote sites, organic aerosols (OAs) are the main constituents of the overall aerosol population, playing a crucial role in defining aerosol hygroscopicity (κ). To estimate the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budget at OA-dominated sites, it is crucial to accurately characterize OA hygroscopicity (κOA) and how its temporal variability affects the CCN activity of the aerosol population, since κOA is not well established due to the complex nature of ambient OA. In this study, we performed CCN closures at a high-altitude remote site during summer to investigate the role of κOA in predicting CCN concentrations under different atmospheric conditions. In addition, we performed an OA source apportionment using positive matrix factorization (PMF). Three OA factors were identified from the PMF analysis: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), with average contributions of 5 %, 36 %, and 59 % of the total OA, respectively. This result highlights the predominance of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with a high degree of oxidation at this high-altitude site. To understand the impact of each OA factor on the overall OA hygroscopicity, we defined three κOA schemes that assume different hygroscopicity values for each OA factor. Our results show that the different κOA schemes lead to similar CCN closure results between observations and predictions (slope and correlation ranging between 1.08–1.40 and 0.89–0.94, respectively). However, the predictions were not equally accurate across the day. During the night, CCN predictions underestimated observations by 6 %–16 %, while, during morning and midday hours, when the aerosol was influenced by vertical transport of particles and/or new particle formation events, CCN concentrations were overestimated by 0 %–20 %. To further evaluate the role of κOA in CCN predictions, we established a new OA scheme that uses the OA oxidation level (parameterized by the f44 factor) to calculate κOA and predict CCN. This method also shows a large bias, especially during midday hours (up to 40 %), indicating that diurnal information about the oxygenation degree does not improve CCN predictions. Finally, we used a neural network model with four inputs to predict CCN: N80 (number concentration of particles with diameter > 80 nm), OA fraction, f44, and solar global irradiance. This model matched the observations better than the previous approaches, with a bias within ± 10 % and with no daily variation, reproducing the CCN variability throughout the day. Therefore, neural network models seem to be an appropriate tool to estimate CCN concentrations using ancillary parameters accordingly."
10.5194/amt-17-7027-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究的是利用多角度偏振测量和深度学习技术进行三维云掩膜，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。具体来说，论文提出了一种机器学习模型，该模型可以根据多角度卫星图像预测基于雷达的垂直云廓线。该模型仅在中心条带标签上进行训练，但可以预测整个被动图像条带上的云廓线。论文比较了不同传感器配置（包括光谱通道、视角和偏振）的相对效用，并发现多角度传感器可以恢复相当精确的垂直云廓线，其技能与视角和光谱通道的数量密切相关，更多的角度会产生更高的性能，而氧A波段对技能的影响很大。这项研究对地球观测系统（例如NASA的PACE和AOS）中的多角度传感器的效用具有重要的意义，并鼓励将计算机视觉技术应用于大气遥感。,"['Cloud', '3D Cloud Masking', 'Multi-angle Polarimetry', 'Deep Learning', 'Satellite Observation', 'PACE', 'AOS', 'Radiative Transfer', 'Atmospheric Remote Sensing']",Sean R. Foley;Kirk D. Knobelspiesse;Andrew M. Sayer;Meng Gao;James Hays;Judy Hoffman,3D cloud masking across a broad swath using multi-angle polarimetry and deep learning,"Measuring the shape of clouds helps scientists understand how the Earth will continue to respond to climate change. Satellites measure clouds in different ways. One way is to take pictures of clouds from multiple angles and to use the differences between the pictures to measure cloud structure. However, doing this accurately can be challenging. We propose a way to use machine learning to recover the shape of clouds from multi-angle satellite data. 
 Understanding the 3D structure of clouds is of crucial importance to modeling our changing climate. Both active and passive sensors are restricted to two dimensions: as a cross-section in the active case and an image in the passive case. However, multi-angle sensor configurations contain implicit information about 3D structure, due to parallax and atmospheric path differences. Extracting that implicit information requires computationally expensive radiative transfer techniques. Machine learning, as an alternative, may be able to capture some of the complexity of a full 3D radiative transfer solution with significantly less computational expense. In this work, we develop a machine-learning model that predicts radar-based vertical cloud profiles from multi-angle polarimetric imagery. Notably, these models are trained only on center swath labels but can predict cloud profiles over the entire passive imagery swath. We compare with strong baselines and leverage the information–theoretic nature of machine learning to draw conclusions about the relative utility of various sensor configurations, including spectral channels, viewing angles, and polarimetry. Our experiments show that multi-angle sensors can recover surprisingly accurate vertical cloud profiles, with the skill strongly related to the number of viewing angles and spectral channels, with more angles yielding high performance, and with the oxygen A band strongly influencing skill. A relatively simple convolutional neural network shows nearly identical performance to the much more complicated U-Net architecture. The model also demonstrates relatively lower skill for multilayer clouds, horizontally small clouds, and low-altitude clouds over land, while being surprisingly accurate for tall cloud systems. These findings have promising implications for the utility of multi-angle sensors on Earth-observing systems, such as NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) and Atmosphere Observing System (AOS), and encourage future applications of computer vision to atmospheric remote sensing."

The article details the optimization of the different elements of the instrument with simulations. This paper also presents a method to optimize laser angles for determining wind direction and strength and shows a 50 % improvement over the current angles used. 
 An architecture for a UV wind lidar dedicated to measuring vertical and lateral wind in front of an aircraft for gust load alleviation is presented. To optimize performance and robustness, it includes a fiber laser architecture and a Quadri Mach–Zehnder (QMZ) interferometer with a robust design to spectrally analyze the backscattered light. Different lidar parameters have been selected to minimize the standard deviation of wind speed measurement projected onto the laser axis, calculated through end-to-end simulations of the instrument. The optimization involves selecting an emission–reception telescope to maximize the number of collected photons backscattered between 100 and 300 m, a background filter to reduce noise from the scene, and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to minimize detection noise. Simulations were performed to evaluate lidar performance as a function of laser parameters. This study led to the selection of three laser architectures, a commercial solid-state laser, a design of a fiber laser, and a hybrid fiber laser, resulting in standard deviations of projected wind speed of 0.17, 0.16, and 0.09 m s−1, respectively, at 10 km altitude. To reconstruct the vertical and lateral wind on the flight path, the lidar is directed along four different directions to measure four different projections of the wind. We analytically calculate (and validate through simulations) the directed angle with respect to the flight direction that minimizes the root mean square error (RMSE) between the reconstructed vertical and lateral wind components and the actual ones, assuming turbulence that follows the von Kármán turbulence model. We found that the optimum angle for an estimation at 100 m is about 50°, resulting in an improvement of about 50 % compared to an angle of 15–30° typically used in current studies."
10.5194/essd-2024-411,False,Earth System Science Data Discussions,这篇论文的主题是关于植被光学厚度（VOD）产品的改进和重建，并非直接关注大气环境遥感技术。虽然它使用了卫星观测数据（SMOS和SMAP），但其主要目的是通过时空融合技术生成全球每日无缝9公里分辨率的L波段VOD产品，用于研究植被含水量和全球碳循环，而非分析大气成分或空气质量。该研究通过填补数据缺失和提高历史数据分辨率，构建了一个更完整、更高质量的VOD数据集，这对于理解全球碳循环至关重要，并可用于环境监测，例如洪水、干旱和森林火灾等自然灾害的预警和响应。,"['Vegetation Optical Depth', 'L-band', 'SMOS', 'SMAP', 'carbon cycle', 'vegetation water content', 'spatiotemporal fusion']",Die Hu;Yuan Wang;Han Jing;Linwei Yue;Qiang Zhang;Lei Fan;Qiangqiang Yuan;Huanfeng Shen;Liangpei Zhang,A global daily seamless 9-km Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) product from 2010 to 2021,"The existing L-band Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) products suffer from data gaps and coarse resolution of historical data. Our study begins with the reconstruction of missing data and then develops a spatiotemporal fusion model to generate global daily seamless 9-km L-VOD products from 2010 to 2021, which are crucial for understanding the global carbon cycle. The dataset is freely accessible for use in environmental monitoring. 
 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) products provide information on vegetation water content and correlate with vegetation growth status, which are closely related to the global water and carbon cycles. The L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. Currently, there are only two operational L-band sensors aboard satellites, namely the SMOS satellite launched in 2010 and the SMAP satellite launched in 2015. The former has the limitation of a low spatial resolution of only 25 km, while the latter has improved the resolution to 9 km but has a shorter usable time range. Due to the influence of sensor and atmospheric conditions, as well as the observation methods of polar-orbiting satellites (such as scan gaps and observation revisit times), the daily data provided by both satellites suffer from varying degrees of missing data. In summary, the existing L-VOD products suffer from the defects of missing data and coarse resolution of historical data. There is few research on filling gaps and reconstructing 9-km long-term data for L-VOD products. To solve this problem, our study depends on a penalized least square regression based on three-dimensional discrete cosine transform to firstly generate the seamless global daily L-VOD products. Subsequently, the non-local filtering idea is applied to spatiotemporal fusion between high- and low-resolution data, resulting in a global daily seamless 9-km L-VOD product from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2021. In order to validate the quality of the products, time series validation and simulated missing regions validation are used for the reconstructed data. The fusion products are validated both temporally and spatially, and also compared numerically with the original 9-km data during the overlapping period. Results show that the seamless SMOS (SMAP) dataset is evaluated with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.855 (0.947), and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.094 (0.073) for the simulated real missing masks. The temporal consistency of the reconstructed daily L-VOD products is ensured with the original time-series distribution of valid values. The spatial information of the fusion product and the original 9-km data in the overlapping period is basically consistent (R2: 0.926–0.958, RMSE: 0.072–0.093, MAE: 0.047–0.064). The temporal variations between the fusion product and the original product are largely synchronized.

We conducted a new set of experiments using a transparent true triaxial cell, which enabled video recording of the temporal evolution of fluid‐driven fracture paths. Using pseudo‐2D samples without macroscale structural discontinuities, we observed multiple occurrences of hydraulic fracture curving and branching under anisotropic boundary stresses. We proposed a theoretical model demonstrating that the stress parallel to the crack line in the solid matrix near the crack tip (i.e., the T‐stress) accounts for the observed fracture curving behavior. This finding suggests that T‐stress is an additional mechanism contributing to the complexity of fluid‐driven fracture networks in the subsurface, besides the geologic discontinuities."

Deep storms co‐occur with relatively dry, unstable conditions, while wide storms are observed in moist, relatively stable environments. We identify eight large‐scale environmental variables that serve to distinguish between storm modes, and then show that principal component analysis can be used to condense this information into just two scalar variables.

 The sulfur species present in magmatic fluids affect the global redox cycle, the Earth’s climate and the formation of some of the largest and most economic ore deposits of critical metals. However, the speciation of sulfur under conditions that are relevant for upper crustal magma reservoirs is unclear. Here we combine a prototype pressure vessel apparatus and Raman spectroscopy to determine sulfur speciation in arc magmatic fluid analogues in situ over a range of geologically relevant pressure–temperature–redox conditions. We find that HS−, H2S and SO2 are the main sulfur species in the experimental fluids, while the concentrations of S6+ species and S2− and S3− sulfur radical ions are negligible, in contrast to previous experimental work. The measured gold solubilities in the experimental fluids are highest when sulfur is dominantly present as HS− and H2S species and greatly exceed thermodynamic predictions. Our results imply that HS−, rather than sulfur radicals, accounts for the high solubilities of gold in magmatic–hydrothermal fluids. We also find that magmatic sulfur degassing is a redox process under oxidizing conditions and may lead to additional magma oxidation beyond that imparted by slab-derived fluxes and crystallization.

 Saturn’s rings have been estimated to be as young as about 100 to 400 million years old according to the hypothesis that non-icy micrometeoroid bombardment acts to darken the rings over time and the Cassini observation indicated that the ring particles appear to be relatively clean. These young age estimates assume that the rings formed out of pure water ice particles with a high accretion efficiency of impacting non-icy micrometeoroid material (η ≳ 10%). Here we show, using numerical simulations of hypervelocity micrometeoroid impacts on a ring particle, that non-icy material may not be as readily accreted as previously thought. We found that the complete vaporization and expansion of non-icy impactor material on energetic collision with a ring particle leads to the formation of charged nanoparticles and ions that are subsequently removed from the rings through collision with Saturn, gravitational escape or electromagnetic drag into Saturn’s atmosphere. Despite uncertainties in our models that assume no porosity, strength or ring particle granularity, we suggest minimal accretion of non-icy materials would occur following micrometeoroid impact. This pollution resistance mechanism implies a low accretion efficiency (η ≲ 1%). Thus we suggest that the apparent youth of Saturn’s rings could be due to pollution resistance, rather than indicative of young formation age.

Here the authors show that prior SA exposure induces non-protective CD4+ T cells, which impair IsdB vaccine protection by IL-10 secretion and IL-17A suppression, whereas IL-17A promoting adjuvant CAF01 overcomes this dilemma. 
 Pathobionts have evolved many strategies to coexist with the host, but how immune evasion mechanisms contribute to the difficulty of developing vaccines against pathobionts is unclear. Meanwhile, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) has resisted human vaccine development to date. Here we show that prior SA exposure induces non-protective CD4+ T cell imprints, leading to the blunting of protective IsdB vaccine responses. Mechanistically, these SA-experienced CD4+ T cells express IL-10, which is further amplified by vaccination and impedes vaccine protection by binding with IL-10Rα on CD4+ T cell and inhibit IL-17A production. IL-10 also mediates cross-suppression of IsdB and sdrE multi-antigen vaccine. By contrast, the inefficiency of SA IsdB, IsdA and MntC vaccines can be overcome by co-treatment with adjuvants that promote IL-17A and IFN-γ responses. We thus propose that IL-10 secreting, SA-experienced CD4+ T cell imprints represent a staphylococcal immune escaping mechanism that needs to be taken into consideration for future vaccine development.

 Plant endogenous signaling peptides shape growth, development and adaptations to biotic and abiotic stress. Here, we identify C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs (CEPs) as immune-modulatory phytocytokines in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data reveals that CEPs induce immune outputs and are required to mount resistance against the leaf-infecting bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We show that effective immunity requires CEP perception by tissue-specific CEP RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) and CEPR2. Moreover, we identify the related RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 7 (RLK7) as a CEP4-specific CEP receptor contributing to CEP-mediated immunity, suggesting a complex interplay of multiple CEP ligands and receptors in different tissues during biotic stress. CEPs have a known role in the regulation of root growth and systemic nitrogen (N)-demand signaling. We provide evidence that CEPs and their receptors promote immunity in an N status-dependent manner, suggesting a previously unknown molecular crosstalk between plant nutrition and cell surface immunity. We propose that CEPs and their receptors are central regulators for the adaptation of biotic stress responses to plant-available resources.

Here, authors used viral-genetic tools to identify the enzyme ABHD6 in postsynaptic mesoaccumbal neurons is a key determinant of body weight and reward-relevant behaviour. 
 α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) is a lipase linked to physiological functions affecting energy metabolism. Brain ABHD6 degrades 2-arachidonoylglycerol and thereby modifies cannabinoid receptor signalling. However, its functional role within mesoaccumbens circuitry critical for motivated behaviour and considerably modulated by endocannabinoids was unknown. Using three viral approaches, we show that control of the nucleus accumbens by neuronal ABHD6 is a key determinant of body weight and reward-directed behaviour in male mice. Contrary to expected outcomes associated with increasing endocannabinoid tone, loss of ABHD6 in nucleus accumbens, but not ventral tegmental area, neurons completely prevents diet-induced obesity, reduces food- and drug-seeking and enhances physical activity without affecting anxiodepressive behaviour. These effects are explained by attenuated inhibitory synaptic transmission onto medium spiny neurons. ABHD6 deletion in nucleus accumbens neurons and dopamine ventral tegmental area neurons produces contrasting effects on effortful responding for food. Intraventricular infusions of an ABHD6 inhibitor also restrain appetite and promote weight loss. Together, these results reveal functional specificity of pre- and post-synaptic mesoaccumbens neuronal ABHD6 to differentially control energy balance and propose ABHD6 inhibition as a potential anti-obesity tool.

 Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a chronic tic disorder, characterized by unwanted motor actions and vocalizations. While brain stimulation techniques show promise in reducing tic severity, optimal target networks are not well-defined. Here, we leverage datasets from two independent deep brain stimulation (DBS) cohorts and a cohort of tic-inducing lesions to infer critical networks for treatment and occurrence of tics by mapping stimulation sites and lesions to a functional connectome derived from 1,000 healthy participants. We find that greater tic reduction is linked to higher connectivity of DBS sites (N = 37) with action-related functional resting-state networks, i.e., the cingulo-opercular (r = 0.62; p < 0.001) and somato-cognitive action networks (r = 0.47; p = 0.002). Regions of the cingulo-opercular network best match the optimal connectivity profiles of thalamic DBS. We replicate the significance of targeting cingulo-opercular and somato-cognitive action network connectivity in an independent DBS cohort (N = 10). Finally, we demonstrate that tic-inducing brain lesions (N = 22) exhibit similar connectivity to these networks. Collectively, these results suggest a critical role for these action-related networks in the pathophysiology and treatment of GTS.

 The environmental use of azole fungicides has led to selective sweeps across multiple loci in the Aspergillus fumigatus genome causing the rapid global expansion of a genetically distinct cluster of resistant genotypes. Isolates within this cluster are also more likely to be resistant to agricultural antifungals with unrelated modes of action. Here we show that this cluster is not only multi-azole resistant but has increased propensity to develop resistance to next generation antifungals because of variants in the DNA mismatch repair system. A variant in msh6-G233A is found almost exclusively within azole resistant isolates harbouring the canonical cyp51A azole resistance allelic variant TR34/L98H. Naturally occurring isolates with this msh6 variant display up to 5-times higher rate of mutation, leading to an increased likelihood of evolving resistance to other antifungals. Furthermore, unlike hypermutator strains, the G233A variant conveys no measurable fitness cost and has become globally distributed. Our findings further suggest that resistance to next-generation antifungals is more likely to emerge within organisms that are already multi-azole resistant due to close linkage between TR34/L98H and msh6-G233A, posing a major problem due to the prospect of dual use of novel antifungals in clinical and agricultural settings.

Our analysis shows a variation of  ± 10% in total system costs across weather years. Layouts designed for years with compound weather events prove more robust, achieving resource adequacy of 99.9% and net-negative CO2 emissions of −0.5% per year relative to 1990 levels. CO2-emitting backup generation regulated by a CO2 tax offers a cost-effective measure to enhance robustness. It increases emissions only marginally, keeping average emissions below 1% of 1990 levels over all layouts. Our findings underscore the need for policymakers and energy stakeholders to account for interannual weather variability in future infrastructure planning. Highly renewable energy systems, built on wind, solar PV, and sectoral integration, can handle year-to-year weather variability while ensuring resource adequacy and CO2 neutrality, at 10% higher cost than systems designed for average weather patterns."

Here the authors report a method that enables the facile production of reduced graphene oxide from biomass at ambient temperature. 
 Although graphene and graphene-related two-dimensional materials (GR2Ms) hold much potential for various applications, the current methods for their large-scale production rely heavily on graphite minerals and energy-intensive techniques. Here we report a one-step dehydration–condensation method for the economical and green preparation of GR2Ms on a gram scale from biomass at room temperature under atmospheric pressure using only concentrated sulfuric acid. This protocol has been applied successfully to various types of biomass and carbohydrates, delivering a 33% mass yield of GR2M product. The properties of the product are consistent with those of classical reduced graphene oxide (RGO), with the twist that it does not need to be produced from graphite minerals. The mild reaction conditions substantially reduce the energy input, while providing a facile platform for monitoring the kinetics of RGO nucleation and growth. Compared with conventional methods, a 98% reduction in energy consumption is achieved. Overall, the results of this research pave a new avenue to scalable and sustainable GR2M production. Reduced graphene oxide materials are of great interest in many fields, but current production methods are neither sustainable nor scalable.

 One mechanism by which the ocean uptakes carbon dioxide is through the biological carbon fixation and its subsequent transport to the deep ocean, a process known as the biological carbon pump. Although the importance of the biological pump in the global carbon cycle has long been recognized, its actual contribution remains uncertain. Here, we quantify the carbon export from the upper ocean via the biological carbon pump by revealing the upper ocean dissolved oxygen balance. Calculations of dissolved oxygen budget quantified net oxygen removals from the upper ocean by physical processes (air–sea exchange, advection, and diffusion) and indicated net biological oxygen production that compensated for those removals. The derived oxygen production is converted to carbon units using the photosynthetic ratio, and inferred an estimated global annual carbon export through the biological pump of 7.36 ± 2.12 Pg C year−1 with providing insights into the overall ocean carbon cycle.

 Timely and reliable rapeseed mapping is crucial for vegetable oil supply and bioenergy industry. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing is able to track rapeseed phenology and map rapeseed fields in cloudy regions. However, SAR-based rapeseed mapping is challenging in mountainous areas due to the highly fragmented farming land and terrain-induced distortions on SAR signals. To address this challenge, this study proposed a novel SAR-based automatic rapeseed mapping (SARM) method for all terrain and weather conditions. SARM first composites high-quality dual-aspect Sentinel-1 time series by combining ascending and descending orbits and smoothing temporal noises. Second, SARM embeds a novel terrain-adjustment modeling to mitigate confounding terrain effects on the SAR intensity of sloped pixels. Third, SARM quantifies unique shape and intensity features of SAR signals during the leaf-flower-pod period to estimate the probability of rapeseed cultivation with the aid of automatically extracted local high-confidence rapeseed pixels. SARM was tested at three sites with varying topographic conditions, rapeseed phenology and cultivation systems. Results demonstrate that SARM achieved accurate rapeseed mapping with the overall accuracy 0.9 or higher, and F1 score 0.85 or higher at all three sites. Compared with the existing rapeseed mapping methods, SARM excelled in mapping fragmented rapeseed fields in both flat and sloped terrains. SARM utilizes unique and universal SAR time-series features of rapeseed growth without relying on any prior knowledge or pre-collected training samples, making it flexible and robust for cross-regional rapeseed mapping, especially for cloudy and mountainous regions where optical data is often contaminated by clouds during rapeseed growing stages."

 Northwest Pacific, where the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents intersect, is the most active region of the mid-latitude air-sea interaction. Two dominant patterns of winter cold extremes were determined, i.e., a monopole pattern and a southwest–northeast dipole pattern. Autumn-mean sea surface temperature in northwest Pacific (SSTNWP) significantly impacts the first EOF pattern of the winter cold extremes in China. This research demonstrates that subseasonal SSTNWP reversal—characterized by opposite SSTNWP anomalies between early and late autumn—also affects cold extremes, but mainly on the second EOF pattern. Both observations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the subseasonal SSTNWP reversal in autumn induce an anomalous Eurasian-like pattern in winter. Specifically, early autumn warming followed by late autumn cooling of SSTNWP enhances the northeast China cold vortex, one of the centers of the Eurasian-like pattern, and thus intensified cold advection into northeast China. Concurrently, low-latitude anticyclonic anomalies block the intrusion of northern cold air and induce adiabatic warming in the Sichuan Basin through sinking motion. The second strongest subseasonal SSTNWP reversal resulted in the strongest cold northeast and warm southwest in China in 2001. This study comprehensively illustrated how the mid-latitude SSTNWP regulate the dominant patterns of cold extremes and potentially contributed to better predict extreme climate in China."
