Fürst;Matthias Braun,Bedrock topography and ice thickness distribution of three major Patagonian outlet glaciers unveiled by helicopter-borne ground penetrating radar,"The Southern Patagonian Icefield is losing glacier area and ice volume rapidly. Although its glaciers share the same plateau, they retreat at different speeds and times. One reason for these differences lies in the unknown landscape beneath the ice. To reveal it, we used helicopter-based radar to measure the ice thickness and map the bedrock of Viedma, Upsala, and Perito Moreno Glaciers. 
 We present the first helicopter-borne ground-penetrating radar dataset over Glaciar Viedma, Upsala, and Perito Moreno, three of the largest outlet glaciers of the Southern Patagonian Icefield in South America. The dataset comprises 116.021 individual ice-thickness measurements along 232 km of flight tracks. Data were acquired during two campaigns in March and April 2022 as well as in October 2024 using a 25 MHz shielded broadband antenna deployed as a helicopter sling load. For the first time, we reveal the complex subglacial topography of these glaciers in their lower regions and measured bed reflections at Glaciar Upsala in depths of up to 800 m. The newly obtained measurements were incorporated into an ice-thickness reconstruction method to derive glacier-wide ice-thickness distribution maps and the corresponding bedrock topography. The latter exerts primary control on the response of water-terminating glaciers to a changing climate. Our 100-m gridded ice-thickness maps indicate that the three glaciers had a combined ice volume of 831.14 km³ in the year 2000. The dataset and the well-constrained glacier-wide grids provide a valuable basis for future studies aiming to better understand the mechanisms driving glacier retreat and the susceptibility of these large outlet glaciers to climate change. All data are publicly available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17464164; Koch et al., 2025a)."

 Coastal wetland vegetation plays a vital role in shoreline protection and ecosystem management, highlighting the need for accurate and high-resolution mapping of these unique and vulnerable habitats. Here, we present CCAV-10m, the first publicly available annual species-level coastal wetland dataset for China at 10 m resolution (2016–2023). This dataset was generated using a novel phenology-guided coastal wetland vegetation classification network (P_SVCN), which integrates Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery with extensive in situ observations. Validation based on 4,668 in situ samples confirms that P_SVCN delivers strong classification performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.916 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.898. Spatiotemporal analysis of CCAV-10m reveals that Suaeda spp. is the dominant vegetation type, followed by S. alterniflora, whose coverage nearly equals the combined extent of P. australis, mangroves, S. mariqueter, and T. chinensis. Notably, this work fills critical gaps in both spatial detail and temporal consistency across existing coastal wetland datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep-learning-based fusion of optical and SAR data for high-resolution vegetation mapping. Regular updates to CCAV-10m will support long-term coastal wetland research, enhance invasive species monitoring, and inform wetland restoration and precision management efforts.

The T23 model captures inner‐core wind variation with small errors, while the E04 model reproduces the broad outer wind structure at large radii well. The new wind model combines the strengths from both T23 and E04 models without the need for statistical fitting, showing great potential in reproducing the full range of simulated and observed TC winds."

Using state‐of‐the‐art climate model simulations, we explore future volume and freshwater transport changes across all three inflow pathways. We find that Pacific wind stress curl changes induce a southward migration of equatorial currents that reduce surface transport through the Halmahera Sea. The projected weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation generates Kelvin waves that propagate into the ITF region and weaken thermocline and intermediate flow through Makassar Strait and Maluku Sea. Despite decreasing volume transport, ITF freshwater transport is projected to increase due to enhanced regional precipitation. Our results highlight the remote and regional processes that will modulate ITF circulation under future warming."

Previous work established the VCP emission inventory by the mass balance (MB) method in China from 2000 to 2017, but localized component emissions and spatial variations have not been systematically investigated. This study presents a high‐resolution VCP‐gridded emission inventory in China, incorporating an updated method for emission estimation, localized source profiles, and spatial allocation. Results reveal that VCP emissions amounted to 13.88 Tg in 2022, dominated by coatings and adhesives. Industrial and domestic VCPs contribute two‐thirds and one‐third of total VCP emissions, respectively. Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and aromatics constitute over 70% of total emissions and ozone formation potential (OFP), with aromatics (3.86 Tg, primarily from coatings) contributing 17.45 Tg to OFP. The component emissions of VCPs in China exhibit distinct characteristics compared to the United States, marked by higher contributions of aromatics and N/S‐containing compounds. Spatial analysis highlights industrial VCP emissions dispersed across suburban regions, whereas domestic VCP emissions are concentrated in urban cores. Key species like m/p‐xylene and methanol align with industrial emissions, whereas ethanol and D5‐siloxane match domestic emission patterns, indicative of promising application as industrial and domestic VCP tracers, respectively. The model‐ready gridded emission inventory for VCP developed in this study can be used by a chemical transport model to evaluate the impacts of VCP emissions on atmospheric chemistry and secondary pollution at different times and spatial scales in China."

Due to substantial computational demands, however, adjoint simulations are constrained to coarse resolutions. This introduces potential biases in health risk assessments that are resolution‐sensitive. Here, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of resolution impacts on health‐focused adjoint assessments of ambient fine particulate matter pollution by analyzing variations in the GEOS‐Chem Adjoint model results across different resolutions and spatial scales. We observed that enhancing the model resolution from 4° × 5° to 2° × 2.5° increased the adjoint‐based estimates of global ambient PM2.5‐related premature deaths by 8.0%, with nearly half of the countries and grid cells showing discrepancies exceeding 20% and 30%, respectively. Further resolution refinement in eastern China to 0.25° × 0.3125°, based on nested simulations, revealed an additional 7.1% increase in estimated mortality. These resolution‐induced disparities predominantly arise from a more pronounced spatial covariation between emissions and forcing (i.e., the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to concentration) at finer resolutions. To mitigate this limitation, we developed a process‐based hybrid approach that dynamically models the inverse transport and convection processes at fine resolutions while simulating chemical and removal processes at coarse resolutions. Compared with direct interpolation methods, this hybrid approach reduces the root mean squared error by more than 40%, accurately reproducing finely resolved adjoint sensitivities and offering a promising avenue for enhancing both forward and adjoint global health assessments at higher spatial resolutions."

The Suomi National Polar‐orbiting Partnership satellite equipped with a low‐light imager enables mesopause TGW observations over distant regions, complementing the limited ground‐based observations. However, a single polar satellite passes over once every night which fails to conduct continuous observations of the same gravity waves event. The launches of JPSS‐1 and JPSS‐2 permit multi‐satellite observations with enhanced temporal resolution. Our novel approach revealed a previously unreported stripes intersection in TGWs, which seems to contradict physical laws. This phenomenon is caused by location errors associated with the mesospheric altitude. Therefore, a parallax correction model is firstly performed for the precise location of mesopause gravity waves. Taking TC Bolaven (2023) and TC Krathon (2024) as examples, after correction, the wavelengths were similar, the central positions were almost overlapping and the stripes distribution conformed to the propagation characteristic. These validate the model effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we report the first horizontal phase velocities for mesopause TGWs in distant ocean regions based on the multi‐satellite joint observation. With the launch of subsequent satellites, multi‐satellite joint observation will provide new opportunities for mesopause gravity wave propagation process."

Evidence From CMIP6 HighResMIP Simulations,"Tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) exhibits substantial interannual variability, often attributed to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies across the global oceans. However, the extent to which this variability can be driven by SST forcing remains unclear. Here we examine WNP TC activity simulated by five high‐resolution atmospheric models from the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, all of which are forced by observed SSTs. These SST‐forced simulations collectively reproduce key climatological characteristics of WNP TC activity, including their spatial distribution and seasonal evolution. On interannual timescales, the multi‐model mean captures variations in TC genesis frequency, track frequency, and power dissipation index over 1980–2014, with statistically significant correlation coefficients of 0.51, 0.62, and 0.65, respectively—indicating that SST forcing can account for approximately 30%–40% of the observed variability. This SST‐driven variability is closely linked to realistic simulations of large‐scale environmental conditions, as quantified by the dynamic genesis potential index, which largely controls both the spatial distribution and temporal variability of TC genesis. Further analysis reveals that trans‐basin SST anomalies—particularly those associated with the Pacific Meridional Mode, the Indian Ocean, and the North Atlantic—play a dominant role in modulating these large‐scale environments. Nonetheless, over half of the interannual variance in TC activity cannot be forced by SST, highlighting the limits of SST‐based seasonal prediction. These results underscore the importance of SST forcing while also pointing to the need for improved understanding of additional drivers of WNP TC variability."

Short;Matthew Williamson;Michael Perlmutter;Seyd Teymoor Seydi;Mojtaba Sadegh,Predictive Understanding of Wildfire Ignitions Across the Western United States,"Wildfires have increasingly affected human and natural systems across the western United States (WUS) in recent decades. Given that the majority of ignitions are human‐caused and potentially preventable, improving the ability to predict fire occurrence is critical for effective wildfire prevention and risk mitigation. We used over 500,000 wildfire ignition records from 2000 to 2020 to develop machine learning models that predict daily ignition probability across the WUS and incorporate a wide range of physical, biological, social, and administrative variables. A key innovation of this work is development of novel sampling techniques for representing ignition absence. Unlike traditional purely random sampling or hyper‐sampling, which does not account for temporally autocorrelated factors (such as droughts, insect outbreaks, and heatwaves) and spatially autocorrelated factors (such as proximity to human settlements, infrastructure presence, and fuel type), we introduce spatially and temporally stratified sampling of ignition absence. By drawing absence samples near the location and time of historical ignitions, we better captured the complex environmental and anthropogenic conditions associated with fire occurrence or lack thereof. Models trained without stratified sampling produced ignition probability maps that consistently overestimated fire risk during high fire danger periods, whereas models incorporating stratified fire absence samples more accurately captured the spatial and temporal variability of fire potential and achieved predictive accuracies exceeding 95%. In addition to operational utility for fire prevention and resource allocation, our approach offers insights into the drivers of wildfire ignitions and highlights the value of incorporating spatial and temporal structure in absence sampling for wildfire modeling."

Here, the authors show that when Src-family signaling kinases lack their typical myristoylation, an alternative acetylated start is detected by DCAF10, directing them to degradation. 
 Co-translational N-terminal modifications such as methionine excision, acetylation, and myristoylation govern protein stability, localization, and folding. Disruption can expose N-terminal degrons that trigger ubiquitin-mediated degradation, safeguarding the proteome. N-terminal acetylation usually protects proteins from degradation, but can also promote it through the Ac/N-degron pathway. Src-family kinases (SFKs), signaling enzymes implicated in tumorigenesis, require N-terminal myristoylation for function. Using peptide pull-downs, mass spectrometry, and AlphaFold 3 predictions, we identify DCAF10 as the E3 ligase substrate receptor for alternatively N-terminally acetylated SFKs. Combining siRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of endogenous Lyn with inducible Lyn-GFP variants confirms that DCAF10 regulates SFK levels by recognizing an N-terminal acetylated glycine residue. In vitro, a CUL4A-DDB1-DCAF10 complex ubiquitinates N-terminally acetylated SFKs. Thus, we define a novel N-degron pathway that monitors replacement of myristoylation by acetylation and activates degradation of SFKs upon acetylation. This mechanism may extend to other N-terminally myristoylated proteins beyond SFKs. Cells depend on early protein modifications for proper function. Here, the authors show that when Src-family signaling kinases lack their typical myristoylation, an alternative acetylated start is detected by DCAF10, directing them to degradation."

 Enhancing the toughness while achieving triggerable degradation in single-network polymer systems without modifying their inherent chemical composition or network architecture remains a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate a smart end-linked polymer network that “self-strengthen” during use yet “self-destruct” upon certain stimuli. Embedding nonscissile cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores within the middle of end-linked polymer networks significantly enhances both toughness and degradability. Under mechanical stress, the force-coupled cycloreversion of these mechanophores releases concealed chain segments, enabling single-network materials to exhibit threefold toughness and tenfold tear energies compared to conventional counterparts. Additionally, ball-milling griding of the bulk material unveils acid-sensitive enol ether units, leading to a markedly improved degradation profile under acidic conditions. This dual effect—originating from the force-coupled cycloreversion of cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores—provides an ideal combination of superior mechanical performance and on-demand degradability. Achieving both high toughness and degradability in mechanophore containing polymer networks is a challenge. Here, the authors incorporated non-scissile cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores into end-linked polymer networks to enhance their toughness and degradability through mechanically triggered cycloreversion reactions."

 WRN helicase is an established synthetic lethal target for inhibition in the treatment of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) cancers. The identification of helicase inhibitors is challenging as high-throughput biochemical screening campaigns typically return few validated hits that are often inactive in cell-based assays. Herein, we highlight the power of non-covalent fragment-based lead discovery in locating new druggable allosteric sites on WRN, enabling us to bypass the challenging behavior of WRN during high-throughput screening hampering hit identification. During the fragment optimization process, structures of WRN with key prioritized fragments reveal multiple conformations of WRN with significant domain rotations up to 180°, including a WRN conformation not previously described. Rooted in a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches, we present the detailed analyses of optimized chemical matter evolved from screening hits and the unique ability of WRN to accommodate diverse conformations as detailed by structural characterization.

 Recent seismological and geodetic observations have revealed shallow slow earthquakes on subduction megathrusts, offering an opportunity to explore the factors controlling megathrust slip. Identifying these controlling factors helps constrain the potential updip extent of future megathrust ruptures. Here, we investigate the factors controlling the spatial extent of shallow slow earthquakes by integrating tremor locations with uncertainty estimates, detailed bathymetry data, and multichannel seismic data for the 2020–2021 slow earthquake sequence in the Kumano-nada region of the Nankai Trough. Tremor probability maps reveal that the updip, downdip, and lateral limits of tremor activity coincide with distinct structural boundaries. These include the kink or branching of the décollement, a deep-seated strike-slip fault, and the inner–outer wedge boundary. These structures likely act as geometrical or mechanical barriers, further influenced by variations in pore-fluid pressure and by the subducted Paleo–Zenisu ridge. The results indicate that megathrust geometry, material properties of the overriding prism, fluid distribution, and ridge subduction jointly govern the spatial extent of slow earthquakes, emphasizing the need to account for these factors in assessing the potential extent of future megathrust ruptures.

 Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites with bandgaps exceeding 1.8 eV are suitable for perovskite/organic or multi-junction tandem solar cell (TSC) applications. However, their complex components easily induce hardly controlled phase heterogeneity and defects during the crystallization process. Herein, we propose a multifunctional additive, DL-methionine methylsulfonium chloride, with a unique combination of functional groups to regulate the crystallization thermodynamics and passivate defects of WBG perovskites. Our comprehensive experimental and computational results reveal that the additive synergistically promotes the nucleation kinetics and improves phase homogeneity during the crystallization process, thereby achieving uniform and low-defect perovskite films, significantly suppressing the non-radiative recombination and phase segregation. Consequently, the single-junction 1.83 eV-WBG perovskite solar cells demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% and notably enhanced operational stability. Furthermore, impressive PCEs of 26.0% and 22.1% are achieved for rigid and flexible perovskite/organic TSCs, respectively, showing great promise for pursuing flexible tandem applications.

These differences arise from finer spectral sampling distances (SSD: 7.4–8.4 nm), higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR: 170–250), and more stable central wavelength shifts (0.3–1.3 nm) within the 2300 nm methane absorption region, which collectively enhance plume discrimination against surface backgrounds. In contrast, PRISMA and ZY1-02E-AHSI exhibit lower sensitivity due to larger wavelength shifts (up to 2.8 nm) and lower SNRs (140–150). Case studies illustrate successful detection of methane plumes from diverse sources, including oil and gas (O&G) infrastructure, coal mines, and a landfill site, highlighting both straightforward and challenging retrieval scenarios. This cross-sensor comparison underscores the importance of spectral fidelity and radiometric performance for methane monitoring. The findings provide a quantitative basis for prioritizing existing assets and guiding the design of future missions, emphasizing that high SNR and stable spectral calibration are key for advancing global detection of point-source methane emissions."

Patel;Ritesh Gautam;Mark Omara,Space-based assessment of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from global oil and gas fields: Bridging the gap in current emission inventories,"•Quantified annual NOx emissions from 44 global oil and gas basins using TROPOMI/VIIRS data via the flux divergence method. •Top-down satellite-based analysis reveals current bottom-up inventories underestimate NOx emissions from Oil & Gas basins by 61-92%. •Satellite-derived NOx emissions correlate (r=0.98) with oil and gas production, suggesting emissions scale with oil and gas activity. •NOx-to-CH4ratios reveal co-pollutant dynamics, separating combustion sources from fugitive leaks to guide mitigation. 
 Identifying air pollutant sources and quantifying related emissions provides crucial information towards improving global air quality and public health. However, emission inventories for oil and gas (OG) activities inadequately represent nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions—a key precursor to tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosols—with notable discrepancies identified. Satellite remote sensing provides a unique vantage point to map and quantify these emissions consistently on a global scale. Here, we quantify annual NOx emissions from 44 major OG basins distributed globally, utilizing TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations with the divergence flux method. In addition, we use the spaceborne Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) natural gas flaring detections to further constrain satellite-derived NOx emissions. The divergence flux method, which addresses 3D topography corrections and chemical loss of NOx while accounting for wind-induced flux smearing, provides a robust approach for estimating NOx emissions. This top-down approach resolves emissions at the facility and basin scale (0.01° x 0.01°), enabling direct quantification of a major gap in current bottom-up inventories. Our findings reveal significant differences between satellite observations and established inventories, which systematically underestimate OG sector emissions. A direct comparison of our TROPOMI-derived NOx emissions against the existing inventories suggests that EDGARv6.1 underestimates onshore emissions by 61 % and offshore emissions by 26 %. The discrepancy is even more pronounced for the CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v5.3 inventory, which underestimates onshore and offshore emissions by 78 % and 92 %, respectively. These findings hold significance for global emission assessments, demonstrating that current inventories are missing a substantial source of NOx pollution, particularly from OG fields. Furthermore, our approach provides detailed spatial emission maps that enhance the granularity in depicting NOx distribution with error analysis (uncertainties: 32 %-54 %) supporting that inventory discrepancies are statistically significant, representing structural deficiencies rather than measurement error. We further explore the variations in the correlation between NOx emissions with OG production volumes and CH4 concentrations across different OG basins in North America. The observed co-locations and correlations provide important insights into co-pollution emission characteristics of methane and NOx, that are respectively a potent greenhouse gas and a reactive air quality pollutant, linked to be originating from oil and gas activity. These findings have important implications for regulatory monitoring and verification, particularly for addressing emissions transparency requirements under international climate frameworks."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are semi-volatile organic pollutants of global concern due to their ubiquity, persistence, potential carcinogenicity, and complex intermedia exchange behaviors. This study investigates the occurrence, composition, and transport mechanisms of PAHs across air, soil, and plants on university campuses with high densities of young adults (aged 18–30). Annual mean concentrations of gaseous ∑16 PAHs (total of 16 USEPA priority PAHs) were 40 ± 14 ng/m3, with 2–3 ring PAHs comprising 59.6 % of the total. Soils accumulated up to 1000 ± 710 ng/g, dominated by 4 ring (37.8 %) and 5–6 ring PAHs (36.5 %). Leaf concentrations averaged 290 ± 160 ng/g, with species-specific accumulation varying up to 5-fold, influenced by wax content (34 ± 28 g/m2), specific leaf area (210 ± 80 cm2/g), and stomatal density (69 ± 38 stomata/mm2). According to McLachlan's framework for semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs) in plants, dynamic equilibrium between the gaseous phase and plants dominated uptake in spring, autumn, and winter, while atmospheric gaseous deposition was predominant in summer. Mackay's fugacity model indicated that 3-ring PAHs (e.g., acenaphthylene, acenaphthene) showed net volatilization (ff > 0.5), with annual mean fluxes of 368 ng/m2/day (main campus) and 173 ng/m2/day (new campus), whereas 4–6 ring PAHs tended to deposit (ff < 0.5). These findings highlight the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity, species-specific plant traits, and seasonal dynamics when assessing the fate and exposure risks of PAHs in urban green spaces, particularly within densely populated university campuses."

 Monocotyledonous plants (monocots) are gaining recognition as a major source of biogenic isoprene, but are massively understudied and underrepresented in current isoprene emission inventories. In addition, very scarce leaf observational studies have been conducted to evaluate their emission flux response to environmental variables to date, representing a major gap in current models. Here, we screened isoprene emissions flux from ten monocots growing on the Ryukyu Island, Okinawa, Japan. We further evaluated their leaf-level emission flux response under varying photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and temperature and applied the “Ping-Pong” method to iteratively optimize temperature (CT) and light (CL) parameters of the G93 algorithm. The ten monocots studied were Arenga engleri, Dypsis lutescens, Livistona chinensis, Mascarena verschaffeltii, Phoenix roebelenii, Satakentia liukiuensis, Pandanus boninensis, Arundo donax, Ravenala madagascariensis, and Dracaena fragrans. Eight were found to emit isoprene, and among these, six are being reported for the first time. Plants were treated with increasing PPFD and temperature to a maximum value (ascending phase), followed by a stepwise decrease (descending phase). Their emission response to this treatment resembled a characteristic pattern observed in plants that experienced prolonged hot weather, which is poorly captured by both the default and optimized G93 algorithms. To improve model performance, we applied the separate optimization approach, where the ascending and descending phases were optimized separately. In all species, the optimized CT parameter (CT1) and CL parameter (α) of the ascending phase were higher than that of the default G93 or that of the descending phase. Basal emission rate (BER) at standard conditions (30 °C and 1000 μmol m−2 s−1 PPFD) of A. donax was the highest emitter among the monocots. The BERs of monocots reported here were lower than those of dicots under comparative hot weather conditions. These results add to isoprene emission inventories for monocot species, as well as expand our knowledge of variability in monocot isoprene emission flux response to environmental variables."

 Brown carbon (BrC) is an important constituent of atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols, and accurately measuring its mass concentration and optical property is of great importance to reduce its uncertainties in model parametrization. This study deployed the novel Bayesian inference (BI) model to determine the BrC mass concentration and absorption on an hour-by-hour basis, using online measurements of multi-wavelength light absorption and total carbon (TC) data over June and December 2023 in Wuhan, central China. BrC mass contributed to 42 % of the TC aerosol and showed comparable level in two months, while its absorption showed distinct seasonal contrast with much higher values in December. Important BrC compositions including various organic tracers were measured, taking advantage of the concurrently collected daily 12-h offline filter samples. BrC mass and absorption showed good correlations with important components such as oxygenated-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), light PAHs and biomass burning tracer-saccharides. Organic-tracer based source apportionment was conducted for both BrC mass and absorption, and nine distinct source factors were resolved. Secondary sources especially secondary organic aerosol (SOA) factor dominated BrC mass contributions in June, while biomass burning emerged as the primary source in December. The primary sources contributing to BrC absorption were SOA and biomass burning in June, while biomass burning dominated in December. Coal combustion, which was a minor source to BrC mass, was a non-negligible contributor to BrC absorption in both months. Different control measures should be implemented to effectively control BrC mass for improved air quality and to mitigate BrC absorption for its climate effect. The results from this study broaden our understandings of the relationship among chemical, optical and sources of BrC, offering significant implications for environmental management."

 Convective-scale wind analysis and short-range forecast remains challenging due to the limited availability of high-temporal-resolution surface wind observations. This study investigates the impact of assimilating conventional 10-min average wind (CAW) and maximum 2-min average wind (MAW) observations from automatic weather stations on convective-scale wind analysis and short-term forecasting, focusing on a severe squall line event that affected Beijing on 30 May 2024. A series of sensitivity experiments were conducted using the WRF-3DVar system, including both single observation tests and full-domain assimilation experiments. Results indicate that CAW data, owing to their high temporal frequency, contribute to localized improvements in near-surface wind analysis and enhance the depiction of cold pool intensity. In contrast, MAW data exert broader, more profound influence that extends through multiple vertical layers, enabling a markedly more accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional wind and the full spatial footprint of the cold pool in the convective system. The comparative analysis demonstrates that MAW assimilation generates larger wind increments, broader spatial coverage, and better agreement with mesoscale observations than CAW assimilation. Additionally, MAW data yield a more realistic temporal evolution of surface winds and more coherent representation of gust front dynamics. These findings underscore the superior capability of MAW observations in convective-scale wind assimilation. Their expansive spatial reach and robust dynamical coherence offer greater potential for improving short-term convective forecasts, positioning them as an indispensable resource for the next generation of nowcasting and data-assimilation frameworks."
