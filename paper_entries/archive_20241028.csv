10.5194/acp-24-10893-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究利用全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）无线电掩星观测数据，对 2007 年至 2019 年间发生的八次主要北半球突然平流层增温事件进行了分析。研究重点关注平流层增温与阻塞事件之间的关系，以及它们对极地对流层顶的影响。研究结果表明，平流层增温事件之前，平流层中存在明显的向上 Eliassen-Palm 通量峰值，并且在七次事件中，该峰值之前在对流层中也存在明显的峰值。研究还发现，平流层增温事件会导致极地对流层顶逆温层的增强，并且这种增强在吸收型事件中更为明显。总体而言，该研究提供了对主要平流层增温事件的观测视角，包括其与阻塞事件的联系以及对极地对流层顶的影响。,"['stratospheric warming', 'blocking', 'satellite observations', 'radio occultation', 'global navigation satellite system (GNSS)', 'atmospheric circulation', 'polar vortex', 'tropopause']",Kamilya Yessimbet;Andrea K. Steiner;Florian Ladstädter;Albert Ossó,Observational perspective on sudden stratospheric warmings and blocking from Eliassen–Palm fluxes,"Major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and atmospheric blocking can markedly influence winter extratropical surface weather. To study the relationship between SSWs and blocking, we examine dynamic stratosphere–troposphere coupling using vertically highly resolved observations from global navigation satellite system radio occultation for 2007–2019. Our results provide a purely observational view of the evolution of major SSWs, their link to blocking, and their effect on the polar tropopause. 
 In this study, we examine eight major boreal sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events between 2007 and 2019 to understand the vertical coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere as well as the relationship between SSWs and blocking events using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) observations. Our study covers the main aspects of SSW events, including the vertical structure of planetary-wave propagation, static stability, geometry of the polar vortex, and occurrence of blocking events. To analyze wave activity and atmospheric circulation, we compute the quasi-geostrophic Eliassen–Palm (EP) flux and geostrophic winds. The results show that the observations agree with theory and previous studies in terms of the primary dynamic features and provide a detailed view of their vertical structure. We observe a clear positive peak of upward EP flux in the stratosphere prior to all SSW events. In seven out of eight events, this peak is preceded by a clear peak in the troposphere. Within the observed timeframe, we identify two types of downward dynamic interactions and the emergence of blocking events. During the 2007 and 2008 “reflecting” events, we observe a displacement of the polar vortex along with a downward propagation of wave activity from the stratosphere to the troposphere during vortex recovery, coinciding with the formation of blocking in the North Pacific region. Conversely, in the other six SSW “absorbing” events from 2009 to 2019, which were characterized by a vortex split, we observe wave absorption and the subsequent formation of blocking in the Euro-Atlantic region. The analysis of the static stability demonstrates an enhancement of the polar tropopause inversion layer as the result of SSWs, which was stronger for the absorbing events. Overall, our study provides an observational view of the synoptic and dynamic evolution of the major SSWs, their link to blocking, and the impact on the polar tropopause."

Substantial plasma lifting is observed within the initial Storm Enhanced Density plume with ionospheric peak heights increasing by 150–300 km, reaching levels of up to 630 km. Scintillation is observed within the cusp during the initial expansion phase of the storm, spreading across the auroral oval thereafter. Patch transport into the polar cap produces broad regions of scintillation that are rapidly cleared from the region after a strong Interplanetary Magnetic Field reversal at 2230UT. Strong heating and composition changes result in the complete absence of the F2‐layer on the eleventh, suffocating high latitude convection from dense plasma necessary for Tongue of Ionization and patch formation, ultimately resulting in a suppression of polar cap scintillation on the eleventh."

The resulting persisting sea surface depression can easily be monitored using the present‐day altimeter constellation. Following a semi‐empirical framework, these baroclinic wake signatures are linked to the inner core TC dynamic and the ocean stratification. To collect these fine‐scale parameters, spaceborne SAR instruments and Argo fleet are used, to precisely capture the maximum wind region and the irregularities of the ocean vertical structure. This combination of high‐resolution information is found paramount to fully capture the modulation of sea surface height anomalies, and its mean trend, especially for major hurricanes. Baroclinic signatures mostly range around 10–20 cm and peak at 40 cm. Deeper anomalies correspond to barotropic response, removed from the present analysis."

The estimated ICON‐LAM and ERA5 WEPs are then compared using an innovative approach with 1.8 million eligible wind turbine placements over southern Africa. Results show ERA5 underestimates ws60m with a Mean Error (ME) of −1.8 m s−1 (−27%). In contrast, ICON‐LAM shows a ME of −0.1 m s−1 (−1.8%), resulting in a much higher average WEP by 48% compared to ERA5. A combined Global Wind Atlas‐ERA5 product reduces the ws60m underestimation of ERA5 to −0.3 m s−1 (−4.7%), but shows a similar average WEP compared to ERA5 resulting from the WEP spatial heterogeneity."

However, for the greening of existing forests, the role of human interventions is unclear. Here we paired neighboring natural and planted forests in Southern China to minimize the differences between the forest types and analyzed the vegetation index EVI2 from Landsat over 1987 to 2021. The EVI2 trends observed in natural forests can be seen as mainly responses to large‐scale environmental changes, whereas the difference between the forest types represents the impact caused by human interventions. We found that though the mean EVI2 of planted forests was comparable to that of natural forests, the greening trends were overall 7.0% lower in planted forests. Our results suggest that human interventions associated with planted forests did not accelerate their greening, indicating the necessity for refined policies to enhance future forest greening."

Unlike previously published algorithms based on data fusion, an empirical retrieval algorithm is for the first time proposed to directly retrieve high‐temporal‐resolution IWV estimates from near‐infrared radiance observations of the non‐geostationary Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI). The retrieval algorithm is developed based on an observed regression relationship between satellite‐based OLCI‐estimated transmittance and ground‐based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)‐estimated IWV in the temporal domain. The results show that all newly retrieved IWV estimates have an overall good consistency with ground‐based IWV from additional GNSS‐sensed measurements, indicating the feasibility of the retrieval approach. The performance of the retrieval algorithm is acceptable and satisfactory when compared with that of IWV retrievals listed in previous studies."

The results from July 2022 to June 2023 show the monthly variation of the HCOOH distribution in Asia. In addition, we show that FY‐4B/GIIRS effectively tracks HCOOH enhancements from wildfires both during the day and at night.

Adaptation actions, including nature‐based solutions, need to be thoroughly evaluated prior to implementation to understand system‐wide impacts and avoid maladaptation. Anarde et al.

(2024b), (https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ef004200) is the latest important contribution in a growing body of transdisciplinary research that more robustly evaluates the complex physical process‐and‐response relationship of barrier systems via sophisticated numerical modeling approaches that also interface with socioeconomic models to inform coastal management actions in response to mitigating coastal risk. This new research indicates the importance of coordinated system‐scale barrier island management, as strategies to reduce coastal hazard risk in one location will directly affect adjacent communities. Further, this work demonstrates that reducing barrier management interventions may actually promote barrier recovery and sustainability in the face of sea level rise. In addition, recent advances in the analysis and application of remotely sensed data from satellites and oblique aerial photography provide scientists an unprecedented opportunity to track coastal evolution over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales at minimal cost. As sea level rise and changing storm patterns challenge the sustainable management of barrier island systems, integrating these advanced, transdisciplinary tools will enable scientists and coastal practitioners to more thoroughly evaluate coastal adaptation options, efficiently invest limited resources to mitigate coastal hazard risk for communities, support healthy ecosystems, and reduce system‐wide impacts."

 Cloud chemistry is of paramount importance in the secondary production of atmospheric aerosols, influencing the spatial-temporal distribution of gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. Using WRF/CUACE (China Meteorological Administration Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment), this study assesses the seasonal impacts of cloud chemistry on the concentrations of SO2, sulfate, as well as two oxidizers, H2O2 and O3, in the most east-central areas of China, including four key pollution zones (the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the Sichuan Basin (SCB)). Near the surface, H2O2-oxidation was the dominant pathway for cloud chemistry in four key pollution zones in four seasons. H2O2 consumption is most pronounced in summer, especially in the SCB and NCP, while O3 consumption peaks in autumn, particularly in the PRD and southeastern coastal areas. While at higher altitudes, oxidation by O3 and H2O2 is compatible with the cloud chemistry process. Near the surface, cloud chemistry consumes SO2 ranging from approximately 0.1 ppb–5.0 ppb, resulting in the generation of about 6.0–25.0 μg m−3 of sulfate. Higher SO2 reduction and sulfate increase are in both summer and winter, especially for the SCB and NCP in summer, and the SCB in winter. Vertically, the cloud chemistry process primarily concentrates its influence on SO2 and sulfate concentrations below 5 km, particularly within the turbulent zone of the troposphere below 2 km in all the four pollution zones and four seasons. The most notable seasonal variation occurs in the NCP compared to other zones. This study also shows that cloud chemistry effectively improves the seasonal simulation accuracy of SO2 and sulfate, resulting in improved correlation and a notable reduction in RMSE."

 Over the past few years, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) has drawn significant attention as a key indicator of photochemical pollution owing to its intimate relationship with ozone and associated health effects. This study presents measurements conducted at the Korea University campus in Seoul during the high-ozone seasons from 2018 to 2021. PAN concentration was measured using fast gas chromatography with luminol chemiluminescence detection (GC-LCD), alongside measurements of O3, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NO, NO2, and meteorological variables, including boundary layer height (BLH).The mean concentrations of PAN and O3 over the years were 0.56 ppbv and 35 ppbv in 2018, 1.29 ppbv and 58 ppbv in 2019, 0.21 ppbv and 50 ppbv 2020, and 0.53 ppbv and 46 ppbv in 2021, respectively. The annual variation observed in Seoul is consistent with trends seen in major cities worldwide during the COVID19 pandemic, reflecting a substantial reduction in urban emissions. Notably, the mean concentration of NOx and VOCs decreased significantly by more than 50 % and 25%, respectively, from 2019 to 2021.At temperatures above 30 °C, PAN decomposition was accelerated, decoupling a consistent positive relationship between PAN and O3 in 2020 and 2021. The results of a 0-D photochemical model (F0AM) calculation demonstrated that PAN formation primarily stems from anthropogenic VOCs, particularly > C2 alkenes. Elevated PAN concentrations during nighttime were attributed to boundary layer expansion and upper-air entrainment. Instances where PAN concentrations surged to at least 3 ppbv or higher in 2019 were attributed to biomass burning impacted air, as evidenced by concurrent elevations in K+ and OC in PM2.5, and O3.This study underscores the complex interplay of factors influencing PAN and ozone enhancements under decreased precursor levels, with an emphasis on dynamic change in the boundary layer, and long-distance transport of non-fossil sources during agricultural burning seasons."

Cloud cover at night plays a pivotal role, impacting morning air quality. Validating a key model, our findings aid accurate air quality predictions, crucial for effective pollution mitigation in urban areas. 
 Aerosol distributions are of great relevance for air quality, especially for cities like Stuttgart, which has limited air exchange due to its location in a basin. We collected a comprehensive set of data from remote sensing and in situ methods including radiosondes for the urban background of downtown Stuttgart to determine the impact of boundary layer mixing processes on local air quality and to evaluate the simulation results of the high-resolution large eddy simulation (LES) model PALM-4U at 10 m grid spacing. Stagnant meteorological conditions caused accumulation of aerosols, and chemical composition analysis shows that ammonium nitrate (37 ± 9 %) and organic aerosol (OA; 34 ± 9 %) dominated during this winter study. Case studies show that clouds during previous nights can weaken temperature inversion and accelerate boundary layer mixing after sunrise by up to 3 h. This is important for ground-level aerosol dilution during the morning rush hour. Furthermore, our observations validate results of the LES model PALM-4U in terms of boundary layer heights and aerosol mixing for 48 h. The simulated aerosol concentrations follow the trend of our observations but are still underestimated by a factor of 4.5 ± 2.1 due to missing secondary aerosol formation processes and uncertainties of emissions and boundary conditions in the model. This paper firstly evaluates the PALM-4U model performance in simulating aerosol spatio-temporal distributions, which can help to improve the LES model and to better understand sources and sinks for air pollution as well as the role of horizontal and vertical transport."

We estimate the LP filter parameters and WEC thresholds for the piecewise‐linear coupling between SRZ and evaporative fraction (EF) at remote sensing and field scale over the Contiguous U.S. We use θS from the Soil Moisture Active‐Passive (SMAP) satellite and 218 in‐situ stations, with EF from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The estimated SRZ compares well against SMAP Level‐4 estimates and in‐situ θRZ, at the corresponding scale.

Enhanced by the excess Hunga water vapor, dehydration via polar stratospheric cloud sedimentation in the 2023 Antarctic vortex exceeded climatological values by ∼ ${\sim} $50%. Simple projections based on modeled exponential decay illustrate that the timing of the return to humidity levels that would have been expected absent the Hunga hydration depends on the ongoing stratospheric water vapor trend. With the Hunga hydration compounding an underlying moistening trend, the stratosphere could remain anomalously humid for an extended period."

However, a warming hole exists in the North Atlantic where SST has cooled by 0.4 K/century during 1900–2017. It has been argued that this cooling is due to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and subpolar North Atlantic SST has thus been utilized to estimate AMOC variability. We assess the robustness of subpolar North Atlantic SST as a proxy for AMOC strength under historical forcing, abrupt quadrupling of CO2, and a medium future emissions pathway, finding that AMOC's fingerprint on SST depends upon forcing scenarios. AMOC is important in warming hole development during significant warming periods, although SST may introduce uncertainties for AMOC reconstruction in stabilized regimes due to diverse forcing mechanisms and decadal variability. Our results caution against using SST alone as a proxy for AMOC variability—both on paleoclimatic and contemporary time scales."

Emissions of N2O are controlled by both anthropogenic and environmental factors and can vary by orders of magnitude over short times and distances. This nature of emissions is difficult to capture with models and presents an observational challenge. In the 2021 and 2022 growing season, we collected airborne measurements of N2O over Iowa to characterize N2O emissions at the farm to multi‐county spatial scales across days. We link our airborne observations to surface emissions using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and quantify emissions using a Bayesian inversion framework. We find emissions magnitudes across Iowa, showing greater skew than modeled predictions, with a small fraction of fields contributing disproportionately to the total [25% of the domain contributing to 52%–77% of total emissions]. In addition to the high spatial variation, we find high temporal variability between flight days by a factor of 2 at the 100 km scale, and an order of magnitude at the 2 km scale], with peak emissions occurring at median soil moisture. This work illustrates the importance of transient, intense emissions from concentrated areas in explaining total cropland emissions, and demonstrates how airborne measurements can provide insights into variation that may be missed by other observational systems. Investigation into environmental factors highlights the need for observations, models and their input data to be spatiotemporally resolved to enable direct comparison, facilitating evaluation of predicted and reported emissions and providing guidance and feedback on mitigation strategies."

Comparison of a control simulation and re‐initialized simulations in which land‐surface feedback is suppressed shows that much of the long rains deficit experienced between 1980 and 2014 is synchronized with the warming of the Northwestern Eurasian landmass. In agreement with the modeling results, multiple observational data sets reveal a strong negative correlation between MAM mean East African rainfall amount and the surface temperature over Northwestern Eurasia. Idealized simulations further indicate that warming in Northwestern Eurasia weakens the regional Hadley Cell and diverts the monsoonal transport of moisture away from Eastern Africa toward Europe and southern Africa, highlighting the role of remote land surface warming on the observed precipitation decline."

First, the gas‐particle partitioning coefficients of the target compounds were calculated and compared with the predictions based on the equilibrium absorptive partitioning theory. Although the vapor pressure (poL) estimation method was selected to improve the agreement between measured and predicted partitioning coefficients, n‐alkanes in Denver and PAHs in both cities exhibited stronger sorption to PM2.5 than predicted. By including the adsorption mechanism, the average logarithms and temporal variations of the partitioning coefficients were well simulated in both Nanjing and Denver. The partitioning of n‐alkanes in Nanjing can be primarily explained by the absorption mechanism, while the adsorption mechanism dominates that for n‐alkanes in Denver and PAHs in both cities. To obtain an optimal simulation, the poL of n‐alkanes and PAHs was estimated using the SPARC and SIMPOL—two group contribution methods, respectively, and the difference between desorption and vaporization enthalpies was set between 2 and 3 kcal mol−1 for n‐alkanes in Denver and PAHs in both cities.

Here, global data sets were compiled to disentangle the effects of environmental variables on EF variations along climate and land surface gradients. We found that (a) at annual timescales, ecosystem‐level EF could be expressed as a power law function of aridity index. The relationships of mean annual soil water content (SWC) and leaf area index (LAI) with mean annual EF resembled the traditional evaporative regime theory; (b) at daily timescales, the boosted regression tree method quantitatively revealed that the impacts of environmental variables (including meteorological variables) on EF showed equal importance, especially at humid sites, primarily due to the different response direction and magnitude of latent heat (LE) and sensible heat (H) fluxes to environmental changes. Particularly, the contrasting responses of LE (positive) and H (negative) to SWC, LAI, and relative humidity enhanced the positive effects of those influencing variables on EF; whereas, the correlations between EF and energy‐related factors (i.e., net radiation‐Rn and air temperature‐Ta) deteriorated as both LE and H showed positive response patterns to those variables; (c) meteorological factors were also found to have nonlinear effects on daily EF, further modified by climatic conditions. Rn near 150 W/m2 and Ta near 15°C appeared to be important energy‐partitioning thresholds at drier and humid sites, respectively. Moreover, changing interactions among environmental variables with climates were demonstrated to be important for better explaining EF variations."

 To gain insights into air quality dynamics, a high-end instrument such as High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) alongside an Aethalometer was used to measure the Composite PM2.5 (C-PM2.5) in Lucknow and Kanpur during winter. It encompasses non-refractive PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and Black Carbon (BC) mass concentrations. Significant variation was noted in average C-PM2.5 concentrations at both sites, as 168.8 ± 61.3 μg m−3 in Lucknow and 90.7 ± 25.7 μg m−3 in Kanpur. Organics emerged as the predominant component, constituting ∼55%–65% of the C-PM2.5 mass, followed by inorganics (24% and 30%) and BC (20% and 8%). The present study employs Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) on combined organic and inorganic source apportionment, resolving eight and seven source factors at Lucknow and Kanpur, respectively. Both sites exhibit significant contributions from solid-fuel combustion organic aerosol (SFC-OA), with ∼11% in Lucknow and 8% in Kanpur. However, SFC-OA mass concentration in Lucknow, at 24.67 μg m-³, is nearly double that in Kanpur (12.05 μg m-³). This was likely due to domestic coal burning in the nearby households, unregulated open burning, and burning of garbage on roadsides. The study shows that both sites were affected by oxidized biomass burning OA (O-BBOA) emissions, with increased concentration during the night due to dark oxidation by NO3 radicals. The diurnal variation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), such as O-BBOA and semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SVOOA), shows increasing concentration during daytime hours. Therefore, the photochemical aging (ta) role in SOA formation was analyzed, and it was revealed that the formation might primarily be driven by photochemical oxidation. Additionally, two inorganic-rich factors, sulfate and nitrate-related OA (SO4-OA and NO3-OA) at both sites and additional ammonium chloride-related OA (NH4Cl-OA) resolved at Lucknow. Our study shows that NO3-OA and SO4-OA formation was dominated by aqueous phase processes due to high relative humidity and decline in concentration with increasing ta (ta > 30 h) during winter."

 Light-absorbing organic carbon (i.e., brown carbon, BrC) significantly contributes to light absorption and radiative forcing in the atmospheric particles. However, the secondary formation of BrC and optical properties of secondary BrC are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed and evaluated the light absorption and environmental effects of BrC and secondary BrC from July 1st to 31st, 2022 (summer) and January 20th to February 20th, 2023 (winter) in Chongqing. BrC and secondary BrC light absorption were estimated via a seven-wavelength aethalometer and the statistical approach. The average values of secondary BrC light absorption (AbsBrC,sec,λ) accounted for 46.2–56.5% of AbsBrC. AbsBrC,370 and AbsBrC,sec,370 were significantly higher during winter (26.2 ± 13.2 and 9.1 ± 5.2 Mm−1 respectively) than that during summer (7.2 ± 4.1 and 5.2 ± 3.5 Mm−1 respectively) (p < 0.001), suggesting secondary formation played an essential role in BrC. A diurnal cycle of AbsBrC,sec,370 was explained by the photobleaching of light-absorbing chromophores under the oxidizing conditions in the daytime, and the formation of chromophores via aqueous reactions with NH4+ and NOx after sunset during winter. PSCF analysis showed that transport of anthropogenic emissions from the northeastern and southeastern areas of Chongqing was the important source of the secondary BrC in PP during winter. During winter, the average values of SFEBrC and SFEBrC,sec were 31.9 and 27.4 W g−1 lower than that during summer (64.7 and 44.5 W g−1), respectively. In contrast, J[NO2] values of SFEBrC and SFEBrC,sec decreased by 23.3% and 8.7% during winter higher than that during summer (19.9% and 5.6%), indicating that BrC and secondary BrC cause substantial radiative effects and atmospheric photochemistry. Overall, this study is helpful in understanding the characterization and secondary formation of BrC and accurately evaluating the environmental effects of BrC in Chongqing."

Using a physics-based calibration technique, we show that AirHARP achieves high measurement accuracy in laboratory and field environments and exceeds a benchmark accuracy requirement for modern aerosol and cloud climate observations. Therefore, the HARP design is highly attractive for upcoming NASA climate missions. 
 The Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP) is a new imaging polarimeter instrument capable of sampling a single Earth target from up to 120 viewing angles, in four spectral channels, and in three linear polarization states across a 114° field of view (FOV). AirHARP is telecentric in the image space and simultaneously images three linear polarization states with no moving parts. These two aspects of the design allow for a simple and efficient quantitative calibration. Using coefficients derived at the center of the lens and the detector flatfields, we can calibrate the entire AirHARP sensor in a variety of laboratory, field, and space environments. We show that this telecentric calibration technique yields a 1σ absolute uncertainty of 0.25 % in degree of linear polarization (DOLP) in the laboratory for all channels and for pixels around the optical axis. To validate across the FOV, we compare our multi-angle reflectance and polarization data with the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) over targets sampled during the NASA Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) campaign. We use the error-normalized difference technique to estimate how well the instruments compare relative to their error models. We find that AirHARP and the RSP reasonably agree for reflectance and DOLP within 2 standard deviations of their mutual uncertainty at 550, 670, and 870 nm and over a limited set of ocean and desert scenes. This calibration technique makes the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP) design attractive for new spaceborne climate missions: HARP CubeSat (2020–2022), HARP2 (2024–) on the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE), and beyond."

Calculations suggest O3 destruction at aqueous surfaces (ocean, droplets) may be strongly accelerated, but field evidence is missing. Here we compare three fast airborne O3 instruments to measure eddy covariance fluxes of O3 over the remote ocean, in clear and cloudy air. We find O3 fluxes below clouds are consistently directed into clouds, while O3 fluxes into oceans are much smaller and spatially variable. 
 The air–sea exchange of ozone (O3) is controlled by chemistry involving halogens, dissolved organic carbon, and sulfur in the sea surface microlayer. Calculations also indicate faster ozone photolysis at aqueous surfaces, but the role of clouds as an ozone sink is currently not well established. Fast-response ozone sensors offer opportunities to measure eddy covariance (EC) ozone fluxes in the marine boundary layer. However, intercomparisons of fast airborne O3 sensors and EC O3 fluxes measured on aircraft have not been conducted before. In April 2022, the Technological Innovation Into Iodine and GV Environmental Research (TI3GER) field campaign deployed three fast ozone sensors (gas chemiluminescence and a combination of UV absorption with coumarin chemiluminescence detection, CID) together with a fast water vapor sensor and anemometer to study iodine chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere over Colorado and over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and Alaska. Here, we present an instrument comparison between the NCAR Fast O3 instrument (FO3, gas-phase CID) and two KIT Fast AIRborne Ozone instruments (FAIRO, UV absorption and coumarin CID). The sensors have comparable precision < 0.4 % Hz−0.5 (0.15 ppbv Hz−0.5), and ozone volume mixing ratios (VMRs) generally agreed within 2 % over a wide range of environmental conditions: 10 < O3 < 1000 ppbv, below detection < NOx < 7 ppbv, and 2 ppmv < H2O < 4 % VMR. Both instrument designs are demonstrated to be suitable for EC flux measurements and were able to detect O3 fluxes with exchange velocities (defined as positive for upward) as slow as −0.010 ± 0.004 cm s−1, which is in the lower range of previously reported measurements. Additionally, we present two case studies. In one, the direction of ozone and water vapor fluxes was reversed (vO3 = +0.134 ± 0.005 cm s−1), suggesting that overhead evaporating clouds could be a strong ozone sink. Further work is needed to better understand the role of clouds as a possibly widespread sink of ozone in the remote marine boundary layer. In the second case study, vO3 values are negative (varying by a factor of 6–10 from −0.036 ± 0.006 to −0.003 ± 0.004 cm s−1), while the water vapor fluxes are consistently positive due to evaporation from the ocean surface and spatially homogeneous. This case study demonstrates that the processes governing ozone and water vapor fluxes can become decoupled and illustrates the need to elucidate possible drivers (physical, chemical, or biological) of the variability in ozone exchange velocities on fine spatial scales (∼ 20 km) over remote oceans."

It employs machine learning to correct the AOD-to-PM2.5 conversion ratio using various data sources. The approach produces high-resolution PM2.5 estimates with improved accuracy. The method is flexible and can incorporate additional training data from different sources, making it a valuable tool for air quality monitoring and epidemiological studies. 
 Estimates of PM2.5 levels are crucial for monitoring air quality and studying the epidemiological impact of air quality on the population. Currently, the most precise measurements of PM2.5 are obtained from ground stations, resulting in limited spatial coverage. In this study, we consider satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval, which involves conversion of high-resolution satellite retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) into high-resolution PM2.5 retrieval. To improve the accuracy of the AOD-to-PM2.5 conversion, we employ the machine-learning-based post-process correction to correct the AOD-to-PM conversion ratio derived from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis model data. The post-process-correction approach utilizes a fusion and downscaling of satellite observation and retrieval data, MERRA-2 reanalysis data, various high-resolution geographical indicators, meteorological data, and ground station observations for learning a predictor for the approximation error in the AOD-to-PM2.5 conversion ratio. The corrected conversion ratio is then applied to estimate PM2.5 levels given the high-resolution satellite AOD retrieval data derived from Sentinel-3 observations. The region of study is central Europe during the year 2019. Our model produces PM2.5 estimates with a spatial resolution of 100 m at satellite overpass times with R2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 6.2 µg m−3. The corresponding metrics for monthly averages are R2 = 0.72 and RMSE = 3.7 µg m−3. Additionally, we have incorporated an ensemble of neural networks to provide error envelopes for machine-learning-related uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates.

These wells, a result of over a century of fossil fuel extraction without adequate regulation, lack basic information like location and depth, emit greenhouse gases, and leak toxic substances into groundwater. For most of these wells, basic information such as well location and depth is unknown or unverified. Addressing this issue necessitates innovative and interdisciplinary approaches for locating, characterizing, and mitigating their environmental impacts. Our survey of the United States revealed the need for tools to identify well locations and assess conditions, prompting the development of technologies including machine learning to automatically extract information from old records (95%+ accuracy), remote sensing technologies like aero-magnetometers to find buried wells, and cost-effective methods for estimating methane emissions. Notably, fixed-wing drones equipped with magnetometers have emerged as cost-effective and efficient for discovering unknown wells, offering advantages over helicopters and quadcopters. Efforts also involved leveraging local knowledge through outreach to state and tribal governments as well as citizen science initiatives. These initiatives aim to significantly contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gases and improving air and water quality."

However, the removal of NO faces challenges of low efficiency, high energy consumption, and production of toxic NO2 byproducts.

Fe single atoms (Fe SAs)-anchored NH2-UiO-66(Zr) (Fe SAs@NU) was synthesized. The five-coordinated Fe SAs undergo a transient structure reconstitution during the photo-Fenton process, which enables a novel heterolytic cleavage pathway of H2O2 to derive specific ·OOH/·O2– radicals as reactive oxygen species. Therefore, a high NO (550 parts per billion) removal rate of 81% (NO3– selectivity up to 99%) is achieved under visible-light irradiation (>420 nm).

It is unclear how combinations of different low‐frequency internal climate modes influence Arctic amplification on the decadal timescale. Here, the decadal Arctic SAT variation, its connection with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and possible underlying mechanisms, are investigated based on several independent observational proxies, pre‐industrial experiments, and historical large ensembles of two CMIP6 models. Our study suggests that AMOC and Arctic SAT vary in phase on the decadal timescale, whereas this relationship is insignificant at the interannual timescale. Further analysis shows that the AMOC accompanied with cross‐basin oceanic water/heat transport between Atlantic and Arctic would alter air–sea interface exchange over the melting ice regions, and then amplified poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transports. The resulting enhanced downward longwave radiation ultimately warms the Arctic SAT. Additionally, the decadal‐scale North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) can modulate the relationship between AMOC and Arctic SAT by influencing poleward moisture transport and cross‐basin circulation. Specifically, the phase shift of combined NPO and AMOC can contribute 14%–41% covariance relationship between AMOC and Arctic SAT.

While earlier research has uncovered significant point‐source methane emissions from O&G production in the US and Canada, which are key regions with large methane emissions, a comprehensive post‐COVID‐19 survey has been notably absent. Here, we perform a detailed survey of methane super‐emitters across multiple basins of North America (Marcellus Shale, Haynesville/Bossier Shale, Permian Basin and Montney Shale) using the new Chinese Gaofen5‐01A/02 (GF5‐01A/02) satellite measurements during 2022–2023. We detect 139 individual methane plumes emanating from 122 point sources, with flux rates ranging from 519 to 16,071 kg hr−1. These emissions exhibit a highly skewed and heavy‐tailed distribution, constituting approximately 23% of the flux inversion with TROPOMI in the sample region, with a range of 13%–40%. Moreover, we observe a 66.7% reduction in methane emissions in Permian Basin during COVID‐19, followed by fluctuations until spring 2023. By summer 2023, methane emissions rebound to twice their previous magnitude (1.68 ± 0.58 Tg a−1). Using these point‐source surveys, we further quantify a regional methane emission of 2.69 ± 0.86 Tg a−1 in Permian Basin. This estimation closely aligns with top‐down inversions (2.22 ± 0.40 Tg a−1) from TROPOMI. The upscale estimation underscores the effectiveness of high‐resolution remote sensing measurements in improving bottom‐up emissions inventories and refining regional methane emission assessments. Our results highlight the potential climate benefits derived from regular monitoring and specific remediation efforts focused on relatively few strong point‐source emissions."

Here, we assess the effect of retrieval errors due to the neglect of 3D radiative transfer during the retrieval process on this analysis of ACI. We use an ensemble of stochastically‐modeled cloud fields and 3D radiative transfer simulations to study the retrieval errors at a solar zenith angle of 30°. Simulated retrieval biases in droplet number concentration (Nd) for all three MODIS channels vary systematically from +35% to −80% as cloud heterogeneity increases. Pixel‐level errors can be much larger. Commonly utilized subsampling strategies do not reduce the systematic variation in retrieval error. Negative error correlations between optical depth and droplet effective radius produce spuriously negative slopes between the logarithm of liquid water path and Nd (−1.0 to −0.3). Pixels at the center of (8 km)2 patches that are not overcast have a relative bias in Nd of −50%. The relative frequency of these biased pixels varies linearly with the clear fraction in MODIS data and form the basis for a simple parameterization of Nd bias that varies with cloud fraction (CF). Using this parameterization, synthetic data experiments indicate that estimates of the first indirect effect in the tropical ocean can be overestimated by up to 30%, and the effect of aerosol on CF is overestimated by 50%, due to neglecting the correlation between retrieval errors and cloud microphysics."

 Multi-year La Niña events cause prolonged climate disruptions worldwide, but a systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms is not yet established. Here we show using observations and models from the sixth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project that a greater frequency of consecutive La Niña events is tied to the upper equatorial Pacific Ocean when it favors more rapid heat discharge. The propensity for heat discharge is underscored by negative skewness in upper-ocean heat content, underpinned by southward tropical Pacific wind shift during austral summer. Models with stronger westerly anomalies south of the equator simulate steeper east-to-west upward tilt of the thermocline that is favorable for a greater discharge rate. This highlights the crucial role of the southward wind shift in the nonlinear system of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The large inter-model spread in multi-year La Niña processes underscores the need in constraining models for reliable climate prediction and projection."

By analyzing the output of various climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we found pronounced spatial disparity of projected heatwave increases in the Northern Hemisphere, even outstretching seven-fold inter-regional differences in extreme heatwave occurrences, attributed primarily to future changes in heat-dome-like circulations and soil moisture–temperature coupling. Specifically, we found that by the end of the 21st century, the modulations of combined Pacific El Niño and positive Pacific Meridional Mode on magnified heat-dome-like circulations would be translated into summertime hotspots over western Asia and western North America. Amplified soil moisture–temperature couplings then further aggravate the heatwave intensity over these two hotspots.

 Weather forecasting is crucial for scientific research and society. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have achieved significant advancements in medium-range weather forecasting. However, they generally depend on the initial fields generated by the computationally expensive four-dimensional variational (4DVar) data assimilation (DA) technique, which limits their real-time applicability in multivariate three-dimensional (3D) weather forecasting. Here we propose 4DVarFormer by exploring the potential of integrating the 4DVar constraint into an attention-based neural network. 4DVarFormer eliminates the need for background error covariance statistics and the complex adjoint model development. It can generate multivariate 3D weather states within 0.37 s. Moreover, 4DVarFormer can capture inter-variable relationships, allowing the assimilation of observed variables to correct unobserved variables. Hence, medium-range forecasts initiated by 4DVarFormer outperform those of DL-based DA methods and achieve performance comparable to the forecasts initiated by ERA5 reanalyses. These promising findings contribute to future advancements in integrated end-to-end DL weather forecasting systems."

 Black carbon is a refractory form of organic carbon formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Riverine transport is considered the dominant pathway of black carbon to the coastal oceans. However, the provenance and pathways of black carbon to the open ocean remain unknown. Here we use both stable and radiogenic isotopes of carbon to show that sedimentary black carbon across the equatorial Atlantic Ocean is aeolian and primarily derived from biomass burning of C4-plants. Fluxes of surface sedimentary black carbon measured along an equatorial Atlantic Ocean transect using chemothermal oxidation at 375 °C were relatively consistent across the Atlantic, ranging from 0.10–0.35 mg cm−2 kyr−1. Carbon isotope values near Africa suggest the black carbon was mostly young and derived from C4 plants, whereas offshore South America, the black carbon was older and dominated by C3 plants. The black carbon radiocarbon values were similar to the reservoir corrected total organic carbon near Africa, implying little pre-aging on land and increased westwards. These findings highlight the influence of C4-biomass burning in the tropical Atlantic and the importance of aeolian deposition as a black carbon source within the global carbon cycle.

 Volcanic tsunamis pose significant threats to nearby coastal communities. Despite extensive research, the mechanism behind tsunami generation remains unclear, and the ability to forecast a destructive tsunami has proven elusive. Here we present findings from the 2022 Tonga volcanic incident, showing that the leading air-pressure wave holds promise as a key predictor of tsunami behavior. We constructed an integrated atmosphere-ocean model to explain the underlying mechanism and validated it with various data, including satellite altimetry measurements. Contrary to prior hypotheses, our results reveal that: (1) the eruption process governs both the air-pressure and tsunami dynamics; and (2) the resulting crater volume controls the volcanic ejecta that produces the air-pressure waves, while the corresponding mass loss in the ocean triggers influxes of water into the crater, generating the tsunami. This study unveils a coupled atmosphere-ocean source mechanism in generating volcanic tsunamis and advocates for incorporating air-pressure sensors into early warning systems.

 Tropical cyclone activity often leads to many adverse impacts and assessing their destructiveness is a crucial scientific concern. Here we investigated changes in the destructiveness of tropical cyclones worldwide using the power dissipation index and found that there is no clear trend in most basins, but a significant decrease in power dissipation index has been detected in the South Indian Ocean basin since 1994, which is almost entirely due to a decrease in both tropical cyclone frequency and duration in this basin. The decrease in tropical cyclone frequency is influenced by increased atmospheric stability. The decrease in tropical cyclone duration can be attributed to the changes in tropical cyclone locations. In addition, the weakened subtropical high is only observed in the South Indian Ocean (i.e., the Mascarene High), which is also associated with the decrease in tropical cyclone destructiveness. These findings have implications for assessing the destructive potential of future tropical cyclones.

 Accurate detection sensitivity characterization of remote methane monitoring technologies is critical for designing, implementing, and auditing effective emissions monitoring and mitigation programs. Several research groups have developed test methods based on single/double-blind controlled release protocols and regression-based data analysis techniques to create probability of detection (PoD) models for characterizing remote sensor detection sensitivities. The previously created methods and models account for some of the important factors that affect detection sensitivity, such as wind speed, and in the case of Conrad et al. flight altitude. However, these models do not account for other important factors, such as 1) light levels received by the remote sensor due to variations in terrain albedo or other factors, 2) spatial density of remote sensing measurements, or 3) variation in individual sensor performance. In this paper, we build on the work of Conrad et al. by introducing a gas concentration noise (GCN) model for Gas Mapping LiDAR aerial methane detection technology that, when combined with wind speed at the emission location, accounts for all significant sensor and environmental parameters that affect detection sensitivity for scenarios involving an isolated emission source - a source that does not spatially overlap with a methane plume originating from another source location. We incorporate the GCN model into Conrad et al.'s PoD model and apply it to several sets of controlled release data acquired across widely varying deployment and environmental conditions to develop PoD models for Bridger Photonics Inc.'s first- and second-generation (GML 1.0 and GML 2.0, respectively) Gas Mapping LiDAR sensors. Finally, we compare controlled release data acquired by GML 2.0 in different geographic regions and terrain cover types, in different wind conditions, deployed on different aircraft types, and with different flight parameters. Results show that the GML 2.0 PoD model remains valid regardless of the location or conditions under which the sensors are deployed, and the aircraft and flight parameters used for deployment. Based on PoD measurements in 12 production basins across North America, the average 90 % PoD emission rate for sites measured by GML 2.0 in 2023 was 1.27 kg/h."

 Radiative efficiency (RE) is a climate metric adopted in international reports on climate change to quantify the greenhouse capacity of gases, and hence to guide decision-making processes and drive transitions in the production and utilization of chemicals in different application fields. Key quantities for the determination of the RE of a gas are the atmospheric irradiance profile and the infrared (IR) absorption cross section spectrum. The latter is usually measured experimentally, even though acquiring high-quality IR spectra can pose severe challenges, sometimes limiting the accuracy or the accessible spectral range. While computational quantum chemistry methods have emerged as valuable tools to simulate IR absorption properties, their application to REs estimation is still limited to the use of the double-harmonic approximation, which presents fundamental limitations. In this work, a cost-effective quantum chemical (QC) workflow including non-empirical anharmonic contributions to spectral properties and an automatic identification of conformer distribution is presented for the accurate evaluation of REs using a range of atmospheric irradiance profiles. Different levels of theory are considered, according to the current state-of-the-art, and the accuracy of the QC RE tool is demonstrated with reference to a number of representative halocarbons widely used in refrigeration, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical fields. The results show that REs can be computed with an average accuracy of 5% using double-hybrid functionals, which overshoot the widely used B3LYP method. Finally, the QC methodology is applied to determine the REs of selected halocarbons for which data is limited, or to address some contradictory results appeared in the literature for some species. The outcomes of this work demonstrate that QC anharmonic IR cross section spectra can be used to estimate REs with an accuracy on par with that of experimental measurements, hence applicable to challenging cases for providing data for policymakers as well for screening purposes when seeking new replacement compounds."

This study presents a comprehensive assessment and comparison of the historical changes and driving factors behind CHD and CHW using observational data and climate model simulations. Findings indicate a notable surge in CHD and CHW occurrences, with CHW experiencing a higher increasing rate. Our investigation further reveals that anthropogenic climate change predominantly drives the increase in both types of compound extremes, especially for CHW. In contrast, land-atmosphere feedbacks have a limited impact on CHW at a global scale, but substantially contributes to the rise in CHD by reinforcing the negative precipitation-temperature coupling. This influence even surpasses that of anthropogenic climate change in specific regions. Understanding these variations and underlying causes is crucial for improving prediction accuracy and mitigating the impacts of compound extremes."

Meijer,Interannual variations in the Δ(17O) signature of atmospheric CO2 at two mid-latitude sites suggest a close link to stratosphere–troposphere exchange,"We present records of the triple oxygen isotope signature (Δ(17O)) of atmospheric CO2 obtained with laser absorption spectroscopy from two mid-latitude stations. Significant interannual variability is observed in both records. A model sensitivity study suggests that stratosphere–troposphere exchange, which carries high-Δ(17O) CO2 from the stratosphere into the troposphere, causes most of the variability. This makes Δ(17O) a potential tracer for stratospheric intrusions into the troposphere. 
 Δ(17O) measurements of atmospheric CO2 have the potential to be a tracer for gross primary production and stratosphere–troposphere mixing. A positive Δ(17O) originates from intrusions of stratospheric CO2, whereas values close to −0.21 ‰ result from the equilibration of CO2 and water, which predominantly happens inside plants. The stratospheric source of CO2 with high Δ(17O) is, however, not well defined in the current models. More, and long-term, atmospheric measurements are needed to improve this. We present records of the Δ(17O) of atmospheric CO2 obtained with laser absorption spectroscopy from Lutjewad in the Netherlands (53°24′ N, 6°21′ E) and Mace Head in Ireland (53°20′ N, 9°54′ W) that cover the period 2017–2022. The records are compared with a 3-D model simulation, and we study potential model improvements. Both records show significant interannual variability of up to 0.3 ‰. The total range covered by smoothed monthly averages from the Lutjewad record is −0.34 ‰ to −0.12 ‰, which is significantly higher than the range of −0.20 ‰ to −0.17 ‰ for the model simulation. The 100 hPa 60–90° N monthly-mean temperature anomaly was used as a proxy to scale stratospheric downwelling in the model. This strongly improves the correlation coefficient of the simulated and observed year-to-year Δ(17O) variations over the period 2019–2021 from 0.40 to 0.82. As the Δ(17O) of atmospheric CO2 seems to be dominated by stratospheric influx, its use as a tracer for stratosphere–troposphere exchange should be further investigated."

This study provides measurements of TBs from various biomass-burning events and ages, enhancing our knowledge of TB emissions and our understanding of their climate impact. 
 Biomass burning emits large numbers of organic aerosol particles, a subset of which are called tarballs (TBs). TBs possess a spherical morphology and unique physical, chemical, and optical properties. They are recognized as brown-carbon aerosol particles, influencing the climate through the absorption of solar radiation. Aerosol particles were collected from wildfire and agricultural-fire smoke sampled by NASA's DC-8 aircraft during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign in the western US from July to September 2019. This study developed an image analysis method using deep learning to distinguish TBs from other round particles that deformed on the substrate, based on the particles' morphological characteristics in transmission electron microscopy images. This study detected 4567 TBs, with most occurring < 10 h downwind of the emissions, and measured their compositions, abundance, sizes, and mixing states. The number fraction, mass fraction, and concentration of TBs in wildfire smoke corresponded to 10 ± 1 %, 10 ± 2 %, and 10.1 ± 4.6 µg m−3, respectively. As the smoke aged for up to 5 h after emission, the TB number fractions roughly increased from 5 % to 15 %, indicating that TBs are processed primary particles. We also observed TBs associated with pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) activity and various TB mixing states. This study reveals the abundance, as well as the physical and chemical properties, of a wide range of TBs from various biomass-burning events and enhances our knowledge of TB emissions, contributing to the evaluation of the climate impact of TBs."

While active satellite sensors are the most accurate for detecting cirrus clouds, they are not ideal for long-term studies. This study compares MODIS and CALIOP data, testing six MODIS methods and two ISCCP tests. The ATC test was the most effective, achieving 72.98 % accuracy during daytime and 59.50 % at night, making it suitable for creating a high-level cloud mask. 
 All clouds influence the Earth's radiative budget, with their net radiative forcing being negative. However, high-level clouds warrant special attention due to their atmospheric warming effects. A comprehensive characterization of cirrus requires information on cloud coverage, obtainable from various data types. Active satellite sensors are presently the most accurate source for cirrus data, but their usefulness in climatological studies is limited. On the contrary, passive data, available for the past 40 years with sufficient temporal resolution for climatological research, were not specifically designed for cirrus detection. In this study, we assessed the utility of MODIS standard products for creating a cirrus mask by validating them against CALIOP data. Our objective was to determine if a MODIS product exists that detects cirrus with the same accuracy as CALIOP."

We developed the U-Surf data, a 1km-resolution dataset that provides key urban surface properties worldwide. U-Surf enhances urban representation in models, enables city-to-city comparison, and supports kilometer-scale Earth system modeling. Its broader applications can be extended to machine learning and many other non-climatic practices. 
 High-resolution urban climate modeling has faced substantial challenges due to the absence of a globally consistent, spatially continuous, and accurate dataset to represent the spatial heterogeneity of urban surfaces and their biophysical properties. This deficiency has long obstructed the development of urban-resolving Earth System Models (ESMs) and ultra-high-resolution urban climate modeling, particularly at large scales. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind 1km-resolution present-day (circa-2020) global continuous urban surface parameter dataset – U-Surf. Using the urban canopy model (UCM) in the Community Earth System Model as a base model for developing dataset requirements, U-Surf leverages the latest advances in remote sensing, machine learning, and cloud computing to provide the most relevant urban surface biophysical parameters, including radiative, morphological, and thermal properties, for UCMs at the facet- and canopy-level. Our high-resolution U-Surf dataset significantly improves the representation of the urban land heterogeneity both within and across cities globally. U-Surf provides essential, high-fidelity surface biophysical constraints to urban-resolving ESMs, enables detailed city-to-city comparisons across the globe, and supports the next-generation kilometer-resolution Earth system modeling across scales. U-Surf parameters can be easily converted or adapted to various types of UCMs, such as those embedded in weather and regional climate models, as well as air quality models. The fundamental urban surface constraints provided by U-Surf are also relevant as features for machine learning models and can have other broad-scale applications for socioeconomic, public health, and urban planning contexts. We expect U-Surf to promote the research frontier on urban systems science, climate-sensitive urban design, and coupled human-Earth systems in the future.

 We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on three months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts known major features of atmospheric chemistry, such as summertime surface pollution and biomass burning activities. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics."

In the environment, PAHs are highly complex in chemical composition, and a great variety of PAHs tend to co-occur. Despite extensive investigation on the photochemical behavior of individual PAH molecules, the photochemical interaction among these coexisting PAHs is still not well understood. Here, we show that during photooxidation, there is a strong photochemical synergistic effect among PAHs extracted from soot particles. We find that neither small PAHs with low molecular weights of 200–350 Da and 4–8 aromatic rings (named PAHsmall) nor large PAHs with high molecular weights of 350–600 Da and 8–14 aromatic rings (named PAHlarge) undergo photooxidation under red-light irradiation (λ = 648 nm), even though PAHlarge can absorb light with this wavelength. Interestingly, when PAHlarge is mixed with PAHsmall, substantial photooxidation is observed for both PAHlarge and PAHsmall. Comparisons of in situ infrared (IR), high-resolution mass spectrometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis indicate that the presence of PAHsmall inhibits the light quenching effect arising from the π–π stacking of PAHlarge. This leads to the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2), which initiates the photooxidation. Our findings reveal a new mechanism for the photooxidation of PAHs and suggest that complex atmospheric PAHs exhibit distinct photoreactivity from simple systems."

Lawrence;Jeff Derry,Microplastic and Associated Black Particles From Road‐Tire Wear: Implications for Radiative Effects Across the Cryosphere and in the Atmosphere,"The environmental effects of airborne micro‐ and nano‐size plastic particles are poorly understood. Microscopy and chemical analyses of atmospherically deposited particles on snow surfaces at high elevation (2,865–3,690 m) in the Upper Colorado River basin (UCRB; Colorado Rocky Mountains) revealed the presence of black substances intimately associated with microplastic fibers, particles interpreted to have originated as tire matter. Identical and similar particles occur in shredded tires and road‐surface samples. The substance responsible for the black color of all tires is carbon black, a graphitic light‐absorbing tire additive produced by hydrocarbon combustion that homogeneously permeates the mixture of tire polymers and other additives. Such black tire matter may thus exert radiative effects closely similar to those of black carbon. The presence in snow of many organic compound types common to tires, measured by two‐dimensional gas chromatography, suggests that atmospherically deposited black road‐tire‐wear matter is among the light‐absorbing particulates that advance the onset and rate of snow melt in the UCRB. The mass of road‐tire‐wear particles shed from vehicles may be estimated by multiplying measured amounts of eroded tire‐per‐distance traveled by vehicular distances. Under a combination of measurements and assumptions about the amounts and radiative properties of atmospheric tire‐wear particles, the radiative effects of these particles might add about 10%–30% to those effects from black carbon, an estimate ripe for revision. On regional and global scales, the amounts and effects of emitted and deposited tire‐wear matter likely vary by factors of geographic source, transport pathway, and depositional setting."

Liquid chromatography-orbitrap mass spectrometry detected 4536−5560 and 2067− 3489 organic molecular formulas in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI−) electrospray ionization modes, respectively. CHO and CHON compounds accounted for over 80% and 60% of total abundance in ESI+ and ESI−, respectively, suggesting their significant contribution to urban OA. The number and abundance percentages of CHO showed obvious seasonal variation, with more CHO in summer than in winter, while CHON exhibited the opposite trend in Beijing and Shanghai. Compared with winter, a lower unsaturation degree, reduced aromaticity, and higher oxidation state of OA in summer were observed in Beijing and Shanghai, while these seasonal variations were not as obvious in Guangzhou, likely due to regional climate differences. The number percentage of common compounds between Beijing and Shanghai was higher than that between Guangzhou and Beijing (or Shanghai). Nitroaromatic compounds were more prevalent in winter than in summer. Further analysis of atmospheric formation relevance and precursor-product pairs suggested that CHON compounds are derived from the oxidization or hydrolyzation processes, revealing potential chemical transformations of these aerosols.

We noted that heavy rainfall in the Philippines during the winter monsoon occurs during a strong East Asian Winter Monsoon and caused by the interaction of shear line and low-level cyclonic vortex. The different location of rainfall maxima in each HRE cluster is a result of the variation of locations of the shear line and cyclonic vortex."

Baekdu was a multiphase eruption with two main phases separated approximately by one or two months, and was less climatically significant than previously thought, according to high-resolution glaciochemical and tephra analyses of an ice core in Greenland. 
 The Millennium Eruption of Mt. Baekdu, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in the Common Era, initiated in late 946. It remains uncertain whether its two main compositional phases, rhyolite and trachyte, were expelled in a single eruption or in two. Investigations based on proximal and medial ash have not resolved this question, prompting us to turn to high-resolution ice-core evidence. Here, we report a suite of glaciochemical and tephra analyses of a Greenlandic ice core, identifying the transition from rhyolitic to trachytic tephra with corresponding spikes in insoluble particle fallout. By modeling annual snow accumulation, we estimate an interval of one to two months between these spikes, which approximates the hiatus between two eruptive phases. Additionally, negligible sulfur mass-independent fractionation, near-synchroneity between particle and sulfate deposition, and peak sulfur fallout in winter all indicate an ephemeral aerosol veil. These factors limited the climate forcing potential of the Millennium Eruption. The Millennium Eruption of Mt.

 The Tibetan Plateau glaciers, among the world’s most remote and pristine places, provide water to millions and play a vital environmental role. We measured the lead isotopic composition in a dusty ice core from the Guliya ice cap in northwest Tibet, from approximately 36 thousand years Before Present (Stone Age) to 2015, to determine the onset and sources of anthropogenic lead. Despite the dust-laden nature of the core, a clear change in the lead isotope signature to below Stone Age levels started in 1949 followed by a rapid decrease in 1960 and an even more rapid decrease in 1974 indicating the first emergence of anthropogenic lead. Accurate isotopic lead measurements allowed us to better, and more sensitively, quantify sources using a Bayesian mixing model. Chinese gasoline was the primary anthropogenic source surpassing natural contributions in the 2000s until 2007 when emissions from leaded gasoline decreased and those from coal and lead-zinc ores increased.

 This work uses a mixture of observations from surface remote sensing (AERONET) and satellite remote sensing (OMI) to uniquely compute the atmospheric column loading of black carbon (BC) mass concentration density (MCD) and number concentration density (NCD) on a grid-by-grid, day-by-day basis at 0.25°x0.25° over rapidly developing and biomass burning (BB) impacted regions in South, Southeast, and East Asia. This mixture of observations is uniformly analyzed based on OMI NO2 retrievals, OMI Near ultraviolet band absorption aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo (SSA), and AERONET visible and near-infrared band SSA observations, in connection with an inversely applied MIE mixing model approach. This method uniquely solves for the unbiased spatial and temporal domains based on variance maximization of daily NO2. These locations in space and time are then used to quantify the distribution of all possible individual particle core and refractory shell sizes as constrained by all band-by-band observations of SSA from AERONET. Finally, the range of NCD and MCD are computed from the constrained range of per-particle core and refractory shell size on a grid-by-grid and day-by-day basis. The maps of MCD and NCD are consistent in space and time with known urban, industrial, and BB sources. The statistical distributions are found to be non-normal, with the region-wide mean, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile MCD [mg/m2] of 90.3, 56.1, 81.1, and 111 respectively, and NCD [x1012 particles/m2] of 8.76, 4.63, 7.39, and 11.3 respectively. On a grid-by-grid basis, a significant amount of variation is found, particularly over Myanmar, Laos, northern Thailand, and Vietnam, with this subregional mean, 25th, 50th, and 75th MCD [mg/m2] of 90.7, 56.1, 81.3, and 112 respectively and NCD [x1012 particles/m2] of 9.66, 5.49, 8.33, and 12.3 respectively. On a day-to-day basis, events are determined 121 days in 2016, during which the computed statistics of MCD and NCD have mean and uncertainty ranges which scale with each other. However, there are 11 days where the uncertainty ratio of NCD values is larger than 1 while the uncertainty ratio of MCD is small, and 5 days where the reverse is observed, indicating that the particle size is strongly atypical on these days, consistent with mixed aerosol sources, a substantial change in the aerosol aging, or other such factors including a substantial region of overlap between BB and urban sources. The high values observed from March to May lead to an extended BB season as compared to previous work focusing on fire radiative power, NO2, and models, which show a shorter season (usually ending in early April). The results are consistent with BC being able to transport significant distances. The new approach is anticipated to provide support for improving radiative forcing calculations, estimating emissions inventories, and providing a basis by which models can compare against observations."

 Diffuse solar radiation (DR) constitutes a vital component of solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. The demand for extensive temporal and spatial coverage of DR data has intensified in the realms of solar energy harvesting, agriculture, and climate change. However, until now, long-term DR observations have only been available from 17 stations across mainland China. Consequently, there is a pressing need to estimate spatially continuous, high-temporal-resolution DR for large-scale regions in China. The current hindrance to DR estimations stems from the scarcity of stations equipped with DR observations. This study proposes a two-stage strategy to efficiently estimate seamless DR in 2019 at a national scale, leveraging both DR and total solar radiation (TR) observations from numerous stations. In the first stage, the approach generates virtual DR at TR stations by establishing a learned relationship between DR and TR observations. Subsequently, in the second stage, these virtual DR data, in conjunction with satellite and reanalysis datasets, are utilized to estimate national-scale DR. Additionally, a novel model, End-to-end Gradient Boosting with Shortcuts and Feature selection (EGB-SF), is introduced to estimate DR over China. One advantage of this model is its consideration of the impact of sequentially boosted features and their interactions. Embedded shortcut connections fully exploit the influence of existing features on newly introduced ones during the learning process. Beyond enhancing the accuracy of DR estimation, the EGB-SF algorithm can also elucidate the relative importance levels of input features to the model. Moreover, the two-stage strategy outperforms the method of estimating national DR using only DR observations, as evidenced by its superior spatial generalization abilities. Statistical evaluation, collaborative analysis with influencing factors, and comparisons with related products confirm the accuracy and spatial continuity of the DR estimations in this study. These results furnish reliable DR data across China for research in agriculture, climate, solar radiation, and related fields."

 Accurate estimation of the surface-emitted longwave radiation (SELR) has important scientific value in understanding its spatiotemporal dynamics and surface thermal environment. Thermal infrared (TIR) images with high spatial resolution offer enhanced data support for studying SELR of complex surfaces, such as urban surface. This study proposes a new urban-oriented hybrid (UoHy) method, which considers multiple scattering and adjacent effects of urban pixel using the term sky view factor, to estimate urban SELR from the top-of-atmosphere radiance of TIR images with high spatial resolution, and performs sensitivity analysis and application. The experimental results for the thermal images of GF-5/VIMS as an example showed that the UoHy method has relatively high accuracy, and obtains SELR errors of less than 12.0 W/m2 under low atmospheric water vapor conditions and less than 17.0 W/m2 under high atmospheric water vapor conditions. The application of the method during daytime and nighttime also demonstrated the method's validity and effectiveness. Compared with the natural surface-oriented hybrid method, the UoHy method obtains an improvement of about 7.0–10.0 W/m2 in SELR estimation, which indicates that it has the potential for practical SELR estimation over urban surface with TIR images of high spatial resolution."

 The Kuroshio has a fundamental impact on the regional oceanography of the northwestern Pacific. But identification of the Kuroshio path (KP), an abstraction of the course along which the Kuroshio mainstream moves, has not yet been established in a systematic manner. We optimally track the KP and study its variability in the northwestern Pacific south of ∼31°N, where eddy activity is rich. An automatic contour method based on maximum surface geostrophic velocity along a given satellite-derived dynamic topographic isoline is applied and its performance is evaluated. Our results are robust and can be further used to derive kinematical, statistical, and spectral properties of the flow field of the Kuroshio upstream. We improve the identification method by tracing two separate KPs in different subdomains. The existence of an alignment or mismatch of these two retrieved KPs hints at the arrival of an approaching eddy. The highly variable and distorted KP east of Luzon Strait and Taiwan is due to eddy impingement. Most of the variability along the KP stems from energy with time scales of ∼30–200 days and 1 year. A more consistent KP is seen north of ∼26°N, with increasing surface currents of up to ∼1 m s−1 before entering through the Tokara Strait. Such regional differences result from the various impacts of impinging mesoscale eddies on the Kuroshio, mainly due to blockage by the Ryukyu Islands. Our optimally determined KP is in line with the historical shipborne subsurface velocity measurements revealing the Kuroshio velocity core and observations of strong surface currents of > ∼0.5 m s−1 by shore-based high-frequency radar (HFR) from locations along the east coast of Taiwan. Supportive evidence of concurrent KP distortion shows that HFR-derived vortex-like flow patterns are related to mesoscale eddies impinging from regions east of the radar footprint. Our work has value as a supplement to the data from radar operational routines, and will help interpret and diagnose these complicated HFR observations east of Taiwan."

 In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied to meteorological radar extrapolation due to the shortcomings of traditional optical flow methods in predicting the genesis and dissipation of radar echoes. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues of clarity and overall intensity attenuation caused by uncertainty. This study implemented a dual-path spatiotemporal attention network that integrates optical flow techniques by employing intra-frame static attention and inter-frame dynamic attention, which could simulate motion fields and the overall intensity distribution of radar echoes separately. Our approach effectively resolve the issues of systematic intensity attenuation and clarity degradation introduced by deep learning methods. Through the comparisons of key metrics such as MSE, SSIM, CSI20, CSI30, and CSI40, the results demonstrated significant improvements over traditional approaches, particularly in CSI30 and CSI40, where the metrics improved by more than 35 %."

 The timing of the Bay of Bengal summer monsoon (BOBSM) onset has implications for the evolution of the Asian summer monsoon and associated precipitation. This study employs Japanese 55-year Reanalysis and NOAA's Gridded Precipitation Reconstruction over Land data to explore the spatiotemporal variation in the thermal influence of the Southeast Asian low-latitude highlands (SEALLH) and its effect on the BOBSM onset date. There is a significant correlation between pre-monsoon season (February–April) shortwave radiative heating (SWH) in the SEALLH and BOBSM onset in the interannual time scale. During the enhanced SWH, an anomalous vertical circulation, which converges and ascends in the lower troposphere over the SEALLH and converges and descends in the upper troposphere north of the Bay of Bengal (BOB), develops over the SEALLH–north of BOB during the pre-monsoon season with anticlockwise rotation. The warmer air mass resulting from the adiabatic heating is accumulated around the north of BOB by the insulation effect related to the anomalous vertical circulation. By facilitating the reversal of the land-sea thermal contrast, the warmer upper troposphere over the north of the BOB causes a 16-day earlier onset of the BOBSM than the case of weakened SWH. The findings shed light on subsequent research into the thermal effects of the SEALLH on Asian summer monsoon variability."

 This study explores a possibility of improving Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) surface-sensitive brightness temperature (TB) simulations over land by assimilating land surface temperature (LST) observations from the National Basic Meteorological Observing Stations of China. The Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation 3D-Var regional data assimilation (DA) system is modified to add LST as a new control variable and its background error variances, horizontal correlations and cross-correlations. The background covariances of LST with other control variables are calculated separately for daytime and nighttime samples in summer and winter seasons. A control experiment (ExpCTL) and three LST DA experiments with (ExpLST) and without (ExpLST_NBC) bias correction or with an average of LST within 2° × 2° grid boxes (ExpLST_SO) are conducted. Considering the fact that surface station observations are point measurements while the satellite TBs measure the total radiation effect of earth's surface within fields-of-view, a bias correction is found necessary for LST DA during daytimes (ExpLST). The biases are quantified by the differences from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST retrievals to compensate for the representative differences. The analyzed fields are then used as input to the Community Radiative Transfer Model to simulate TBs of AHI surface-sensitive channels over land. A long-period statistics shows that ExpLST significantly reduces the observations minus simulations (OB) biases and standard deviations of surface-sensitive TBs in terms of reducing the diurnal variations and season dependences of TB biases over different surface types, which also outperforms ExpLST_NBC and ExpLST_SO at daytime. This study suggests a potential benefit of combining the use of LST observations for assimilating surface-sensitive infrared TBs."

Using satellite remote sensing, we find a clear linear relationship between forest cover and isoprene and a pronounced non-linear relationship between burned area and nitrogen dioxide in the southern Amazon, a region of substantial deforestation. These quantified relationships can be used for model evaluation and further exploration of biosphere-atmosphere interactions in Earth System Models. 
 Land surface changes can have substantial impacts on biosphere–atmosphere interactions. In South America, rainforests abundantly emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which, when coupled with pyrogenic emissions from deforestation fires, can have substantial impacts on regional air quality. We use novel and long-term satellite records of five trace gases, namely isoprene (C5H8), formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in addition to aerosol optical depth (AOD), vegetation (land cover and leaf area index), and burned area. We characterise the impacts of biogenic and pyrogenic emissions on atmospheric composition for the period 2001 to 2019 in the southern Amazon, a region of substantial deforestation. The seasonal cycle for all of the atmospheric constituents peaks in the dry season (August–October), and the year-to-year variability in CO, HCHO, NO2, and AOD is strongly linked to the burned area. We find a robust relationship between the broadleaf forest cover and total column C5H8 (R2 = 0.59), while the burned area exhibits an approximate fifth root power law relationship with tropospheric column NO2 (R2 = 0.32) in the dry season. Vegetation and burned area together show a relationship with HCHO (R2 = 0.23). Wet-season AOD and CO follow the forest cover distribution. The land surface variables are very weakly correlated with CH3OH, suggesting that other factors drive its spatial distribution. Overall, we provide a detailed observational quantification of biospheric process influences on southern Amazon regional atmospheric composition, which in future studies can be used to help constrain the underpinning processes in Earth system models."

Understanding the aerosol population that interacts with clouds is important for constraining future melt. Measurements of aerosols at cloud height over Greenland are rare, and surface measurements are often used to investigate cloud–aerosol interactions. We use a tethered balloon to measure aerosols up to cloud base and show that surface measurements are often not equivalent to those just below the cloud. 
 Surface radiative cooling in polar regions can generate persistent stability in the atmospheric boundary layer. Stable layers below clouds can decouple the cloud layer from the near-surface environment. Under these conditions, surface aerosol measurements are not necessarily representative of the near-cloud or intra-cloud aerosol populations. To better understand the variability in the vertical structure of aerosol properties over the central Greenland Ice Sheet, in situ measurements of aerosol particle size distributions up to cloud base were made at Summit Station in July and August 2023. These measurements identified distinct vertical aerosol layers between the surface- and cloud-base-associated thermodynamic decoupling layers. Such decoupling layers occur 49 % of the time during the summer in central Greenland, suggesting that surface aerosol measurements are insufficient for describing the cloud-relevant aerosol population half of the time. Experience during this first measurement season demonstrated the ability of a tethered-balloon platform to operate effectively under icing conditions and at low surface pressure (< 680 hPa).

However, the mechanism and magnitude of this effect are not yet clear. In this study, field observations on physicochemical properties of BC-containing particles (PMBC) were conducted in the northeast (Xihai) and southeast (Lulang) regions of the TP to investigate the impacts of transported emissions from lower-altitude areas on BC characteristics in the TP. Large spatial discrepancies were found in the chemical composition of PMBC. Both sites showed higher concentrations of PMBC when they were affected by transported air masses outside the TP but with diverse chemical composition. Source apportionment for organic aerosol (OA) suggested that primary OA in the northeastern TP was attributed to hydrocarbon OA (HOA) from anthropogenic emissions, while it was dominated by biomass burning OA (BBOA) in the southeastern TP. Regarding secondary aerosol, a marked enhancement in nitrate fraction was observed on aged BC coating in Xihai when the air masses were brought by updrafts and easterly winds from lower-altitude areas. With the development of boundary layer, the enhanced turbulent mixing promoted the elevation of anthropogenic pollutants. In contrast to Xihai, the thickly coated BC in Lulang was mainly caused by elevation and transportation of biomass burning plumes from south Asia, showing a large contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The distinct transported emissions lead to substantial variations of both chemical composition and light absorption ability of BC across the TP. The thicker coating and higher mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of PMBC in air masses elevated from lower-altitude regions reveal the promoted BC aging processes and their impacts on the mixing state and light absorption of BC in the TP. These findings emphasize the vulnerability of plateau regions to influences of elevated emissions, leading to significant changes in BC concentration, mixing states and light absorption across the TP, all of which need to be considered in the evaluation of BC radiative effects for the TP region."

Salvador;Michael Le Breton;Mattias Hallquist;Jian Zhen Yu;Chak K. Chan;Åsa M. Hallquist,Online characterization of primary and secondary emissions of particulate matter and acidic molecules from a modern fleet of city buses,"Our research on city bus emissions reveals that alternative fuels (compressed natural gas and biofuels) reduce fresh particle emissions compared to diesel. However, all fuels lead to secondary air pollution. Aiming at guiding better environmental policies, we studied 76 buses using advanced emission measurement techniques. This work sheds light on the complex effects of bus fuels on urban air quality, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluations of future transportation technologies. 
 The  potential impact of transitioning from conventional fossil fuel to a non-fossil-fuel vehicle fleet was investigated by measuring primary emissions via extractive sampling of bus plumes and assessing secondary mass formation using the Gothenburg Potential Aerosol Mass (Go:PAM) reactor from 76 in-use transit buses. Online chemical characterization of gaseous and particulate emissions from these buses was conducted using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) with acetate as the reagent ion, coupled with the Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO). Acetate reagent ion chemistry selectively ionizes acidic compounds, including organic and inorganic acids, as well as nitrated and sulfated organics. A significant reduction (48 %–98 %) in fresh particle emissions was observed in buses utilizing compressed natural gas (CNG), biodiesels like rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), and hybrid-electric HVO (HVOHEV) compared to diesel (DSL). However, secondary particle formation from photooxidation of emissions was substantial across all the fuel types. The median ratio of particle mass emission factors of aged to fresh emissions increased in the following order: DSL buses at 4.0, HVO buses at 6.7, HVOHEV buses at 10.5, RME buses at 10.8, and CNG buses at 84. Of the compounds that can be identified by CIMS, fresh gaseous emissions from all Euro V/EEV (Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle) buses, regardless of fuel type, were dominated by nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrous acid (HONO), nitric acid (HNO3), and isocyanic acid (HNCO), alongside small monoacids (C1−C3). Notably, the emission of nitrogen-containing compounds was lower in Euro VI buses equipped with more advanced emission control technologies. Secondary gaseous organic acids correlated strongly with gaseous HNO3 signals (R2=0.85–0.99) in Go:PAM, but their moderate to weak correlations with post-photooxidation secondary particle mass suggest that they are not reliable tracers of secondary organic aerosol formation from bus exhaust. Our study highlights that non-regulated compounds and secondary pollutant formation, not currently addressed in legislation, are crucial considerations in the evaluation of environmental impacts of future fuel and engine technology shifts."

Significant positive correlations between EPFRs and the water-soluble oxidative potential of PM2.5 were found, primarily attributable to the water-soluble fractions of EPFRs. These findings emphasize understanding EPFRs' atmospheric evolution for climate and health impacts. 
 Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) represent a novel class of hazardous substances, posing risks to human health and the environment. In this study, we investigated the EPFRs in ambient fine, coarse, and total suspended particles (PM2.5, PM10, and TSPs) in the rural North China Plain, where local primary emissions of EPFRs were limited. We observed that the majority of EPFRs occurred in PM2.5. Moreover, distinct seasonal patterns and higher g factors of EPFRs were found compared to those in urban environments, suggesting unique characteristics of EPFRs in rural areas. The source apportionment analyses revealed atmospheric oxidation as the largest contributor (33.6 %) to EPFRs. A large water-soluble fraction (35.2 %) of EPFRs was determined, potentially resulting from the formation of more oxidized EPFRs through atmospheric oxidation processes during long-range or regional transport. Additionally, significant positive correlations were observed between EPFRs and the oxidative potential of water-soluble PM2.5 measured by dithiothreitol-depletion and hydroxyl-generation assays, likely attributable to the water-soluble fractions of EPFRs. Overall, our findings reveal the prevalence of water-soluble EPFRs in rural areas and underscore the fact that atmospheric oxidation processes can modify their properties, such as increasing their water solubility. This evolution may alter their roles in contributing to the oxidative potential of PM2.5 and potentially also influence their impact on climate-related cloud chemistry."

Two distinct types of ship emissions were identified and characterised: sulfate-rich plumes from the use of heavy fuel oil with scrubbers and organic-rich plumes from the use of low-sulfur fuels. The latter were more frequent, emitting double the particle number and having a typical V / Ni ratio for ship emission. 
 Source apportionment quantitatively links pollution to its source but can be difficult to perform in areas like ports where emissions from shipping and other port-related activities are intrinsically linked. Here we present the analysis of aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) data using combined organic and sulfate ion positive matrix factorisation (PMF) during an intensive measurement campaign in Dublin Port. Two main types of ship emissions were identified by this technique: sulfate-rich (S-Ship) and organic-rich (O-Ship). The S-Ship emissions were attributed to heavy fuel oil use and are characterised by particles with standard V/Ni ratios from 2.7–3.9 and a large fraction of acidic sulfate aerosol. The O-Ship emissions were attributed to low-sulfur fuel types and were comprised mostly of organic aerosol (OA) with the V/Ni ratios ranging only from 0–2.3. O-Ship plumes occurred over 3 times more frequently than S-Ship plumes during the measurement period. A third minor ship emission factor (X-Ship) was resolved by PMF but not clearly attributable to any specific fuel type. Overall, ship plumes had PM1 concentrations in the range 4–252 µg m−3, with extreme concentrations usually lasting for 5–35 min. Despite their short duration, shipping emission plumes were frequent and contributed to at least 28 % of PM1 (i.e. 14 % O-Ship, 12 % S-Ship, and 2 % X-Ship). Moreover, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) and black carbon could also originate, in part, from shipping-related activities such as ferry traffic and heavy-goods vehicles, suggesting that the overall contribution of shipping activity to ambient PM1 is likely higher, upwards of 47 %."

Previous work has developed a new machine learning method for measuring supercooled liquid water in Antarctic clouds using simple lidar observations. We evaluate this technique using a lidar dataset from Christchurch, New Zealand, and develop an updated algorithm for accurate supercooled liquid water detection at mid-latitudes. 
 The use of depolarization lidar to measure atmospheric volume depolarization ratio (VDR) is a common technique to classify cloud phase (liquid or ice). Previous work using a machine learning framework, applied to peak properties derived from co-polarized attenuated backscatter data, has been demonstrated to effectively detect supercooled-liquid-water-containing clouds (SLCCs). However, the training data from Davis Station, Antarctica, include no warm liquid water clouds (WLWCs), potentially limiting the model's accuracy in regions where WLWCs are present. In this work, we apply the same framework used on the Davis data to a 9-month micro-pulse lidar dataset collected in Ōtautahi / Christchurch,  Aotearoa / New Zealand, a location which includes WLWC. We then evaluate the results relative to a reference VDR cloud-phase mask. We found that the Davis model performed relatively poorly at detecting SLCC with a recall score of 0.18, often misclassifying WLWC as SLCC. The performance of our new model, trained using data from Ōtautahi / Christchurch, displays recall scores as high as 0.88 for identification of SLCC, although it generally underestimates SLCC occurrence. The overall performance of the new model highlights the effectiveness of the machine learning technique when appropriate training data relevant to the location are used."

The data are automatically calibrated by a newly implemented data processing system. The accuracies of the mid-cost instruments vary from 1.0 to 2.4 ppm for hourly afternoon measurements. Our model–data analyses highlight prospects for integrating mid-cost instrument data with high-precision measurements to improve fine-scale CO2 emission quantification in urban areas. 
 To effectively monitor highly heterogeneous urban CO2 emissions using atmospheric observations, there is a need to deploy cost-effective CO2 sensors at multiple locations within the city with sufficient accuracy to capture the concentration gradients in urban environments. These dense measurements could be used as input of an atmospheric inversion system for the quantification of emissions at the sub-city scale or to separate specific sectors. Such quantification would offer valuable insights into the efficacy of local initiatives and could also identify unknown emission hotspots that require attention. Here we present the development and evaluation of a mid-cost CO2 instrument designed for continuous monitoring of atmospheric CO2 concentrations with a target accuracy of 1 ppm for hourly mean measurements. We assess the sensor sensitivity in relation to environmental factors such as humidity, pressure, temperature and CO2 signal, which leads to the development of an effective calibration algorithm. Since July 2020, eight mid-cost instruments have been installed within the city of Paris and its vicinity to provide continuous CO2 measurements, complementing the seven high-precision cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) stations that have been in operation since 2016. A data processing system, called CO2calqual, has been implemented to automatically handle data quality control, calibration and storage, which enables the management of extensive real-time CO2 measurements from the monitoring network. Colocation assessments with the high-precision instrument show that the accuracies of the eight mid-cost instruments are within the range of 1.0 to 2.4 ppm for hourly afternoon (12:00–17:00 UTC) measurements. The long-term stability issues require manual data checks and instrument maintenance. The analyses show that CO2 measurements can provide evidence for underestimations of CO2 emissions in the Paris region and a lack of several emission point sources in the emission inventory. Our study demonstrates promising prospects for integrating mid-cost measurements along with high-precision data into the subsequent atmospheric inverse modeling to improve the accuracy of quantifying the fine-scale CO2 emissions in the Paris metropolitan area."

Our findings suggest that such a satellite mission is highly capable of resolving individual wave parameters and could give new insights into the role of gravity waves in general atmospheric circulation and atmospheric processes. 
 In the past, satellite climatologies of gravity waves (GWs) have initiated progress in their representation in global models. However, these could not provide the phase speed and direction distributions needed for a better understanding of the interaction between GWs and the large-scale winds directly. The ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT could provide such observations. CAIRT would use a limb-imaging Michelson interferometer resolving a wide spectral range, allowing temperature and trace gas mixing ratio measurements. With the proposed instrument design, a vertical resolution of 1 km, along-track sampling of 50 km, and across-track sampling of 25 km in a 400 km wide swath will be achieved. In particular, this allows for the observation of three-dimensional (3D), GW-resolving temperature fields throughout the middle atmosphere.In this work, we present the methodology for the GW analysis of CAIRT observations using a limited-volume 3D sinusoidal fit (S3D) wave analysis technique. We assess the capability of CAIRT to provide high-quality GW fields by the generation of synthetic satellite observations from high-resolution model data and comparison of the synthetic observations to the original model fields. For the assessment, wavelength spectra, phase speed spectra, horizontal distributions, and zonal means of GW momentum flux (GWMF) are considered. The atmospheric events we use to exemplify the capabilities of CAIRT are the 2006 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropics, and the mesospheric preconditioning phase of the 2019 SSW event.Our findings indicate that CAIRT would provide highly reliable observations not only of global-scale GW distributions and drag patterns but also of specific wave events and their associated wave parameters. Even under worse-than-expected noise levels of the instrument, the resulting GW measurements are highly consistent with the original model data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimated GW parameters can be used for ray tracing, which physically extends the horizontal coverage of the observations beyond the orbit tracks."

The portability of the EM27/SUN allows us to evaluate satellite and model data in locations not covered by traditional validation networks. This is of particular value in tropical Africa, where extensive terrestrial ecosystems are a significant store of carbon and play a key role in the atmospheric budgets of CO2 and CH4. 
 The extensive terrestrial ecosystems of tropical Africa are a significant store of carbon and play a key but uncertain role in the atmospheric budgets of carbon dioxide and methane. As ground-based observations in the tropics are scarce compared with other parts of the world, recent studies have instead made use of satellite observations assimilated into atmospheric chemistry and transport models to conclude that methane emissions from this geographical region have increased since 2010 as a result of increased wetland extent, accounting for up to a third of global methane growth, and that the tropical Africa region dominates net carbon emission across the tropics. These studies critically rely on the accuracy of satellite datasets, such as those from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), and the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), along with results from atmospheric transport models, over a geographical region where there are little independent data to test the robustness of published results.In this paper we present the first ground-based observations of greenhouse gas column concentrations over East Africa, obtained using a portable Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer during a deployment covering the first few months of 2020 in Jinja, Uganda. We operated the instrument near autonomously by way of an automated weatherproof enclosure and observed total atmospheric column concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, as well as carbon monoxide, a useful proxy for emissions from incomplete combustion processes in the region. We discuss the performance of the combined enclosure and spectrometer system that we deployed in Jinja to obtain these data and show comparisons of our ground-based observations with satellite datasets from OCO-2 and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) for carbon dioxide and TROPOMI for methane and carbon monoxide, whilst also comparing our results with concentration data from the GEOS-Chem and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) atmospheric inversions that provide a means of increasing spatial and temporal coverage where satellite data are not available. For our measurement period, we find mean differences in XCO2 between OCO-2 and the EM27/SUN of −0.29 % and between OCO-3 and the EM27/SUN of −0.28 %. In the case of TROPOMI, the mean difference in XCH4 that we find between TROPOMI and the EM27/SUN is −0.44 %, whilst for XCO the mean difference is −5.65 %. In each of these cases, the mean difference observed between the satellite and ground-based column concentrations is either close to or within the precision and accuracy requirements for the respective missions. With regard to the model and reanalysis comparisons with the EM27/SUN column concentrations, we see mean differences from the EM27/SUN of a global GEOS-Chem inversion for XCO2 of −0.08 %, a regional high-resolution GEOS-Chem inversion for XCH4 of −0.22 %, and the CAMS global reanalysis for XCO of −9.79 %. Our results demonstrate the value of ground-based observations of total column concentrations and show that the combined EM27/SUN and enclosure system employed would be suitable for acquisition of the longer-term observations needed to rigorously evaluate satellite observations and model and reanalysis calculations over tropical Africa."

Van Dijk,Enhancing long-term vegetation monitoring in Australia: a new approach for harmonising the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer normalised-difference vegetation (NVDI) with MODIS NDVI,"Understanding vegetation response to environmental change requires accurate, long-term data on vegetation condition (VC). We evaluated existing satellite VC datasets over Australia and found them lacking, so we developed a new VC dataset for Australia, AusENDVI. It can be used for studying Australia's changing vegetation dynamics and downstream impacts on the carbon and water cycles, and it provides a reliable foundation for further research into the drivers of vegetation change. 
 Long-term, reliable datasets of satellite-based vegetation condition are essential for understanding terrestrial ecosystem responses to global environmental change, particularly in Australia, which is characterised by diverse ecosystems and strong interannual climate variability. We comprehensively evaluate several existing global Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalised-difference vegetation index (NDVI) products for their suitability for long-term vegetation monitoring in Australia. Comparisons with the MODIS NDVI highlight significant deficiencies, particularly over densely vegetated regions. Moreover, all the assessed products failed to adequately reproduce the interannual variability in the pre-MODIS era as indicated by Landsat NDVI anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach to calibrating and harmonising NOAA's Climate Data Record of AVHRR NDVI to the MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI for Australia using a gradient-boosting decision tree ensemble method. Two versions of the datasets are developed, one incorporating climate data in the predictors (“AusENDVI-clim”: Australian Empirical NDVI-climate) and another that is independent of climate data (“AusENDVI-noclim”). These datasets, spanning 1982–2013 at a spatial resolution of 0.05° and with a monthly time step, exhibit strong correlations (r2=0.89–0.94) and low mean errors compared with MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI (mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.014–0.028, RMSE = 0.021–0.046), accurately reproducing seasonal cycles over densely vegetated regions. Furthermore, they closely replicate the interannual variability in vegetation condition in the pre-MODIS era. A reliable method for gap-filling the AusENDVI record is also developed that leverages climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and woody-cover fraction predictors. The resulting synthetic NDVI dataset shows excellent agreement with the MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI and the recalibrated AVHRR NDVI time series (r2=0.82–0.95, MAE = 0.016–0.029, RMSE = 0.039–0.041). Finally, we provide a complete 41-year dataset where the gap-filled AusENDVI-clim from January 1982 to February 2000 is joined with the MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI from March 2000 to December 2022. Analysing 40-year per-pixel trends in Australia's annual maximum NDVI revealed increasing values, and shifts in the timing, of the annual peak NDVI across most of the continent, underscoring the dataset's potential to address crucial questions regarding the changing vegetation phenology and its drivers. The AusENDVI dataset can be used for studying Australia's changing vegetation dynamics and downstream impacts on the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, and it provides a reliable foundation for further research into the drivers of vegetation change.

This study utilizes aircraft observations of cumulus clouds during two field campaigns to determine the quantitative relationship between entrainment rate and aerosol loading. In both campaigns, the entrainment rate is negatively correlated with aerosol loading. It is speculated that increased aerosol loading enhances cloud edge droplet evaporation, which leads to increased buoyancy and vertical velocity within the cloud, thereby reducing the entrainment rate. Further analysis shows that the response of entrainment rate to aerosol perturbations is more significant in smaller cumulus clouds with weak buoyancy and less pronounced under opposite conditions. These findings shed new light on improving the description of aerosol‐cloud interactions in cumulus parameterizations."

In these cases, the time scales are defined by dissipation of energetic electrons and effective recombination processes. The results presented in this paper were applied in the regions of pulsating aurora and polar arcs, demonstrating the fact that ionospheric conductance requires some time to form and decay. These time delays constitute an effective “inertia” in the conductance calculation which is not accounted for in many global models which assume an instantaneous connection between precipitation and conductance. Ionospheric conductance inertia influences the temporal variation in ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields, and as a result, impacts magnetosphere‐ionosphere (MI) dynamics on a global scale."

The lifetime models developed using two different methods are valid for electrons with an energy range from 1 keV to 2 MeV. To facilitate the integration of these new models into different ring current and radiation belt codes, we parameterize the electron lifetime as a function of L $L$‐shell and electron kinetic energy at each MLT and geomagnetic activity (Kp). The parameterized electron lifetimes exhibit strong dependencies on L $L$‐shell, MLT, and energy.

A case is selected wherein the WindBorne balloon directly sampled a jet streak associated with a tropopause polar vortex (TPV). The observed TPV merged with another TPV at the same time as a downstream Arctic cyclone (AC) redeveloped eastward. The case is used to better understand the role of the observed TPV in the evolution of the downstream AC. The assimilation of the WindBorne observations improves the forecast track and amplitude of the TPV during the ∼1 day forecast period that the TPV can be tracked as a distinct feature. The root mean square error of temperature at 350 hPa is improved by the WindBorne assimilation throughout the 2.5 day forecast period. The surface cyclone track forecast is improved by the WindBorne assimilation during the period of eastward redevelopment of the surface cyclone, and the sea level pressure RMSE in the surrounding region is reduced during the first ∼1.5 days of forecast lead time. Results demonstrate the capability of the long‐duration controllable WindBorne balloons to improve the analysis of the TPV associated with the jet streak, leading to improved forecast of both tropopause‐level and surface pressure features. Additionally, the importance of observing the upstream TPV amplitude for improving forecasts of the process of TPV merging and its impact on the evolution and longevity of the mature AC is confirmed."

Recently, there has been increasing discussion on the potential supplementation of this conventional mitigation portfolio with Solar Radiation Modification (SRM). However, the impact of SRM on conventional mitigation measures has received limited attention to date. In this study, we explore one part of this impact, the potential effect of one type of SRM, Stratospheric Aerosol Injections (SAI), on WRE. Using hourly output from the Earth System Model CNRM‐ESM2‐1, we compare WRE potential under a medium emission scenario (SSP245) and a high emission scenario (SSP585) with an SRM scenario that has SSP585 baseline conditions and uses SAI to offset warming to approximately SSP245 global warming levels. Our results suggest that SAI may affect surface wind resources by modifying large‐scale circulation patterns, such as a significant poleward jet‐shift in the Southern Hemisphere. The modeled total global WRE potential is negligibly reduced under SAI compared to the SSP‐scenarios. However, regional trends are highly variable, with large increases and decreases in WRE potential frequently reaching 12% across the globe with SAI. This study highlights potential downstream effects of SRM on climatic elements, such as wind patterns, and offers perspectives on its implications for our mitigation efforts."

Mach,"Flickering gamma-ray flashes, the missing link between gamma glows and TGFs","Flickering gamma-ray flashes associated with terrestrial thunderstorms have been observed, which may be the missing link between gamma-ray glows and TGFs. 
 Two different hard-radiation phenomena are known to originate from thunderclouds: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs)1 and gamma-ray glows2. Both involve an avalanche of electrons accelerated to relativistic energies but are otherwise different. Glows are known to last for one to hundreds of seconds, have moderate intensities and originate from quasi-stationary thundercloud fields2–5. TGFs exhibit high intensities and have characteristic durations of tens to hundreds of microseconds6–9. TGFs often show a close association with an emission of strong radio signals10–17 and optical pulses18–21, which indicates the involvement of lightning leaders in their generation. Here we report unique observations of a different phenomenon, which we call flickering gamma-ray flashes (FGFs). FGFs resemble the usual multi-pulse TGFs22–24 but have more pulses and each pulse has a longer duration than ordinary TGFs. FGF durations span from 20 to 250 ms, which reaches the lower boundary of the gamma-ray glow duration. FGFs are radio and optically silent, which makes them distinct from normal TGFs. An FGF starts as an ordinary gamma-ray glow, then suddenly increases exponentially in intensity and turns into an unstable, ‘flickering’ mode with a sequence of pulses. FGFs could be the missing link between the gamma-ray glows and conventional TGFs, whose absence has been puzzling the atmospheric electricity community for two decades. Flickering gamma-ray flashes associated with terrestrial thunderstorms have been observed, which may be the missing link between gamma-ray glows and TGFs."

 Thunderstorms emit fluxes of gamma rays known as gamma-ray glows1,2, sporadically observed by aircraft1,3–7, balloons8–11 and from the ground12–18. Observations report increased gamma-ray emissions by tens of percent up to two orders of magnitude above the background, sometimes abruptly terminated by lightning discharges1,3–5. Glows are produced by the acceleration of energetic electrons in high-electric-field regions within thunderclouds8 and contribute to charge dissipation3. Glows had been considered as quasi-stationary phenomena3,5,12, with durations up to a few tens of seconds and spatial scales up to 10–20 km. However, no measurements of the full extension in space and time of a gamma-ray-glow region and their occurring frequency have been reported so far. Here we show that tropical thunderclouds over ocean and coastal regions commonly emit gamma rays for hours over areas up to a few thousand square kilometres. Emission is associated with deep convective cores; it is not uniform and continuous but shows characteristic timescales of 1–10 s and even subsecond for individual glows. The dynamics of gamma-glowing thunderclouds strongly contradicts the quasi-stationary picture of glows and instead resembles that of a huge gamma-glowing ‘boiling pot’ in both pattern and behaviour.

 Given the impact of deep stratospheric intrusion on air quality, the development of more extensive trace substances to quantify stratospheric intrusion intensity can better distinguish between stratospheric ozone pollution and anthropogenic factors. The ratio of cosmogenic beryllium-10 to beryllium-7 (10Be/7Be), primarily generated in the stratosphere, has the potential to identify stratospheric air masses on the ground. Here we constructed a 10Be/7Be time-series (July 2020 to September 2021) in rainwater and aerosols from Xi’an, China. Combining in-situ pollutants, reanalysis data, and model calculations support a stratospheric origin for increased 10Be/7Be and identify it as a means of quantifying intrusion intensity. It was found that anticyclones formed by the Asian summer monsoon drive a sudden increase in deep stratospheric intrusion in spring, exacerbating ozone pollution beyond China’s air quality standards. Based on the sufficiently sensitive 10Be/7Be, it further indicates the process of six weak upper atmosphere intrusions in Xi’an during winter.

 Sea-ice surface temperature from atmospheric reanalysis has been used as an indicator of ice melt and climate change. However, its performance in atmospheric reanalyses is not fully understood in Antarctica. Here, we quantified biases in six widely-used reanalyses using satellite observations, and found strong and persistent warm biases in most reanalyses examined. Further analysis of the biases revealed two main culprits: incorrect cloud properties, and inappropriate sea-ice representation in the reanalysis products. We found that overestimated cloud simulation can contribute more than 4 K warm bias, with ERA5 exhibiting the largest warm bias. Even in reanalysis with smaller biases, this accuracy is achieved through a compensatory relationship between relatively lower cloud fraction bias and overestimated sea ice insulation effect. A dynamic downscaling simulation shows that differences in sea-ice representation can contribute a 2.3 K warm bias. The representation of ice concentration is the primary driver of the spatial distribution of biases by modulating the coupling between sea ice and clouds, as well as surface heat conduction. The lack of a snow layer in all reanalyses examined also has an impact on biases.

 During drought, resource managers want to know when the drought will end to make informed management decisions. However, as anthropogenic climate change has intensified drought conditions, we hypothesize it has affected drought recovery. Here, we leverage monthly self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index data across the western US derived from observations and climate models, and quantify the probability of drought recovery following severe drought. We find that the probability of drought recovery is ~25–50% lower in recent decades (2000–2021) than in the historical record (1901–1980), with at least one-third of the reduced recovery probability attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Climate model ensembles show reduced recovery probabilities in the contemporary era (2000–2040), primarily due to increased evaporative demand in non-winter months, resulting in an additional 1–4 months for droughts to recover compared with the historical record. These findings suggest climate change is slowing drought recovery, with ramifications for water management decisions and drought planning.

 The stability of a climate data record (CDR) is essential for evaluating long-term trends in surface temperature using remote sensing products. In the case of a satellite-derived CDR of land surface temperature (LST), this includes the stability of processing steps prior to the estimation of the target climate variable. Instability in the masking of cloud-affected observations can result in non-geophysical trends in a LST CDR. This paper provides an assessment of cloud detection performance stability over a 25-year LST CDR generated using data from the second Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2), the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). We evaluate three cloud detection methodologies, one fully Bayesian, one naïve probabilistic and the operational threshold-based cloud mask provided with each sensor, at four in-situ ceilometer sites. Of the 12 algorithm-site combinations assessed, only two (17 %) were stable across the full timeseries with respect to both cloud contamination and missed clear-sky observations. Five (42 %) were stable with respect to missed clear-sky observations only. The associated impacts on LST trends in the CDR could be as large as (+/−)0.73 K per decade (0.43 K per decade above the target stability), which means that attention needs to be paid to this aspect of stability in order to understand uncertainty in long-term observed trends. Given that cloud detection stability has not to our knowledge been previously assessed for any target climate variable, this conclusion may apply more broadly to other satellite-derived CDRs."

 The adjacency effect distorts the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral signals of coastal and inland waters and is a major challenge for optical remote sensing of nearshore aquatic environments. We introduce a closed-form expression that corrects for the adjacency effect prior to atmospheric correction. The method is included in an open-source Python tool, which ingests level-1 imagery and calculates the point-spread function of the atmosphere to convolve the input imagery. For each band, the difference between the observed and convolved reflectances is used to quantify and correct for the adjacency effect, i.e., pixels are corrected to the TOA reflectance they would have if surrounded by pixels of identical reflectance. Validation was conducted for Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI imagery against a global dataset of coincident in situ radiometric measurements. Results showed improved accuracy of water-leaving reflectance derived by atmospheric correction processors, including ACOLITE, POLYMER, and l2gen, when these were applied following adjacency-effect correction. For matchups within 200 m of shorelines (n = 212), adjacency-effect correction resulted in an average 16.7 % reduction in root mean square error, a 32.4 % reduction in symmetric signed percentage bias, and a 36.8 % reduction in median symmetric accuracy for the three processors. The improvements were more significant in the near-infrared (NIR) range for ACOLITE, visible wavelengths for l2gen, and evenly distributed across the visible-NIR spectrum for POLYMER. We anticipate that this physics-based approach to adjacency-effect correction will lead to improved satellite-derived aquatic products for coastal and inland waters under diverse atmospheric and aquatic conditions."

 Remote sensing observations and artificial intelligence algorithms have emerged as key components for crop yield estimation at various scales during the past decades. However, the utilization of multi-source satellite data and machine learning for estimating aggregated crop yield at the regional level in Europe has been only scarcely explored. Our study aims to bridge this research gap by focusing on the district-level spring barley yield estimation in southern Sweden from 2017 to 2022. We developed an estimation method with the random forest (RF) approach using four satellite-derived products along with two climate variables. These variables were used individually and in combinations as inputs for the RF approach. The results showed that vegetation indices (VIs) outperformed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in barley yield estimation, while combining VIs and SIF variables achieved the highest model performance (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 488 kg/ha). The inclusion of climate variables generally had little added contributions to the model performance. Importantly, barley yield prediction could be achieved two months prior to harvest, using monthly VIs and SIF data from April and May. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using freely accessible satellite data and the machine learning approach for estimating crop yield at the pan-European regional level. We expect that our proposed methodology can be extended to different crop types and regional-scale crop yield estimation in Europe, benefiting national and local authorities in making agricultural productivity decisions."

 A Regional Air Quality Model System (RAQMS) driven by WRF was applied to explore the emission, transport, deposition, and direct radiative effect of mineral dust over western China in July 2022, with focus on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Model validation against ground and satellite observations demonstrated the model reproduced meteorological variables, PM10 concentration, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and extinction coefficients in the vertical reasonably well. There was a dust event during 3–7 July 2022, which was originated from the Taklimakan Desert (TKD) and affected eastern and central TP under anticyclonic flows, resulting in the maximum hourly PM10 concentration exceeding 50 μg m−3 in Lhasa. Shortwave radiation was reduced considerably by dust aerosols over eastern TP, with the maximum decrease in daytime mean shortwave radiation reaching 30 W m−2 around Nyingchi on 5 July. Anthropogenic aerosols dominated PM10 mass in the capital cities of western China (54–67 %), while dust aerosols were dominant in the cities near the deserts. During this dust event, dust aerosols from TKD and Qaidam Desert (QDD) significantly influenced eastern TP, with dust contributions to PM10 mass concentration of 52 %, 76 % and 69 %, respectively, in Chamdo, Lhasa and Nyingzhi, respectively. The total dust emission in western China was about 10.6 Tg in July 2022, with the largest contribution from TKD (63.5 %), followed by Gobi Desert (GB) (26 %). The total deposition of dust was estimated to be 6.2 Tg, in which TKD and GB contributed 66 % and 22 %, respectively. During the study period, about 418 Gg dust aerosols were deposited on TP, 49 % of which was from TKD and 25 % from QDD. Foreign dust sources contributed approximately 7 % and 9 % to dust concentration and total deposition over TP, respectively. Over southern TP, the source contribution to dust deposition was estimated to be 42 %, 24 % and 21 % from TKD, foreign sources and QDD, respectively, suggesting potentially important impact of long-range transboundary dust transport on deposition, surface albedo and climate over TP."

This discrepancy has led to suggestions that models fail to accurately simulate changes in weather patterns caused by Arctic warming. Here, we show that the observed frequency and intensity of midlatitude cold extremes have strongly decreased since 1990 and are consistent with modeled trends. The previously reported increase in cold extremes was overestimated due to an artifact of changing data coverage. We also show that the fraction of land with observed cold extreme increases over recent decades is consistent with model internal variability on top of a near-uniform forced reduction in cold extremes across the midlatitudes. Our results provide strong evidence of a decrease in midlatitude cold extremes over recent decades and consistency between models and observations."

Invasive mammal eradication on islands is a proven conservation intervention that prevents biodiversity loss and is a foundational activity for restoring degraded island-ocean ecosystems. However, these interventions are prioritized and evaluated primarily on biodiversity-based objectives despite growing evidence that invasive species removal may also serve as an effective nature-based solution to increase climate resilience of island-ocean ecosystems and contribute to climate change solution by protecting and restoring unique carbon stocks of native woody vegetation. To assess the effectiveness of interventions at the global scale, we developed a consistent and scalable framework for the long-term monitoring of tree cover, forest extent, forest carbon, and vegetation productivity in 1078 islands across 17 ecozones. Time-series of satellite-derived estimates of tree cover and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index over 36 yr (1984–2020) were used to establish annual baselines and changes in forest extent, carbon stocks, and vegetation productivity. The analysis revealed significant and sustained positive trends in all the indices on islands with eradication. The magnitude and potential biological relevance of these effects was highly variable across ecozones, but the overall sustained effects provide strong evidence of a positive ecosystem response to invasive mammal removal. We also found that, collectively, these islands sustain more than 940 000 ha of forest and 53 million MgC of forest carbon. This novel framework enables measuring the climate co-benefits of island restoration interventions in relevant policy terms using a low cost and globally consistent methodology that is applicable across the range of spatial and temporal scales pertinent to ecosystem recovery dynamics on islands."

Predictions of future wildfire events, their extremity, and their impact on the environment and economy must account for the interactions between these drivers. Economic policy and land use decisions influence the susceptibility of an area to climate extremes, the probability of burning, and future decision making. To better understand how climate-driven drought events and adaptation efforts affect burned area, agricultural production losses, and land use decisions, we developed a storyline approach centered on Indonesia’s 2015 fire events, which saw significant (>5%) production losses of palm oil. We explored analogous events under three warming conditions and two storylines (multi-model ensemble mean climate change and high impact). We employed a model chain consisting of CMIP6 climate modeling to quantify climate change impacts, a wildfire climate impacts and adaptation model (FLAM) to predict burned areas, and the Global biosphere management model (GLOBIOM) to predict the resultant production losses and socio-economic consequences in the oil palm sector in Indonesia and, by extension, the EU. FLAM is a mechanistic, modular fire model used to reproduce and project wildfires based on various scenario criteria and input variables, whereas GLOBIOM is a global economic land use model, which assesses competition for land use and provides economic impacts based on scenario data. We found that total burned area and production loss can increase by up to 25% and lead to local price increases up to 70%, with only minor differences beyond 2.5 degrees of warming. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interactions of future warming, drought conditions, and extreme weather events when predicting their impacts on oil palm losses and burned area. This study sets the stage for further exploration on the impacts of land management policies on local and international environments and economies in the context of global warming."

We analyzed the extracts of passive air samplers deployed at 119 unique sites in Southern Canada between 2019 and 2022 for 353 organic vapors. Hierarchical clustering of the obtained data set revealed four archetypes of spatial concentration variability in the outdoor atmosphere, which are indicative of common sources and similar atmospheric dispersion behavior. “Point Source” signatures are characterized by elevated concentration in the vicinity of major release locations. A “Population” signature applies to compounds whose air concentrations are highly correlated with population density, and is associated with emissions from consumer products. The “Water Source” signature applies to substances with elevated levels in the vicinity of water bodies from which they evaporate. Another group of compounds displays a “Uniform” signature, indicative of a lack of major sources within the study area. We illustrate how such a data set, and the derived spatial patterns, can be applied to support the identification of sources, the quantification of atmospheric emissions, the modeling of air quality, and the investigation of potential inequities in inhalation exposure."

Pandis,Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation during the Oxidation of Large Aromatic and Other Cyclic Anthropogenic Volatile Organic Compounds,"The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from the reactions of anthropogenic large volatile (VOCs) and intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) with hydroxyl radicals under high NOx conditions was investigated. The organic compounds studied include cyclic alkanes of increasing size (amylcyclohexane, hexylcyclohexane, nonylcyclohexane, and decylcyclohexane) and aromatic compounds (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-triethylbenzene and 1,3,5-tritert-butylbenzene). A considerable amount of SOA was formed from all examined compounds. For the studied cyclohexanes (C11–C16) there appears that the SOA yield depends nonlinearly on the length of their substitute chain. The large cyclohexanes had higher yields than the aromatic compounds, but the aromatic precursors produced a more oxidized SOA. This was due to the production of lower volatility and O:C first generation products by the cyclohexanes. Most oxidation products (with C* < 104 μg m–3) in the case of cyclohexanes are SVOCs (∼50%), while of aromatics are IVOCs (∼60%). Structure, molecular size, and length of the substitute chain of the parent hydrocarbon were found to play key roles in SOA formation, oxidation state, and volatility. The SOA volatility distribution, effective vaporization enthalpy, and effective accommodation coefficient were also quantified by combining SOA yields, thermodenuder (TD) and isothermal dilution measurements. Parameterizations for the Volatility Basis Set (VBS) are proposed for future use in chemical transport models."

A dipolar mode with a notable meridional contrast between the equatorial and northern NIO is revealed by the second mode of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis with a sharp rise over the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB) since 2002. Our results show that the aerosol dipolar variation is primarily modulated by an El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during 1983–2001 (ID1) and by a warm phase of Atlantic Multi‐decadal Oscillation (AMO) during 2002–2020 (ID2), leading to a dry‐and‐warming condition spanning the coasts of East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula (AP), and South Asia (SA) that favors increasing aerosol emission and a longer life cycle in the upstream regions. A warm phase of the AMO tends to excite an anomalous cyclone in western Siberia and reinforces anticyclonic circulation in the Tibetan Plateau. Correlation analyses between the second EOF mode time series and other parameters in ID1 and ID2 show that an interannual dry‐and‐warming condition over the AP–SA is associated with a noticeable north‐south contrast of convection between the equatorial NIO and AP–SA in ID1. But in ID2, a zonal contrast of anomalous convective activities between the AP–SA and the BoB‐South China Sea is dominant, partially due to the warming AMO, which aids the development of anticyclonic cells over the TP and the strengthened subtropical westerly jet streams."

The measured LDRs of smoke in previous studies are highly variable and different from each other. Existing research on smoke aerosols considers only the internal mixing state of the black carbon (BC) particle population either by ignoring the externally mixed organic carbon (OC) particle population or by evaluating the LDR of smoke aerosols using the results of individual particles rather than the particle population. The field‐measured LDR of smoke then becomes difficult to interpret properly. The recent prescribed forest burning experiment in China showed that the LDR of freshly emitted smoke varies between 0.0% and 20.1% in wavelength (λ) of 532 nm. Electron microscopy images also showed that coated BC and pure OC exist simultaneously in biomass burning aerosols. Therefore, this study evaluates the influence of various parameters on the LDR of smoke by considering the internal and external mixing states. The calculated LDRs of the smoke aerosols were found to vary between 0.0% and 28.2% when λ is equal to 532 nm. The calculation results indicate that the LDR of smoke is slightly influenced by BC, considerably affected by the externally mixed OC, and is essentially dominated by the latter's morphology and particle size distribution. High levels and rapid changes of LDR of smoke can be well explained by nonsphericity and particle size distribution of externally mixed OC. This study advances the research on the measurement and evaluation of the LDR of smoke aerosols."

 To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the Paris Agreement committed countries to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 °C by urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Paris temperature ambitions and remaining carbon budgets mostly use models that lack feedback among fire, vegetation and carbon, which are essential for understanding the future resilience of ecosystems. Here we use a coupled fire–vegetation model to explore regional impacts and feedbacks across global warming levels. We address whether the 1.5 °C goal is consistent with avoiding significant ecosystem changes when considering shifts in fire regimes. We find that the global warming level at which fire began to impact global carbon storage significantly was 1.07 °C (0.8–1.34 °C) above pre-industrial levels and conclude that fire is already playing a major role in decreasing the effectiveness of land carbon sinks. We estimate that considering fire reduces the remaining carbon budget by 25 Gt CO2 (~5%) for limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C and 64 GtCO2 (~5%) for 2.0 °C compared to previous estimates. Whereas limiting warming to 1.5 °C is still essential for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, in many cases, we are already reaching the point of significant change in ecosystems rich in carbon and biodiversity. Only about 1.07 °C of climate warming above the pre-industrial level is required for fire to substantially diminish the effectiveness of global carbon sinks, suggesting that climate change has already been weakening carbon storage through fire, according to integrated model simulations that consider the interaction between fire and vegetation."

 The occurrence of extreme hot and dry summer conditions in the Pacific Northwest region of North America (PNW) has been known to be influenced by climate modes of variability such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and other variations in tropospheric circulation such as stationary waves and blocking. However, the extent to which the subseasonal remote tropical driver influences summer heat extremes and fire weather conditions across the PNW remains elusive. Our investigation reveals that the occurrence of heat extremes and associated fire-conducive weather conditions in the PNW is significantly heightened during the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) phases 6-7, by ~50–120% relative to the seasonal probability. The promotion of these heat extremes is primarily attributed to the enhanced diabatic heating over the tropical central-to-eastern North Pacific, which generates a wave train traveling downstream toward North America, resulting in a prominent high-pressure system over the PNW. The ridge, subsequently, promotes surface warming over the region primarily through increased surface radiative heating and enhanced adiabatic warming. The results suggest a potential pathway to improving subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions of heatwaves and wildfire risks in the PNW by improving the representation of BSISO heating over the tropical-to-eastern North Pacific."

 We have extended a recently developed metric that ingests United States station data—the accumulated winter season severity index—to a global indicator based on temperature and snowfall from reanalysis output. The expanded index is analyzed to reveal relationships between Arctic air temperatures/pressures and the probability of severe winter weather across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Here we find a direct and quasilinear relationship between anomalously high Arctic temperatures/pressures and increased severe winter weather, especially in northeastern continental regions downstream of maximum regional Arctic warming. Positive temperature trends in the Arctic are associated with positive trends in severe winter weather across the continents in mid- to late-winter, coinciding with an increase in stratospheric polar vortex disruptions. During the era of rapid Arctic warming, variability has decreased over the Arctic Ocean and Europe, but has increased in Canada, the Northern US and northeast Asia, indicating more pronounced shifts in weather conditions. Anomalously high Arctic pressures and temperatures are directly and quasi-linearly linked to incidents of severe winter weather in the northern mid-latitudes, especially downstream of maximum regional Arctic warming, according to an analysis using an updated index of accumulated winter severity."

 Sea spray emission is the largest mass flux of aerosols to the atmosphere with important impact on atmospheric radiative transfer. However, large uncertainties still exit in constraining this mass flux and its climate forcing, in particular in the Arctic, where sea ice and relatively low wind speed in summer constitute a significantly different regime compared to the global ocean. Sea state conditions and marine boundary layer stability are also critical variables, but their contribution is often overlooked. Here we present concurrent observations of sea state using a novel stereo camera system, of sea spray through coarse mode aerosols, and of meteorological variables to determine boundary layer stability in the Barents and Kara Seas during the 2021 Arctic Century Expedition. Our findings reveal that aerosol concentrations were highest over open waters, closely correlating with wave height, followed by wind speed, wave steepness, and wave age. Notably, these correlations were stronger under unstable marine boundary layer conditions, reflecting immediate sea spray generation. By analysing various combinations of sea and atmospheric variables, we identified the wave height Reynolds number as the most effective indicator of atmospheric sea spray concentration, explaining 57% of its variability in unstable conditions. Our study underscores the need to consider sea state, wind, and boundary layer conditions together to accurately estimate atmospheric sea spray concentrations in the Arctic."

However, the effects of evaporation on BBOA volatility and viscosity under different environmental conditions remain poorly understood. This study focuses on the molecular characterization of laboratory-generated BBOA proxies from wood pyrolysis emissions. The initial mixture, “pyrolysis oil (PO1)”, was progressively evaporated to produce more concentrated mixtures (PO1.33, PO2, and PO3) with volume reduction factors of 1.33, 2, and 3, respectively. Chemical speciation and volatility were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption combined with direct analysis in real-time ionization and high-resolution mass spectrometry (TPD-DART-HRMS). This novel approach quantified saturation vapor pressures and enthalpies of individual species, enabling the construction of volatility basis set distributions and the quantification of gas–particle partitioning. Viscosity estimates, validated by poke-flow experiments, showed a significant increase with evaporation, slowing particle-phase diffusion and extending equilibration times. These findings suggest that highly viscous tar ball particles in aged biomass burning emissions form as semivolatile components evaporate. The study highlights the importance of evaporation processes in shaping BBOA properties, underscoring the need to incorporate these factors into atmospheric models for better predictions of BBOA aging and its environmental impact."

However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions."

These observations are consistent with rapid conversion of SO2 (e‐folding time: 17.1 ± 4.3 days) to SA, with an injected burden of >1.0 Tg SO2. This points at larger SO2 injections than previously thought.

This study spans a 2‐month period during the wet seasons of 2014 and 2015. We observe a strong correlation between the MCS track density and accumulated precipitation in the Amazon basin. Key factors contributing to precipitation, such as MCS properties (number, size, rainfall intensity, and movement), are thoroughly examined. Our analysis reveals that while the overall model produces fewer MCSs with smaller mean sizes compared to observations, it tends to overpredict total precipitation due to excessive rainfall intensity for heavy rainfall events (≥10 mm hr−1). These biases in simulated MCS properties could vary with the constraints on the convective background environment. Moreover, while the wet bias from heavy (convective) rainfall outweighs the dry bias in light (stratiform) rainfall, the latter can be crucial, particularly when MCS cloud cover is significantly underestimated.

By taking advantage of the high spatio‐temporal resolution of an X‐band dual‐polarized multiparameter phased array radar, this paper employs negative KDP signatures to investigate the variation of electric fields in an isolated thunderstorm within its evolution, and the relationship between the negative KDP signatures and intracloud (IC) lightning activity. The results show that the radar‐inferred strong electric fields distributed in a region of about 8.5–10 km during the developing stage, then extended from about 10 km to the cloud top during the mature stage, with an increasing IC lightning flash rate before the end of the mature stage. Subsequently, the electric fields weakened associated with a large amount of IC lightning discharges. The qualitative analysis results indicate that the evolution of the radar‐inferred electric fields associated with the upper charge regions is consistent with the electrification process in the isolated thunderstorm, inferred by the IC lighting activity. In addition, there is a tendency for the increased IC lightning rate as the decrease in average composite KDP in the middle and upper layers of the thunderstorm, with a time lag of about 5.5 min between the minimum average composite KDP and the peak IC lightning rate, while a good correlation between the negative KDP volume and the IC lightning flash rate at a lag of approximately 9 min."

However, plants have the capacity to acclimate to rising temperatures by adjusting Topt, thereby maintaining or even enhancing photosynthesis and carbon uptake. Despite this, it remains unclear how Topt of vegetation activity changes over time and to what extent global vegetation can acclimate to current temperature changes. In this study, we evaluated the temporal trends of Topt of vegetation activity and the thermal acclimation magnitudes globally using three remote‐sensed vegetation indices and eddy‐covariance observations of gross primary productivity from 1982 to 2020. We found that the global Topt of vegetation activity has increased at an average rate of 0.63°C per decade over the past four decades. The increase in Topt closely tracked the rise in annual maximum daily mean temperature (Tmax), indicating that thermal acclimation has occurred widely across the globe. Globally, we found an average thermal acclimation magnitude of 0.38°C per 1°C increase in Tmax. Notably, polar and continental regions exhibited the highest thermal acclimation magnitudes, while arid areas showed the lowest. Additionally, the thermal acclimation magnitude was positively affected by interannual temperature variability and negatively affected by soil moisture and vapor pressure deficits. Our findings indicate that terrestrial ecosystems have acclimated to current climate warming trends with varying degrees, suggesting a greater potential for land carbon uptake. Moreover, these results highlight the necessity for earth system models to integrate the thermal acclimation of Topt to better forecast the global carbon cycle."

However, the inherent limitations of this remote sensing technique make it difficult to assess rivers unless ambient conditions are cloud‐free, devoid of steep terrain and the rivers are at least 60 m wide. To address these challenges that limit the spatiotemporal continuity of satellite‐based hydro‐thermal data, we harnessed the extensive coverage from the Landsat missions' thermal infrared sensors and data‐driven techniques to estimate surface water temperature of rivers. Out of the tested data‐driven techniques, we selected the Random Forest Regressor as our prime non‐linear approach for estimation of surface water temperature in rivers. Using the selected technique, proposed as THORR (Thermal History of Regulated Rivers), we successfully reconstructed a multi‐decadal, continuous spatiotemporal surface water temperature record for regulated rivers in the Columbia River Basin. Using 42 years of data, the surface water temperature could be predicted on average with 0.71° C of absolute error regardless of the dam's potential thermal influence in the downstream reaches.

 Interregional transport plays a significant role in haze formation with varying and disputable contribution extent. Current research on quantitatively analyzing interregional atmospheric pollution transport has mainly relied on meteorological and chemical models. However, these models are typically affected by uncertainties due to the assumptions and simplifications inherent in the numerical simulations and source emission estimations. In this study, a comprehensive optical flow framework is developed to offer a new perspective on quantitative characterization of interregional transport of atmospheric pollution based on synergistic observations from geostationary and sun-synchronous satellites. In this framework, the high-frequency continuous aerosol observing images are regarded as video in computer vision, and an aerosol dynamic optical flow algorithm is proposed by incorporating aerosol-specific assumptions and constraints, overcoming the limitation that traditional optical flow methods are typically confined to rigid bodies. Results demonstrate that the developed optical flow framework could distinguish the aerosol transport process from other dynamic processes of aerosol development and accurately capture the fast-changing details of transport processes. Moreover, the satellite-based optical flow framework achieves aerosol transport results comparable to those of widely accepted model-based methods, demonstrating the physical interpretation of pixel-based optical flow results and highlighting its effectiveness in quantitative characterization of the atmospheric pollution transport process via the Aerosol Transport Index (ATI). Furthermore, a case analysis of long-term assessments of interregional transport of atmospheric pollution indicates that Beijing acts as a “sink” of atmospheric pollution, and a downward trend could be found from the annually averaged transported aerosol net loadings due to the emission reduction policy. Compared with model-based methods, the satellite-based optical flow framework is directly grounded in observations and does not rely on emission inventories that take years to update. Therefore, it not only helps improve understanding the patterns of atmospheric pollution interregional transport, but also provides a more efficient and economical way to assess the effectiveness of regional joint control policy."

Based on the processing of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) scenes, the algorithm offers an unprecedented trade-off between spatial (375 m) and temporal resolution (multiple acquisitions per day), having the potential to detect thermal anomalies for pixel-integrated temperatures as low as 0.5 K above the background, while maintaining a false positive rate of ∼1.8 %. The analysis of decadal time series of VIIRS data (2012−2023), acquired at three different volcanoes, reveals how the algorithm can: (i) detect hydrothermal crises at fumarolic fields (Vulcano, Italy), (ii) unveil thermal unrest preceding dome extrusions and explosive eruptions (Agung, Indonesia), and (iii) spatially trace lava flows extent and quantify their advancement rate, as well as track their long-term cooling behaviour (La Palma, Spain).We envisage that the algorithm will prove instrumental for detecting early signs of volcanic activity and following the evolution of eruptive phenomena, providing a useful tool for hazard management and risk reduction applications. Furthermore, the compilation of statistically robust multidecadal thermal datasets will provide novel insights and new perspectives into volcano monitoring, laying the ground for forthcoming higher-resolution TIR missions."

 Inversion based on observational data and the source-receptor relationship (SRR) simulated by an air quality model is an effective means to estimate NOx emissions. However, the SRR bias induced by the inherent uncertainty of the simulated model leads to potential errors in the inversed emissions, but this is seldom considered in NOx inversion. In this study, we constructed an inversion model based on the SRR correction (IMSC) by introducing a correction matrix, combined with joint regularization scheme and genetic algorithm. We innovated the dynamic acquisition method of center-restricted parameters for the correction matrix, combined this with other parts of the IMSC, attaining the multi-month and multi-region pollutant emission inversion. Hypothetical examples demonstrated that the IMSC effectively corrected the SRR and accurately estimated the NOx emissions. The IMSC was used to estimate Linyi county-level NOx emissions for January, April, July and October (typical months) during 2020 and 2021. An inversion model without SRR correction (IMWSC) was developed for comparison with the IMSC. Results showed that the IMSC more accurately, robustly, and reasonably estimated NOx emissions. Compared to the IMWSC, the IMSC improved the mean correlation between NOx emissions and NO2 observational concentrations by 25.0%, enhancing the correlation between NOx emissions and NO2 column concentrations by 111.3%. The similar NOx emission change ratios (σaverage = 5.1%) between the typical months in 2021 and 2020 among the different counties indicated a more robust performance of the IMSC than the IMWSC (σaverage = 55.2%). In addition, the NOx emissions inversed by the IMSC also showed better consistency with social activity levels (i.e., electricity consumption). The typical monthly Linyi's county-level NOx emission characterization was also studied. NOx emissions were lower in April, July, and October 2021 than the same period in 2020 due to COVID-19 and pollution controls. This study provides strategies for swiftly and accurately estimating pollutant emissions."

 In Mediterranean countries, such as Greece, the frequency of forest fires has increased in recent years, primarily due to the widespread impacts of climate change. At the end of August 2023, Greece experienced a record-breaking heatwave that triggered severe wildfire incidents, significantly impacting the atmospheric conditions of several cities, among them Thessaloniki. A significant number of wildfires occurred in northern Greece (Evros), burning thousands of hectares of the protected Dadia forest (Natura 2000) and releasing a significant load of smoke into the atmosphere. According to the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) a total area of 90,000 ha was burnt collectively by the Evros extreme wildfires during August 2023. The emissions led to severely adverse air pollution conditions, causing reduced visibility across an extended eastern Mediterranean region for several days. In this work, we analyze the influence of the transported biomass burning particles on the aerosol properties in the free troposphere, as well as on the surface UV radiation levels over Thessaloniki during the last week of August 2023. The transported smoke plume was detected over the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics (LAP) in Thessaloniki, approximately 240 km away from the burning area, from August 22nd to the 25th. During this period, the presence of smoke led to exceptionally increased levels of aerosol optical depth (AOD), reaching up to 3.4 at 340 nm (the highest ever recorded in Thessaloniki), as well as high Ångström exponent (AE) values, peaking at 2.4 for the 440–870 nm range, followed by high Fine Mode Fractions (FMFs), indicating the prevalence of fine-mode smoke aerosol particle. Moreover, during the event, the presence of the biomass burning aerosols led to a strong attenuation of the solar UV irradiance by up to 90 %, reaching unprecedented levels, similar of a solar eclipse. The primary goal of this study is to highlight the extensive impacts that wildfires have, which are anticipated to increase in frequency in the near future, due to the predicted rise in the rate of occurrence of summer heatwaves especially for Mediterranean areas and specifically for Greece. Furthermore, the great value of the synergistic monitoring of the event with ground-based remote sensing instrumentation, along with satellite aerosol observations and modeling tools, is made prominent."

Thus, we aimed to explore this association in a cross-sectional analysis, with cardiometabolic phenotypes derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phenotypes of the left (LV) and right cardiac ventricle, whole-body adipose tissue (AT), and organ-specific AT were obtained by MRI in 400 participants of the KORA cohort. Land-use regression models were used to estimate residential long-term exposures to TRAP, e.g., nitrogen dioxides (NO2) or particle number concentration (PNC). Associations between TRAP and MRI phenotypes were modeled using linear regression. Participants’ mean age was 56 ± 9 years, and 42% were female. Long-term exposure to TRAP was associated with decreased LV wall thickness; a 6.0 μg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with a −1.9% [95% confidence interval: −3.7%; −0.1%] decrease in mean global LV wall thickness. Furthermore, we found associations between TRAP and increased cardiac AT. A 2,242 n/cm3 increase in PNC was associated with a 4.3% [−1.7%; 10.4%] increase in mean total cardiac AT.

This study investigates the role of formic acid (HCOOH), a prevalent electron and proton donor, in the transformation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the formation of HONO on photoactive mineral dust. Exploiting hematite (Fe2O3) as an environmental indicator, we demonstrate that HCOOH significantly promotes the photoreduction of NO2 to HONO, while suppressing nitrate accumulation. This occurs through the formation of a surface ≡Fe–OOCH complex, where sunlight activates the C–H bond to generate and transfer active hydrogen, directly converting NO2 to HONO. Additionally, HCOOH can trigger the photolysis of nitrates as predeposited on Fe2O3, further increasing HONO production. These findings show that HCOOH-mediated photochemical reactions on iron minerals may contribute to elevated atmospheric HONO levels, highlighting a crucial pathway with broad effects on atmospheric chemistry and public health."

The elevated North Atlantic Tripole SST triggered a strong negative Pacific meridional mode and easterly anomalies in the equatorial western‐central Pacific.

North‐Central India, a highly populated region prone to heatwaves, has experienced record maximum temperatures (> ${ >} $48°C) during the pre‐monsoon season. While studies have shown positive trends in heatwaves due to rising air temperature, we identify a shift in pre‐monsoon mean daily maximum temperature over North‐Central India, resulting in an increase in temperature by 0.7°C post‐1998. The jump in temperature is associated with a northward migration of the subtropical westerly jet since 1998. We find that the meridional shift in the subtropical westerly jet explains more than 25% of the variability in heatwave characteristics over North‐Central India, implying that the increase in heatwaves post‐1998 is associated with a northward shift of the jet. These findings highlight that the exacerbation of heatwaves in North‐Central India is driven by atmospheric dynamical changes triggered by a regime shift, further compounded by global warming."

We present a newly implemented aerosol formation algorithm that enhances the representation of nitrate aerosol in the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) coupled with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The simulated aerosol chemical composition, as well as vertical distributions of aerosol size and mass, are evaluated using in situ and remote sensing observations. The simulated concentrations (ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate) and size distributions are generally within the error bars of data. We find nitrate, organics, and sulfate contribute significantly to the UTLS aerosol concentration between 15°–45°N and 0°–160°E. The two key formation mechanisms of nitrate‐containing aerosols in the ATAL are ammonium neutralization to form ammonium nitrate in regions where convection is active, and condensation of nitric acid in regions of cold temperature. Furthermore, including nitrate formation in the model doubles the surface area density in the tropical tropopause region between 15°–45°N and 0°–160°E, which alters the chlorine partitioning and subsequently impacts the rate of ozone depletion."

Particulate matter in wildfire smoke can worsen asthma control, cause acute exacerbations, and increase health resource utilization (HRU) and costs. Research to date has been retrospective with few opportunities to project changes in underlying asthma control and HRU given exposure to wildfire smoke. Using a microsimulation of 5,000 Californians with asthma, we calculated changes in asthma control distribution, risk of exacerbation, and HRU and cost outcomes in the 16 weeks during and after a wildfire. The model was calibrated against empirical values on asthma control distribution and increased HRU after exposure to wildfire smoke. Without smoke exposure, 48% of the cohort exhibited complete or well control of asthma, and 8% required acute healthcare per cycle. Following two consecutive weeks of wildfire smoke, complete or well control of asthma fell to 27%, with an additional 4% HRU. This corresponds to total additional $601,250 in all‐cause medical costs and eight fewer quality‐adjusted life years over 16 weeks of model time. Our model found increased asthma health and cost burden due to wildfire smoke that were aligned with empirical evidence from a historic wildfire event. This study establishes a framework for a more nuanced understanding of asthma impacts from wildfire smoke that can help inform the development of public health policies to mitigate harm and promote resilience among asthma patients in the face of climate change."

 Urban heat island (UHI) is among the most pronounced human impacts on Earth. To formulate locally adapted mitigation strategies, a comprehensive understanding of the influencing mechanisms of UHI at high resolution is imperative. Based on surface energy balance, we attributed surface UHI (SUHI) into five biophysical terms (surface radiation, anthropogenic heat, convection, evapotranspiration and heat storage term) using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images in Beijing. The simulated SUHI intensity, derived by combining all five contribution terms, exhibited a good consistency but a higher spatial resolution, than SUHI intensity extracted from Landsat-8 land surface temperature product. SUHI intensity tended to decrease from the old city to outsides, attributed to the decrease of evapotranspiration, solar radiation and anthropogenic heat term. The convection and heat storage term play a positive role in reducing SUHI. Among urban morphological blocks, low-rise and high-density blocks had the strongest SUHI, with the evapotranspiration term contributing the most. The results highlighted the capacity of the urban surface to evaporate water in affecting Beijing SUHI. The proposed method provides one useful tool to analyze the drivers of SUHI from the aspect of heat formation, which can be potentially applied worldwide for large-scale comparisons of how urbanization affects UHI."

 Cities worldwide face escalating climate change risks, underscoring the need for spatially and temporally resolved urban air temperature (Ta) data. While satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data have been widely used to estimate Ta, high-resolution hourly Ta estimation in urban areas remains underexplored. Traditional methods typically rely on LST data from geostationary satellites and continuous 24-h Ta observations from weather stations. To address these limitations, we introduce a method that combines a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model with a random forest model to estimate monthly mean hourly urban Ta at 1-km resolution. This approach leverages a limited number of diurnal Ta observations from weather stations, MODIS LST data, and ancillary information. The core idea of the proposed method is to transform the estimation of monthly mean hourly 1-km Ta into estimating 1-km DTC model parameters, primarily daily maximum and minimum Ta values. This method capitalizes on MODIS LST's ability to estimate daily Ta extremes and requires only four diurnal Ta observations within a daily cycle to estimate monthly mean hourly 1-km Ta. Station-based five-fold cross-validation yields overall RMSE values consistently below 1.0 °C across nine cities with diverse geographic and climatic contexts. The accuracy achieved with only four diurnal Ta observations rivals that obtained using continuous 24-h Ta observations. Even with a limited training set of ten stations, the overall RMSE remains below 1.0 °C for most cities. The proposed method proves effective for both single-city and multi-city modeling and can estimate daily hourly 1-km Ta under clear-sky conditions. In conclusion, this study offers a feasible, efficient, and versatile method for accurately estimating monthly mean hourly 1-km Ta, which can be readily applied to other cities and holds potential for various applications."

 PM2.5 is still one of the major atmospheric pollutants worldwide. Extracting contributions of anthropogenic emission control from the observed PM2.5 variations (PM2.5_anth), which are also strongly affected by meteorological changes, is critical for effective pollution control. Statistical and machine learning methods are usually used for such purpose, but the effectiveness of these methods is hard to evaluate due to the lack of observed anthropogenic contributions. In this study, we use the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem standard simulation to mimic PM2.5 variability in the real atmosphere, and use the model simulation with fixed meteorological fields as the “true value” for PM2.5_anth. We evaluate the effectiveness of three methods in meteorological normalization of PM2.5 on decadal (2006–2017) and synoptic (one month) scale: multiple linear regression (MLR), general additive model (GAM), and random forest (RF) algorithm. For meteorological normalization of PM2.5 on decadal scale, 67–72% of the MLR simulations show positive biases and 56–75% of the RF simulations show negative biases. The “true value” of PM2.5_anth falls within the range of meteorological normalization results of the three methods in most cases, but consistent positive/negative biases are observed in ∼30% of the cases, when meteorological changes dominate PM2.5 variability. In addition, the biases are correlated to the contribution of meteorological changes. As such, multiple statistical or machine learning methods are recommended to quantify the uncertainties associated with method choice in cases anthropogenic emission changes dominate PM2.5 variability. On synoptic scale, RF performs better in reproducing the daily variations of the PM2.5_anth differences than MLR (GAM) in all (83% of) the cases, and is recommended for meteorological normalization of PM2.5 in short-term in eastern China."

 Ozone (O3) concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) surrounding Los Angeles remain at unhealthy levels despite multiple decades of control programs designed to reduce emissions of precursor Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Here we report on comprehensive VOC measurements made at Redlands, which has the highest measured O3 concentrations in SoCAB, as part of the Re-Evaluating the Chemistry of Air Pollutants in California (RECAP-CA) field campaign (July–October 2021). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was applied to identify nine VOC factors. A photochemical chamber model initialized by field measurements was configured with a tagging technique to quantify the VOC factor contributions to O3 formation in Redlands. Biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) made the largest contribution (26.6%) to O3 formation, followed by traffic VOCs (21.2%), volatile chemical products (VCPs) (19%), and plant decomposition (14.9%). High O3 episodes were not driven by increased VOC emissions from any single source, but rather were associated with stagnation events that concentrated VOCs from all sources and high temperature days that enhanced O3 formation efficiency. This implies that VOC controls optimized to reduce O3 concentrations would look similar in both the NOx-limited and VOC-limited regimes that can occur at Redlands. These results suggest that control strategies that reduce VOC and NOx emissions from the on-road vehicle fleet, such as increasing electrification, may yield O3 reductions on days in both the NOx-limited and VOC-limited chemical regimes at Redlands."

 China's Clean Air Actions have substantially improved ambient PM2.5 air quality since 2013. However, ozone (O3) pollution in urban areas has worsened in recent years, particularly in the eastern region. The formation of O3 in these high emission areas is highly complex and regulated by numerous factors. Utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), this study conducted a comprehensive analysis through nine sensitivity experiments for the years 2013 and 2017, aimed at disentangling the relative contributions of major factors (e.g., meteorological factors, anthropogenic emissions, biogenic emissions, and aerosol feedback mechanisms) to the observed O3 concentration trends in Jiangsu, a developed region of China with increasing trend of O3 level. Our findings indicate a pronounced increase in mean daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 levels in the economically vibrant southern Jiangsu, contrasted with a decrease in the less developed northern regions. The study identifies anthropogenic emissions change as the primary driver of O3 variations, with significant impacts also attributed to meteorological conditions and aerosol feedback effects, while biogenic emission shifts play a lesser role. In terms of meteorological factors, we discovered that the alteration in meteorological thermal factors (enhanced solar radiation and temperatures) in 2017, compared to 2013, exerted a more pronounced influence on the formation of O3 than the change in thermally driven dynamic factors (boundary layer height and wind speed). Moreover, the study observes a shift in O3 formation sensitivity from VOC-sensitive to transitional or NOX-sensitive regimes, signifying a notable transformation in the regional atmospheric chemistry conducive to O3 generation. Aerosol feedback effects, through complex pathways including photolysis rate alterations and modifications in the vertical O3 distribution, further compound the challenge of mitigating O3 levels. Our research underscores the necessity for adaptive, region-specific strategies to mitigate O3 pollution, providing potential insights for policymakers to formulate effective control measures."

 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) is one of the most crucial observations in atmospheric and climate science. GNSS RO globally produces accurate and long-term stable vertical profiles for essential climate variables with high vertical resolution in all weather conditions. RO measurements offer global coverage but may be limited for specific regions. Currently, various RO satellite constellation programs have been developed by nations and companies, and the growing quantity of RO observations can contribute not only globally but also has the potential to benefit specific regions, such as China. To investigate the potential of RO observation in China, the performance of five operational RO measurements from COSMIC-2, MetOp-B/C, FY-3D/E, Spire and PlanetiQ on data coverage capabilities and quality are assessed by comparing with ERA5 and radiosonde over China. The results of data coverage showed that all RO missions can acquire extensive coverage over China with effective low-altitude penetration capability, whereas MetOp-B/C exhibits some gaps in local time coverage. The results of data quality confirmed that commercial Spire and PlanetiQ are comparable to those of national-led COSMIC-2, MetOp-B/C and FY3D/E, even though Spire exhibited a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The mean bending angle and refractivity relative differences of all RO measurements are within ±0.53/1.30 % and ± 0.54/0.28 % (with respect to ERA5/radiosonde) in the altitude range of 5 to 35 km, respectively, and the corresponding relative standard deviations (SD) are less than 2.20/6.99 % and 1.35/1.56 %, respectively. Mean temperature and specific humidity differences of all RO measurements are within ±0.18/0.22 K and ± 0.08/0.22 g/kg, respectively, from the near-surface to 12 km, with SD of less than 1.26/1.67 K and 0.84/0.91 g/kg. Among the five RO missions, FY-3D/E exhibits larger errors in refractivity, temperature and specific humidity. The RO profiles derived from GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo show comparable quality at the altitudes below 35 km. These results can help users further understand the capabilities and performance of these RO observations and indicate the application potential of numerous RO profiles from multi-source RO measurements, which is anticipated to enhance numerical weather predictions for China."

Thus, accurately identifying the emission hotspots of TRAPs is essential for assessing potential exposure risks. We investigated the relationship between turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and pollutant dispersion (D) through an integrated field measurement. A five-year near-road sampling campaign (5 min based) near a light-duty vehicle-restricted roadway and an on-road sampling campaign (5 s based) on isolated proving grounds were conducted. The D was first calculated based on vehicle emission and pollutant concentrations and then paired with TKE measurements. Here, 198 near-road and 377 on-road measurement pairs were collected. In the near-road measurements, TKE and D showed a positive relationship (R2 ≥ 0.69) with the vehicle flow rate, while they showed similar decay patterns and sensitivity to vehicle types in the on-road measurements. A relationship between TKE and D (TKE-D) was developed through these measurements, demonstrating a robust correlation (R2 ≥ 0.61) and consistent slope values (1.1–1.3). These findings provide field evidence for the positive association between TKE and D, irrespective of the measurement techniques or locations. The TKE-D relationship enables vehicle emission estimation with TKE as the sole input, facilitating the identification of emission hotspots with high spatiotemporal resolution."

We used 7 years of satellite observations and model and reanalysis products to control for co‐varying meteorology, and to assess how dust and other aerosols impact cloud phase and cloud radiative effects over the summertime sea ice. We focus on clouds at 3 km, where dust modeling is most accurate. There is strong indication that dust aerosols caused about 4.5% of clouds below −15°C to change phase, with smaller effects at higher temperatures. Sulfate has a smaller impact on cloud phase. Dust is associated with cloud‐mediated surface cooling of up to a 6.3 W m−2 below single‐layer clouds at ∼3 km in June.

Here we characterize the atmospheric signal of this strong evaporation in terms of water vapor isotopes and investigate if such a signal can have a cumulative imprint on the ocean mixed‐layer. Observations include continuous water vapor isotope measurements, event‐based precipitation samples, and sea‐water samples taken at various depths from the research vessel Alliance during the Iceland‐Greenland Seas Project cruise in February and March 2018. In conjunction with a simulation from a regional, isotope‐enabled atmospheric model, we find that the predominant atmospheric isotope signature during predominant marine cold‐air outbreak conditions is −129.8 ± 16.6‰ for δ2H and −18.10 ± 2.87‰ for δ18O, with a d‐excess of 15.1 ± 7.9‰, indicating enhanced non‐equilibrium fractionation compared to the global average. During events of warm‐air intrusion from mid‐latitudes, near‐surface vapor becomes saturated and the vapor d‐excess approaches equilibrium or becomes negative. Similarly, precipitation d‐excess is lower and thus closer to equilibrium conditions during warm‐air intrusions. There are indications that an evaporation signal of waters exiting the Nordic Seas through Denmark Strait could be locally enhanced over seasons to years, as supported by simple model calculations. Our findings thus suggest that evaporation signals could be transferred into the ocean isotope composition in this region, potentially enabling mass‐balance constraints in isotope‐enabled coupled ocean‐atmosphere models."

Understanding MCSs in NwSA is vital due to their impact on precipitation patterns and potential for severe weather events. To enhance this understanding, the ATRACKCS algorithm was developed for tracking convective systems, utilizing precipitation and brightness temperature data sets. This research focuses on documenting the spatiotemporal variability of MCS occurrence, life cycle, and movement. Notably, MCS hotspots were identified to the west of the major orographic features in the region, with maximum occurrences at night, contrasting with the region's typical afternoon peak in land convection. MCS movement is also heavily influenced by topography, with higher velocities on the eastern (windward) side of the Andes compared to velocities on the western (leeward) side. MCSs generally move westward, driven by easterly winds, but this pattern is not consistent throughout the year or region. Northward movement is predominant to the west of the Andes, while southward movement is observed to the east. These seasonal and regional movement variations are linked to factors such as the intertropical convergence zone position, moisture availability, topography, and low‐level jets. This research underscores the complexity of MCSs in NwSA and emphasizes the need for detailed studies on the atmospheric environment shaping these systems. Additionally, it provides a robust 21‐year MCS database for NwSA and an advanced tracking tool for research in various geographic contexts and impact areas."

In the last four decades, due to global warming, permafrost degradation has accelerated significantly in high latitudes and altitudes. However, the impact of permafrost degradation on vegetation remains poorly understood to date. Based on active layer thickness (ALT) monitoring data, meteorological data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, we found that most ALT‐monitored sites in the Northern Hemisphere show an increasing trend in NDVI and ALT. This suggests an overall increase in NDVI from 1980 to 2021 while permafrost degradation has been occurring. Permafrost degradation positively influences NDVI growth, with the intensity of the effects varying across land cover types and permafrost regions. Furthermore, based on Mann‐Kendall trend test, we detected abrupt changes in NDVI and environmental factors, further confirming that there is a strong consistency between the abrupt changes of ALT and NDVI, and the consistency between the abrupt change events of ALT and NDVI is stronger than that of air temperature and precipitation. These findings work toward a better comprehending of permafrost effects on vegetation growth in the context of climate change."

 Carbon sinks in the tropical rainforests are restricting the global warming to attain unprecedented heights. However, deforestation and climate change is switching them to a net carbon source at some of the deforested patches. Using machine learning algorithm we predict that more than 50% of the tropical rainforests will undergo rapid “Savannisation”/transformation by the end of 21st century under high emission scenarios. Climate change projects ‘El Niño-like’ warming condition, which decreases precipitation in the rainforests and favors atmospheric dryness. In Central Amazonia vegetation degradation saturates the carbon sink and more than 25% of the rainforests will transform into a net carbon source due to increase in soil microbial respiration. This transition will accelerate if Eastern Pacific/Global temperature warms beyond 1.5◦K/2.3◦K (by 2050’s) and will undergo a steeper transit by ~2075 (2.45◦K/3.8◦K warming).

In this study, we conducted the first comprehensive monthly assessment of the excess particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to the heightened congestion and freight transport activity from ocean-going vessels (OGVs), trucks, locomotives, and cargo handling equipment (CHE) supporting seaport operations. Excess emissions peaked in October 2021 at 23 tons of NOx per day and 2001 tons of CO2 per day. The strategic queuing system implemented in November 2021 significantly reduced the number of anchored and loitering OGVs and their emissions near the ports, even during continued high cargo throughput until Summer 2022. Looking forward, we analyzed projected emissions benefits of adopted California Air Resources Board regulations requiring cleaner and zero-emission trucks, locomotives, and CHE over the next decade.

Although various studies have revealed PM2.5 chemical components, there is limited knowledge on how to reduce PM2.5 concentrations through administrative policies focusing on source management. We compared PM2.5 compositional characteristics and performed source apportionment using the positive matrix factorization in four metropolitan cities (Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Ulsan) in South Korea from 2014 to 2018. The annual average of PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the annual national ambient air quality standard of 15 μg m−3 in all areas while secondary inorganic aerosols constituted the largest fraction of PM2.5. This implies that secondary formation from gaseous precursors in the atmosphere was the main factor contributing to ambient PM2.5. However, the concentrations of PM2.5 constituents varied significantly across cities, suggesting that PM2.5 is a heterogeneous pollutant considerably influenced by region-specific conditions. In line with the chemical composition, secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, and mobile-related sources were found to be significant contributors of PM2.5. Additionally, the extent of contribution from each source varied across the study regions. We also evaluated the impacts of policy interventions by comparing the PM2.5 composition and source apportionment before and after the policies for improving air quality. Intensive programs focused on the vehicle sector in Seoul led to a considerable decrease in the concentrations of carbonaceous compounds and mobile-related sources. In addition, strengthened regulations on coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) since 2016 have influenced the contributions of coal combustion sources in two cities adjacent to the west coastal area, where approximately half of the CFPPs of the country are densely distributed. Overall, the study’s findings indicate that region-specific PM2.5 chemical constituents and source contributions should be considered for establishing PM2.5-related policies, considering the high heterogeneity of PM2.5."

The FLUXNET-CH4 synthesis initiative has established a global network of flux tower infrastructure, offering valuable data products and fostering a dedicated community for the measurement and analysis of methane flux data. Existing studies using the FLUXNET-CH4 Community Product v1.0 have provided invaluable insights into the drivers of ecosystem-to-regional spatial patterns and daily-to-decadal temporal dynamics in temperate, boreal, and Arctic climate regions. However, as the wetland CH4 monitoring network grows, there is a critical knowledge gap about where new monitoring infrastructure ought to be located to improve understanding of the global wetland CH4 budget. Here we address this gap with a spatial representativeness analysis at existing and hypothetical observation sites, using 16 process-based wetland biogeochemistry models and machine learning. We find that, in addition to eddy covariance monitoring sites, existing chamber sites are important complements, especially over high latitudes and the tropics. Furthermore, expanding the current monitoring network for wetland CH4 emissions should prioritize, first, tropical and second, sub-tropical semi-arid wetland regions. Considering those new hypothetical wetland sites from tropical and semi-arid climate zones could significantly improve global estimates of wetland CH4 emissions and reduce bias by 79% (from 76 to 16 TgCH4 y−1), compared with using solely existing monitoring networks.

Murray-Watson;Edward Gryspeerdt,Air mass history linked to the development of Arctic mixed-phase clouds,"The formation of mixed-phase clouds during marine cold-air outbreaks is not well understood. Our study, using satellite data and Lagrangian trajectories, reveals that the occurrence of these clouds depends on both time and temperature, influenced partly by the presence of biological ice-nucleating particles. This highlights the importance of comprehending local aerosol dynamics for precise modelling of cloud-phase transitions in the Arctic. 
 Clouds formed during marine cold-air outbreaks (MCAOs) exhibit a distinct transition from stratocumulus decks near the ice edge to broken cumuliform fields further downwind. The mechanisms associated with ice formation are believed to be crucial in driving this transition, yet the factors influencing such formation remain unclear. Through Lagrangian trajectories collocated with satellite data, this study investigates the development of mixed-phase clouds using these outbreaks. Cloud formed in MCAOs are characterized by a swift shift from liquid to ice-containing states, contrasting with non-MCAO clouds also moving off the ice edge. These mixed-phase clouds are predominantly observed at temperatures below −20 °C near the ice edge. However, further into the outbreak, they become dominant at  temperatures as high as −13 °C. This shift is consistent with the influence of biological ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which become more prevalent as the air mass ages over the ocean. The evolution of these clouds is closely linked to the history of the air mass, especially the length of time it spends over snow- and ice-covered surfaces – terrains may that be deficient in INPs. This connection also accounts for the observed seasonal variations in the development of Arctic clouds, both within and outside of MCAO events. The findings highlight the importance of understanding both local marine aerosol sources near the ice edge and the overarching INP distribution in the Arctic for modelling of cloud phase in the region."

The identification results from the bi-Gaussian method are more reasonable and more consistent with the evolution process of atmospheric thermal stratifications. 
 The tropopause is an important transition layer and can be a diagnostic of upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric structures, exhibiting unique atmospheric thermal and dynamic characteristics. A comprehensive understanding of the evolution of fine tropopause structures is necessary and primary for the further study of complex multi-scale atmospheric physical–chemical coupling processes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. A novel method utilizing the bi-Gaussian function is capable of identifying the characteristic parameters of vertical tropopause structures and providing information on double-tropopause (DT) structures. The new method improves the definition of the cold-point tropopause and detects one (or two) of the most significant local cold points  by fitting the temperature profiles to the bi-Gaussian function, which defines the point(s) as the tropopause height(s). The bi-Gaussian function exhibits excellent potential for explicating the variation trends of temperature profiles. The results of the bi-Gaussian method and lapse rate tropopause, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization, are compared in detail for different cases. Results indicate that the bi-Gaussian method is able to more stably and obviously identify the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the thermal tropopauses, even in the presence of multiple temperature inversion layers at higher elevations. Moreover, 5 years of historical radiosonde data from China (from 2012 to 2016) revealed that the occurrence frequency and thickness of the DT, as well as the single-tropopause height and the first and second DT heights, displayed significant meridional monotonic variations. The occurrence frequency (thickness) of the DT increased from 1.07 % (1.96 km) to 47.19 % (5.42 km) in the latitude range of 16–50° N. The meridional gradients of tropopause height were relatively large in the latitude range of 30–40° N, essentially corresponding to the climatological locations of the subtropical jet and the Tibetan Plateau."

We found that biomass burning and transboundary transport are the main sources of NOCs in the high-altitude area. Understanding these aerosol sources informs how they add to regional and potentially global climate changes. Our findings could help shape effective environmental policies to enhance air quality and address climate impacts in this sensitive region. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is highly susceptible to climate change, and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) represent one of the largest uncertainties with respect to their impact on the climate in high-altitude areas. Previous studies have shown that NOCs play a vital role in the nitrogen budget of PM2.5. However, our understanding of the composition and sources of NOCs in PM2.5, particularly in the TP, is limited. Here, we aim to enhance our understanding of NOCs in the TP region by examining their identification, concentration levels, sources, and origins. We conducted field sampling at a regional background sampling site in Gaomeigu, in the southeastern margin of the TP from 11 March to 13 May 2017, followed by laboratory analysis of the NOCs collected on the filters. The daily mass concentrations of NOCs ranged from 714.4 to 3887.1 ng m−3, with an average of 2119.4 ± 875.0 ng m−3 during the campaign. This average concentration was approximately 40 % higher than that reported at a typical regional site in the North China Plain (NCP), highlighting a more significant presence of NOCs in the Tibetan area. Biomass burning and secondary sources were identified as the major contributors to total NOCs. This was further substantiated by a regional air quality model, which indicated that over 80 % of the aerosol in the southeast of the TP originated from neighboring countries. This study improves our understanding of NOCs' contribution to PM2.5 in the TP and their potential impacts on climate stability in high-altitude areas."

Velazco;Wei Wang;Avelino F. Arellano Jr.,"Local and regional enhancements of CH4, CO, and CO2 inferred from TCCON column measurements","A combination of data analysis techniques is introduced to separate local and regional influences on observed levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane from an established ground-based remote sensing network. We take advantage of the covariations in these trace gases to identify the dominant type of sources driving these levels. Applying these methods in conjunction with existing approaches to other datasets can better address uncertainties in identifying sources and sinks. 
 In this study, we demonstrate the utility of available correlative measurements of carbon species to identify regional and local air mass characteristics as well as their associated source types. In particular, we combine different regression techniques and enhancement ratio algorithms with carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) total column abundance from 11 sites of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) to infer relative contributions of regional and local sources to each of these sites. The enhancement ratios provide a viable alternative to univariate measures of relationships between the trace gases that are insufficient in capturing source-type and transport signatures. Regional enhancements are estimated from the difference between bivariate regressions across a specific time window of observed total abundance of these species (BERr for bulk enhancement regression ratio) and inferred anomalies (AERr for anomaly enhancement regression ratio) associated with a site-specific background. Since BERr and AERr represent the bulk and local species enhancement ratio, respectively, its difference simply represents the site-specific regional component of these ratios. We can then compare these enhancements for CO2 and CH4 with CO to differentiate between combustion and non-combustion air masses. Our results show that while the regional and local influences in enhancements vary across sites, dominant characteristics are found to be consistent with previous studies over these sites and with bottom-up anthropogenic and fire emission inventories. The site in Pasadena shows a dominant local influence (> 60 %) across all species enhancement ratios, which appear to come from a mixture of biospheric and combustion activities. In contrast, Anmyeondo shows more regionally influenced (> 60 %) air masses associated with high-temperature and/or biofuel combustion activities. Ascension Island appears to only show a large regional influence (> 80 %) on CO / CO2 and CO / CH4, which is indicative of transported and combustion-related CO from the nearby African region, consistent with a sharp rise in column CO (3.51 ± 0.43 % ppb yr−1) at this site. These methods have important applications to source analysis using spaceborne column retrievals of these species."

Thornton;Urs Rohner;Felipe Lopez-Hilfiker,Evaluation of a reduced-pressure chemical ion reactor utilizing adduct ionization for the detection of gaseous organic and inorganic species,"We present a newly designed reduced-pressure chemical ionization reactor for detection of gas-phase organic and inorganic species. The system operates through the combined use of vacuum ultraviolet ionization and photosensitizers to generate numerous adduct ionization schemes. As a result, it offers the ability to simultaneously measure a wide variety of organic and inorganic species in terms of compound volatility and functionality, while being largely independent of changes in sample humidity. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and volatile inorganic compounds (VICs) provide critical information across many scientific fields including atmospheric chemistry and soil and biological processes. Chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for tracking these chemically complex and temporally variable compounds in a variety of laboratory and field environments. It is particularly powerful with time-of-flight mass spectrometers, which can measure hundreds of compounds in a fraction of a second and have enabled entirely new branches of VOC and/or VIC research in atmospheric and biological chemistry. To accurately describe each step of these chemical, physical, and biological processes, measurements across the entire range of gaseous products is crucial. Recently, chemically comprehensive gas-phase measurements have been performed using many CI mass spectrometers deployed in parallel, each utilizing a different ionization method to cover a broad range of compounds. Here we introduce the recently developed Vocus AIM (adduct ionization mechanism) ion–molecule reactor (IMR), which samples trace vapors in air and ionizes them via chemical ionization at medium pressures. The Vocus AIM supports the use of many different reagent ions of positive and negative polarity and is largely independent of changes in the sample humidity. Within the present study, we present the performance and explore the capabilities of the Vocus AIM using various chemical ionization schemes, including chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−), iodide (I−), nitrate (NO3-), benzene cations (C6H6+), acetone dimers ((C3H6O)2H+), and ammonium (NH4+) reagent ions, primarily in laboratory and flow tube experiments. We report the technical characteristics and operational principles, and compare its performance in terms of time response, humidity dependence, and sensitivity to that of previous chemical ionization approaches. This work demonstrates the benefits of the Vocus AIM reactor, which provides a versatile platform to characterize VOCs and VICs in real time at trace concentrations."

The paper deals with technical aspects of this process and shows how the reconstruction of the spectrum can be optimized. 
 Correct determination of the phase spectrum is a highly relevant task in Fourier Transform Spectrometry for concluding which spectral distribution connects with the measured interferogram. We present implementation of an improved scheme for phase determination in the operational Collaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) processor. We introduce a robust unwrapping scheme for retrieving a connected phase spectrum at intermediate spectral resolution, which uses all spectral positions carrying enough signal to allow a significant determination of the phase. In the second step, we perform a least squares fit of model parameters of a suited analytical phase spectrum model through all reliable phase values constructed in the first step. The model fit exploits the fact that we expect the phase to be spectrally smooth. Still, it can be refined to reflect specific characteristics inherent to the optical and electronic layout of the interferometer. The proposed approach avoids the problems of the classical phase reconstruction method, which enforce a spectrally smooth phase by directly limiting spectral resolution when calculating the complex phase. Thereby, the phase is created from a very low number of interferogram points around the centerburst of the interferogram, which results in a suboptimal noise propagation from the interferogram into the spectral domain. Moreover, the interpolation of the phase spectrum across spectral subsections with reduced spectral signal is not well behaved and results depend strongly on the numerical apodization function used for creating the low-resolution phase."

China's quest for reducing carbon emissions will promisingly benefit the air quality, yet its impact on carbon sinks remains unclear. Here, we assess the effect of China's clean air actions and carbon neutrality policy on air quality and its associated co‐benefits for terrestrial carbon sinks by integrating multiple observations and numerical modeling. We find a quadratic response of plant photosynthesis to aerosol loading due to trade‐offs between diffuse fertilization effect and light limitations. The estimations show that China's air pollution suppresses terrestrial carbon uptake through aerosol‐induced light limitations, leading to a 7.3% decrease in plant productivity in the 2010s. In the context of carbon neutrality pledge, the associated aerosol reductions tend to alleviate the suppression and produce an additional CO2 removal of 0.39 GtCO2 year−1.

 Climate change is shifting animal distributions. However, the extent to which future global habitats of threatened marine megafauna will overlap existing human threats remains unresolved. Here we use global climate models and habitat suitability estimated from long-term satellite-tracking data of the world’s largest fish, the whale shark, to show that redistributions of present-day habitats are projected to increase the species’ co-occurrence with global shipping. Our model projects core habitat area losses of >50% within some national waters by 2100, with geographic shifts of over 1,000 km (∼12 km yr−1). Greater habitat suitability is predicted in current range-edge areas, increasing the co-occurrence of sharks with large ships. This future increase was ∼15,000 times greater under high emissions compared with a sustainable development scenario. Results demonstrate that climate-induced global species redistributions that increase exposure to direct sources of mortality are possible, emphasizing the need for quantitative climate-threat predictions in conservation assessments of endangered marine megafauna.

 Compound events have become more frequent and diverse under global warming. This study specifically focuses on a type of compound events termed spatially compounding flood-nocturnal heat events over adjacent regions. Five flood hotspots are identified to compound with adjacent nocturnal heat. The flood and nocturnal heat are linked via a water vapor transport belt, with flood over the region of prominent water vapor convergence and ascending anomalies and nocturnal heat over the extension region with moderately increased humidity and weak vertical motion anomaly. The compound events for all the hotspots occur more frequently recently, with commonly positive contribution from the increasing trends of nocturnal temperature (TN) but various contribution from the trends of precipitation (Pr) and Pr-TN correlation. The positive contribution of enhanced Pr-TN correlation results from the enhanced variability of the circulation accompanied with water vapor transport.

 Ongoing warming intensifies snowpack extremes, posing significant hydroclimatic risks to socio-ecological systems. However, the relation between snowpack extremes and subsequent compound hydroclimatic extremes remains unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of snowpack extremes on warm-season compound hydroclimatic extremes in the Northern Hemisphere using multisource datasets from 1980 to 2022. We found widespread increases in deficient, short, and deficient-short snowpack extremes, triggering more compound hot-dry extremes within a month after snowpack disappearance (mean coincidence rate over 0.6, p < 0.05). The impact of compound snowpack extremes exceeded that of individual snowpack extremes in both areas (over 10%) and coincidence rates (over 0.2). Meanwhile, increased intensity, rather than frequency, of snowpack extremes drove mainly the occurrence of compound hydroclimatic extremes. Furthermore, background climate factors, followed by vegetation, topography, and soil, affected relations between snowpack and compound hydroclimatic extremes. These findings will deepen our understanding of the emerging consecutive extremes and improve their predictability.

Both estimates show consistent, statistically significant trends. 
 Estimating accurate oil and gas methane emissions has been a global challenge, highlighted by a twofold discrepancy between atmospheric measurement-based estimates and emission inventories. The principle of continuous improvement in Canada’s National Inventory Report has led to an unstable baseline in recent years for tracking emission reduction progress. The gaps between previous inventory estimates and inversions exceeded 60%. Here we show that incorporating new source-resolved information derived from low-altitude aerial survey data has narrowed this gap by 80%, reducing the discrepancy to 10% for the 2010–2014 baseline. This study proposes a hybrid emission reporting framework, complemented by an ensemble inversion top-down method using continuous tower-based atmospheric measurements, to establish a stable baseline and provide independent verification. As the 2030 target year for emission reduction approaches, we report a significant 27% decline (19%–34%) in inverse oil and gas methane emissions from 2010 to 2022 in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and a 41% decline (26%–56%) as calculated using the 2024 official inventory.

 The Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) is an imaging spectrometer launched to the International Space Station in July 2022 to measure the mineral composition of Earth’s dust-producing regions. We present a systematic accuracy assessment of the EMIT surface reflectance product in two parts. First, we characterize the surface reflectance product’s overall performance using multiple independent vicarious calibration field experiments with hand-held and automated field spectrometers. We find that the EMIT surface reflectance product has a standard error of ±1.0% in absolute reflectance units for temporally coincident observations. Discrepancies rise to ±2.7 % for spectra acquired at different dates and times of day, which we attribute mainly to changes in solar geometry. Second, we develop an error budget that explains the differences between EMIT and in-situ field spectrometer data. We find that uncertainties in spatial footprints, field spectroscopy, and the EMIT-reported measurement were sufficient to explain discrepancies in most cases. Our approach did not detect any systematic calibration or reflectance errors in the timespan considered. Together, these findings demonstrate that a space-based imaging spectrometer can acquire high-quality spectra across a wide range of observational and atmospheric conditions."

McMurdie;Angela K. Rowe;Andrew J. Heymsfield,Simulated particle evolution within a winter storm: contributions of riming to radar moments and precipitation fallout,"Using a numerical model, the process whereby falling ice crystals accumulate supercooled liquid water droplets is investigated to elucidate its effects on radar-based measurements and surface precipitation. We demonstrate that this process accounted for 55% of the precipitation during a wintertime storm and is uniquely discernable from other ice crystal growth processes in Doppler velocity measurements. These results have implications for measurements from airborne and spaceborne platforms. 
 Remote sensing radars from airborne and spaceborne platforms provide critical observations of clouds to estimate precipitation rates across the globe. The ability of these radars to detect changes in precipitation properties is advanced by Doppler measurements of particle fall speed. Within mixed-phase clouds, precipitation mass and its fall characteristics are especially sensitive to the effects of riming. In this study, we quantified these effects and investigated the distinction of riming from aggregation in Doppler radar vertical profiles using quasi-idealized particle-based model simulations. Observational constraints of a control simulation were determined from airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements collected during the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) for a wintry–mixed precipitation event over the northeastern United States on 4 February 2022. From the upper boundary of a one-dimensional column, particle evolution was simulated through vapor deposition, aggregation, and riming processes, producing realistic Doppler radar profiles. Despite a modest observed amount of supercooled liquid water (0.05 g m−3), riming accounted for 55 % of the ice-phase precipitation mass, cumulatively increasing reflectivity by 44 % and Doppler velocity by 68 %. Independent evaluation of process-based sensitivities showed that, while radar reflectivity is comparably sensitive to either riming- or aggregation-based particle morphology, the Doppler velocity profile is uniquely sensitive to particle density changes during riming. Thus, Doppler velocity profiles advance the diagnosis of riming as a dominant microphysical process in stratiform clouds from single-wavelength radars, which has implications for quantitative constraints of particle properties in remote sensing applications."

It allows automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It has been conceived for subsequent elemental composition analysis (from Na to Pb) by PIXE, but optical techniques may also be applied to measure the Black and Brown Carbon. The combined use with other high temporal resolution instrumentation can provide complete chemical speciation of the aerosol on an hourly basis. 
 The joint use of hourly resolution sampling and analyses with accelerated ion beams such as Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) technique has allowed the measurement of hourly temporal patterns of particulate matter (PM) composition at many sites in different parts of the world. The demand within the scientific community for this type of analysis has been continuously increasing in recent years, but hourly resolution samplers suitable for PIXE analysis are now discontinued and/or suffer from some technical limitations. In this framework, a new hourly sampler, STRAS (Size and Time Resolved Aerosol Sampler), was developed for the collection of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It allows automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples (1 week), it is mechanically robust, compact, and easily transportable. To increase PIXE sensitivity, each sample is concentrated on a small surface area on a polycarbonate membrane. The comparison between the elemental concentrations retrieved by STRAS samples and samples collected using a standard sequential sampler operated in parallel shows a very good agreement; indeed, if both the samplers use the same kind of membrane, the concentrations of all detected elements are in agreement within 10 %."

We also show examples that illustrate the performance of the lidar during measurements at different altitude ranges and timescales. 
 The ALOMAR (Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research)  Rayleigh/Mie/Raman (RMR) lidar is an active remote sensing instrument for investigation of the Arctic middle atmosphere on a routine basis during day and night. It was installed on the island of Andøya in northern Norway (69° N, 16° E) in summer 1994. During the past 30 years of operation, more than 20 200 h of atmospheric data have been measured, approximately 60 % thereof during sunlit conditions. At present, the RMR lidar is the only system measuring aerosols, temperature, and horizontal winds simultaneously and during daytime in the middle atmosphere. We report on the current status of the lidar, including major upgrades made during recent years. This involves a new generation of power lasers and new systems for synchronization, data acquisition, and spectral monitoring of each single laser pulse. Lidar measurements benefit significantly from a control system for augmented operation with automated rule-based decisions, which allows complete remote operation of the lidar. This was necessary in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it was impossible to access the lidar from outside Norway for almost 1.5 years. We show examples that illustrate the performance of the RMR lidar in investigating aerosol layers, temperature, and horizontal winds, partly with a time resolution below 1 s."

Pinto;Gabriele Messori,A New Database of Extreme European Winter Windstorms,"We created a new, publicly available database of the Top 50 most extreme European winter windstorms from each of four different meteorological input data sets covering the years 1995–2015. We found variability in all aspects of our database, from which storms were included in the Top 50 storms for each input to their spatial variability. We urge users of our database to consider the storms as identified from two or more input sources within our database, where possible. 
 European windstorms pose a significant threat to people, infrastructure and the natural environment. Several windstorms in the recent past have caused substantial damages, and losses associated with extreme windstorms may increase with climate change. Characterizing the footprints of destructive windstorms is thus key to providing quantitative estimates of storm-related economic losses. To that end, we have developed a new, publicly available database of extreme European windstorm footprints for the extended winter season during 1995–2015. In contrast to previously compiled European windstorm databases, we include storm footprints derived from four different data sets, rather than a single source: the ERA5 reanalysis, the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis for Europe, the COSMO-Climate Limited-area Mode regional climate model driven by ERA5 on the EURO-CORDEX domain, and simulation output from the same model but on an enlarged Germany domain with higher horizontal resolution. The database includes both the footprints themselves, expressed as the relative daily maximum wind gusts associated with a storm event, and the daily maximum wind gusts in absolute magnitude associated with the footprints. We derived and included the storm footprints associated with the 50 most extreme storms, or Top50 storms, identified within each of the four input data sets. We applied a consistent methodology, the storm loss index, across input data sets for identifying storm footprints and assessing their severity. This enables a direct comparison between the footprints derived from the different input sources, eases future efforts to extend the time record of the database or to include additional input data sets, and enables assessment of uncertainty in the footprints. Moreover, since we derived the Top50 storms from each input on its native horizontal resolution, the database also allows to characterize the impact that horizontal resolution can have on footprint identification and severity assessment. Our database thus supports both the research community and the insurance industry in exploring the data set and resolution dependence of assessments of extreme storm hazards."

This dataset overcomes the limitations of infrared observations and provides accurate, all-weather PWV data ,spanning all types of land surface. Researchers are expected to leverage it to explore the role of water vapor in weather patterns, refine precipitation forecasting, and validate climate simulations. 
 A global terrestrial precipitable water vapor (PWV) dataset has been developed using observations from the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI) aboard the FY-3 satellite series (FY-3B, FY-3C and FY-3D) spanning 2012 to 2020. The dataset offers twice-daily PWV records at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°, aligned with the ascending and descending orbits of the FY-3 satellites. The dataset was generated using an automated machine learning (ML) model that leverages MWRI-based features characterizing surface conditions and an enhanced Global Position System (GPS) PWV dataset as a reference. Trained on over one million sampling points from more than ten thousand stations worldwide, the model ensures a robust representation of global PWV variations. Independent evaluations against SuomiNet GPS and Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive Version 2 (IGRA2) PWV products yielded root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.47 mm and 3.89 mm, respectively, with RMSE values ranging from 2.90 to 5.49 mm across various surface conditions. The dataset effectively captures both spatial and temporal PWV variations, allowing for precise examination of localized and abrupt changes in water vapor induced by extreme weather events. Representing a significant advancement in global terrestrial PWV monitoring, the MWRI PWV dataset provides an all-weather, high-precision data record that bridges gaps in global coverage of passive microwave-based terrestrial PWV observations. It is a valuable resource for atmospheric research, climate modeling, water cycle studies, and beyond. The dataset is available at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26712709 (Xia et al., 2024). "

However, interactions of microphysical processes, such as settling and coagulation of solid particles, with stratospheric dynamics have not been considered. Using a global chemistry‐climate model with interactive solid particle microphysics, we show that agglomeration significantly reduces the backscatter efficiency per unit of injected material compared to mono‐disperse particles, partly due to faster settling of the agglomerates, but mainly due to increased forward‐ over backscattering with increasing agglomerate size. Despite these effects, some materials substantially reduce required injection rates as well as perturbation of stratospheric winds, age of air and stratospheric warming compared to injection of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$, with the most promising results being shown by 150 nm diamond particles. Uncertainties remain as to whether stratospheric dispersion of solid particles is feasible without formation of agglomerates."

This study investigates the characteristics and mechanisms of extreme precipitation over SSTP from June to September during 2001–2020 using Global Precipitation Measurement satellite observation. The extreme precipitation days are defined as the days with top 5% of regional‐mean daily precipitation over SSTP in this period, which has an average precipitation of 27.2 mm/d. Averaging over the extreme precipitation days, precipitation peaks at an altitude of about 300 m, coinciding with the climatological maximum precipitation, but with a much larger value of 37.2 mm/d than the climatology of 11.9 mm/d. Composite analysis of circulations on extreme days reveals significant circulation anomalies in both the lower and upper troposphere. Specifically, the lower‐tropospheric circulations are characterized by significant westerly anomalies over northern India, and the upper‐tropospheric circulations are characterized by northerly anomalies over the central Tibetan Plateau, which are statistically independent. The lower‐tropospheric westerly anomalies blowing toward SSTP are blocked by the topography, favoring extreme precipitation over SSTP. The upper‐tropospheric northerly anomalies, on the other hand, correspond to anomalous northeasterlies north of SSTP in the middle troposphere and southeasterlies to the south in the lower troposphere, and the convergence of these circulation anomalies favors extreme precipitation over SSTP. Lastly, the lower‐tropospheric westerly and upper‐tropospheric northerly anomalies, respectively, correspond to less precipitation over the South Asian monsoon region and the Tibetan Plateau."

 Reanalysis and satellite data indicate a decreasing precipitation area in recent decades, affecting local water resources and precipitation intensities. We have used CMIP6 simulations to test the hypothesis of a shrinking precipitation area in a warming climate. Our analyses reveal that SSP5-8.5 projections show a robust decrease in the precipitation area between 50 °S and 50 °N, and globally in 75% of the simulations. The new findings support the observed relationship, although to a lesser extent than earlier found in reanalysis and satellite data. We find a poleward shift of precipitation, increasing the daily precipitation area in the Arctic from 18% to 28%. At lower latitudes the precipitation area is reduced due to a decreasing occurrence of precipitation. These changes are related to the expansion of low relative humidity zones in the lower-to-mid troposphere, specifically at the poleward edges of the subtropics."

 It is widely acknowledged that the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves are increasing worldwide, including the Arctic. However, less attention has been paid to the land area affected by heatwaves. Here, using atmospheric reanalysis and global climate models, we show that the area covered by heatwaves is substantially expanding in the terrestrial Arctic. Compared to the mid-20th century, the total land area affected by severe heatwaves in the Arctic has doubled, the area of extreme heatwaves has tripled, and the area of very extreme heatwaves has quadrupled. Furthermore, climate model projections suggest that the extent of heatwaves will continue to increase in the 21st century, but with large regional differences in heatwave magnitudes due to summer intraseasonal temperature variability. Our findings underscore the growing vulnerability of the Arctic region to extreme heat, potentially leading to severe impacts on both ecosystems and societies.

 The geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine has escalated into international trade sanctions targeting Russia’s energy-related products. Here we combine a global general equilibrium model and an atmospheric source-receptor model to explore the environmental, economic, and public-health effects of varying intensities of trade sanction measures. Our results indicate that the trade-offs between economic development and environmental pressure might not be directly proportional, where one-fifth of global regions (e.g., Russia, China, and Central America) would experience a co-harm situation (e.g., decreased GDP and increased emissions and health risks). Intensifying trade sanction measures would reallocate the burdens of energy production and export to less-developed regions (e.g., Europe and Central Asia), thereby exacerbating the uneven distribution of environmental and health outcomes among regions. The global repercussions of the trade sanctions highlight the necessity of considering the consequences on regions beyond the conflict to formulate desired global initiatives for impact mitigation/adaptation and post-conflict restoration.

The average HONO flux was 0.77 ± 0.72 ng N m−2 s−1, displaying a diurnal pattern of higher fluxes during the day and lower fluxes at night, similar to previous flux observations. A strong linear correlation between the HONO flux with the product of NO2 and solar radiation (R2 = 0.90) suggests that surface reactions involving NO2 and sunlight may dominate HONO production from the paddy fields, surpassing microbial activity within the soil. Given the diversity of field environments, more field observations are needed for assessing emission rates of HONO and understanding underlying mechanisms."

 Heatwaves pose significant threats to urban environments, affecting both ecological systems and public health, primarily through the exacerbation of air pollution. Accurate prediction of air pollutant concentrations during heatwave periods is crucial for authorities to develop timely prevention and control strategies. Thus, we developed the 1D-CNN-BiLSTM-attention model, specifically designed to account for the unique data characteristics associated with heatwave conditions. Our model leverages an attention mechanism to enhance its ability to learn and predict air pollutant behavior during heatwaves. Across six scenario-based experiments, the model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, achieving a MAPE of 2.93 %. The model integrates meteorological indicators such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and precipitation, extending its predictive capability across a spatial range of 150 km. In experiments testing the model's applicability to three typical city types in the Yangtze River Delta region, the results confirmed its effectiveness in predicting air pollutants. These findings highlight the model's usefulness for studying air pollution during urban heatwave periods on a regional scale, demonstrating its robustness and reliability under varying weather conditions."

 Sandstorm is a disastrous weather phenomenon that often occurs in arid and semi-arid areas, endangering the ecological environment and affecting people's lives and property safety seriously. Since the 21st century, the sandstorm weather in the Yellow River Basin has ameliorated obviously. However, the causes of the long-term trends in sandstorms during 21st century were still unknown. In this study, fifteen influencing factors from five aspects: ecology, meteorology, hydrology, geography and man-made were selected to comprehensively analyze the driving mechanism of sandstorm activities in the Yellow River Basin since the 21st century, and the effect of each influencing factor on sandstorm weather was quantified. The results indicated that ecological, meteorological and geographical factors had dominant impacts on the spatio-temporal variation of sandstorms during 2000–2021, while hydrological and human factors played little role in the long-term variation of sandstorms. Sandstorms frequently occurred in semi-desert or grassland or non-high vegetation covered areas in spring. Vegetation coverage, precipitation, surface pressure, surface roughness, and soil moisture content were negatively correlated with sandstorms, while wind speed, friction velocity, evaporation, and soil temperature were positively correlated with sandstorms. Precipitation, runoff, evaporation, soil moisture content, soil temperature, and surface temperature indirectly acted on normalized brightness temperature dust index (NBTDI) and sandstorms by changing soil texture. Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) had direct negative effects on NBTDI, while wind speed 10 m (WS10m), slope of sub-gridscale orography (SOSGO), and forecast surface roughness (FSR) had direct positive effects on NBTDI. This study comprehensively revealed the dominant factors and their driving mechanism of sandstorm weather in the Yellow River Basin since the 21st century, which had practical application value for the prevention of sandstorms."

McCorquodale,Stable and unstable fall motions of plate-like ice crystal analogues,"This study uses 3D-printed ice crystal analogues falling in a water–glycerine mix and observed with multi-view cameras, simulating atmospheric conditions. Four types of motion are observed: stable, zigzag, transitional, and spiralling. Particle shape strongly influences motion; complex shapes have a wider range of conditions where they fall steadily compared to simple plates. The most common orientation of unstable particles is non-horizontal, contrary to prior assumptions of always horizontal. 
 The orientation of ice crystals affects their microphysical behaviour, growth, and precipitation. Orientation also affects interaction with electromagnetic radiation, and through this it influences remote sensing signals, in situ observations, and optical effects. Fall behaviours of a variety of 3D-printed plate-like ice crystal analogues in a tank of water–glycerine mixture are observed with multi-view cameras and digitally reconstructed to simulate the falling of ice crystals in the atmosphere.Four main falling regimes were observed: stable, zigzag, transitional, and spiralling. Stable motion is characterised by no resolvable fluctuations in velocity or orientation, with the maximum dimension oriented horizontally. The zigzagging regime is characterised by a back-and-forth swing in a constant vertical plane, corresponding to a time series of inclination angle approximated by a rectified sine wave. In the spiralling regime, analogues consistently incline at an angle between 7 and 28°, depending on particle shape. Transitional behaviour exhibits motion in between spiral and zigzag, similar to that of a falling spherical pendulum.The inclination angles that unstable planar ice crystals make with the horizontal plane are found to have a non-zero mode. This observed behaviour does not fit the commonly used Gaussian model of inclination angle. The typical Reynolds number when oscillations start is strongly dependent on shape: solid hexagonal plates begin to oscillate at Re =237, whereas several dendritic shapes remain stable throughout all experiments, even at Re > 1000. These results should be considered within remote sensing applications wherein the orientation characteristics of ice crystals are used to retrieve their properties."

Allen;Xueying Zhao;Cynthia A. Randles;Ryan J. Kramer;Bjørn H. Samset;Christopher J. Smith,Present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes surface warming relative to preindustrial conditions,"Present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes 28% (7–55%) of the surface warming associated with its longwave absorption. The precipitation increase associated with the longwave radiative effects of the present-day methane perturbation is also muted by shortwave absorption but not significantly so.  Methane shortwave absorption also impacts the magnitude of its climate feedback parameter, largely through the cloud feedback. 
 Recent analyses show the importance of methane shortwave absorption, which many climate models lack. In particular, Allen et al. (2023) used idealized climate model simulations to show that methane shortwave absorption mutes up to 30 % of the surface warming and 60 % of the precipitation increase associated with its longwave radiative effects. Here, we explicitly quantify the radiative and climate impacts due to shortwave absorption of the present-day methane perturbation. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes the warming effects of longwave absorption. For example, the global mean cooling in response to the present-day methane shortwave absorption is -0.10±0.07 K, which offsets 28 % (7 %–55 %) of the surface warming associated with present-day methane longwave radiative effects. The precipitation increase associated with the longwave radiative effects of the present-day methane perturbation (0.012±0.006 mm d−1) is also muted by shortwave absorption but not significantly so (-0.008±0.009 mm d−1). The unique responses to methane shortwave absorption are related to its negative top-of-the-atmosphere effective radiative forcing but positive atmospheric heating and in part to methane's distinctive vertical atmospheric solar heating profile. We also find that the present-day methane shortwave radiative effects, relative to its longwave radiative effects, are about 5 times larger than those under idealized carbon dioxide perturbations. Additional analyses show consistent but non-significant differences between the longwave versus shortwave radiative effects for both methane and carbon dioxide, including a stronger (negative) climate feedback when shortwave radiative effects are included (particularly for methane). We conclude by reiterating that methane remains a potent greenhouse gas."

We observed that SSA flux is suppressed during increased marine biological activity in the Baltic Sea. At the same time, the influence of wave age showed higher SSA emissions in the Baltic Sea for younger waves compared to the Atlantic Ocean. These insights underscore the complex interplay between biological activity and physical dynamics in regulating SSA emissions. 
 Ship-based measurements of sea spray aerosol (SSA) gradient fluxes in the size range of 0.5–47 µm in diameter were conducted between 2009–2017 in both the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. Measured total SSA fluxes varied between 8.9 × 103 ± 6.8 × 105 m−2 s−1 for the Baltic Sea and 1.0 × 104 ± 105 m−2 s−1 for the Atlantic Ocean. The analysis uncovered a significant decrease (by a factor of 2.2 in the wind speed range of 10.5–14.5 m s−1) in SSA fluxes, with chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration higher than 3.5 mg m−3 in the Baltic Sea area. We found statistically significant correlations for both regions of interest between SSA fluxes and various environmental factors, including wind speed, wind acceleration, wave age, significant wave height, and wave Reynolds number. Our findings indicate that higher chl a concentrations are associated with reduced SSA fluxes at higher wind speeds in the Baltic Sea, while the influence of wave age showed higher aerosol emissions in the Baltic Sea for younger waves compared to the Atlantic Ocean. These insights underscore the complex interplay between biological activity and physical dynamics in regulating SSA emissions. Additionally, in both measurement regions, we observed weak correlations between SSA fluxes and air and water temperature and between SSA fluxes and atmospheric stability. Comparing the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, we noted distinct emission behaviors, with higher emissions in the Baltic Sea at low wave age values compared to the Atlantic Ocean. This study represents the first comparative analysis of SSA flux measurements using the same methodology in these contrasting marine environments."

Lee;Michel Van Roozendael;Rainer Volkamer,Troposphere–stratosphere-integrated bromine monoxide (BrO) profile retrieval over the central Pacific Ocean,"Atmospheric bromine destroys ozone, impacts oxidation capacity, and oxidizes mercury into its toxic form. We constrain bromine by remote sensing of BrO from a mountaintop. Previous measurements retrieved two to three pieces of information vertically; we apply new methods to get five and a half vertically and two more in time. We compare with aircraft measurements to validate the methods and look at variations in BrO over the Pacific. 
 Bromine monoxide (BrO) is relevant to atmospheric oxidative capacity, affecting the lifetime of greenhouse gases (i.e., methane, dimethylsulfide) and mercury oxidation. However, measurements of BrO radical vertical profiles are rare, and BrO is highly variable. As a result, the few available aircraft observations in different regions of the atmosphere are not easily reconciled. Autonomous multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments placed at remote mountaintop observatories (MT-DOAS) present a cost-effective alternative to aircraft, with the potential to probe the climate-relevant yet understudied free troposphere more routinely.Here, we describe an innovative full-atmosphere BrO and formaldehyde (HCHO) profile retrieval algorithm using MT-DOAS measurements at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO – 19.536° N, 155.577° W; 3401 m a.s.l.). The retrieval is based on time-dependent optimal estimation and simultaneously inverts 190+ individual BrO (and formaldehyde, HCHO) SCDs (slant column densities; SCD = dSCD + SCDRef) from solar stray light spectra measured in the zenith and off-axis geometries at high and low solar zenith angles (92° > SZA > 30°) to derive BrO concentration profiles from 1.9 to 35 km with 7.5 degrees of freedom (DoFs). Two case study days are characterized by the absence (26 April 2017, base case) and presence of a Rossby-wave-breaking double tropopause (29 April 2017, RW-DT case). Stratospheric-BrO vertical columns are nearly identical on both days (VCD = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 1013 molec. cm−2), and the stratospheric-BrO profile peaks at a lower altitude during the RW-DT (1.6–2.0 DoFs). Tropospheric-BrO VCDs increase from (0.70 ± 0.14) × 1013 molec. cm−2 (base case) to (1.00 ± 0.14) × 1013 molec. cm−2 (RW-DT) owing to a 3-fold increase in BrO in the upper troposphere (1.7–1.9 DoFs). BrO at MLO increases from (0.23 ± 0.03) pptv (base case) to (0.46 ± 0.03) pptv (RW-DT) and is characterized by an added time resolution (∼ 3.8 DoFs). Up to (0.9 ± 0.1) pptv BrO is observed above MLO in the lower free troposphere in the absence of the double tropopause.We validate the retrieval using aircraft BrO profiles and in situ HCHO measurements aboard the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft above MLO (11 January 2014) that establish BrO peaks around 2.4 pptv above 13 km in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) during a similar RW-DT event (0.83 × 1013 molec. cm2 tropospheric-BrO VCD above 2 km). The tropospheric-BrO profile measured using MT-DOAS (RW-DT case) and using the aircraft agree well (after averaging-kernel smoothing). Furthermore, these tropospheric-BrO profiles over the central Pacific Ocean are found to closely resemble those over the eastern Pacific Ocean (2–14 km) and are in contrast to those over the western Pacific Ocean, where a C-shaped tropospheric-BrO profile shape has been observed."

After reclassifying fluxes to countries’ reporting categories for national greenhouse gas inventories, we found that roughly two-thirds of the total net flux from forests is anthropogenic and one-third is non-anthropogenic. 
 Forests are a key component of climate change mitigation strategies because they both emit and remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. Earth observation data are increasingly used to estimate the magnitude and geographic distribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and reduce overall uncertainty in the global carbon budget, including for forests. Here we report on a revised and updated geospatial, Earth observation-based forest carbon flux modelling framework that maps GHG emissions (Gibbs et al. 2024a), carbon removals (Gibbs et al. 2024b), and the net balance between them (Gibbs et al. 2024c) globally from 2001 onwards at roughly 30-meter resolution (Harris et al. 2021, hereafter referred to as the Global Forest Watch (GFW) model). Beyond updating the model to include the most recent years, revisions address some of the original model’s limitations, improve model inputs, and refine the uncertainty analysis. We found that between 2001 and 2023, global forest ecosystems were, on average, a net carbon sink of -5.5 ± 8.1 (one standard deviation) gigatonnes CO2 equivalent yr-1 (Gt CO2e yr-1), which reflects the balance of 9.0 ± 2.7 Gt CO2e yr-1 of GHG emissions and -14.5 ± 7.7 of carbon removals, with an additional -0.20 Gt CO2e yr-1 transferred into harvested wood products. Uncertainty in gross removals was greatly reduced compared to the original model due to refinement of temperate secondary forest carbon removal factor uncertainties."

Irradiated atmospheres from precursors with a single C═C bond (3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, cis/trans-2-pentene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 1-butene, and 1-pentene) had low potencies (<5), whereas linear dienes with terminal C═C bonds had high potencies (50–65). Dienes with a branched structure (isoprene) or internal C═C bonds (1,3-pentadiene) had intermediate potencies (15–20). No VOCs were mutagenic without photochemical oxidation. VOCs+O3 in the dark produced less mutagenic atmospheres than photochemistry in the presence of NO. Atmospheres induced primarily C to T and C to A mutations, the main base substitutions in nonsmoker lung cancer. Atmospheres from the photooxidation of isoprene and 1,3-pentadiene also induced GG to TT, the signature mutation of peroxyacetyl nitrate. Five molecular compositions identified by Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS), most containing nitrogen, correlated (r = 0.76–0.85) with the mutagenic potencies of irradiated atmospheres; most had a likely nitrate functional group.

This event was recorded in Yellowknife, Canada, by a TREx RGB imager and a citizen scientist. Swarm satellites traversed the latitude of the observation, measuring extreme westwards ion drift velocities exceeding 4 km/s. Such velocities are more typically associated with the subauroral region located at mid‐latitudes, rather than at the high‐latitudes reported here. Significantly, this event occurred without a substorm, which differs from previous STEVE observations. While high‐latitude radars detected fast ionospheric equatorward flows, GOES satellite did not record any injections. These observations suggest that the inner magnetosphere is highly inflated.

Kurth,Magnetospheric Line Radiation: Temporal Modulation Corresponding to a Bouncing Wave,"Magnetospheric line radiation (MLR) is a peculiar type of whistler‐mode emissions formed by several similarly spaced spectral lines, whose frequencies may vary with time. These emissions typically occur at frequencies between about 1 and 8 kHz and are observed in both ground‐based and satellite measurements. However, their origin and source locations are not yet understood, as their detection by spacecraft instruments is challenging due to the limited frequency resolution of onboard wave measurements. We use high‐resolution multicomponent wave data obtained by the Van Allen Probes to demonstrate that, in addition to the frequency modulation, MLR events possess a temporal modulation with periods on the order of seconds, which may be related to the wave bouncing between hemispheres. Observed modulation periods are used to estimate a tentative source L‐shell. The modulation periods are shorter for events with larger frequency spacing, and the estimated source L‐shells correlate with model plasmapause locations."
10.1029/2024GL109295,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了全球降雨截留损失（Ei）的多年代际动态及其驱动因素。研究人员使用多产品方法分析了 Ei 的全球趋势，并利用最近开发的验证数据集，分离了降水、植被和蒸发需求的相对贡献。研究发现，在年代际尺度上，Ei 的增加主要受全球植被绿化驱动，而其年际变化主要受降水变化控制，与厄尔尼诺/南方涛动密切相关。大气变暖驱动的蒸发需求增加也对全球 Ei 的上升做出了积极贡献。这项研究为进一步理解气候变化对陆地水文循环的影响提供了新的视角。,"['precipitation', 'vegetation', 'evaporative demand', 'satellite observations', 'remote sensing', 'hydrological cycle']",Feng Zhong;Shanhu Jiang;Akash Koppa;Liliang Ren;Yi Liu;Menghao Wang;Diego G.

The influence of climate and vegetation on Ei is not well known at continental‐to‐global and annual‐to‐decadal scales. Here, we use a long‐term multi‐product approach to examine the global trends in Ei, and further utilize a recently developed and validated dataset to isolate the relative contributions of precipitation, vegetation and evaporative demand. At decadal timescales, increasing Ei is largely driven by global vegetation greening through an increase in the intercepting surface and storage capacity, while its inter‐annual variations are mainly controlled by changes in precipitation, largely related to El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Increasing evaporative demand, driven by atmospheric warming, also positively contributes to the global rise in Ei. This study provides new perspectives for further understanding the impacts of climate change on the terrestrial hydrological cycle."

The REA technique has been used to measure turbulent fluxes of various compounds, such as methane, ethene, propene, butene, isoprene, nitrous oxides, ozone, and others. The REA method requires the accumulation of scalar concentrations in two separate compartments that conditionally sample updrafts and downdraft events. It is demonstrated here that the assumptions behind the conventional or two‐compartment REA approach allow for one‐compartment sampling, therefore called a one compartment or 1‐C‐REA approach, thereby expanding its operational utility. The one‐compartment sampling method is tested across various land cover types and atmospheric stability conditions, and it is found that the one‐compartment REA can provide results comparable to those determined from conventional two‐compartment REA. This finding enables rapid expansion and practical utility of REA in studies of surface‐atmosphere exchanges, interactions, and feedbacks."

Paris,Attribution of Excess Methane Emissions Over Marine Environments of the Mediterranean and Arabian Peninsula,"To accurately assess the current atmospheric methane budget and its future trends, it is essential to apportion and quantify the anthropogenic methane emissions to specific sources. This poses a significant challenge in the under‐sampled Middle East, where estimates predominantly depend on remote sensing observations and bottom‐up reporting of national emissions. Here, we present in situ shipborne observations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and non‐methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) collected along a >10,000‐km route from Vigo, Spain, to Abu Dhabi, UAE. By comparing our observations with Lagrangian dispersion model simulations, coupled with two methane emission inventories, we identify periods of considerable mismatch and apportion the responsible sources. Employing interspecies relationships with NMHCs has enabled the characterization of methane emissions from oil and gas (O&G) operations, urban centers, Red Sea deep water, enteric fermentation, and agriculture across diverse atmospheric environments. Our analysis reveals that the Suez area is a regional emission hotspot, where simulations consistently underestimate the methane emission sources. Importantly, the Middle Eastern O&G sector has been identified as an additional source of considerable uncertainty. Here, methane emissions were alternately underestimated and overestimated by the two inventories, exposing significant gaps in our understanding of fuel exploitation‐related emissions in the Middle East. This underscores the need for further targeted field campaigns and long‐term observations to improve the accuracy of emission data in the inventories."

Shepherd,A Forensic Investigation of Climate Model Biases in Teleconnections: The Case of the Relationship Between ENSO and the Northern Stratospheric Polar Vortex,"Teleconnections are crucial in shaping climate variability and regional climate change. The fidelity of teleconnections in climate models is important for reliable climate projections. As the observed sample size is limited, scientific judgment is required when models disagree with observed teleconnections. We illustrate this using the example of the relationship between El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the northern stratospheric polar vortex (SPV), where the MIROC6 large ensemble exhibits an ENSO‐SPV correlation opposite in sign to observations. Yet the model well captures the upward planetary‐wave propagation pathway through which ENSO is known to affect the SPV. We show that the discrepancy arises from the model showing an additional linkage related to horizontal stratospheric wave propagation. Observations do not provide strong statistical evidence for or against the existence of this linkage. Thus, depending on the research purpose, a choice has to be made in how to use the model simulations. Under the assumption that the additional linkage is spurious, a physically‐based bias adjustment is applied to the SPV, which effectively aligns the modeled ENSO‐SPV relationship with the observations, and thereby removes the model‐observations discrepancy in the surface air temperature response. However, if one believed that the additional linkage was genuine and was undersampled in the observations, a different approach could be taken. Our study emphasizes that caution is needed when concluding that a model is not suitable for studying teleconnections. We propose a forensic approach and argue that it helps to better understand model performance and utilize climate model data more effectively."

However, the 2016 extreme El Niño unexpectedly coincided with the longest and most extensive marine heatwave ever recorded in the region. This heatwave, spanning over 1.7 million square kilometers, persisting for 24 days with a peak intensity of 1.5°C, resulted in massive coral bleaching and fish mortality. This exceptional warming resulted from anomalously strong shortwave radiation and reduced heat loss via latent heat fluxes, owing to low wind speed and increased air humidity. These anomalies are attributed to a rare combined event “Madden-Julian Oscillation and extreme El Niño.” Following 10 February, the rapid dissipation of this marine heatwave results from the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific. The hazardous ecological impacts of this extreme event highlight the needs for improving our understanding of marine heatwave–driving mechanisms that may result in better seasonal predictions."

Particle emissions are dependent on engine power setting, flight altitude, and fuel composition. Engine models show a good correlation with measurement results. Future increased prevalence of SAF can positively influence the climate impact of aviation. 
 In order to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions and comply with current climate targets, the European Union plans a mandatory quota of 2 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, rising up to ≥70 % SAF by 2050. In addition to a reduction of life cycle CO2 emissions, the use of SAF can also have a positive impact on particle emissions and contrail properties. In this study we present observations from the  ECLIF3 (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) aircraft campaign, which investigated exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A350-941 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines. For the first time, non-volatile and total particle emissions of 100 %  HEFA-SPK (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids–synthetic paraffinic kerosene) SAF, a blended fuel and a reference Jet A-1 fuel were measured in flight. A maximum reduction in non-volatile particle number emissions of ∼41 % compared to the reference Jet A-1 fuel was measured at low cruise engine power settings when using 100 % HEFA-SPK. The reduction decreases to ∼29 % for typical cruise engine settings and to ∼22 % at high cruise engine power settings. The size of non-volatile particles was slightly smaller for HEFA-SPK compared to Jet A-1. We show a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogen content of globally available fuels. Our results demonstrate the impact of the fuel composition in terms of its aromatic, hydrogen, and sulfur content as well as of the effect of engine power settings on particle emissions. We demonstrate that the use of HEFA-SPK can significantly reduce particle emissions and thus contrail ice particles and therefore can provide an aviation climate benefit."

 Ice nucleating particles (INPs) play a crucial role in initiating ice crystal formation in clouds, influencing the dynamics and optical properties of clouds and their impacts on precipitation and the climate system. Despite their importance, there is limited knowledge about the vertical distribution of INPs. This study focuses on aircraft measurements conducted during spring 2018 above the boreal forest of Hyytiälä, Finland. Similarities between INP concentrations, activated fractions, particle concentrations, and size distributions observed at ground level and in the boundary layer aloft indicate that surface particles and INPs are efficiently transported and mixed within the boundary layer. INP concentrations observed in the boundary layer are best predicted by a parameterization describing near-surface INP concentrations driven by the abundance of biogenic aerosol in the Finnish boreal forest, suggesting that biogenic INPs are dominant in the boundary layer above the same environment. Most of the INP concentrations and activated fractions observed in the free troposphere are notably lower than in the boundary layer, and the distinct particle size distributions suggest that different aerosol populations, likely resulting from long-range transport, are present in the free troposphere. However, we show one case where higher INP concentrations are observed in the free troposphere and where a homogeneous particle population exists from the surface to the free troposphere. This indicates that surface particles and INPs from the boreal forest can occasionally reach the free troposphere, which is particularly important as the INPs in the free troposphere can further travel horizontally and/or vertically and impact cloud formation."

We have found that Aeolus and CALIPSO show similar aerosol patterns in the collocated orbits and have good agreement for the extinction coefficients for the dust aerosols, especially for the cloud-free scenes. The finding is applicable to Aeolus L2A product Baseline 17. 
 The Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument (ALADIN) on board Aeolus was the first high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) in space. It was launched in 2018 and re-entered in 2023. The FeatureMask (A-FM) and extinction profile algorithms (A-PRO) developed for the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) HSRL ATmospheric LIDar (ATLID) have been adapted to Aeolus and called AEL-FM and AEL-PRO, respectively. These algorithms have been purposely built to process low signal-to-noise ratio space-based lidar signals. A short description of the AEL-FM and AEL-PRO algorithms is provided in this paper. AEL-FM and AEL-PRO prototype products (v1.7) have been evaluated using the collocated Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) vertical feature mask (VFM) product and level 2 aerosol profile product for 2 months of data in October 2018 and May 2019. Aeolus and CALIPSO are both polar-orbiting satellites, but they have different overpass times. The evaluations are focused on desert dust aerosols over Africa. These types of scenes are often stable in space (tens of kilometres) and time (on the order of 0.5–1 h), and thus, a useful number of collocated cases can be collected.We have found that the AEL-FM feature mask and the CALIPSO VFM show similar aerosol patterns in the collocated orbits, but AEL-FM does not separate aerosol and cloud features. Aeolus and CALIPSO have a good agreement for the extinction coefficients for the dust aerosols, especially for the cloud-free scenes. The Aeolus aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is larger than the CALIPSO AOT, mainly due to cloud contamination. Because of the missing a cross-polar channel, it is difficult to distinguish aerosols and thin ice clouds using the Aeolus extinction coefficients alone.The AEL-FM and AEL-PRO algorithms have been implemented in the Aeolus level 2A (L2A) processor. The findings here are applicable to the AEL-FM and AEL-PRO products in L2A Baseline 17. This is the first time that the AEL-FM and AEL-PRO products have been evaluated using CALIPSO data."

We found making accurate mixtures at very low levels challenging due to the gas sticking to cylinder walls. However, we successfully created stable mixtures at higher levels. These can be used as reliable standards for global air monitoring. More research is needed to develop methods for making accurate mixtures at lower levels. 
 Acetonitrile plays an important role in atmospheric processes and serves as a key tracer of biomass burning, the major emission source of primary carbonaceous particles and trace gases in the global atmosphere. Recognizing its significance, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) has designated acetonitrile as one of the target volatile organic compounds for global atmospheric monitoring, aiming for data quality better than 20 % accuracy and 15 % precision. Meeting the objectives of the WMO GAW program requires accurate and stable calibration standards with uncertainties of less than 5 %. In this study, we explored the feasibility of gravimetry for developing primary standard gas mixtures (PSMs) in three different types of aluminium cylinders, each with distinct internal surface treatments, at nmol mol-1 and µmol mol-1 levels with a relative expanded uncertainty of less than 5 %. We found that all three types of cylinders were inadequate, without further passivation, for developing acetonitrile PSMs below 10 nmol mol-1 due to significant adsorption losses (6 %–49 %) onto the cylinder's inner surface. To overcome this challenge, we prepared acetonitrile gas mixtures at 100 nmol mol-1 using a modified gravimetric method and at 10 µmol mol-1 using a conventional gravimetric method and then evaluated their long-term stability. Results showed that the effect of the adsorption loss at 100 nmol mol-1 and 10 µmol mol-1 was negated and negligible, respectively. Stability results show that we can disseminate acetonitrile calibration standards at both 100 nmol mol-1 and 10 µmol mol-1 with a relative expanded uncertainty of 3 % and 1 %, respectively (with an expiration period of 3 years), meeting the target uncertainty of the WMO GAW program. Further research is still needed to develop accurate and stable acetonitrile calibration standards below 10 nmol mol-1 that are closer to atmospheric levels."

VODCA v2 comprises two products: VODCA CXKu, spanning 34 years of observations (1987–2021), suitable for monitoring upper canopy dynamics, and VODCA L (2010–2021), for above-ground biomass monitoring. VODCA v2 has lower noise levels than the previous product version and provides valuable insights into plant water dynamics and biomass changes, even in areas where optical data are limited. 
 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a model-based indicator of the total water content stored in the vegetation canopy derived from microwave Earth observations. As such, it is related to vegetation density, abundance, and above-ground biomass (AGB). Moesinger et al. (2020)  introduced the global microwave VOD Climate Archive (VODCA v1), which harmonises VOD retrievals from several individual sensors into three long-term, multi-sensor VOD products in the C, X, and Ku frequency bands, respectively. VODCA v1 was the first VOD dataset spanning over 30 years of observations, thus allowing the monitoring of long-term changes in vegetation. Several studies have used VODCA in applications such as phenology analysis; drought monitoring; gross primary productivity monitoring; and the modelling of land evapotranspiration, live fuel moisture, and ecosystem resilience.This paper presents VODCA v2, which incorporates several methodological improvements compared to the first version and adds two new VOD datasets to the VODCA product suite. The VODCA v2 products are computed with a novel weighted merging scheme based on first-order autocorrelation of the input datasets. The first new dataset merges observations from multiple sensors in the C-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies into a multi-frequency VODCA CXKu product indicative of upper canopy dynamics. VODCA CXKu provides daily observations in a 0.25° resolution for the period 1987–2021. The second addition is an L-band product (VODCA L), based on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, which in theory is more sensitive to the entire canopy, including branches and trunks. VODCA L covers the period 2010–2021 and has a temporal resolution of 10 d and a spatial resolution of 0.25°. The sensitivity of VODCA CXKu to the upper vegetation layer and that of VODCA L to above-ground biomass (AGB) are analysed using independent vegetation datasets.VODCA CXKu exhibits lower random error levels and improved temporal sampling compared to VODCA v1 single-frequency products. It provides complementary spatio-temporal information to optical vegetation indicators containing additional information on the state of the canopy. As such, VODCA CXKu shows moderate positive agreement in short vegetation (Spearman's R: 0.57) and broadleaf forests (Spearman's R: 0.49) with the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from MODIS. VODCA CXKu also shows moderate agreement with the slope of the backscatter incidence angle relation of MetOp ASCAT in grassland (Spearman's R: 0.48) and cropland (Spearman's R: 0.46). Additionally, VODCA CXKu shows temporal patterns similar to the Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI) from in situ L-band GNSS measurements of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) and sap flow measurements from SAPFLUXNET. VODCA L shows strong spatial agreement (Spearman's R: 0.86) and plausible temporal patterns with respect to yearly AGB maps from the Xu et al. (2021) dataset. VODCA v2 enables monitoring of plant water dynamics, stress, and biomass change and can provide insights, even into areas that are scarcely covered by optical data (i.e. due to cloud cover).VODCA v2 is open-access and available at https://doi.org/10.48436/t74ty-tcx62 (Zotta et al., 2024)."

Palmer,Improved definition of prior uncertainties in CO2 and CO fossil fuel fluxes and its impact on multi-species inversion with GEOS-Chem (v12.5),"Monitoring greenhouse gas emission reductions requires a combination of models and observations, as well as an initial emission estimate. Each component provides information with a certain level of certainty and is weighted to yield the most reliable estimate of actual emissions. We describe efforts for estimating the uncertainty in the initial emission estimate, which significantly impacts the outcome. Hence, a good uncertainty estimate is key for obtaining reliable information on emissions. 
 Monitoring, reporting, and verification frameworks for greenhouse gas emissions are being developed by countries across the world to keep track of progress towards national emission reduction targets. Data assimilation plays an important role in monitoring frameworks, combining different sources of information to achieve the best possible estimate of fossil fuel emissions and, as a consequence, better estimates for fluxes from the natural biosphere. Robust estimates for fossil fuel emissions rely on accurate estimates of uncertainties corresponding to different pieces of information. We describe prior uncertainties in CO2 and CO fossil fuel fluxes, paying special attention to spatial error correlations and the covariance structure between CO2 and CO. This represents the first time that prior uncertainties in CO2 and the important co-emitted trace gas CO are defined consistently, with error correlations included, which allows us to make use of the synergy between the two trace gases to better constrain CO2 fossil fuel fluxes. CO:CO2 error correlations differ by sector, depending on the diversity of sub-processes occurring within a sector, and also show a large range of values between pixels within the same sector. For example, for other stationary combustion, pixel correlation values range from 0.1 to 1.0, whereas for road transport, the correlation is mostly larger than 0.6. We illustrate the added value of our definition of prior uncertainties using closed-loop numerical experiments over mainland Europe and the UK, which isolate the influence of using error correlations between CO2 and CO and the influence of prescribing more detailed information about prior emission uncertainties. For the experiments, synthetic in situ observations are used, allowing us to validate the results against a “truth”. The “true” emissions are made by perturbing the prior emissions (from an emission inventory) according to the prescribed prior uncertainties. We find that using our realistic definition of prior uncertainties helps our data assimilation system to differentiate more easily between CO2 fluxes from biogenic and fossil fuel sources. Using improved prior emission uncertainties, we find fewer geographic regions with significant deviations from the prior compared to when using default prior uncertainties (32 vs. 80 grid cells of 0.25°×0.3125°, with an absolute difference of more than 1 kg s−1 between the prior and posterior), but these deviations from the prior almost consistently move closer to the prescribed true values, with 92 % showing an improvement, in contrast to the default prior uncertainties, where 61 % show an improvement. We also find that using CO provides additional information on CO2 fossil fuel fluxes, but this is only the case if the CO:CO2 error covariance structure is defined realistically. Using the default prior uncertainties, the CO2 fossil fuel fluxes move farther away from the truth in many geographical regions (with 50 % showing an improvement compared to 94 % when advanced prior uncertainties are used). With the default uncertainties, the maximum deviation of fossil fuel CO2 from the prescribed truth is about 7 % in both the prior and posterior results. With the advanced uncertainties, this is reduced to 3 % in the posterior results."

Specifically, sample solutions containing NaCl, NaBr, NH4Cl, and NaI at concentrations between 10–6 and 10–1 M were subjected to freezing–melting cycles and then analyzed for H2O2 content. The relationship between the production rate of H2O2 and the salt concentration follows that of the Workman–Reynolds freezing potential (WRFP) values as a function of the salt concentration. Our results suggest that H2O2 is formed at the liquid–ice interface from the self-recombination of hydroxyl radicals (OH·), produced from the oxidation of hydroxide anions due to the high electric field generated at the aqueous–ice interface under the WRFP effect. Furthermore, the involvement of O2 likely acting as an electron capturer could promote to produce more OH radicals and  hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2·), thus enhancing the production of H2O2 at the liquid–ice interface. Overall, this study suggests a novel mechanism of H2O2 formation in ice via its spontaneous production at the liquid–ice interface, induced by the Workman–Reynolds effect."

The application of Zn isotopes (δ66Zn) has been suggested as a potent tool for tracing environmental contamination. However, studies focusing on Zn isotope tracing within the cryosphere areas are notably limited. Here we present the first data set on Zn isotopes in glacial cryoconite, based on observations over a large regional scale in High Asian Mountains (including Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surroundings of western China). The results showed that glacial cryoconite had a general heavy Zn isotopic signature in various TP locations, with δ66Zn values ranging from −0.22‰ to +0.87‰. Employing the MixSIAR model, the overall Zn contribution source to the cryoconite was mineral dust (36%) > coal burning (33%) > non‐exhaust traffic emissions (22%) > industrial smelting (10%). We ascertained that anthropogenic sources account for the primary contribution (about 60%–73%) of Zn inputs in all glacial locations, with coal burning emerging as the foremost anthropogenic contributor (mean 33%). Anthropogenic Zn in various TP locations was primarily derived from Zn emissions resulting from coal combustion, though it is also predominantly influenced by industrial smelting source in cryoconite of the Tianshan Mountains. Our results aligned with coal combustion data from the energy inventory of western China, suggesting that regional coal burning likely represents the foremost source of atmospheric Zn pollutant emission and deposition in the High Asia mountain glaciers."

Although cropland expansion may overconsume local water resources in general, in Northwest China, increased precipitation and enhanced glacier melt have increased the water available for croplands. Counterintuitively, the enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) resulting from this cropland expansion could benefit remote ecologically vulnerable natural vegetation through atmospheric moisture recycling. In this study, we used a moisture tracking model to quantify contributions of croplands and cropland expansion to local precipitation and the consequent precipitation supply to natural vegetation in Northwest China. We found that the croplands contributed 27.69 billion m3/year (2.13%) of regional total precipitation and supplied 17.30 billion m3/year (2.39%) of precipitation over natural vegetation, and the cropland expansion resulted in a net increase of 80.25 million m3/year (1.07% of the total increase) in regional precipitation and 36.23 million m3/year (4.56% of the total increase) in precipitation supply for natural vegetation. Among different types of natural vegetation, grasslands received the most precipitation supply due to its vast area, followed by forests and shrublands. The more arid regions experienced not only faster rates of cropland expansion but also obtained a greater increase in regional precipitation and precipitation supply to natural vegetation. Our study quantifies the ecological impacts of cropland expansion through moisture recycling in Northwest China.

 Typhoons are one of the most important weather systems that can cause severe ozone (O3) pollution in eastern China. While the effects of individual typhoons on O3 concentrations have been extensively studied, the effects of consecutive northward typhoons and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, partly due to the complex processes involved. Here, Typhoons Maysak and Haishen, two consecutive northward typhoons in 2020, are selected to investigate their impact on the O3 pollution in eastern China. The results show that consecutive northward typhoons not only produced and maintained meteorological conditions conducive to O3 generation (e.g., elevated temperatures and intensified solar radiation), but also facilitated local accumulation and cross-regional transport of O3. These factors jointly led to a 30% increase in O3 concentration in eastern China with a prolonged period of O3 pollution. Our work underscores the significance of complex meteorological conditions in O3 pollution occurrences during extreme weather events, advancing our understanding of how consecutive northward typhoons affect air quality."

Using reanalysis product and Earth System Model data, the spatiotemporal characteristics and temperature sensitivities of EPEs are analyzed. Results show that EPE-Hs, while less frequent, have longer duration and greater magnitude compared to EPE-NHs, particularly in high latitude regions. In the future, a significant increase is projected in the characteristics of EPE-Hs, in contrast to the stable duration and magnitude of EPE-NHs. EPE-Hs demonstrate substantially higher temperature sensitivity than EPE-NHs, especially in low latitudes. The precipitation-temperature scaling relationships diverge markedly between EPE-Hs and EPE-NHs, with notable regional variations.

 Forest regeneration is a crucial strategy for mitigating and adapting to global warming. Yet its precise impact on local climate remains uncertain, a factor that complicates decision-making when it comes to prioritizing investments. Here, we developed global maps illustrating how natural forest regeneration influences key local climate drivers—land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and evapotranspiration—using models fitted at a 1-km spatial resolution with a random forest classifier. We found that natural forest regeneration can alter annual mean LST by 0.01 °C, −0.59 °C, −0.50 °C, and −2.03 °C in Boreal, Mediterranean, Temperate, and Tropical regions, respectively. These variations underscore the region-specific effects of forest regeneration. Importantly, natural forest regeneration reduces LST across 64% of 1 billion hectares and 75% of 148 million hectares of potentially restorable land under different scenarios. These findings improve understanding of how forest regeneration can help regulate local climate, supporting climate adaptation efforts. Natural forest regeneration can enhance local climate adaptation by reducing land surface temperature. Natural forest regenerations reduce mean land surface temperature across potentially restorable areas in the Boreal, Mediterranean, Temperate, and Tropical regions according to an analysis that combines climate data, machine learning, and scenario analysis."

 Improving our understanding of the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and the lower atmosphere (i.e. land–atmosphere interactions), and how climate change may affect them, is crucial to predict changes in temperature and precipitation extremes. Observations of energy and water fluxes at the land surface are typically retrieved from the eddy covariance method, which presents limitations related to spatial and temporal gaps, and the non-closure of the energy and water balances. Meanwhile, soil moisture (SM) products derived from satellite data have been widely used at regional and global scales, but they are limited to capture only surface soil water content and variations. The combination of remote sensing (RS) data and modelling frameworks is called to be the solution to improve the spatial coverage and vertical resolution of land–atmosphere interactions data, ensuring the energy and water balance closure. Here, we explore the combination of remote sensing and meteorological data with a physical-based modelling framework, the High resOlution Land Atmosphere Parameters from Space (HOLAPS). We used HOLAPS to produce hourly consistent estimates of energy and water fluxes over Europe at 5 km resolution. HOLAPS and other satellite-based evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux products from the literature are evaluated against the water balance method and eddy covariance measurements. HOLAPS SM estimates together with other RS-modelling products are also evaluated against ground-based measurements at the surface and in the root zone. The evaluation of HOLAPS ET estimates show similar performance to the other products with Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) ¿ -0.41 in comparison with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET in all seasons but in boreal winter. The simulation of H is more uncertain than for ET with KGE values ranging from -2.5 to 0.8 along the products and stations at monthly scales. HOLAPS reaches slightly better results than the rest of ET and H products at daily scales in summer (KGE ¿ 0.3 for ET and KGE ¿ 0.0 for H) and during hot conditions (KGE ¿ 0.2 for ET and KGE ¿-0.2 for H), while the state-of-the-art products show KGE ¿ 0.1 for ET and KGE ¿ -0.41 for H in summer and KGE ¿ -0.1 for ET and KGE ¿ -0.6 for H during hot conditions. All products evaluated here yield a reasonable performance (KGE ¿-0.41 at most sites) in simulating SM at the surface and in the root zone. Our results expose the need for further investigating and improving product performances during extreme conditions. The good performance of HOLAPS together with its inherent advantages (RS data driven, high temporal and spatial resolution, spatial and temporal continuity, soil moisture at different depths and long-term consistent evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux estimates) support its use for agricultural and forest management activities as well as to study land–atmosphere interactions based on Earth Observations."

 Emissions from industrial parks are crucial sources of ambient volatile organic compound (VOC) pollution, characterized by high concentrations, complex compositions, dispersed emission sources, and uneven spatial distribution. To better understand and address this issue, it is crucial to analyze the spatial differences in VOC pollution and associated health risks through multi-point monitoring. In this study, we established four online monitoring sites in a typical industrial park in Kaifeng, China. We monitored 115 VOC species and found significant differences in the concentration and chemical composition of total VOCs (TVOCs) among the four sites. Two sites were primarily composed of halohydrocarbons (49.80% and 41.21%), while the other two sites had a higher proportion of aromatics (54.78% and 39.03%). Acetaldehyde was the main contributor to ozone formation potential (OFP) at one site, while toluene was associated with the other three sites. The site with the highest VOC concentration and OFP also showed the highest secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP). In terms of health risk assessment, acrolein posed a non-carcinogenic risk at all sites, but there were disparities in the carcinogenic risk among the four sites. 1,2-Dichloroethane at one site exceeded the definite risk limit, while 1,2-dibromoethane and chloroform were considered probable risk species at another site. Considering both the environmental impact and health risk, we used entropy-weighting to calculate a comprehensive control index (CCI).

Alves,Gaseous and aerosol emissions from open burning of tree pruning and hedge trimming residues: Detailed composition and toxicity,"•EFs of gaseous pollutants and PM10for the open burning of pruning wastes were obtained. •PM10was dominated by organic carbon, 50% of which was found to be water soluble. •All samples significantly reduced the viability of alveolar epithelial cells. •PAHs and saccharides were significantly correlated with cell viability. •WSOC and some PAHs correlated with OPDTT, while OPAAwas linked to some trace metals. 
 Gaseous and PM10 samples were collected during the open burning of pruning residues (olive branches and garden waste) and characterised by distinct analytical techniques to obtain comprehensive chemical emission profiles. Oxidative potential (dithiothreoitol and ascorbic acid assays) and cell viability tests were also performed with the aim of evaluating aerosol toxicity. Emission factors (EFs) were as follows (g kg−1 biofuel, dry basis): 1537–1672 for CO2, 41.9–80 for CO, 2.74–6.6 for CH4, 0.89–3.51 for ethane, 0.79–1.78 for ethylene and 0.56–3.47 for formaldehyde. Emissions of PM10, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were in the ranges 8–41, 3–18, and 0.4–1.5 g kg−1 biofuel, dry basis, respectively. OC accounted for 35–45% of the total PM10 mass, while EC contributed between around 3% and 5%. WSOC/OC ratios varied from 0.4 to 0.6, revealing that a substantial portion of the carbon emitted was hydrosoluble. Water soluble ions constituted around 8–21% of the PM10 mass, with potassium and chloride as the most abundant ions in all samples. Levoglucosan, widely used a reliable biomass burning tracer, was found in significant amounts in all samples (up to 1.2% of the PM10 mass). Retene, generally pointed out as a biomass combustion biomarker, was the predominant PAH. WSOC and some PAHs showed significant positive correlations with the intrinsic OP measured with the DTT assay, while the OPAA was significantly correlated with some trace metals, such as Fe or Ni. All samples significantly reduced the viability of alveolar epithelial cells."

Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone."

 Rate coefficients for the reactions of OH radicals with C3–C11 alkanes were determined using the multivariate relative-rate technique. A total of 25 relative-rate coefficients at room temperature and 24 Arrhenius expressions in the temperature range of 273–323 K were obtained. Notably, a new room temperature relative-rate coefficient for 3-methylheptane that had not been previously reported was determined, and the obtained kOH value (in units of 10−12 cm3 molec.−1 s−1) was 7.71 ± 0.35. Interestingly, whilst results for n-alkanes agreed well with available structure–activity relationship (SAR) calculations of Kwok and Atkinson (1995), Neeb (2000), Wilson et al. (2006), Jenkin et al. (2018), and McGillen et al. (2020), the three cycloalkanes (cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane) and one branched alkane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) were found to be less reactive than predicted by the SAR approach. Conversely, the SAR estimates for 2,3-dimethylbutane were approximately 25 % lower than the experimental values, with the exception of those estimated by the Wilson group, highlighting that there may be additional factors that govern the reactivity of highly branched alkanes that are not captured by current SAR techniques. Arrhenius expressions (in units of cm3 molec.−1 s−1) for the reactions of various branched alkanes with OH radicals were determined for the first time: 2-methylheptane, 1.37±0.48×10-11exp-209±100/T, and 3-methylheptane, 3.54±0.45×10-11exp-374±49/T. The reactivity relation of saturated alkanes with OH radicals and chlorine atoms was obtained: log10k(Cl+alkanes)=0.569×log10k(OH+alkanes)-3.111 (R2 = 0.86). In addition, the rate coefficients for the 24 previously studied OH + alkanes reactions were consistent with existing literature values, demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of this method for the simultaneous investigation of gas-phase reaction kinetics."

Carslaw,Global modeling of aerosol nucleation with  a semi-explicit chemical mechanism for  highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs),"Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) play an important role in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). By semi-explicitly coupling the chemical mechanism of HOMs and a comprehensive nucleation scheme in a global climate model, the updated model shows better agreement with measurements of nucleation rate, growth rate, and NPF event frequency. Our results reveal that HOM-driven NPF leads to a considerable increase in particle and cloud condensation nuclei burden globally. 
 New particle formation (NPF) involving organic compounds has been identified as an important process affecting aerosol particle number concentrations in the global atmosphere. Laboratory studies have shown that highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) can make a substantial contribution to NPF, but there is a lack of global model studies of NPF with detailed HOM chemistry. Here, we incorporate a state-of-the-art biogenic HOM chemistry scheme with 96 chemical reactions to a global chemistry–climate model and quantify the contribution to global aerosols through HOM-driven NPF. The updated model captures the frequency of NPF events observed at continental surface sites (normalized mean bias changes from −96 % to −15 %) and shows reasonable agreement with measured rates of NPF and sub-20 nm particle growth. Sensitivity simulations show that compared to turning off the organic nucleation rate, turning off organic initial growth results in a more substantial decrease in aerosol number concentrations. Globally, organics contribute around 45 % of the annual mean vertically integrated nucleation rate (at 1.7 nm) and 25 % of the vertically averaged growth rate. The inclusion of HOM-related processes leads to a 39 % increase in the global annual mean aerosol number burden and a 33 % increase in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) burden at 0.5 % supersaturation compared to a simulation with only inorganic nucleation. Our work predicts a greater contribution of organic nucleation to NPF than previous studies due to the semi-explicit HOM mechanism and an updated inorganic NPF scheme. The large contribution of biogenic HOMs to NPF on a global scale could make aerosol sensitive to changes in biogenic emissions."

Results show that the simulations reproduce the observations well and improve understanding of cloud impacts on radiation. The research also indicates that a few strategically placed sensors, capitalizing on measurement timing, can effectively measure these variations, aiding in the development of detailed weather prediction models. 
 The amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth surface (surface solar irradiance, SSI) is critical for a variety of applications, ranging from surface–atmosphere interactions to solar energy. SSI is characterized by a large spatiotemporal variability, in particular in the presence of cumulus clouds. This results in complex spatial patterns of shadows and sunlight directly related to clouds' geometry and physical properties. Although key in many respects, the instantaneous spatial distribution of SSI remains largely unexplored. Here, we use unique observations from a dense network of pyranometers deployed during the HOPE field campaign to investigate the SSI spatial distribution. For cumulus scenes, bimodal distributions are found, with one mode corresponding to cloud shadows and the other to sunlit areas with enhanced SSI exceeding clear-sky values. Combining large-eddy simulations of cumulus clouds with Monte Carlo ray tracing, we demonstrate the capability of advanced numerical tools to reproduce the observed distributions and quantify the impact of cloud geometrical and physical properties on both modes. In particular, cloud cover strongly modulates their amplitudes, in addition to their position and width, which are also sensitive to cloud height, geometrical depth, and liquid water content. Combining observations and simulations, we also explore sampling strategies to estimate the SSI spatial distribution with a limited number of sensors, suggesting that 10 pyranometers integrated over 10 min can capture most details of the full distribution. Such a strategy could be used for future campaigns to further investigate SSI distributions and their impact on land–atmosphere exchanges or photovoltaic farm management."

Flynn;Shan-Hu Lee,"Measurement report: Urban ammonia and amines in Houston, Texas","Ammonia and amines are important ingredients for aerosol formation in urban environments, but the measurements of these compounds are extremely challenging. Our observations show that urban ammonia and amines in Houston are emitted from urban sources, and diurnal variations in their concentrations are likely governed by gas-to-particle conversion and emissions. 
 Ammonia and amines play critical roles in secondary aerosol formation, especially in urban environments. However, fast measurements of ammonia and amines in the atmosphere are very scarce. We measured ammonia and amines with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) at the urban center in Houston, Texas, the fourth most populated urban site in the United States, during October 2022. Ammonia concentrations were on average four parts per billion by volume (ppbv), while the concentration of an individual amine ranged from several parts per trillion by volume (pptv) to hundreds of pptv. These reduced nitrogen compounds were more abundant during weekdays than on weekends and correlated with measured CO concentrations, implying they were mostly emitted from pollutant sources. Both ammonia and amines showed a distinct diurnal cycle, with higher concentrations in the warmer afternoon, indicating dominant gas-to-particle conversion processes taking place with the changing ambient temperatures. Studies have shown that dimethylamine is critical for new particle formation (NPF) in the polluted boundary layer, but currently there are no amine emission inventories in global climate models (as opposed to ammonia). Our observations made in the very polluted area of Houston, as well as a less polluted site (Kent, Ohio) from our previous study (You et al., 2014), indicate there is a consistent ratio of dimethylamine over ammonia at these two sites. Thus, our observations can provide a relatively constrained proxy of dimethylamine using 0.1 % ammonia concentrations at polluted sites in the United States to model NPF processes."

ICI is a passive conically scanning radiometer that will operate within a frequency range of 183 to 664 GHz, helping to cover the present wavelength gap between microwave and infrared observations. Reliable global data will be produced on a daily basis. This paper presents the retrieval database to be used operationally and performs a final pre-launch assessment of ICI retrievals.Simulations are performed within atmospheric states that are consistent with radar reflectivities and represent the three-dimensional (3D) variability of clouds. The radiative transfer calculations use empirically based hydrometeor models. Azimuthal orientation of particles is mimicked, allowing for the consideration of polarisation. The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the ICI retrieval database are shown to vary according to cloud type. The simulations are considered to be the most detailed performed to this date. Simulated radiances are shown to be statistically consistent with real observations.Machine learning is applied to perform inversions of the simulated ICI observations. The method used allows for the estimation of non-Gaussian uncertainties for each retrieved case. Retrievals of ice water path (IWP), mean mass height (Zm), and mean mass diameter (Dm) are presented. Distributions and zonal means of both database and retrieved IWP show agreement with DARDAR. Retrieval tests indicate that ICI will be sensitive to IWP between 10−2 and 101 kg m−2. Retrieval performance is shown to vary with climatic region and surface type, with the best performance achieved over tropical regions and over ocean. As a consequence of this study, retrievals from real observations will be possible from day one of the ICI operational phase."

In this study 27 years of airborne measurements of temperature and relative humidity from In‐service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) are used to parameterize the distribution of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The parameterization is designed to simulate water vapor fluctuations within gridboxes of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) with typical size of a few tens to a few hundred kilometers. The distributions currently used in such models are often not supported by observations at high altitude. More sophisticated distributions are key to represent ice supersaturation, a physical phenomenon that plays a major role in the formation of natural cirrus and contrail cirrus. Here the observed distributions are fitted with a beta law whose parameters are adjusted from the gridbox mean variables. More specifically the standard deviation and skewness of the distributions are expressed as empirical functions of the average temperature and specific humidity, two typical prognostic variables of AGCMs. Thus, the distribution of water vapor is fully parameterized for a use in these models. The new parameterization reproduces the observed distributions with a determination coefficient always greater than 0.917 and with a mean value of 0.997. The parameterization is robust to a selection of various geographical subsets of data and to gridbox sizes varying between 25 and 300 km."

Different types of weather events, including tropical cyclones (TCs), mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), and atmospheric rivers (ARs), significantly impact precipitation patterns in East Asia. This study pioneers the application of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural network, U‐Net, and Attention U‐Net models, to simulate precipitation associated with these weather events. The spatial permutation method is also used to identify key meteorological variables for accurately generating precipitation in DL models. The DL models trained on all timeslots consistently surpass the performance of state‐of‐the‐art numerical simulations, although their efficacy slightly diminishes during extreme weather events. This outperformance is attributed to the appropriate emphasis on key variables that capture precipitation processes, such as low‐level moisture and mid‐level pressure fields. However, new DL models trained separately for TCs, MCSs, and ARs using clipped precipitation as the output does not exceed the performance of the previous DL models. Among all input features, moisture variables contribute the most to precipitation at low intensity, while the importance of other variables increases for more intense precipitation, although some discrepancies vary across models and event types. The spatial results further reveal the detailed locations of variables that are essential for accurately simulating precipitation related to weather events, such as areas of high specific humidity and strong winds.

Quantifying their contribution to air quality is crucial to understanding the trends of vehicle emissions as low‐ and “zero” emission vehicles join the fleet. Modeling on‐road emissions is complex due to various factors like fleet activities, traffic patterns, and meteorological conditions. We compare on‐road emissions from two mobile models: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fuel‐based Inventory of Vehicle Emission (FIVE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), finding they contribute 4%–33% to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NOx, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Using a regional chemical transport model, we assess air quality effects under different emission scenarios. Both emission data sets yield satisfactory performance, with MOVES showing lower biases in ozone (O3) and PM2.5 over CONUS, while FIVE performs better at city scales due to higher urban NOx emissions. In January, on‐road emissions increased surface O3 over western and southern US by up to 9.1%–13.1% but decreased by 2.5% over the northeastern US, while PM2.5 predictions vary across the US (−85% to 24%). In July, on‐road emissions elevate O3 and PM2.5 concentrations by 15%–20% across CONUS, except in some west coast cities. They also greatly contribute to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by more than 80% near roads and in urban areas. This study highlights the significant impact of on‐road emissions on urban air quality and provides insights for improving air quality forecasting and management."

 Climate over land—where humans live and the majority of food is produced—is changing rapidly, driving severe impacts through extreme heat, wildfires, drought and flooding. Our ability to monitor and model this changing climate is being transformed through new observational systems and increasingly complex Earth system models. But fundamental understanding of the processes governing land climate has not kept pace, weakening our ability to interpret and utilize data from these advanced tools. Here we argue that for land-climate science to accelerate forwards, an alternative approach is needed. We advocate a parallel scientific effort, one emphasizing robust theories, that aims to inspire current and future land-climate scientists to better comprehend the processes governing land climate, its variability and extremes and its sensitivity to global warming. Such an effort, we believe, is essential to better understand the risks people face, where they live, in an era of climate change.

 Centennial-scale increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide, known as carbon dioxide jumps, are identified during deglacial, glacial and interglacial periods and linked to the Northern Hemisphere abrupt climate variations. However, the limited number of identified carbon dioxide jumps prevents investigating the role of orbital background conditions on the different components of the global carbon cycle that may lead to such rapid atmospheric carbon dioxide releases. Here we present a high-resolution carbon dioxide record measured on an Antarctic ice core between 260,000 and 190,000 years ago, which reveals seven additional carbon dioxide Jumps. Eighteen of the 22 jumps identified over the past 500,000 years occurred under a context of high obliquity. Simulations performed with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity point towards both the Southern Ocean and the continental biosphere as the two main carbon sources during carbon dioxide jumps connected to Heinrich ice rafting events. Notably, the continental biosphere appears as the obliquity-dependent carbon dioxide source for these abrupt events. We demonstrate that the orbital-scale external forcing directly impacts past abrupt atmospheric carbon dioxide changes.

 Wildfires in the southwestern United States are increasingly frequent and severe, but whether these trends exceed historical norms remains contested. Here we combine dendroecological records, satellite-derived burn severity, and field measured tree mortality to compare historical (1700-1880) and contemporary (1985-2020) fire regimes at tree-ring fire-scar sites in Arizona and New Mexico. We found that contemporary fire frequency, including recent, record fire years, is still <20% of historical levels. Since 1985, the fire return interval averages 58.8 years, compared to 11.4 years before 1880. Fire severity, however, has increased. At sites where trees historically survived many fires over centuries, 42% of recent fires resulted in high tree mortality. Suppressed wildfires tended to burn more severely than prescribed burns and wildfires managed for resource benefit. These findings suggest that expanded use of low-severity prescribed and managed fire would help restore forest resilience and historical fire regimes in dry conifer forests. Contemporary fires are less frequent than those occurring in the past, but their severity results in higher tree mortality, based on a comparison of historical and contemporary fire severity using dendrochronology, satellite, and field-derived data from forests in Arizona and New Mexico, USA."

 Small α-dicarbonyls (SαDs) are well-known as the important precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Hence, it is imperative to understand the atmospheric chemistry of SαDs to contribute to SOA formation. In this work, we investigated the interfacial chemistry of typical SαDs, including methylglyoxal (MG) and biacetyl (BA) in the neutral and acidic droplets by combined molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations. The trans configurations of MG and BA are found to be the favorable configurations at the interfaces and are prone to stay at the gas-liquid interface of the acidic droplet. The C=O group exhibits a preferential uptake orientation towards the interface because the carbonyl-O atom has a strong interaction with interfacial H2O. The uptakes and accumulations of MG and BA at the interfaces are promoted by the acidic condition. Subsequent interfacial hydrations of MG and BA in the acidic droplet are beneficial to yield diols, which can engage in oligomerization in the droplet interior to contribute SOA formation. Our results provide the theoretical insight into the interfacial chemistry of SαDs and their role in SOA formation."

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) stands as one of the most important greenhouse gasses, with steadily increasing concentrations attributable to human activities. In the pursuit of reaching peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals, it is essential to quantify carbon emissions and evaluate carbon reduction strategies. To establish a high-precision observation with full time series and spatial coverage, a spatio-temporal interpolation method was developed to obtain XCO2 data over mainland China at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° for the years 2015–2021. An east-west gradient, higher levels in the east and lower levels in the west, was observed, exhibiting a seasonal pattern of elevation in spring and reduction in summer. Subsequently, the research area is classified into seven clusters based on time-series XCO2 anomalies (ΔXCO2) and ODIAC (Open Source Data Inventory of Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide) carbon emission data. This classification aims to emphasize the differentiation of spatial heterogeneity in carbon emissions and the results highlight that regions with high ΔXCO2 reflect higher carbon emission. Finally, the carbon emissions of each cluster were estimated by using a random forest model individually yielding an R2 of approximately 0.6. For assessing the variables influencing carbon emission predictions, the importance of each variable was calculated. Specifically, NightTime Lighting data (NTL), representing human production activities, emerged as a crucial variable influencing carbon emission predictions in most clusters. In comparison, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is considered a more critical variable in Southwest China (SWC), primarily owing to the intricate vegetation carbon sink system in this region. Temperature (T) emerges as a key variable influencing the estimation of carbon emissions in certain developed cities in Eastern China (EC), driven by the urban heat island effect which amplifies energy consumption, modifies land use, and impacts urban systems, influencing the spatial patterns of carbon emissions. Carbon emissions in different characteristic regions was quantified by establishing machine learning models with remote sensing data, which can provide new insights and support for refined carbon monitoring and management strategy."

Reason,Rainfall characteristics over the Congo Air Boundary Region in southern Africa: A comparison of station and gridded rainfall products,"•The first comparison between station data in poorly observed southwestern Africa and gridded rainfall products is presented. •Gridded rainfall products do not accurately capture extreme rainfall in mountainous regions. •GPCC and CPC do not adequately represent strong rainfall gradients in the region. •Most gridded rainfall products overestimate rainfall in the northern and wetter parts of the domain. 
 Strong meridional rainfall gradients exist between the tropics and subtropics in southwestern Africa, bounded to the north by the moist Congo basin and to the south by the Kalahari Desert. This domain received relatively little scientific attention compared to the rest of southern Africa. In this study, the limited available station data are assessed against six gridded rainfall products (CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR, ERA5, GPCC and CPC) for various rainfall characteristics. The nearest neighbour approach was used to match the closest rainfall dataset pixel to each station location, with the assumption that each rain gauge represents observation of various pixels of products, irrespective of product resolution. Results reveal that ERA5, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR tend to represent the monthly rainfall totals and number of rainy days well for most stations although magnitudes and monthly peaks differ. CPC and GPCC tend to perform poorly for magnitudes of rainfall, rainy days and monthly cycles especially for Angolan stations. These products also fail to adequately capture spatial distributions of rainfall, with poor representation of the strong gradients found in the region.Correlations between various gridded rainfall products mostly show good agreement in rainfall totals and rainy days. For early summer (October–November-December) moderate rainy days, ERA5 and CHIRPS products tend to have more days than the stations while CPC and GPCC products perform poorly over Angola and in the south. ERA5 generally overestimates rainfall in mountainous regions, while other products tend to underestimate it. Based on the Simple Daily Intensity Index, it was found that for most of the gridded rainfall products tend to overestimate rainfall during rainy days in the northern and wetter part of the domain. Furthermore, for heavy rainfall, CPC and GPCC tend to compare fairly well with stations in the southern and eastern parts of the domain but poorly with those in the western parts. PERSIANN-CDR tends to underestimate heavy rainy days for most stations in early and late summer (January–February-March-April). However, CHIRPS compares well at several stations, while ERA5 performs well for stations located in the south. This study helps provide useful guidance in choosing suitable rainfall gridded datasets for assessing long term rainfall cycles, daily rainfall characteristics as well as extremes over southwestern Africa."

Cirrus clouds are of great importance to the global climate, with their net radiative forcing strongly dependent on the microphysical properties that are related to the ice‐nucleating regime. However, the influence of long‐range transport of dust on primary ice formation in cirrus clouds is limitedly understood, specifically over the clean remote ocean regions. Here, two case studies show that transpacific Asian dust can impact the ice formation of cirrus clouds over the central Pacific based on Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR, CloudSat) observations. One case shows a well‐developed horizontally extended cirrus embedded in a pure dust layer, with an average dust‐related ice‐nucleating particle concentration (INPC) of 7 L−1 and 96 L−1 for an ice saturation ratio Si of 1.15 and 1.25, respectively; ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) with diameters >25 and 100 μm (denoted as nice,25 μm and nice,100 μm) are 64 L−1 and 7 L−1, respectively. Another case shows that cirrus clouds with a much smaller horizontal extent appeared in the vicinity of polluted dust, with an average INPC of 42–310 L−1 for the typical higher Si of 1.25–1.35 by considering a tenfold reduction of the ice nucleation efficiency of ice crystals; nice,25 μm and nice,100 μm are 168 L−1 and 20 L−1, respectively. The estimated INPC and ICNC values suggest the dominance of ice formation by dust‐induced heterogeneous nucleation, proving that the long‐range transport of dust toward the upper troposphere and the potential influence on cirrus formation over the central Pacific should be well considered in atmospheric models."

The 1.37 μm channel, known as strong water vapor absorbing, was made polarized in the polarized multi‐angle imager (PMAI) onboard FengYun‐3G satellite. The infight data shown that the new 1.37 μm polarized channel could be used to detect SWCs. The cloudbow is observed around the 140° scattering angle in the 1.37 μm polarization image, with a maximum polarization reflectance of approximately 0.04–0.06. The indicated water clouds with spherical particles in the high‐level altitude could be SWCs. Then, the SWCs detected by 1.37 μm polarized channel is verified using polarized reflectance of other channels, the reflectance difference of channels, and thermal infrared bright temperature. The presence of cloudbow in 1.03 and 1.64 μm channels indicate liquid water cloud. The reflectance difference between 1.03 and 1.64 μm of SWCs agree with characteristic of water cloud. The thermal infrared channels from the imager on the same platform indicate cold cloud with the brightness temperature far below 273.16 K. Therefore, the only use of 1.37 μm polarized channel could perform the identification of SWCs. PMAI provides a powerful tool for monitoring supercooled water clouds."

In this study, we document one such structure, a PMC front, by analyzing PMC images in the northern hemisphere from the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument onboard the aeronomy of ice in the mesosphere (AIM) satellite. A PMC front is defined as a sharp boundary that separates cloudy and mostly clear regions, and where the clouds at the front boundary are brighter than the clouds in the cloudy region. We explore the environment that supports the formation of PMC fronts using near‐coincident temperature and water vapor observations from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) satellite instrument. A comparison of PMC front locations to near‐coincident temperature profiles reveals the presence of inversion layers at PMC altitudes. The adiabatic and superadiabatic topside lapse rates of these temperature inversions indicate that some of the identified inversion layers may have been formed by gravity wave (GW) dissipation. The structure of the squared buoyancy frequency profiles indicates a stable layer or thermal duct that can be associated with large‐amplitude mesospheric inversion layers (MILs) that extend large distances. These inversion layers may be conducive to horizontal wave propagation. We hypothesize that ducted GWs may be a formation mechanism of PMC fronts."

The proposed model utilizes a coated spheroid to represent melting snow and graupel. It consists of three stages–coating, soaking, and melting–to account for the dielectric and density effects of melting particles. The scattering properties of the melting particles are computed with the Invariant‐Imbedding T‐Matrix (IITM) method, and the results are tabulated as look‐up tables for the radar operator. Regarding the parameterization of bulk optical properties, a flux‐conservation scheme is employed to estimate the size distribution of melting particles. To demonstrate its flexibility and superiority, the single and bulk scattering properties of our multi‐stage melting model are compared against the traditional homogeneous model, which uses the effective medium approximation (EMA). The effectiveness of the multi‐stage melting model has also been assessed by mapping model states in the regional mesoscale model of the China Meteorology Administration (CMA‐MESO) to radar observations. In the microphysics package of CMA‐MESO, the melting process is not explicitly represented, and we assume that melting hydrometeors occur where solid and liquid phases overlap. When compared with observations, the present multi‐stage melting model successfully reproduces melting layer signatures, highlighting its potential for microphysic validation, quantitative precipitation estimations, and data assimilation studies."

 Identifying changes in volcanic unrest and tracking eruptive activity are fundamental for volcanic surveillance and monitoring. Magmatic gases, particularly sulphur dioxide (SO2), play a crucial role in influencing eruptive styles, making the monitoring of SO2 emissions essential. Recent advancements in satellite remote sensing technology, including higher spatial resolution and sensitivity, have enhanced our ability to detect SO2 emissions from volcanoes worldwide. However, traditional fixed-threshold algorithms struggle to automatically distinguish volcanic SO2 emissions from non-volcanic sources. Additionally, accurately quantifying SO2 emissions is challenging due to their dependence on plume height, particularly when reaching high altitudes. To address these challenges, we developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that detects and quantifies volcanic SO2 emissions in near real-time. Our approach utilizes a Random Forest (RF) model, a supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, to identify volcanic SO2 emissions and integrates Cloud Top Height (CTH) data to enhance the accuracy of SO2 mass quantification during intense volcanic eruptions. This AI algorithm, fully implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), leverages data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite to automatically retrieve daily volcanic SO2 plumes and CTH. We validated the model's performance against the Radius classifier, a state-of-the-art tool, and generalized its application across various volcanoes (Etna, Villarrica, Fuego, Pacaya, and Cumbre Vieja) with differing degassing activities, SO2 emission rates, and plume geometries. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed AI approach effectively identifies and quantifies SO2 plumes emitted by different volcanoes, enabling the investigation of SO2 emission time series that reflect magma dynamics."

 Montane cloud forests (MCFs) feature frequent, wind-driven cloud bands (fog and low stratus [FLS]), providing crucial moisture to the ecosystems. Elevated temperatures may displace FLS, impacting MCFs significantly. To evaluate the consequences, quantifying FLS occurrences is vital. In this study, we employed “RANdom forest GEneRator” (Ranger), an advanced machine learning algorithm, to detect diurnal (07:00–17:00) FLS (dFLS) occurrence from 2018 to 2021 in MCFs in northeast Taiwan using 31 variables, including the visible and infrared bands of the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard Himawari-8, pixel solar azimuth and zenith angles, band differences, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and topographic attributes. We applied simple (lumping all data) and three-mode (sunrise/sunset, cloudy and clear sky) models to predict dFLS occurrence. We randomly selected 80 % of the data for model development and the rest for validation by referring to four ground dFLS observation stations across an elevation range of 1151–1811 m a.s.l with 53,358 diurnal time-lapse photographs. We found that it was possible to detect dFLS occurrence in MCFs using both simple and three-mode models regardless of the weather conditions (F1 ≥ 0.864, accuracy ≥ 0.905 and the Matthews correlation coefficient ≥ 0.786); the performance of the simple model was slightly better. The NDVI was more important than other variables in both models. This study demonstrates that Ranger may be able to detect dFLS in MCFs solely using a comprehensive array of satellite features insensitive to varying atmospheric conditions and terrain effects, permitting systematic monitoring of dFLS over vast regions."

 With rapid economic development and urban growth, Seoul experiences severe air pollution due to fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), which is detrimental to human health. Although recent studies have extensively focused on estimating daytime PM2.5 concentrations using various types of satellite data, there remains a significant lack of research on nighttime PM2.5 estimations. This study estimated nighttime PM2.5 in Seoul from December 2018 to November 2019 using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models. These models, which incorporated data on radiance, moon illumination fraction, and terrain height from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite covering all moon phases, also utilized meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). To address multicollinearity, seasonal models were developed using forward stepwise regression and variance inflation factor analysis. DNB radiance analysis indicates that the high intensity of artificial light sources in Seoul significantly reduces the impact of moonlight, leading to notable changes in the DNB radiation associated with PM2.5 concentrations. Consequently, this study estimated nighttime PM2.5 over Seoul across all moon phases. These estimates were then validated through 10-fold cross-validation. The RF model exhibited superior accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.65–0.90, compared to MLR, with R2 of 0.15–0.50, reflecting seasonal fluctuations in the model performance. The developed models can be applied to estimate reliable nighttime PM2.5 concentrations in megacities with strong artificial light sources, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from satellite observations for all moon phases. Additionally, our findings can serve as scientific data for establishing environmental policies by providing valuable insights into understanding air pollution primarily caused by PM2.5."

To shed light on the specific roles of spray-mediated sensible and latent heat fluxes, we conducted sensitivity experiments with heat flux parameterizations. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion and variation of the spray-mediated sensible heat significantly reduce model errors when compared against dropsonde data. These findings uniquely quantify the pivotal role of spray-mediated sensible heat flux in accurately predicting hurricane rapid intensification compared to previous studies. Without sea spray processes, ocean-coupled model simulations could not reproduce the steep intensification rate observed in multi-case studies of four high-impact hurricanes. This study also highlights that dropsonde data, as well as directly observed flux, is useful in minimizing uncertainty in the flux parameterization used for hurricane simulations. In this paper, we show how spray-mediated heat flux affects hurricane energetics through turbulent heat exchange and subsequent humid air inflow through primary and secondary circulations. Our findings provide new insights into the transformative role of sea spray in turbulent heat exchange that drives rapid hurricane intensification."

This drought mainly struck Yunnan Province and surrounding regions (21°–30° N, 97°–106° E), with precipitation deficit lasting for about 8 months from Oct 2022 to May 2023. The area-mean precipitation and surface soil moisture in the study region during the drought were both the lowest recorded for the same period since 1950. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) also reached its lowest level since 1950 at −2.76. Quantitative analysis shows that precipitation deficit and potential evapotranspiration (PET) increase contributed 71.36%, and 28.64% to the SPEI, respectively. Of the raw contribution of PET, 7.05% can in turn be attributed to the changes in precipitation. Using data from the CMIP6 Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP), we found that anthropogenic forcing increased the likelihood of a PET anomaly such as the one during the drought by about 133 times, with a fraction of attributable risk (FAR) of 0.99 [0.98, 1.00]. For the precipitation anomaly, we obtained a FAR of 0.26 [−1.12, 0.70], suggesting that anthropogenic forcings may have little impact. The extreme drought also increased the risk of fires, with the Fire Weather Index reaching its second-highest value since 1950 and abnormally high burned areas observed by satellites."

To analyses and map GF sites (GFs), the Daytime Approach for GF Investigation (DAFI), which is based on daytime data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat-8 satellite, has recently been developed. The GFs catalogue from the DAFI system, spanning over the years 2013–2021, represents the first worldwide GF product generated from mid-high spatial resolution data (30 m). The DAFI version 2 (v2), also including information from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2 satellites, already showed an improved capacity in the mapping of GFs over Iran and Iraq. In this work, the new catalogue arising from the porting of DAFI v2 at global scale is presented and discussed. By using a parallel workflow, based on a loop tiling scheme running in Google Earth Engine, DAFI v2 allowed us to extend the GF inventory globally up to 2023, by analyzing ∼4 million of OLI/OLI-2 (Collection 2) and MSI imagery. Results of this study show: (i) an increased DAFI v2 capacity, of about 41%, in detecting GFs compared to the previous DAFI version; (ii) a downward trend (∼4.6%) in terms of GF sites detected from 2021 to 2023. These findings demonstrated that DAFI v2, which will also include the estimates of radiative power at different spatial scales, may contribute in assessing and monitoring the GFs activities and in evaluating the effectiveness of the greenhouse gas-emission reduction strategies at global, continental, national and local scales."

We observed a stratospheric background period from 2013 to mid-2017, along with several perturbations from volcanic aerosols and wildfire-induced smoke. In summer, injected stratospheric aerosols are found to be captured by the Asian monsoon anticyclone, resulting in prolonged residence and regional transport in the mid-latitudes of East Asia. 
 This study analyzes the vertical distribution, optical properties, radiative forcing, and several perturbation events of stratospheric aerosols using observations from a ground-based polarization lidar in Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.4° E) from 2010 to 2021. The background stratospheric aerosol optical depth (sAOD) was 0.0044 ± 0.0019 at 532 nm, as calculated during a stratosphere-quiescent period from January 2013 to August 2017. In addition, several cases of volcanic aerosol and wildfire-induced smoke were observed. Volcanic aerosols from the Nabro (2011) and Raikoke (2019) eruptions (both in boreal summer) increased the sAOD to 2.9 times the background level. Tracers of smoke from the Canadian wildfire in the summer of 2017 were observed twice, at 19–21 km on 14–17 September and at 20–23 km on 28–31 October, with a plume-isolated aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 0.002–0.010 and a particle linear depolarization ratio δp of 0.14–0.18, indicating the dominance of non-aged smoke particles. During these summertime events, the injected stratospheric aerosols were captured by the large-scale Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA), confining the transport pathway to mid-latitude Asia. On 8–9 November 2020, smoke plumes originating from the California wildfire in October 2020 appeared at 16–17 km, with a mean δp of 0.13. Regarding seasonal variation, the sAOD in the cold half-year (0.0054) is 69 % larger than in the warm half-year (0.0032) due to stronger meridional transport of stratospheric aerosols from the tropics to middle latitudes. The stratospheric radiative forcing was −0.11 W m−2 during the stratosphere-quiescent period and increased to −0.31 W m−2 when volcanic aerosols were largely injected. These findings contribute to our understanding of the sources and transport patterns of stratospheric aerosols over mid-latitude Asia and serve as an important database for the validation of model outputs."

In response to nuclear war, there would be spatially uneven cooling that would result in an anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) gradient pattern. Associated with this would be an anomalous zonal vertical circulation, tending to suppress upward motion and increase vertical wind shear over all TC main development regions, largely explaining the observed TC reduction at regional and global scales. This study improves our understanding of the impact of nuclear war on the TC environment."

 Tropospheric ozone impacts health, climate, and ecosystems. Effective ozone mitigation policies are challenged by limited quantitative understanding of national versus transboundary contributions to surface ozone. This study uses a chemical transport model with a source apportionment algorithm to analyze ozone contributions across Europe from 2015 to 2017 during peak ozone season. We quantify country-level ozone production and imported ozone, distinguishing contributions from 35 European countries, neighboring countries, seas, and hemispheric influences. Results show substantial contributions from outside the 35 European countries, with hemispheric contributions playing a significant role. European contributions are crucial during high ozone episodes, especially from Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Poland, and Spain. Spain, northern Italy, and northwest France are identified as areas where national precursor reductions would be more effective in improving national air quality. Furthermore, 25 of the 35 European countries studied are net importers of cumulative ozone mass, with the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK acting as major exporters. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive air quality policies and cross-border cooperation.

 We have conducted a quantitative analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Seoul from September 2022 to June 2023, employing passive air samplers (PAS) at 25 sites and continuous monitoring at five photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS). Comparing VOCs concentrations and compositions from PAS and PAMS during the same time periods, we found that most VOCs showed no significant difference (p-value >0.05) between the methods, except for olefins, which were overestimated by 24 % in passive sampling, confirming PAS as an effective tool for assessing the spatial distribution of VOCs species over large areas. Throughout Seoul, median values of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) concentrations collected with passive samplers remained stable with a standard deviation of 1.22 ppbv, typically ranging from 11 to 13 ppbv, except for an increase during winter in the southwestern regions of the city, where intense industrial and vehicular emissions are reported in the current Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) emissions inventory. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis using the passive data revealed general consistency in the spatial distribution of area and road emissions when compared with CAPSS emission inventory, although localized discrepancies were observed. In quantitative assessments of TVOCs comparing PAS observations with emission-based models, modeled values were within 1.5 times the interquartile range of observed PAS concentrations over Seoul. However, the lack of detection of emission hotspots in southeastern Seoul in the PAS data, coupled with the omission of photochemical loss in our dispersion-only models, indicates that the current CAPSS emission inventory may significantly underestimate actual ambient VOCs levels, especially in summer."

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are the largest source of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) globally. However, the complex interactions between marine and terrestrial BVOCs remain unclear, inhibiting our in-depth understanding of the SOA formation in the coastal areas and its environmental impacts. Here, we performed smog chamber experiments with mixed α-pinene (a typical monoterpene) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS, a typical marine emission BVOC) to investigate their possible interactions and subsequent SOA formation. It is found that DMS has a non-linear effect on SOA generation: The mass concentration and yield of SOA show increasing and then decreasing trends with the increase of the initial concentration of DMS. The increasing trend can be attributed to OH regeneration from isomerization of the CH3SCH2OO radical together with acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions by the oxidation of DMS, while the decreasing trend is explained by the less contribution of isomerization reaction and the high OH reactivity that inhibits the formation of low volatility products. The results from infrared spectra and mass spectra together reveal the contribution of sulfur-containing molecules in the mixed system. Moreover, the mass spectra results indicate that acidic products generated by DMS photooxidation enhance the O:C ratio, while organosulfates are produced to contribute to the formation of mixed SOA. In addition, the trends in relative abundance of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) with C8 - C10 multiple functional groups in different mixed systems agree well with the turning point of the SOA yield. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding binary or more complex systems in the atmosphere in the coastal areas."

 The transported dust particles significantly impact global weather and climate. Previous studies focused primarily on the physical and chemical properties of dust plumes, but the interaction mechanism between these dust plumes and background dust aerosols remains unclear. We explored this issue using in-situ observation data of the East Asia dust from the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) during January 2013. We identified a dust plume originating from the Gurbantunggut Desert, which triggered a four-day dust event with an average dust concentration of 67.2 μg m−3. Notably, this dust event led to a significant increase in mass scattering efficiencies of dust, shifting from an inverted U-shape to a continuously increasing pattern with wavelength. The enhanced dust mass scattering efficiency inhibited the development of the planetary boundary layer. These changes persisted for at least two weeks after the event, primarily due to the resuspension of deposited dust particles altering the size of background dust particle. Our findings highlight the ability of dust plumes to enhance the scattering efficiency of background dust aerosols and providing new insights into the complex interactions between dust and the atmosphere."

 The precipitation structures and microphysical characteristics of predecessor rain events (PREs) over the Yangtze River Delta area and related tropical cyclones (TCs) from 2014 to 2019 were investigated using Dual-frequency Precipitation radar data from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) for drop size distributions (DSDs). Results showed that the total mean rain rate of PREs was larger than that of TCs, primarily due to higher convective and stratiform rain rates, with enhanced fractional coverage of convective rain in PREs. Examination of microphysical characteristics revealed that a greater quantity of small-sized droplets and a smaller quantity of medium- as well as large-sized droplets contributed towards PREs in comparison with TCs. The conclusion still holds when partitioning DSDs based on different precipitation rate categories. Further investigation of DSDs using gamma functions illustrated that precipitation in PREs had lower average mass-weighted diameters (Dm) and enhanced normalized number concentration (Nw) compared with TCs; partitioning precipitation into convective and stratiform components illustrated a larger Dm and lower Nw in TCs than PREs. The analysis of microphysical and thermodynamical processes using the reanalysis data indicates that relatively intense convective activity with drier conditions may be favorable to enhancing raindrop growth through collision-coalescence processes, as a result of larger Dm in TCs than PREs. The empirical relations (Z–R algorithms) applied in different rain regimes (stratiform, convective, and total PREs) revealed significant diversities, relying on weather conditions and geographical locations.Plain language summaryThe Yangtze River Delta area is an important economic belt in China. Under climate change, observed frequent occurrences of weather extremes of heavy rainfall and tropical cyclones (TCs) exert adverse effects on economic development in this region. Thus, a deep understanding of the mechanism of TCs torrential rainfall in the Yangtze River Delta area is urgently necessary. In this study, we investigated the precipitation patterns and microphysical characteristics of predecessor rain events (PREs) in the Yangtze River Delta region, and their association with TCs in the South China Sea-Western North Pacific Ocean (SCS-WNPO) area from 2014 to 2019. We found that PREs had a higher total mean precipitation rate than TCs. Further examination using gamma functions demonstrated that PREs exhibited lower average mass-weighted diameters (Dm) and higher normalized intercept parameters (Nw) than TCs. This pattern persisted when distinguishing between convective and stratiform precipitation components. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because these results provide valuable insights into the distinct precipitation characteristics of PREs and TCs in the study region and contribute to a better understanding of tropical cyclone-related rainfall patterns, and act as a scientific basis for disaster mitigation."

This has created a source of atmospheric dust, with implications for the balance of solar and thermal radiation. Simulating these effects using a dust transport model, we find that Aralkum dust adds radiative cooling effects to the surface and atmosphere on average but also adds heating events. Increases in surface pressure due to Aralkum dust strengthen the Siberian High and weaken the summer Asian heat low. 
 The Aralkum is a new desert created by the desiccation of the Aral Sea and is an efficient source of dust aerosol which perturbs the regional Central Asian radiation balance. COSMO–MUSCAT model simulations are used to quantify the direct radiative effects (DREs) of Aralkum dust, and investigate the associated perturbations to the atmospheric environment. Considering scenarios of “Past” (end of 20th century) and “Present”  (beginning of 21st century) defined by differences in surface water coverage, it is found that in the Present scenario the simulated yearly mean net surface DRE across the Aralkum is −1.34 W m−2 with a standard deviation (±) of 6.19 W m−2, of which −0.15 ± 1.19 W m−2  comes from dust emitted by the Aralkum. In the atmosphere the yearly mean DRE is −0.62 ± 2.91 W m−2, of which −0.05 ± 0.51 W m−2 is from Aralkum dust: on the yearly timescale, Aralkum dust is cooling both at the surface and in the atmosphere, due to its optically scattering properties. The daytime surface cooling effect (solar zenith angle ≲ 70–80°) outweighs the nighttime heating effect and the atmospheric daytime (solar zenith angle ≲ 60–70°) heating and nighttime cooling effects. Instantaneous Aralkum dust DREs contribute up to −116 W m−2 of surface cooling and +54 W m−2 of atmospheric heating. Aralkum dust perturbs the surface pressure in the vicinity of the Aralkum by up to +0.76 Pa on the monthly timescale, implying a strengthening of the Siberian High in winter and a weakening of the Central Asian heat low in summer. These results highlight the impacts of anthropogenic lakebed dust on regional atmospheric environments."
10.5194/acp-24-11333-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这项研究调查了印度恒河平原(IGP)地区气溶胶和气象因素对降水云和非降水云的影响。它利用MODIS和TRMM卫星数据以及NCEP/NCAR再分析资料，分析了2001年至2021年期间气溶胶光学厚度(AOD)、云特性（云顶高度、云光学厚度、有效云滴半径、云滴数浓度）以及降水率等参数。研究发现，夏季高气溶胶浓度导致不稳定条件下降水云的发生频率增加，并且气溶胶与云的相互作用对降水有显著影响，这与气溶胶的直接和间接效应有关。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星遥感数据来监测气溶胶和云的特性，并分析了它们对空气质量和降水的影响。,"['Aerosol optical depth', 'Cloud properties', 'Precipitation', 'MODIS', 'TRMM', 'Air quality', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Indo-Gangetic Plain']",Nabia Gulistan;Khan Alam;Yangang Liu,Influence of covariance of aerosol and meteorology on co-located precipitating and non-precipitating clouds over the Indo-Gangetic Plain,"This study looks at the influence of aerosol and meteorology on precipitating and non-precipitating clouds over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP).  A major finding of this study was that the high loading of aerosols led to a high occurrence of precipitating clouds under unstable conditions in summer. The study has the potential to open a new avenue for the scientific community to further explore and understand the complications of aerosol–cloud–precipitation over the complex topography of the IGP. 
 Aerosol–cloud–precipitation interaction (ACPI) plays a pivotal role in the global and regional water cycle and the earth's energy budget; however, it remains highly uncertain due to the different underlying physical mechanisms. Therefore, this study aims to systematically analyze the effects of aerosols and meteorological factors on ACPI in the co-located precipitating clouds (PCs) and non-precipitating clouds (NPCs) in winter and summer seasons by employing the long-term (2001–2021) retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) coupled with the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis-II datasets over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The results exhibit a decadal increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Lahore (5.2 %), Delhi (9 %), Kanpur (10.7 %), and Gandhi College (22.7 %) and a decrease over Karachi (−1.9 %) and Jaipur (−0.5 %). The most stable meteorology with high values of lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) is found in both seasons over Karachi. In the summer season, the occurrence frequency of clouds is high (74 %) over Gandhi College, 60 % of which are PCs. Conversely, the lowest number of PCs is found over Karachi. Similarly, in the winter season, the frequency of cloud occurrence is low over Karachi and high over Lahore and Gandhi College. The analysis of cloud top pressure (CTP) and cloud optical thickness (COT) indicates high values of cloud fraction (CF) for thick and high-level clouds over all study areas except Karachi. The microphysical properties such as cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) bear high values (CER ≳ 15 µm and CDNC ≳ 50 cm−3) for both NPCs and PCs in summer. The AOD–CER correlation is good (weak) for PCs (NPCs) in winter. Similarly, the sensitivity value of the first indirect effect (FIE) is high (ranging from 0.2 ± 0.13 to 0.3 ± 0.01 in winter and from 0.19 ± 0.03 to 0.32 ± 0.05 in summer) for PCs and low for NPCs. The sensitivity value for the second indirect effect (SIE) is relatively higher (such as 0.6 ± 0.14 in winter and 0.4 ± 0.04 in summer) than FIE. Sensitivity values of the aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) are low (i.e., −0.06 ± 0.09) for PCs in summer. Furthermore, the precipitation rate (PR) exhibits high values in the summer season, primarily due to the significant contribution from optically thick clouds with lower CDNC (≲ 50 cm−3) and larger CER and the intermediate contribution from optically thick clouds with higher CDNC ( ≳ 50 cm−3)."

The importance of understanding spatiotemporal distribution patterns and the associated driving factors that govern estuary NPP is paramount for regional carbon (C) budget assessments. Using a combined remote sensing and machine learning (ML) approach, the average NPP of the Yangtze Estuarine–offshore continuum (YEOC) was measured at 273.19 ± 21.26 mgC m–2 day–1 over the past two decades. Temporally, NPP exhibited a significant downward trend between 2002 and 2022. Climate factors (climate fluctuations, sea level rise, and discharge) drove phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) while light conditions (PAR and Kd490) affected photosynthesis rates. Together, they can explain 65% of the NPP variation. Anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., damming and nutrient emissions) were not significant. Additionally, changes in NPP decreased phytoplankton C sequestration rates from 11.9 to 10.4 Tg C year–1, reducing the estuary’s C sink capacity, which relies on biological C fixation. This study highlights the climate’s influence on the spatiotemporal transformation of YEOC NPP while enhancing our understanding of the response of EOC C budgets to climate change and anthropogenic activities."

However, in-depth and systematic studies in this area are still lacking. Novel types of amorphous CeMnx catalysts with abundant defects were prepared through simple hydrothermal synthesis and used for Cl-VOCs catalysis for the first time. Experimental characterizations and DFT calculations proved that Ce doping induced  MnO2 lattice distortion, which led to the transformation of CeMnx into an amorphous structure and the formation of abundant defect sites. It was observed that CeMn0.16 was able to eliminate chlorobenzene (CB) at 200 °C, and the CO2 yields and the selectivity of inorganic chlorine was significantly higher than that of MnO2. The 18O isotope kinetic experiments revealed that the interfacial reaction process followed the MVK mechanism. The large number of oxygen vacancies accelerated the migration of lattice oxygen from the interior to the exterior, enhancing the ability to trap gas-phase oxygen.

The carbon sink in pantropical biomes play a crucial role in modulating the inter‐annual variations of global terrestrial carbon balance and is threatened by extreme climate events. However, it has not been carefully examined whether an increase in tropical gross primary productivity (GPP) can compensate the decrease during precipitation anomalies. Using the asymmetry index (AI) and multiple GPP products, we assessed responses of pantropical GPP to precipitation anomalies during 2001–2022. Positive AI indicates that GPP increases are greater than GPP decreases during precipitation anomalies, and vice versa. Our results showed an average negative pantropical GPP asymmetry, that is, GPP decreases exceeded the GPP increases during precipitation anomalies. In addition, a positive AI was found in tropical hyper‐arid and arid regions, which is opposite to the negative AI observed in tropical semi‐arid, sub‐humid, and humid regions. This suggest that tropical GPP asymmetry changes from positive to negative as the moisture increases. Notably, a significant decreasing trend of negative AI was observed over the entire tropical region, indicating that the negative effect of inter‐annual precipitation variations on pantropical vegetation productivity has enhanced. Considering the model predicted increasing climate variability and extremes, the negative impact of precipitation variability on tropical carbon cycle may continue to intensify. Lastly, the divergence in AI estimates among multiple GPP products highlight the need to further improve our understanding of the response of tropical carbon cycle to climate changes, especially for the tropical humid regions."

 Methyl bromide (CH3Br) is an important ozone-depleting substance whose use is regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Quantifying emissions on the national scale is required to assess compliance with the Montreal Protocol and thereby ensure the timely recovery of the ozone layer. However, the spatial-temporal patterns of China’s national CH3Br emissions remain unclear. Here we estimate the national emissions of CH3Br in China during 2011−2020 using atmospheric observations at 10 sites across China combined with an inversion technique (top-down) and compare those with an updated inventory of identified emission sources (bottom-up). Measured CH3Br mole fractions are enhanced well above the background mole fractions, especially at sites in eastern China. Top-down emission estimates exceed bottom-up estimates by 5.5 ± 1.4 gigagrams per year, with the largest fraction (60%) of observationally derived CH3Br emissions arising from underestimated or unidentified emissions sources.

 In April and May 2023, Southeast Asia (SEA) encountered an exceptional heatwave. The Continental SEA was hardest hit, where all the countries broke their highest temperature records with measurements exceeding 42 °C, and Thailand set the region’s new record of 49 °C. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of this event by investigating its spatiotemporal evolution, physical mechanisms, forecast performance, return period, and extensive impacts. The enhanced high-pressure influenced by tropical waves, moisture deficiency and strong land-atmosphere coupling are considered as the key drivers to this extreme heatwave event. The ECMWF exhibited limited forecast skills for the reduced soil moisture and failed to capture the land-atmosphere coupling, leading to a severe underestimation of the heatwave’s intensity. Although the return period of this heatwave event is 129 years based on the rarity of temperature records, the combination of near-surface drying and soil moisture deficiency that triggered strong positive land-atmosphere feedback and rapid warming was extremely uncommon, with an occurrence probability of just 0.08%. These analyses underscore the exceptional nature of this unparalleled heatwave event and its underlying physical mechanisms, revealing its broad impacts, including significant health repercussions, a marked increase in wildfires, and diminished agricultural yields."

 Extreme humid heat is a major climate hazard for the coastal Arabian Peninsula. However, many of its characteristics, including diurnal and spatial variations, remain incompletely explored. Here we present evidence from multiple reanalysis and in situ datasets that evening or nighttime daily maxima in extreme wet-bulb temperature and heat index are widespread along the southern Persian/Arabian Gulf coastline and adjacent inland desert, driven principally by sea-breeze-related movements of moist maritime air. This timing runs counter to the general expectation of more intense heat and greater heat-stress risk during daytime hours. While wet-bulb temperature is one of many metrics relevant for understanding heat hazards, it has featured prominently in recent literature and its values are closer to uncompensable-heat limits in coastal Arabia than anywhere else. Deviations from an afternoon-peak assumption about heat risks are thus of critical importance and heighten the value of improved understanding of extreme-humid-heat meteorology, in this region and in others subject to similar physical processes.

 The Earth's climate is changing rapidly and unexpectedly, causing more frequent, longer and more severe droughts, with lasting impacts on plants, ecosystems, communities and people. Consequently, this is leading to an increased importance of monitoring the climate and water storage trends in different regions. This information on a global scale is already commonly derived using satellite-based geodetic techniques such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). The use of both techniques has significant advantages, especially in regions where changes in the hydrosphere are notable, such as the Amazon basin, where 25 GPS stations were lately classified as benchmarks for hydrogeodesy. We show that the vertical displacements obtained from GPS and GRACE have good spatio-temporal agreement with the Standardized Precipitation and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration indices, abbreviated respectively as SPI and SPEI, for all these stations. Drought severity index (DSI) estimated separately from GPS-observed and GRACE-derived vertical displacements on a station-by-station basis is capable to identify dry and wet events previously reported for the Amazon basin. However, due to the weaknesses of both techniques, such as technique-related systematic errors or coarse spatial resolution, a few extreme hydrological events may not be properly captured by GPS-DSI and/or GRACE-DSI. To take full advantage of both techniques and overcome their weaknesses, we introduce a completely new methodology to combine individual GPS-DSI and GRACE-DSI indices. As a novelty, both indices are estimated using short-term changes (<9 months) of monthly vertical displacements observed by GPS permanent stations and those derived by GRACE for GPS locations. Then, to capture and detect drought events that either both geodetic techniques metrics missed or incorrectly depicted, the Multivariate Drought Severity Index (MDSI) is estimated through the concept of Frank copulas. We demonstrate that the MDSI captures more hydroclimatic events reported in previous studies, which are not identified by individual series of GPS-DSI or GRACE-DSI indices, and is temporally consistent with Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) based on the in-situ river discharge changes."

 The aethalometer model (AM) is widely used for source apportionment (SA) of black carbon (BC) in regions with mixed BC sources despite being initially developed for a relatively simplistic and low-pollution environments. The present study interrogates the applicability of AM in highly polluted metropolitan environments by comparing its results with the more nuanced Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model. The measurements were conducted in Delhi during the winter and summer season. PMF apportions the BC into diverse sources by taking help from complementary trace elemental measurements, thereby acknowledging the complex pollution landscape of the Delhi region. The AM estimates BCbb (BC from biomass burning) and BCff (BC from fossil fuel combustion) contributions as 48.3% and 51.7% during the winter and 16.6% and 83.4% during the summer, respectively.In contrast, the PMF model-derived biomass burning factor is the dominant source of BC during both winter and summer seasons, contributing 53.9% and 44% of the total BC, respectively. The decrease in light absorption at UV wavelengths of biomass-burning aerosols owing to escalated ambient aging is posited to be the reason for BCbb underprediction by the AM model during summers. Furthermore, while the AM model identifies fossil fuel combustion as the only other BC source apart from biomass burning, the PMF model apportions BC to five additional sources during winter, including vehicle emissions (22.9%), Pb-rich factor (10%), power plant (5.7%), waste incineration (4%) and industrial emission (3.6%). The contribution of these BC sources during summer is vehicular emission (16.5%), power plant (14.5%), waste incineration (11.5%), Pb-rich factor (9.5%), and industrial emission (4%). Additionally, the spectral variation of the light absorption properties of black carbon (bBCabs) and brown carbon (bBrCabs), delta-C effect, and sensitivity of the AM are reported for the study period. The present study cautions that BC source apportionment can be complex in highly polluted metropolitan environments, and complementary tracer measurements are recommended for reliable results."

Planetary wave trains, stimulated over the SDP by anomalous rainfall and latent heat release, establish this teleconnection. These planetary wave trains, guided by westerly jets, then spread eastward and poleward, causing atmospheric circulation anomalies that affect Antarctic sea ice. The Antarctic sea-ice anomalies connected to the SDP are mostly consistent with abnormalities in the surface air temperature and wind fields."

The inventory is validated by a modeling study against the observations. This study enhances the understanding of anthropogenic chlorine emissions in the atmosphere, identifies key sources, and provides scientific support for pollution control and climate change. 
 Chlorine species play a crucial role as precursors to Cl radicals, which can significantly impact the atmospheric oxidation capacity and influence the levels of trace gases related to climate and air quality. Several studies have established a chlorine emission inventory in China in recent years, but the emission remains uncertain and requires further investigation. The Anthropogenic Chlorine Emission Inventory for China (ACEIC) was the first chlorine emission inventory for China based on local data developed in our previous study, which only includes the emissions from coal combustion and waste incineration. In this study, we updated this inventory to include data for a more recent year (2019) and expanded the range of species considered (HCl, fine particulate Cl−, Cl2, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl)) and the number of anthropogenic sources (41 specific sources). Compared with previous studies, this updated inventory considered more anthropogenic sources, used more localized emission factors, and adopted more refined estimation methods. The total emissions of HCl, fine particulate Cl−, Cl2, and HOCl in mainland China for the year 2019 were estimated to be 361 (−18 % to 27 %), 174 (−27 % to 59 %), 18 (−10 % to  15 %), and 79 (−12 % to 18 %) Gg, respectively. To facilitate analysis, we aggregated the chlorine emissions from various sources into five economic sectors: power, industry, residential, agriculture, and biomass burning. HCl emissions were primarily derived from the industry (43 %), biomass burning (38 %), and residential (13 %) sectors. The biomass burning and industry sectors accounted for 74 % and 19 % of the fine particulate Cl− emissions, respectively. Residential and industry sectors contributed 61 % and 29 % of the total Cl2 emissions. HOCl emissions were predominantly from the residential sector, constituting 90 % of the total emissions. Notably, the usage of chlorine-containing disinfectants was identified as the most significant source of Cl2 and HOCl emissions in the residential sector. Geographically, regions with high HCl and fine particulate Cl− emissions were found in the North China Plain, northeastern China, central China, and the Yangtze River Delta, whereas the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei regions exhibited elevated levels of Cl2 and HOCl emissions. Regarding monthly variation, emissions of HCl and fine particulate Cl− were higher during early spring (February to April) and winter (December to January) due to intensified agricultural activities, while Cl2 and HOCl emissions were higher in the summer months due to increased demand for water disinfection. We incorporated this emission inventory into the chemical transport model and found the simulated concentrations of chlorine species agreed reasonably well with the observations, which suggested the relatively faithful estimations of their emissions. This updated inventory contributes to a better understanding of anthropogenic sources of chlorine species and can aid in the formulation of emission control strategies to mitigate secondary pollution in China."

The huge urban sprawl in recent decades has led to regional human-induced air pollution in the region. Black carbon was highest in April 2021 and March 2022, exceeding the WHO limit. The monsoon season causes huge rainfall over the region, which reduces the pollutants by scavenging (rainout and washout). 
 Black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) both have a versatile nature, and they have an apparent role in climate variability and changes. As anthropogenic activity is surging, BC and BrC are also reportedly increasing. So, the monitoring of BC and BrC and observations of land use land cover change (LULCC) at a regional level are necessary for the changes in various interconnected meteorological phenomena. The current study investigates BC, BrC, CO2, BC from fossil fuels (BCff), BC from biomass burning (BCbb), and LULCC and their relationship to the corresponding meteorological conditions over Gangtok in the Sikkim Himalayan region. The concentration of BC (BrC) was found to be highest during March 2022 (April 2021) at 43.5 µg m−3 (32.0 µg m−3). Surface pressure exhibits a significant positive correlation with BC, BCff, BCbb, and BrC. Higher surface pressure results in a calmer and more stable boundary layer, which effectively retains deposited contaminants. Conversely, the wind appears to facilitate the dispersion of pollutants, showing a strong negative correlation. The fact that all pollutants and precipitation have been shown to behave similarly points to moist scavenging of the pollutants. Despite the dense cloud cover, it is clear that the area is not receiving convective precipitation, implying that orographic precipitation is occurring over the region. Most of Sikkim receives convective rain from May to September, indicating that the region has significant convective activity contributed from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon season. Furthermore, monsoon months have the lowest concentrations of BC, BCbb, BCff, and BrC, suggesting the potential of convective rain (as rainout scavenging) to remove most of the pollutants."

Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (AOD), coupled with a simulated PM2.5–AOD relationship (η), can provide global PM2.5 estimations. This study aims to understand the spatial patterns and driving factors of η to guide future measurement and modeling efforts. We quantified η globally and regionally and found that its spatial variation is strongly influenced by aerosol composition. 
 Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the leading global environmental determinant of mortality. However, large gaps exist in ground-based PM2.5 monitoring. Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (AOD) offers information to help fill these gaps worldwide when augmented with a modeled PM2.5–AOD relationship. This study aims to understand the spatial pattern and driving factors of this relationship by examining η (PM2.5AOD) using both observations and modeling. A global observational estimate of η for the year 2019 is inferred from 6870 ground-based PM2.5 measurement sites and satellite-retrieved AOD. The global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, in its high-performance configuration (GCHP), is used to interpret the observed spatial pattern of annual mean η. Measurements and the GCHP simulation consistently identify a global population-weighted mean η value of 96–98 µg m−3, with regional values ranging from 59.8 µg m−3 in North America to more than 190 µg m−3 in Africa. The highest η value is found in arid regions, where aerosols are less hygroscopic due to mineral dust, followed by regions strongly influenced by surface aerosol sources. Relatively low η values are found over regions distant from strong aerosol sources. The spatial correlation of observed η values with meteorological fields, aerosol vertical profiles, and aerosol chemical composition reveals that spatial variation in η is strongly influenced by aerosol composition and aerosol vertical profiles. Sensitivity tests with globally uniform parameters quantify the effects of aerosol composition and aerosol vertical profiles on spatial variability in η, exhibiting a population-weighted mean difference in aerosol composition of 12.3 µg m−3, which reflects the determinant effects of composition on aerosol hygroscopicity and aerosol optical properties, and a population-weighted mean difference in the aerosol vertical profile of 8.4 µg m−3, which reflects spatial variation in the column–surface relationship."

Rendón,Long-range transport of air pollutants increases the concentration of hazardous components of PM2.5 in northern South America,"In the Aburrá Valley, northern South America, local emissions determine air quality conditions. However, we found that external sources, such as regional fires, Saharan dust, and volcanic emissions, increase particulate concentrations and worsen chemical composition by introducing elements like heavy metals. Dry winds and source variability contribute to seasonal influences on these events. This study assesses the air quality risks posed by such events, which can affect broad regions worldwide. 
 Long-range transport (LRT) of air pollutants from a range of sources can substantially enhance background pollution levels, especially in urbanized regions, which can exacerbate high-pollution episodes. In the Aburrá Valley (AV), Colombia, and other cities in northern South America, biomass burning (BB), dust, and volcanic degassing have been identified as sources of long-range aerosol transport. However, the impact of these sources on air quality and the characterization of these sources have yet to be thoroughly studied. This work investigates the influence of these sources on the chemical composition of PM2.5 during annual and intra-annual high-load aerosol events in the AV. We identified, tracked, and meteorologically characterized LRT events and evaluated their influence on PM2.5 concentration and chemical composition. We found that the LRT of aerosols from BB, dust, and volcanic degassing influenced approximately 13 %, 8 %, and 13 % of days in the year, respectively. We applied the positive-matrix-factorization (PMF) statistical model to quantify PM2.5 concentrations and chemical compositions for the different LRT event types (e.g., BB). For BB events, we identified large contributions from organic carbon (OC1 and OC2), F−, and secondary aerosol tracers (SO42- and NO3-). For dust LRT events, crustal mineral components, along with Ti and Ca, were the primary contributors to aerosol composition, while SO42-, Na, Al, and Ca were the primary contributors during volcanic events. The concentrations of some ions and toxic heavy metals (Cr, Mn, Cd, and Ni) were also elevated during BB and volcanic-degassing events. BB contributed the most to PM2.5 levels during the LRT events (∼11 µg m−3), while contributions from aerosols arising from dust and volcanic events were also substantial (<7 µg m−3). Our study identifies the Orinoco and the Middle Magdalena Valley as sizable sources of BB aerosols and Nevado del Ruiz as a source of volcanic aerosols. Additionally, we found that African dust reached the Andean region via the Caribbean route. As a result, we identify the need for future chemical-transport modeling studies in the region and new support strategies to manage internal and external pollution sources that degrade air quality in the AV and the surrounding region."

The findings are helpful for inlet users and are expected to aid in developing improved inlets. 
 Chemical ionisation inlets are fundamental instrument components in chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS). However, the sample gas and reagent ion trajectories are often understood only in a general and qualitative manner. Here, we evaluate two atmospheric pressure interface chemical ionisation inlets (MION2 and Eisele type inlet) with 3D computational fluid dynamics physicochemical models regarding the reagent ion and sample gas trajectories and estimate their efficiencies of reagent ion production, reagent ion delivery from the ion source volume into the ion–molecule mixing region, and the interaction between reagent ions and target molecules. The models are validated by laboratory measurements and quantitatively reproduce observed sensitivities to tuning parameters, including ion currents and changes in mass spectra. The study elucidates how the different transport and chemical reactions proceed within the studied inlets, where space charge can already be relevant at ion concentrations as low as 107 cm−3, and compares the two investigated inlet models. The models provide insights into how to operate the inlets and will help in the development of future inlets that further enhance the capability of CIMS."

 Ground level ozone (O3) is a highly oxidising gas with very reactive properties, harmful at high levels, generated by complex photochemical reactions when ""primary"" pollutants from combustion of fossil materials react with sunlight. Thus, its concentration serves as an indicator of the activity of other air pollutants and plays a key role in Air Quality monitoring systems in smart cities. To increase its spatial sampling resolution over the city map, ozone low cost sensors are an interesting alternative, but they have a lack of accuracy. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques, in particular ensemble machine learning methods, can improve the raw readings from these sensors taking into account additional environmental information. In this paper, we analyse, propose and compare different techniques, reducing the estimation error in around 94 %, achieving the best results using the Gradient Boosting algorithm and outperforming the related work using sensor approximately 10 times less expensive."

However, knowledge on the actual distribution of humidity concentrations is sparse – mainly due to technological limitations. With the herein presented lidar, it is possible to measure humidity concentrations and their vertical fluxes up to altitudes of >3 km with high spatio-temporal resolution, opening new possibilities for detailed process understanding and, ultimately, better model representation. 
 High-resolution measurements of water vapor concentrations and their transport throughout the turbulent planetary boundary layer (PBL) and beyond are key for an enhanced understanding of atmospheric processes. Therefore, data from the mobile atmospheric monitoring system (ATMONSYS) differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is presented for the first time. The ATMONSYS DIAL has been developed with the goal of resolving turbulence throughout the PBL at a sampling frequency of 10 s and vertical resolutions of less than 200 m. General measuring capabilities during high-noon, clear-sky, summer conditions with a maximum vertical measurement range of >3 km and statistical uncertainties of <5 % are demonstrated. The analysis of turbulence spectra shows an overall good agreement with Kolmogorov's law, demonstrating its general capability of resolving turbulence, although deviations to the Kolmogorov behaviour can be observed at certain frequency ranges. By the combination of the ATMONSYS DIAL with an adjacent high-quality Doppler wind lidar, some of those deviations are evaded in the co-spectra due to independent noise of both instruments. However, the intermediate deviations from the expected Kolmogorov behavior in the co-spectra persist. Under consideration of the surrounding landscape, an impact of present surface heterogeneities on those intermediate frequency deviations seems plausible. Agreement of the co-spectra with Kolmogorov's law at the highest frequencies reveals that the ATMONSYS DIAL is capable to resolve turbulent latent energy fluxes down to the measurement's Nyquist frequency of 5 · 10-2 Hz. A system cross-intercomparison of the ATMONSYS DIAL with two adjacent water vapor Raman lidars and radiosondes shows good agreement between all sensors, despite minor DIAL deficiencies under certain conditions with shreded clouds surpassing the lidar. Observed profile-to-profile DIAL fluctuations and sensor-to-sensor deviations, in combination with low statistical uncertainty, show the advantage of humidity lidars, such as the ATMONSYS DIAL, to capture both short-term and small-scale dynamics of the lowermost atmosphere."

The long-term and high-quality UV dataset could further facilitate health-related research in the future. 
 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is closely related to health; however, limited measurements have hindered further investigation of its health effects in China. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used to predict environmental factors with high accuracy, but a limited number of studies have implemented it for UV radiation. The main aim of this study is to develop a UV radiation prediction model using the random forest approach and predict the UV radiation with a daily and 10 km resolution in mainland China from 2005 to 2020. The model was developed with multiple predictors, such as UV radiation data from satellites as independent variables and ground UV radiation measurements from monitoring stations as the dependent variable. Missing satellite-based UV radiation data were obtained using the 3 d moving average method. The model performance was evaluated using multiple cross-validation (CV) methods. The overall R2 and root mean square error between measured and predicted UV radiation from model development and model 10-fold CV were 0.97 and 15.64 W m−2 and 0.83 and 37.44 W m−2 at the daily level, respectively. The model that incorporated erythemal daily dose (EDD) retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) had a higher prediction accuracy than that without it. Based on predictions of UV radiation at the daily level, 10 km spatial resolution, and nearly 100 % spatiotemporal coverage, we found that UV radiation increased by 4.20 %, PM2.5 levels decreased by 48.51 %, and O3 levels increased by 22.70 % from 2013–2020, suggesting a potential correlation among these environmental factors. The uneven spatial distribution of UV radiation was associated with factors such as latitude, elevation, meteorological factors, and season. The eastern areas of China pose a higher risk due to both high population density and high UV radiation intensity. Using a machine learning algorithm, this study generated a gridded UV radiation dataset with extensive spatiotemporal coverage, which can be utilized for future health-related research.

However, different methods for classifying these areas could lead to inconsistencies in environmental exposure and health studies, which are often overlooked. We constructed different urban/rural classification systems based on multiple population-based (e.g., total population, population density, and commuting) and built-environment-based (e.g., nighttime light intensity, building density, road density, distance to urban centers, point of interest density, and urban area coverage) indicators and various classification schemes. These classification systems were applied to Virginia and West Virginia, United States. We compared differences in urban/rural spatial patterns, demographic compositions, and exposures of particulate matter (PM2.5), greenspace, and land surface temperature using these urban/rural classification systems to understand their impacts on environmental exposure and health research. Our findings reveal clear differences in spatial patterns and demographic compositions across various systems. We also observed that different systems can lead to changes in the magnitude and direction of urban/rural disparities in environmental exposure assessment. Addressing the complexities in delineating urbanicity and rurality may include careful consideration of classification systems to reflect those aspects of urbanicity and rurality that are relevant to the research question or the use of multiple, complementary systems."

For ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), we compare the air quality monitoring data with spatially complete concentrations derived from empirical models to quantify the gaps in existing U.S. monitoring networks in capturing concentration hotspots and exposure disparities. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted a more stringent annual-average air quality standard for PM2.5 (9 μg/m3). Here, we demonstrate that 44% of urban areas exceeding this new standard─encompassing ∼20 million people─would remain undetected because of gaps in the current PM2.5 monitoring network. Crucially, we find that “uncaptured” hotspots, which contain 2.8 million people in census tracts that are misclassified as in attainment of the new PM2.5 standard, have substantially higher percentages of minority populations (i.e., people of color, disadvantaged communities, and low-income populations) compared with the overall U.S. population. To address these gaps, we highlight 10 priority locations that could reduce the population in the uncaptured hotspots by 67%.

In this project, we use a combination of aircraft remote sensing (i.e., GCAS), source apportionment models (i.e., CAMx), and regression models to investigate NOx emissions from individual source-sectors in Houston, TX. In prior work, GCAS column NO2 was shown to be close to the “truth” for validating column NO2 in model simulations. Column NO2 from CAMx was substantially low biased compared to Pandora (−20%) and GCAS measurements (−31%), suggesting an underestimate of local NOx emissions. We applied a flux divergence method to the GCAS and CAMx data to distinguish the linear shape of major highways and identify NO2 underestimates at highway locations. Using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, we isolated on-road, railyard, and “other” NOx emissions as the likeliest cause of this low bias, and simultaneously identified a potential overestimate of shipping NOx emissions. Based on the MLR, we modified on-road and shipping NOx emissions in a new CAMx simulation and increased the background NO2, and better agreement was found with GCAS measurements: bias improved from −31% to −10% and r2 improved from 0.78 to 0.80. This study outlines how remote sensing data, including fine spatial information from newer geostationary instruments, can be used in concert with chemical transport models to provide actionable information for air quality managers to identify further opportunities to reduce NOx emissions."

We show that the portion of global land experiencing drought‐conditioned heat anomalies more than tripled in less than 3 decades. However, using such traditional heat waves indicators, the level of spatial coupling between heat waves and drought seems to decline.

Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are of great concern due to their impact on human health and the environment. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used for surface NO2 estimation with rapid developments in computational power and big data. However, the uncertainties inherent to such retrievals are rarely studied. In this study, a novel ML framework has been developed, enhanced with uncertainty quantification techniques, to estimate surface NO2 and provide corresponding data‐induced uncertainty. We apply the Boosting Ensemble Conformal Quantile Estimator (BEnCQE) model to infer surface NO2 concentrations over Western Europe at the daily scale and 1 km spatial resolution from May 2018 to December 2021. High NO2 mainly appears in urban areas, industrial areas, and roads. The space‐based cross‐validation shows that our model achieves accurate point estimates (r = 0.8, R2 = 0.64, root mean square error = 8.08 μg/m3) and reliable prediction intervals (coverage probability, PI‐50%: 51.0%, PI‐90%: 90.5%). Also, the model result agrees with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model. The quantile regression in our model enables us to understand the importance of predictors for different NO2 level estimations. Additionally, the uncertainty information reveals the extra potential exceedance of the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 limit in some locations, which is undetectable by only point estimates. Meanwhile, the uncertainty quantification allows assessment of the model's robustness outside existing in‐situ station measurements. It reveals challenges of NO2 estimation over urban and mountainous areas where NO2 is highly variable and heterogeneously distributed."

 Terrestrial photosynthesis, or gross primary production (GPP), is the largest carbon flux in the biosphere, but its global magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics remain uncertain1. The global annual mean GPP is historically thought to be around 120 PgC yr−1 (refs. 2–6), which is about 30–50 PgC yr−1 lower than GPP inferred from the oxygen-18 (18O) isotope7 and soil respiration8. This disparity is a source of uncertainty in predicting climate–carbon cycle feedbacks9,10. Here we infer GPP from carbonyl sulfide, an innovative tracer for CO2 diffusion from ambient air to leaf chloroplasts through stomata and mesophyll layers. We demonstrate that explicitly representing mesophyll diffusion is important for accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants. From the estimate of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants, we infer a global contemporary GPP of 157 (±8.5) PgC yr−1, which is consistent with estimates from 18O (150–175 PgC yr−1) and soil respiration (

This difference predominantly occurs in the pan-tropical rainforests and is corroborated by ground measurements11, suggesting a more productive tropics than satellite-based GPP products indicated. As GPP is a primary determinant of terrestrial carbon sinks and may shape climate trajectories9,10, our findings lay a physiological foundation on which the understanding and prediction of carbon–climate feedbacks can be advanced.

Our ML-based summer MJO prediction model shows a correlation skill of 0.5 at about 24-day forecast lead time. By utilizing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we discern Precipitable Water (PW) and Surface Temperature (TS) as the most influential sources for the summer MJO predictability. We especially identify the roles of PW and TS in the eastern and northern Indian Ocean (EIO and NIO) regions on the propagation characteristics of the summer MJO through XAI-based sensitivity experiments. These results suggest that ML-based approaches are useful for identifying sources of predictability and their roles in climate phenomena."

 Marine phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a concentration are often estimated from pigment fluorescence measurements, which have become routine despite known variability in the fluorescent response for a given amount of chlorophyll-a. Here, we present a near-global, monthly climatology of chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements from profiling floats combined with ocean color satellite estimates of chlorophyll-a concentration to illuminate seasonal biases in the fluorescent response and expand upon previously observed regional patterns in this bias. Global biases span over an order of magnitude, and can vary seasonally by a factor of 10. An independent estimate of chlorophyll-a from light attenuation shows similar global patterns in the chlorophyll-fluorescence bias when compared to biases derived from satellite estimates. Without accounting for these biases, studies or models using fluorescence-estimated chlorophyll-a will inherit the seasonal and regional biases described here.

 The terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its successor, the GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite, presents a remarkable opportunity for extreme weather detection and the enhancement of environmental protection. However, the practical utility of GRACE data is challenged by an 11-month data gap and several months of missing data. To address this limitation, we have developed an innovative transformer-based deep learning model for data gap-filling. This model incorporates a self-attention mechanism using causal convolution, allowing the neural network to capture the local context of GRACE time series data. It takes into account various factors such as temperature (T), precipitation (P), and evapotranspiration (ET). We trained the model using a global dataset of 10,000 time series pixels and applied it to fill all the time gaps. The validation results demonstrate its robustness, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.18 cm and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.906. Notably, the Transformer-based method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in arid regions. The incorporation of T, P, and ET has further enhanced the accuracy of gap filling, with an average RMSE decrease of 7.5 %. This study has produced a reliable gap-filling product that addresses 11-month data gaps and 24 isolated gaps, ensuring the continuity of GRACE data for various scholarly applications. Moreover, our Transformer approach holds important potential for surpassing traditional methods in predicting and filling gaps in remote sensing data and gridded observations."

 The Iberian Peninsula (IP), where this study is conducted, has experienced an increase of the frequency and intensity of Saharan aerosol dust outbreaks over the latest decades, which may have an impact on its regional climate. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-chem) has been used worldwide to simulate dust outbreaks and can support the analysis of such potential impacts. However, it includes multiple alternative aerosol parameterization choices that have not been conveniently evaluated in the study region yet. Here, three of the most popular WRF-chem aerosol parameterization schemes, namely, the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) and the Modal Aerosol Dynamics Model for Europe (MADE) schemes, are inter-compared during a strong and dry dust outbreak on July 2021 in southern IP. The results show that the three schemes predict qualitatively similar dust intrusion patterns that are consistent with ground observations and have inter-model dust loading differences smaller than 4%. However, their average dust size distributions differ notably. While GOCART is reasonably consistent with observations, MOSAIC underpredicts the amount of dust particles with sub-micron diameters and overpredicts that of large particles and MADE does the opposite. This is found to have a strong detrimental impact on the prediction performance of dust optical properties in MOSAIC and MADE, which is related, at least partially, with issues in the required inter-sectional redistribution of dust parameters during the dust emission and calculation of optical properties. Overall, GOCART generally appears a better choice for strong and dry dust outbreak events in southern IP. It remains to be evaluated during wet dust outbreaks, which is a work underway."

We explore sequential humid heat and rainfall relationships during the local summer season, identifying two classes of temporal relationships. We find that high wet bulb temperature (WBT) anomalies in most mid- to high-latitude and tropical regions are preceded by anomalously low precipitation.

High WBT events are followed by positive precipitation anomalies in many land regions."

This study reassesses the spatiotemporal variations in the frequency and persistence indices of extreme precipitation from 2001 to 2019 across thirteen widely used precipitation datasets. We quantify the inter-product biases using common accuracy indices based on reference data, derived from a national observation network of over 2400 stations. Regarding the duration of extreme precipitation, represented by consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD), gauge-based datasets generally demonstrate better accuracy. Satellite retrieval datasets tend to overestimate CDD (4.58%) and CWD (60.50%) at continental scale. Meanwhile, reanalysis and fusion datasets tend to underestimate CDD (−30.27% and −15.39%, respectively) and overestimate CWD (148.44% and 93.41%, respectively). In terms of frequency indices, represented by the number of heavy precipitation days (R10MM) and the number of very heavy precipitation days (R20MM), gauge-based, satellite retrieval, and fusion datasets show weak biases in R10MM (all below 3.5%), while reanalysis datasets indicate substantial overestimation (33.62%). In the case of R20MM, there is an improvement in the performance of reanalysis datasets, while the performance of other datasets declines. However, almost all datasets fail to consistently capture variations in the Tibetan Plateau and Xinjiang regions, where gauge stations are limited and terrain is complex. Furthermore, multiple datasets present significant discrepancies in temporal trends from 2001 to 2019. Remote sensing datasets tend to overestimate CDD, while reanalysis datasets generally show persistent underestimation of CDD and persistent overestimation of other indices. This research contributes to guiding the application and improvement of global precipitation datasets in extreme precipitation studies."

The magnitude of CO sources and the fraction of fossil vs biogenic sources are still uncertain and vary across emissions inventories. Measurements of radiocarbon (14C) in CO could potentially be used to investigate the sources of CO on a regional scale because fossil sources lack 14C and reduce the 14C/C ratio (Δ14C) of atmospheric CO more than biogenic sources. We use regional Lagrangian model simulations to investigate the utility of Δ14CO measurements for estimating the fossil fraction of CO emissions and evaluating bottom-up emissions estimates (United Kingdom Greenhouse Gas, UKGHG, and TNO Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, TNO) in London, UK. Due to the high Δ14CO in atmospheric CO from cosmogenic production, both fossil and biogenic CO emissions cause large reductions in Δ14CO regionally, with larger reductions for fossil than biogenic CO per ppb added. There is a strong seasonal variation in Δ14CO in background air and in the sensitivity of Δ14CO to fossil and biogenic emissions of CO. In the UK, the CO emissions estimate from TNO has a higher fraction from fossil fuels than UKGHG (72% vs 67%). This results in larger simulated decreases in Δ14C per ppb CO for TNO emissions. The simulated differences between UKGHG and TNO are likely to be easily detectable by current measurement precision, suggesting that Δ14CO measurements could be an effective tool to understand regional CO sources and assess bottom-up emissions estimates."

Here, using projections from ten Earth system models, we found divergent trends in the relationship between global land greening and C storage among three distinct shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We identified global transition times for their positive relationships, which will occur in 2034, 2038, and 2048 for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. We found a widespread decoupling trend of vegetation greening and ecosystem C storage under medium to high emission scenarios, particularly in the tundra, boreal forest, and grassland regions, by delving deeper into six transition modes. These findings underscore the highly uncertain role of vegetation greening in land C sequestration under prospective climate change scenarios."

However, recent studies warn of the adverse impacts of deforestation and climate variability, which are causing a decrease in rainfall and a delay in the rainy season onset. These changes pose significant threats to both ecosystems and intensive agriculture. To assess these threats, we compared past and present rainfall and rainy season duration in MT and conducted robust climate projections using climate simulations forced by realistic deforestation scenarios. Our analysis of observed rainfall data from the past four decades and Community Earth System Model simulations affirmed a worrying trend of decreasing rainfall volumes, delayed rainy season onset, and shorter rainy season length. Climate projections indicate that this pattern will intensify, with onsets expected in late October and rainy season durations shorter than 200 d by mid-century. These findings underscore the potential impact on MT’s double-cropping system, a cornerstone of the region’s agricultural success, and emphasize the urgent need for sustainable large-scale agricultural practices and strategic interventions by regional decision-makers to mitigate agricultural losses and ecosystem degradation."

Using molecular spectroscopy, we showed that ammonium-promoted aqueous replacement reaction, unique to these aerosols, is closely linked to phase behavior. The interplay between reactions and aerosol phase state can cause atypical phase transition and irreversible changes in aerosol composition during hygroscopic cycles, further impacting atmospheric processes. 
 Atmospheric secondary aerosols are often internally mixed with organic and inorganic components, particularly dicarboxylic acids, ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. These complex compositions enable aqueous reaction between organic and inorganic species, significantly complicating aerosol phase behavior during aging and making phase predictions challenging. We investigated carboxylate–ammonium salt mixtures using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The mono-, di-, and tricarboxylates included sodium pyruvate (SP), sodium tartrate (ST), and sodium citrate (SC), while the ammonium salts included NH4NO3, NH4Cl, and (NH4)2SO4. Our results demonstrated that aqueous replacement reactions between carboxylates and ammonium salts were promoted by the formation and depletion of NH3 as relative humidity (RH) changed. For SP/ammonium aerosols, NaNO3 and Na2SO4 crystallized from 35.7 % to 12.7 % and from 65.7 % to 60.1 % RH, respectively, which is lower than the values for pure inorganics (62.5 ± 9 %–32 % RH for NaNO3 and 82 ± 7 %–68 ± 5 % RH for Na2SO4). Upon hydration, the crystalline Na2SO4 and NaNO3 deliquesced at 88.8 %–95.2 % and 76.5 ± 2 %–81.9 %, which is higher than the values of pure Na2SO4 (74 ± 4 %–98 % RH) and NaNO3 (65 %–77.1 ± 3 % RH). In contrast, reaction between ST or SC and (NH4)2SO4 was incomplete due to the gel structure at low RH. Unexpectedly, aqueous Na2SO4 crystallized upon humidification in ST/(NH4)2SO4 particles at 43.6 % RH and then deliquesced with increasing RH. This is attributed to increased ion mobility in viscous particles, leading to nucleation and growth of Na2SO4 crystals. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between chemical components within organic/inorganic aerosol and the impact of replacement reactions on aerosol aging, phase state, and subsequently atmospheric processes."

 This study investigates the chemical composition and physical properties of aerosols, which play a crucial role in influencing human health, cloud physics, and local climate. Our focus centers on the hygroscopicity of ambient aerosols, a key property reflecting the ability to take up moisture from the atmosphere and serve as cloud condensation nuclei. Employing home-built air quality box (AQB) systems equipped with low-cost sensors, we assess the ambient variability of particulate matter (PM) concentrations to determine PM hygroscopicity. The AQB systems effectively captured meteorological parameters and most pollutant concentrations, showing high correlations with data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TW-EPA). With the application of κ-Köhler equation and certain assumptions, AQB-monitored PM concentrations are converted to dry particle mass concentration, providing optical particle counter sensitivity correction and resulting in improved correlation with TW-EPA data. The derived single hygroscopicity parameters (κ) range from 0.15 to 0.29 for integrated fine particles (PM2.5) and 0.05 to 0.13 for coarse particles (PM2.5−10), consistent with results of ionic chromatography analysis from a previous winter campaign nearby. Moreover, the analysis of PM10 division into PM2.5 and PM2.5−10, considering composition heterogeneity, provided improved dry PM10 concentration as the sensitivity coefficients for PM2.5−10 were notably higher than for PM2.5. Our methodology provides a comprehensive approach to assess ambient aerosol hygroscopicity, with significant implications for atmospheric modeling, particularly in evaluating aerosol efficiency as cloud condensation nuclei and in radiative transfer calculations. Overall, the AQB systems proved to be effective in monitoring air quality and deriving key aerosol properties, contributing valuable insights into atmospheric science."

We highlight the benefits of dense network observations and a cloud-regime-resolved approach in validating GHI retrievals. 
 Accurate and detailed retrieval of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) has many benefits, for instance, in support of the energy transition towards an energy supply with a high share of renewable energy sources and for validating high-resolution weather and climate models. In this study, we apply a downscaling algorithm that combines the high-resolution visible and standard-resolution channels on board the Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) to obtain  cloud physical properties and GHI at an increased nadir spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km instead of 3 km × 3 km. We validate the change in accuracy of the high-resolution GHI in comparison to the standard-resolution product against ground-based observations from a unique network of 99 pyranometers deployed during the HOPE field campaign in Jülich, Germany, from 18 April to 22 July 2013. Over the entire duration of the field campaign, a small but statistically significant reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8 W m−2 is found for the high-resolution GHI at a 5 min scale. The added value of the increased spatial resolution is largest on days when GHI fluctuates strongly: for the 10 most variable days a significant reduction in the RMSE of 7.9 W m−2 is obtained with high- versus standard-resolution retrievals. In contrast, we do not find significant differences between both resolutions for clear-sky and fully overcast days. The sensitivity of these results to temporal- and spatial-averaging scales is studied in detail. Our findings highlight the benefits of spatially dense network observations as well as a cloud-regime-resolved approach for the validation of GHI retrievals. We also conclude that more research is needed to optimally exploit the instrumental capabilities of current advanced geostationary satellites in terms of spatial resolution for GHI retrieval."

We have developed the GIEMS-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC) dataset to represent the dynamics of wetland extent on a global scale (0.25°x0.25° resolution, monthly time step). This updated resource combines satellite data and existing wetland databases, covering 1992 to 2020. Consistent maps of other methane-emitting surface waters (lakes, rivers, reservoirs, rice paddies) are also provided. 
 The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) database first published in 2001 (Prigent et al., 2001) was a key advance toward the accurate representation of wetlands globally by providing dynamic time series of global surface water based on passive microwave observations. This study supplements the second version of GIEMS (GIEMS-2) with other datasets to produce GIEMS-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC), a dynamically mapped dataset of methane-emitting waterlogged and inundated ecosystems. We separated open water from wetlands in GIEMS-MC by using the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database version 2 (GLWDv2), while adding unsaturated peatland areas undetected by GIEMS-2. Rice paddies are identified using the Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas (MIRCA2000) product. A specific coastal zone filtering is applied to avoid ocean artifacts while preserving coastal wetlands. GIEMS-MC covers the period 1992–2020 on a monthly scale at 0.25°x0.25° spatial resolution. The GIEMS-MC product includes two layers of monthly wetland time series – one for flooded and saturated wetlands and another for all wetlands and peatlands – together with seven layers of compatible static maps of open water bodies (lakes, rivers, reservoirs) and seasonal rice paddy maps used in its production. The dominant vegetation and wetland types per pixel are also provided in GIEMS-MC variables. GIEMS-MC is compared to Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modelling (WAD2M), a dataset providing dynamic wetland information. In terms of wetland extent, GIEMS-MC all wetlands and peatlands and WAD2M show similar results, with a mean annual maximum of 7.8 Mkm2 for GIEMS-MC and 6.8 Mkm2 for WAD2M, and similar spatial patterns in most regions. The GIEMS-MC seamless time series represents a significant advance in wetland representation for methane modelling, although limitations remain in the accurate identification of rice, coastal and peatland areas.

Zhang;Bin Wang,Light Precipitation rather than Total Precipitation Determines Aerosol Wet Removal,"Precipitation scavenging is an important sink for both organic and inorganic pollutants in the atmosphere. However, there has been controversy over the relative importance of different precipitation characteristics (i.e., the precipitation amount, intensity, frequency, and duration) in the removal of air pollutants. It is critical to reach a consensus on which precipitation characteristics are most significant for aerosol wet removal. In this study, the analysis of multisource in situ observations of aerosol wet deposition worldwide indicates that the precipitation frequency plays a first-order role in scavenging aerosols. This is because large amounts of air pollutants are efficiently removed at precipitation initiation. As the duration and amount of precipitation increase, the scavenging efficiency decreases sharply. Consequently, it is featured that light precipitation, due to its high frequency of occurrence, rather than total precipitation, determines climatological aerosol wet deposition. To further confirm this, a state-of-the-art global climate model with convection resolved is modified to reduce the light precipitation frequency in both stratiform and convective cloud regimes. Results show widespread increases in aerosol optical depth (AOD) due to the reduced wet deposition. The spatial distribution of aerosol wet deposition changes resembles that of changes in the light precipitation frequency rather than that of total precipitation changes. These findings are consistent with those from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 multimodel simulations, which show that the intermodel uncertainty in simulated AOD correlates more strongly with the uncertainty in light precipitation frequency than with that in total precipitation."

In this study, we aimed to develop an ensemble machine learning method to estimate PM10-2.5 concentrations in mainland China during 2013–2020. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, we developed two methods: the indirect method refers to developing models for PM2.5 and PM10 separately and subsequently calculating PM10-2.5 as the difference between them; and the direct method refers to establishing a model between PM10-2.5 measurements and relevant predictors directly. In the second stage, we employed an ensemble method by integrating predictions from both indirect and direct methods. Internal and external cross-validation (CV) were performed to validate the extrapolation capacity of models. The ensemble method demonstrated enhanced extrapolation accuracy in both internal and external CV compared to indirect and direct methods. The predictions produced by the ensemble method captured the spatiotemporal pattern of PM10-2.5, even in the sand and dust storm seasons. Our study introduces an ensemble strategy leveraging the strengths of both indirect and direct methods to estimate PM10-2.5 concentrations, which holds significant potential to support future epidemiological studies to address knowledge gaps in understanding the health effects of PM10-2.5."

In these regions, vehicular emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO + NO2) modulate the oxidative fate of isoprene, a biogenic precursor of the harmful air pollutants ozone, formaldehyde, and particulate matter (PM2.5). Here, we investigate the direct and indirect influence of the end-use emissions on ambient air quality. To do so, we use the GEOS-Chem model with focus on the eastern United States (US) in summer. Regional mean end-use NOx of 1.4 ppb suppresses isoprene secondary organic aerosol (OA) formation by just 0.02 μg m–3 and enhances abundance of the carcinogen formaldehyde by 0.3 ppb. Formation of other reactive oxygenated volatile organic compounds is also enhanced, contributing to end-use maximum daily mean 8-h ozone (MDA8 O3) of 8 ppb.

In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of OA produced through the 600 °C pyrolysis of ten urban materials in nitrogen, which were subsequently aged under UV light for 2 h. The analysis utilized ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) separation, coupled with a photodiode array (PDA) detector and a high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) for molecular characterization. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that lumber-derived OA was the most diverse and distinct in composition. Unaged and aged OA (for each urban material) did not significantly differ in chemical identities. Potential aromatic brown carbon (BrC) chromophores (based on their degree of unsaturation) constituted 13–42% of all assigned compounds. PDA chromatograms revealed multiple BrC chromophoric species that were either enhanced or degraded as a result of UV aging, providing insights into specific BrC chromophores responsible for photobleaching and photoenhancement of the overall absorption coefficient. Thirty-six BrC chromophores were identified across the ten OA types, and their structures were confirmed using reference standards. Components of plasticizers and resins, such as phthalic and terephthalic acids, were structurally confirmed in the samples. We present potential species for WUI fires as components of resins, epoxies, dyes, and adhesives commonly used in manufacturing urban materials.

Wall,"Adjustments to Climate Perturbations—Mechanisms, Implications, Observational Constraints","Since the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5) an extended concept of the energetic analysis of climate change including forcings, feedbacks and adjustment processes has become widely adopted. Adjustments are defined as processes that occur in response to the introduction of a climate forcing agent, but that are independent of global‐mean surface temperature changes. Most considered are the adjustments that impact the Earth energy budget and strengthen or weaken the instantaneous radiative forcing due to the forcing agent. Some adjustment mechanisms also impact other aspects of climate not related to the Earth radiation budget. Since AR5 and a following description by Sherwood et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1175/bams‐d‐13‐00167.1), much research on adjustments has been performed and is reviewed here. We classify the adjustment mechanisms into six main categories, and discuss methods of quantifying these adjustments in terms of their potentials, shortcomings and practicality. We furthermore describe aspects of adjustments that act beyond the energetic framework, and we propose new ideas to observe adjustments or to make use of observations to constrain their representation in models. Altogether, the problem of adjustments is now on a robust scientific footing, and better quantification and observational constraint is possible.

Collisions between radiolytically produced O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ and the O produced via electron impact dissociation of O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ affect the exospheric structure and escape rates. Specifically, O + O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ collisions lead to the production of a non‐thermal O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ population, and increase the O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ escape while decreasing the O escape. These collisions are dependent on three specific physical parameters: (a) the density of O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$, (b) the electron impact dissociation rate of O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$, and (c) the O + O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ collision cross section.

Stratospheric volcanic aerosols can affect the global radiative balance and stratospheric composition. In this study, we analyze ensemble experiments with an interactive stratospheric aerosol microphysical general circulation model, designed to assess the climate forcing from large‐magnitude explosive eruptions in the tropics and northern extratropics. Previous studies have generally identified a lower radiative forcing from extratropical eruptions from the shorter stratospheric lifetime of volcanic sulfate aerosols. However, our study finds that both the shorter lifetime and lower effective radiative forcing (ERF) efficacy contribute to the lower ERF in the northern extratropical eruptions. The simulated 2‐year averaged ERF efficacy in northern extratropical eruptions is 22% lower than that in the equatorial eruptions due to the seasonal mismatch of peak stratospheric aerosol optical depth and solar radiation in the first year after a northern extratropical volcanic eruption. Additionally, equatorial eruptions accelerate the Brewer‐Dobson circulation (BDC), while northern hemispheric (NH) extratropical eruptions decelerate the BDC branch in NH and accelerate the BDC branch in southern hemisphere (SH), leading to different spatio‐temporal pattern of ozone anomalies. Consequently, dominated by the dynamical processes, equatorial eruption leads to ozone loss in tropics and increase in midlatitudes, while both northern extratropical summer and winter eruptions trigger ozone decrease in NH and increase in SH."

Atmospheric radiative heating rate, which manifests radiative energy convergence in the atmosphere, is a fundamental factor shaping the Earth's climate and driving climate change. Compared to the radiative energy budget at the top of atmosphere or surface, the atmospheric energy budget and heating rate are less studied due to a lack of observational constraints and diagnostic tools. Motivated by growing interest in atmospheric energy budget and to facilitate the heating rate analysis, we innovate a set of radiative kernels, which quantitatively measure the sensitivity of atmospheric heating rate to different geophysical variables. When multiplied with the changes in these geophysical variables, these kernels quantify their contributions to the heating rate change. A climate change experiment of Global Climate Models (GCMs) is used to test the application of heating rate kernels. The results indicate the radiative heating rate change simulated by GCMs can be well reproduced by the kernels, validating the kernel method. The decomposition of the heating rate changes reveals the contributing mechanisms. For example, in the tropical upper troposphere, the negative heating anomaly in a warmer climate is dominated by atmospheric temperature and water vapor. Increases in both variables intensify atmospheric thermal radiation to space, partially offset by a positive heating anomaly caused by the lifting high‐cloud tops. Moreover, compared to the results corrected using the kernels, the cloud effect inferred from the radiative heating difference between clear‐ and all‐skies (“cloud radiative heating”) has a non‐negligible bias, necessitating the use of kernels to quantify the cloud‐induced heating rate changes."

Cloud feedback is the largest source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity. This feedback is generally discussed in terms of radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, but the vertical distribution of the contribution of cloud changes to the top‐of‐atmosphere cloud feedback should be discussed to understand the feedback in greater detail. We have developed a simple analysis method called “vertical profile analysis of cloud feedback,” which simply uses radiative flux data from each level of the model. The analysis is applied for typical cloud regimes and the results are discussed together with cloud fraction change profiles. The advantages and disadvantages of the vertical profile analysis, compared with the commonly used International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) histogram kernel method, are discussed. Our analysis has the advantage of resolving the detailed vertical profiles of the contribution to the top‐of‐atmosphere cloud feedback from the changes in cloud regimes associated with warming, such as reduced cloud cover and upward shifts of the cloud layer in subtropical low‐cloud regions as well as the increased height of the melting layer in tropical deep convection. The main disadvantage is that the vertical profile analysis cannot represent the feedback components sorted by cloud optical thickness as in the ISCCP histogram kernel method."

Our model focuses on daily, weekly, and monthly predictions, achieving commendable R2 ${\mathrm{R}}^{2}$ coefficients of 0.83, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively. By constructing a gridded map of ozone and incorporating both land use and meteorological features into each grid, we achieved ozone prediction at a high spatiotemporal resolution, outperforming previous research in terms of performance and scale, particularly in regions with limited monitoring stations. The results can be further improved when applied to regional research using meteorological and ozone data from regional stations. Additionally, our research revealed that temperature is the most significant factor affecting ozone concentrations across China. In health risk assessment, we retrieved a high‐resolution spatial distribution of ozone‐attributed mortality for 5‐COD and daily ozone inhalation distributions during our study period. We concluded that ozone‐attributed mortality is predominantly caused by stroke and IHD, accounting for more than 70% of the total deaths in 2021, with the highest mortality rates in developed urban areas such as the NCP and the YRD.

 We evaluate trends in terrestrial water storage over 1950–2100 in CMIP6 climate models against a new global reanalysis from assimilating GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite observations into a hydrological model. To account for different timescales in our analysis, we select regions in which the influence of interannual variability is relatively small and observed trends are assumed to be representative of the development over longer periods. Our results reveal distinct biases in drying and wetting trends in CMIP6 models for several world regions. Specifically, we see high model consensus for drying in the Amazon, which disagrees with the observed wetting. Other regions show a high consensus of models and observations suggesting qualitatively correctly simulated trends, e.g., for the Mediterranean and parts of Central Africa. A high model agreement might therefore falsely indicate a robust trend in water storage if it is not assessed in light of the observed developments.

 The rise in globally averaged sea level—or global mean sea level—is one of the most unambiguous indicators of climate change. Over the past three decades, satellites have provided continuous, accurate measurements of sea level on near-global scales. Here, we show that since satellites began observing sea surface heights in 1993 until the end of 2023, global mean sea level has risen by 111 mm. In addition, the rate of global mean sea level rise over those three decades has increased from ~2.1 mm/year in 1993 to ~4.5 mm/year in 2023.

We use machine learning to systematically group forest ecoregions into 12 global forest pyromes, with each showing distinct sensitivities to climatic, human, and vegetation controls. This delineation revealed that rapidly increasing forest fire emissions in extratropical pyromes, linked to climate change, offset declining emissions in tropical pyromes during 2001 to 2023. Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity. This contributed to a 60% increase in forest fire carbon emissions from forest ecoregions globally. Our results highlight the increasing vulnerability of forests and their carbon stocks to fire disturbance under climate change."

Its prediction skill was compared with that of a dynamical prediction model. The spatiotemporal pattern of sea ice anomalies, which exhibit strong seasonality and are maintained for a significant period above the seasonal time scale by atmosphere-ocean interactions, was extracted using SEOFs.

However, our understanding of climatic mechanisms remains inadequate for operational prediction. By analyzing the atmospheric circulation of ETCTRs occurring in Central and Eastern China during the boreal midsummer period (July–August) from 1981 to 2020, this study found that these boreal midsummer ETCTRs may be influenced by the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and North Pacific Ocean Dipole (IPOD). Diagnostic analysis and Linear Baroclinic Model experiments indicated that negative IPOD-type sea surface temperature anomalies can trigger positive geopotential height anomalies in the mid-upper troposphere over the subtropical region and negative geopotential height anomalies from the Western North Pacific to Northeastern and Northern China. This circulation pattern and moisture transport conditions are conducive to the formation of ETCTRs during boreal midsummer in Central and Eastern China and vice versa for the positive IPOD case. This study provides useful evidence for short-range climate prediction of boreal midsummer ETCTRs in Central and Eastern China."

Prior research has proposed examining the area of applicability (AoA) of a model based on structurally similar characteristics in the Earth Observation predictors and weights based on the model derived feature importance. We expand on and evaluate this approach in the context of grain yield forecasting in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we evaluate an AoA methodology established for generating raster surfaces and apply it to vector supported grain data. We fit a series of ensemble tree models both within single countries and across multiple sets of countries and then test those models in countries excluded from the training set. We then calculate and decompose AoA measures and examine several different performance metrics. We find that the spatial transfer accuracy does not vary across season but does vary by average rainfall and across high, medium, and low yielding regions. In general, areas with higher yields and medium to high average rainfall tend to have higher accuracy for both model training and transfer. Finally, we find that fitting models with multiple countries provides more accurate out-of-sample estimates when compared to models fitted to a single country."

Crowley,"Measurement report: Sources, sinks, and lifetime of NOx in a suburban temperate forest at night","Using measurements of various trace gases in a suburban forest near Paris in the summer of 2022, we were able to gain insight into the sources and sinks of NOx (NO+NO2) with a special focus on their nighttime chemical and physical loss processes. NO was observed as a result of nighttime soil emissions when O3 levels were strongly depleted by deposition. NO oxidation products were not observed at night, indicating that soil and/or foliar surfaces are an efficient sink of reactive N. 
 The budget of reactive nitrogen species, which play a central role in atmospheric chemistry (e.g. in photochemical O3 production), is poorly understood in forested regions. In this study, through observations of NO, NO2, NOy, and O3 in the Rambouillet Forest near Paris, France, we have examined nighttime processes controlling NOx in an anthropogenically impacted forest environment. The O3 mixing ratios displayed a strong diel profile at the site that was driven by a variable but generally rapid deposition to soil and foliar surfaces. The O3 diel profile was strongly influenced by relative humidity and temperature inversion. Only when the O3 mixing ratio was sufficiently low (and thus the NO lifetime sufficiently long) were sustained NO peaks observed above the instrumental detection limit, enabling the derivation of average NO emission rates of ∼1.4 ppbv h−1 from the soil. Observations of the lack of increase in NO2 at night, despite a significant production rate from the reaction of NO with O3, enabled an effective lifetime of NO2 of ∼0.5–3 h to be derived. As the loss of NO2 was not compensated for by the formation of gas- or particle-phase reactive nitrogen species, it was presumably either driven by deposition to soil and foliar surfaces or any products formed were themselves short-lived with respect to deposition. By comparison, the daytime lifetime of NO2 with respect to loss by reaction with OH is about 1 d. Our results indicate that the nighttime deposition of NO2 is a major sink of boundary layer NOx in this temperate forest environment."

Santos,Using open-path dual-comb spectroscopy to monitor methane emissions from simulated grazing cattle,"Most methane emissions during the life cycle of beef cattle occur during the grazing phase. Measuring methane in grazing systems is difficult due to the high mobility and low density of animals. This work investigates if dual-comb spectroscopy can measure methane emissions from small cattle herds. An enhancement of 10 nmol mol-1 methane above the atmospheric background was measured, equivalent to 20 head located 60 m away. The calculated methane flux was within 5 % of the actual release rate. 
 Accurate whole-farm or herd-level measurements of livestock methane emissions are necessary for anthropogenic greenhouse gas inventories and to evaluate mitigation strategies. A controlled methane (CH4) release experiment was performed to determine if dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) can detect CH4 concentration enhancements produced by a typical herd of beef cattle in an extensive grazing system. Open-path DCS was used to measure downwind and upwind CH4 concentrations from 10 point sources of methane simulating cattle emissions. The CH4 mole fractions and wind velocity data were used to calculate CH4 flux using an inverse dispersion model, and the simulated fluxes were then compared to the actual CH4 release rate. For a source located 60 m from the downwind path, the DCS system detected 10 nmol mol−1 CH4 horizontal concentration gradient above the atmospheric background concentration with a precision of 6 nmol mol−1 in 15 min interval. A CH4 release of 3970 g d−1 was performed, resulting in an average concentration enhancement of 24 nmol mol−1 of CH4. The calculated CH4 flux was 4002 g d−1, showing good agreement with the actual CH4 release rate. Periodically altering the downwind path, which may be needed to track moving cattle, did not adversely affect the ability of the instruments to determine the CH4 flux. These results give us confidence that CH4 flux can be determined by grazing cattle with low disturbance and direct field-scale measurements."

Such differences can affect the homogeneity and comparability of their measurements. In this study, we assess the homogeneity between the sun photometer networks GAW-PFR and SKYNET, analysing common measurements during three campaigns between 2017–2021, and investigate the main cause of the differences. 
 In this study, we assess the homogeneity of aerosol optical depth (AOD) between two sun photometer networks, the Global Atmosphere Watch-Precision Filter Radiometer (GAW-PFR) and the European SKYNET radiometers network (ESR), at the common wavelengths of their main instruments (500 and 870 nm). The main focus of this work is to evaluate the effect of the improved Langley plot calibration method (ILP) used by SKYNET and to investigate the factors affecting its performance. We used data from three intercomparison campaigns that took place during 2017–2021. Each campaign was organized at two locations (mountainous rural – Davos, Switzerland; urban – Rome, Italy). Our analysis shows that differences in AOD due to post-processing and instrument differences are minor. The main factor leading to AOD differences is the calibration method. We found a systematic underestimation of AOD in ESR compared to in GAW-PFR due to underestimation of the calibration constant calculated with the ILP method compared to the calibration transfers using the PFR as a reference. The calibration and AOD differences are smaller in Davos, where the traceability criteria are satisfied at 870 nm and where the median differences are below 0.01 at 500 nm. In Rome, the AOD median differences at 500 nm were in the 0.015–0.034 range. We conducted a sensitivity study, which shows that part of the difference can potentially be explained by errors in the assumed surface albedo and instrument solid-view angle provided as inputs to the ILP code (based on Skyrad pack 4.2). Our findings suggest that the ILP method is mainly sensitive to the measured sky radiance. The underestimation in calibration is probably caused by an error in the retrieved scattering AOD (sc-AOD) through the sky radiance inversion. Using an alternative retrieval method (Skyrad MRI pack version 2) to derive sc-AOD and to recalibrate the instruments with the ILP method, we found no significant differences between the retrieved sc-AOD and no systematic increase in the ILP-derived calibration constant when using the MRI pack for sc-AOD inversion instead of the Skyrad 4.2. The potential error may be a result of the model assumptions used for the sky radiance simulations. In conclusion, the on-site calibration of sun photometers has several advantages, including the fact that instrument shipments and data gaps can be avoided. However, it has also the disadvantages of a larger uncertainty and significant systematic differences compared to the traditional Langley calibration performed under low- and constant-AOD conditions at high-altitude sites. The larger uncertainty of the ILP method can be attributed to the required modelling and input parameters."

These maps reveal how the reflectivity of different land surfaces varies throughout the year. Our dataset enhances the understanding of the Earth's energy balance. 
 Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative-transfer simulations of the Earth's system as it is fundamental for correctly calculating the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance Black-Sky Albedo dataset (version 6.1 of MCD43D) provides detailed albedo maps for seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only into seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra and correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from remote sensing observations of the Earth. We use a principal component analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of the Earth. By combining different datasets containing laboratory measurements of hyperspectral reflectance for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct albedo maps across the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-year average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05° in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, and a temporal resolution of 1 d (day). Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities, and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps will enable us to refine calculations of the Earth's energy budget and its seasonal variability and improve climate simulations."

We developed a new method to create long-term cloud radiative kernels to improve the accuracy of sunlight reaching the surface, which significantly reduces errors. Findings suggest that prior estimates of cloud cooling effects may have been overstated, emphasizing the need for better strategies to manage climate change impacts in the Arctic. 
 The surface shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) plays a critical role in modulating the Earth's energy balance and climate change. However, accurately quantifying the CRE remains challenging due to significant uncertainties in downwelling surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) and cloud parameter estimates, especially in the Arctic. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances the accuracy of CRE estimation by constructing a computationally efficient, long-term gridded surface cloud fraction radiative kernels (GCF-CRKs) and integrating refined DSSR estimates and a high-precision cloud fraction (CF). By leveraging the correlation between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiative parameters and surface radiation, combined with high-precision fused CF datasets from multiple satellite sources, we construct a CF-dependent model to refine DSSR estimates. Based on this model, we construct GCF-CRKs using the CF as the sole perturbation parameter to isolate the CF CRE. Our results indicate that this method significantly improves the accuracy of DSSR estimation under partially cloudy conditions (0<CF<100 %), aligning more closely with ground-based observations. In Arctic-wide validation experiments, the root mean square error (RMSE) was decreased by approximately 2.5 Wm-2, and the bias was reduced by 1.23 Wm-2, which was an improvement of 8.7 % (reduction of RMSE) against the CERES-EBAF. The even greater improvements were achieved at stations in Greenland (RMSE reduced by 4.53 Wm-2 and a bias reduced by ~6.89 Wm-2, with an accuracy improved about 11.1%). The GCF-CRKs exhibit similar signs and patterns and enhanced stability compared to existing kernels. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that seasonal and interannual variations introduce GCF-CRK uncertainties of approximately 1 Wm-2 %-1 and 0.1 Wm-2 %-1, respectively, while spatial variations within the same latitude range can cause CRK uncertainties of 0.2–1.2 Wm-2 %-1. These uncertainties can result in CRE biases ranging from 5 to 50 Wm-2, which demonstrates the limitations of existing methods that utilize short-term, small-area parameter data to produce global CRKs. Using these GCF-CRKs, we estimated the spatiotemporal properties of the surface shortwave CRE in the Arctic over a 21-year period (2000–2020), and the trend result indicates that despite the increasing influence of the CF on the Arctic DSSR, the smaller magnitude and interannual trend of the annual average surface shortwave CRE suggest that previous studies may have overestimated the magnitude and rate of the cooling effect of clouds on the Arctic DSSR by up to 4 Wm-2 and 0.5 Wm-2 per decade, particularly in Greenland. This study provides a more accurate and efficient assessment of the CRE, and the results underscore the need for more effective measures to mitigate the impact of Arctic amplification on the surface radiative energy balance, which is crucial for understanding and addressing regional and global climate change. The GCF-CRKs can be freely available to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13907217 (Liu, 2024)."

This study examines how the gas–salt interface composition of desert salt changes with varying relative humidity (RH), using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Ion chromatography analysis of desert salt indicates it is predominantly composed of sulfate, sodium, and magnesium ions, with traces of calcium, chloride, nitrate, and potassium ions. APXPS and NEXAFS surface analyses show that, at 0% RH, the gas–salt interface primarily features Na2SO4, with smaller amounts of MgSO4 and a trace of NaCl on the top layers. As humidity increases, the composition at the gas–salt interface changes, notably with Mg2+ binding to SO42– ions and a dominant NaCl formation throughout the studied surface depth. This shift indicates a transition from a sulfate- to a chloride-rich surface as humidity increases, contradicting MD simulations that predicted that on salt crystals covered by a submonolayer of water with electrolytes, chloride ions migrate toward the liquid–solid interface.

The stratiform zones of two types of precipitating systems are studied, a frontal situation that occurred over Finland in June 2014 and a squall line system observed over Oklahoma in June 2011. An analysis method for determining raindrop trajectories was used to obtain the temporal variation of the total raindrop concentration from the observations. The resulting raindrop concentration rate as a function of the mean volume diameter reveals significant differences with the parameterizations currently used in two‐moment bulk microphysics schemes. These results show that even if they produce variations in raindrop concentration of the same order of magnitude as the observations, the current parameterizations diverge from the median of the observations, resulting in an overestimation of either the self‐collection or the breakup process. From the median of radar observations, new parameterizations of the self‐collection and breakup processes and of rain self‐collection efficiency are developed and can be implemented in two‐moment bulk microphysics schemes."

 Warming in the Third Pole region accelerates glacier and snow melt, leading to a rise in glacial lake numbers and sizes. However, accurately measuring their water level changes poses challenges, hindering precise volume assessments and evaluation of glacier mass balance contributions. Here, we took the Ak-Shyirak glaciers and the largest Petrov proglacial lake in the Central Tien Shan as a case study to investigate these phenomena. Specifically, firstly, we conducted mass balance assessments for the Ak-Shyirak massif for six sub-periods from 1973 to 2023 using KH-9 DEMs, SRTM DEM, and ASTER DEMs. The results indicate that glaciers were in a state of rapid melting for 1980–2000 and 2005–2012, with rates of −0.46 m w.e./a and − 0.37 m w.e./a; moderate melting during 1973–1980 and 2012–2018, with rates of −0.26 m w.e./a and − 0.28 m w.e./a, while slower melting during 2000–2005 and 2018–2023, with rates of −0.08 m w.e./a and − 0.18 m w.e./a. Subsequently, we conducted assessments of the area change of Petrov Lake for 1973–2023 using KH-9 and Landsat images. The results reveal a significant increase in the glacial lake area by 2.81 km2 (150.25 %), corresponding to a rate of 0.054 km2/a over the entire study period. Furthermore, we conducted monitoring of Petrov Lake's water level from 2019 to 2023 by utilizing ICESat-2 laser altimetry and Sentinel-3 radar altimetry data. Our findings indicate that the glacial lake level shows intra-annual fluctuations and inter-annual change, with amplitudes of 0.67 ± 0.09 m and increase rate of 0.30 ± 0.05 m/a, respectively, as determined by a periodic fluctuation model. Finally, after a comprehensive analysis of ERA5-Land meteorological data, topography, glacier mass balance, lake area, and water level, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) glacier mass balance is predominantly influenced by the air temperature and snowfall; (2) changes in glacial lake area are driven by factors such as the lake basin, glacier surface elevation, and drainage event; (3) intra-annual fluctuations and inter-annual change in glacial lake levels are both primarily influenced by precipitation and glacier mass balance; (4) glacier mass balance accounts for (36.19 ± 8.47)% of the water supply contributing to changes in glacial lake volume change, while precipitation represents (63.81 ± 5.08)%. Glacier mass balance measurements reveal changing patterns in the Ak-Shyirak massif, Central Tien Shan, due to climate change. Inaugural proglacial lake level measurements provide unique insights into both intra-annual and inter-annual changes, serving as a reference for Third Pole region-wide glacial lake monitoring. Additionally, quantifying glacier meltwater contributions to lake volumes will aid future glacial lake evaluation and potential outburst flood impacts."

 Aldehydes are one of the most important oxygenated volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, contributing to atmospheric radicals such as HO2 and RO2, which play a pivotal role in atmospheric chemistry and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. The kinetics, gas-phase products, and SOA formation of pentanal and n-hexanal initiated by Br atoms were studied in this work. The reaction rate constants of n-pentanal and n-hexanal reacting with Br atoms were determined to be (1.77 ± 0.25) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and (2.07 ± 0.29) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 298 K and 760 Torr, respectively. Key gas-phase products, including smaller aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and alcohols, are known to contribute to atmospheric reactivity and have potential implications for air quality by promoting the formation of secondary pollutants and influencing the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. The SOA yields were (5.24 ± 0.10)% and (6.00 ± 1.20)% for n-pentanal and n-hexanal, respectively, higher than the SOA yields of the aldehydes reaction initiated by OH radicals. The higher SOA yields observed from Br atoms oxidation compared to OH radical oxidation highlight the necessity to re-evaluate the role of halogen chemistry in atmospheric processes, particularly in regions where halogen compounds are prevalent. This research enhances our understanding of the atmospheric fate of aldehydes and highlights the importance of considering halogen-driven oxidation pathways in atmospheric models."

 Hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides and hydroperoxides exhibit high reactivity and play a pivotal role in atmospheric chemistry. These compounds are formed during the oxidation of volatile organic compounds in both gaseous and aqueous phases, particularly under low NOx conditions. Their significant contribution to the mass of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) is well-documented, and they are believed to have significant health implications. Several spectrophotometric methods have been employed to measure SOA-bound peroxides in laboratory samples, but systematic comparisons are lacking. In this study, we have assessed the advantages and limitations of these methods, including the traditional and microwave-assisted iodometric methods, the 4-nitrophenyl boronic acid assay (NPBA), and the Fenton reaction-assisted ferrous-xylenol (FOX2) assay. Besides, a comprehensive evaluation of these methodologies was conducted for the first time across a substantial cohort of commercial peroxides and hydroperoxides, employing diverse solvents (namely, water, 1-propanol, acetonitrile, methanol and chloroform) to provide broader insights compared to previous work. Ultimately, the four methods were applied and compared for peroxide determination in laboratory-generated SOA resulting from gas-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene.

 :In this study, the investigation is made to reveal the impact of multi-strategically assimilating Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation and Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) water vapor radiances (WVR) on forecasting a heavy snowfall event in the Eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (EQTP) employing the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) and the Four-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) assimilation system (WRF-4DVar). The multiple data assimilation (DA) strategies include control tests (CON), the individual assimilation of AHI and GPM tests (DA_AHI and DA_GPM) and the joint assimilation of GPM and AHI (DA_G&A), with different initial times. The results indicate that GPM precipitation effectively captures mesoscale atmospheric details, but its scope is confined to a limited area. AHI WVR is sensitive to upper-middle atmospheric humidity and furnishes extensive-scale environmental parameters such as water vapor transport characteristics. The joint assimilation of the two not only yields multi-dimensional atmospheric insights but also addresses the limitations of individual assimilation. Assimilation GPM and AHI are respective sensitivity to the lower layers (about 800hpa) and upper layers (about 400hpa) of model. The individual assimilation GPM has the greatest effect on near-surface humidity field, and AHI plays a dominant role in the joint assimilation. By assimilating different remote sensing products at different initial times of NWPs, the thermodynamic and dynamic structures are variously reconstructed, leading to the different snowfall scenes. In addition, we further compare the 12-hourly cumulative snowfall with in-situ meteorological station observations. The predictions of snowfall from DA_G&A perform much better with the correlation coefficient (CC) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) 0.36 and 3.14 mm, respectively. As for different initial times of NWPs, the best snowfall forecast is 0600 UTC on October 28, 2022, and the CC is 0.4. Nevertheless, accurately predicting precipitation areas, intensity, and temporal variations remains challenging, particularly for solid precipitation like snowfall. Thus, meticulous consideration of weather process characteristics, observation attributes, and relevant parameter configurations during DA are imperative to enhance the efficiency of observation data utilization."

The uncertainty in precipitation projections across the Sahel has persisted across generations of climate models. Many projections show a zonal dipole in the sign of precipitation change, with wetting across the Central Sahel and drying across the Western Sahel. We analyze the outputs from an ensemble of current climate models to explain why some produce this dipole and understand the inter‐model variability in the transition region for these models. Models projecting the dipole tend to shift the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to the south, while models that do not tend to shift the ITCZ to the north. We find that the strong relationship between the change in Sahel precipitation and surface temperature‐based indices is highly driven by the non‐dipole models. These indices do not explain most of the variance in where models transition. This suggests that understanding zonal variability in Sahel precipitation change must go beyond these temperature‐based analysis."

 It is generally believed that the Maritime Continent (MC) is rarely affected by tropical cyclones (TCs) due to its equatorial location. However, this study reveals that TCs in the tropical western North Pacific can significantly suppress rainfall over the MC and its surrounding seas, based on the composite analysis. This suppression effect of TCs exists across all phases of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). TCs greatly alleviate rainfall enhancement during the convective phases of the MJO and aggravate rainfall suppression during the suppressive phases. Particularly, TCs reduce the likelihood of extremely high rainfall in convective MJO phases from 9% to 5% and increase the likelihood of extremely low rainfall in suppressive MJO phases from 10% to 16%. The rainfall suppression is attributed to the lower-tropospheric southwesterly anomalies to the south of TCs, which result in moisture divergence over the MC. Additionally, the upper-tropospheric equatorward outflows of TCs also promote subsidence and suppress rainfall. This study introduces a new factor influencing the rainfall over the MC from a synoptic climatology perspective."

A comprehensive like-for-like analysis shows reanalysis trends exhibit large uncertainty, and coupled climate model simulations exhibit weaker trends than most but not all reanalyses. However, simulations with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) exhibit significantly greater storminess trends, particularly in the South Pacific, implying SST trend discrepancies in coupled simulations impact storminess trends. Using pacemaker simulations that correct Southern Ocean and tropical east Pacific SST trend discrepancies, we show that storminess trends in coupled simulations are underestimated because they do not capture the enhanced storminess resulting from Southern Ocean cooling and La-Nina-like teleconnection trends.

 The Euromediterranean area is a key region in which the link between atmospheric moisture transport and hydrometeorological extremes concerns. Atmospheric rivers, the main moisture transport mechanism affecting the region, play a notable role in extreme precipitation there. Moreover, moisture transport deficits from two of the major oceanic moisture sources of the planet, the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, are strongly related to drought occurrence in that region. Here, we examine the projected changes in these relationships with global warming, under a high-emission scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway 5–8.5). Here we show that, for the mid-21st century, a moderate increase in the influence of moisture transport on winter precipitation maxima is projected, in line with its increasing concurrence with atmospheric rivers. A stronger increase is estimated for the relationship between moisture transport deficits and drought occurrence, for which probabilities between two and three times greater than those observed in the present climate are obtained for the mid- and end-21st century. This highlights the increasing importance of moisture transport from the ocean in future droughts in the region, especially in the context of reduced local moisture inputs from terrestrial evaporation as a consequence of drier soil.

 A Master Chemical Mechanism has been employed to describe the yield of hydrogen from the photolysis of the formaldehyde produced by the oxidation of up to one hundred volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a polluted boundary layer in north west Europe. Yields were estimated from the ratio of the additional hydrogen production to the additional rate of each VOC oxidised. The hydrogen yields varied from close to zero for benzaldehyde, dimethyl ether, formic acid and propane to close to unity for limonene, in terms of additional hydrogen molecules produced per additional VOC molecule oxidised. The alkene class exhibited the largest mean hydrogen yield of 0.6 molecules per molecule oxidised. To put the estimated H2 yields into a global context, they were scaled by the global emissions of anthropogenic and natural biogenic emissions. Altogether, the twenty most prolific anthropogenic VOC species accounted for a global atmospheric H2 source of 1.3 Tg yr−1. Oxidation of ethylene was the most prolific H2 source, accounting for 0.27 Tg yr−1, followed by butadiene and formaldehyde. The total atmospheric H2 source from the oxidation of natural biogenic VOCs amounted to 18.6 Tg yr−1. The most prolific natural biogenic VOC species by a large margin was isoprene which accounted for about 70% of the natural biogenic total.

We find a moderately positive global low‐cloud feedback (0.45 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$, 90% range 0.18–0.72 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$), about twice the mean value (0.22 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$) of 16 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We link this discrepancy to a pervasive model mean‐state bias: models underestimate the low‐cloud response to warming because (a) they systematically underestimate present‐day tropical marine low‐cloud amount, and (b) the low‐cloud sensitivity to warming is proportional to this present‐day low‐cloud amount. Our results hence highlight the importance of reducing model biases in both the mean state of clouds and their sensitivity to environmental factors for accurate climate change projections."
10.1029/2024GL110325,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了温度、海冰覆盖率以及海盐和尘埃气溶胶混合比对北极和南大洋云相的综合影响。它使用了CloudSat/CALIPSO卫星观测数据以及可解释机器学习技术，分析了不同高度云（低云、中云和中低云）的相态。研究发现云顶温度是决定云相的最重要参数，海盐和海冰对低云相态有预测能力，而尘埃对中云相态有预测能力。南大洋强烈的纬向风影响气溶胶分布，可能导致低层海盐气溶胶混合比高，但抑制了尘埃向极地的输送。海冰可能抑制海盐和海洋有机气溶胶的释放，导致海冰上空云的液态水比例更高。总而言之，该研究利用遥感技术（卫星观测）和机器学习方法，定量分析了大气成分（气溶胶、海冰）对云相的影响，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析。,"['cloud phase', 'aerosol', 'sea ice', 'temperature', 'satellite observation', 'CloudSat', 'CALIPSO', 'Arctic', 'Southern Ocean', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing', 'air quality']",Barbara Dietel;Hendrik Andersen;Jan Cermak;Philip Stier;Corinna Hoose,"Combined Impacts of Temperature, Sea Ice Coverage, and Mixing Ratios of Sea Spray and Dust on Cloud Phase Over the Arctic and Southern Oceans","We analyze the importance of cloud top temperature, dust aerosol, sea salt aerosol, and sea ice cover for the thermodynamic phase of low‐level, mid‐level, and mid to low‐level clouds observed by CloudSat/CALIPSO over the Arctic and the Southern Ocean using an explainable machine learning technique. As expected, the cloud top temperature is found to be the most important parameter for determining cloud phase. The results show also a predictive power of sea salt and sea ice on the phase of low‐level clouds, while in mid‐level clouds dust shows predictive power. Over the Southern Ocean, strong zonal winds coincide with the aerosol distribution. While they can produce high mixing ratios of sea spray at lower levels, the strong zonal winds may prevent the pole‐ward transport of dust. Sea ice may prevent the release of sea salt aerosols and marine organic aerosols leading to higher liquid fractions in clouds over sea ice."
10.1029/2024GL111086,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了热带气旋中水汽静力能量 (MSE) 的空间变异性及其对热带气旋发展的预测作用。它利用1996年至2021年北大西洋上空探空仪的观测数据，对热带气旋中的MSE结构进行了迄今为止最广泛的观测分析。研究发现，MSE和其柱积分值(CMSE)随着距热带气旋中心的距离增加而减小，并且在1-2级飓风中空间变异性比热带风暴更大。此外，水分主导了MSE的空间变异性，但在热带气旋中心上层，温度也有贡献。虽然减弱和增强热带气旋之间MSE空间变异性的差异不太明显，但在大多数半径和垂直高度上，增强热带气旋的原始MSE往往更大。总的来说，这项研究使用了遥感技术（探空仪）观测大气成分（水汽静力能量）来改进热带气旋预报，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['moist static energy', 'tropical cyclones', 'dropsondes', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing', 'weather forecasting']",Michael V.

The spatial variability of moist static energy (MSE) and its column‐integral (CMSE) around tropical cyclones (TCs) are known to help prognose TC development. Though limited in number and spatial coverage per TC, modeling work suggests that dropsondes, when strategically deployed, can reliably capture radial MSE and CMSE variability. This study uses North Atlantic upper‐level reconnaissance dropsondes from 1996 to 2021 to produce the most extensive observational analysis of MSE structure in TCs to date. MSE and CMSE decrease with distance from the TC center. MSE spatial variability is larger in Category 1 and 2 hurricanes compared to tropical storms, and generally largest after a TC's lifetime maximum intensity. Moisture dominates the MSE spatial variability but temperature contributes in the upper levels near the TC center. While differences in MSE spatial variability between weakening and intensifying TCs are less clear, raw MSE tends to be greater in intensifying TCs at most radii and vertical levels."

The continental United States is well instrumented with facilities for mid‐latitude upper atmosphere research that operate on a continuous basis. In addition, citizen scientists provide a wealth of information when unusual events occur. We combine ionospheric total electron content (TEC) data from distributed arrays of GNSS receivers, magnetometer chains, and auroral observations obtained by citizen scientists, to provide a detailed view of the intense auroral breakup and westward surge occurring at the peak of the 10–11 May 2024 extreme geomagnetic storm. Over a 20‐min interval, vertical TEC (vTEC) increased at unusually low latitude (∼45°) and rapidly expanded azimuthally across the continent. Individual receiver/satellite data sets indicate sharp bursts of greatly elevated of vTEC (∼50 TECu). Intense red aurora was co‐located with the leading edge of the equatorward and westward TEC enhancements, indicating that the large TEC enhancement was created by extremely intense low‐energy precipitation during the rapid substorm breakup."
10.1029/2024JD041290,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了东西伯利亚海冰与中国西北地区6月干旱之间的关系。它利用卫星遥感数据，分析了1979年至2021年东西伯利亚海冰浓度与中国西北地区6月干旱的年际变化之间的联系。研究发现，东西伯利亚海秋季海冰浓度与中国西北6月干旱呈负相关，尤其是在2000年以后这种联系更为显著。进一步分析表明，这种联系可能与东西伯利亚海冰浓度的变化幅度加大有关。高海冰浓度异常与异常的东北风有关，导致东欧平原土壤变干和气温下降，这种干燥信号可能持续到次年春季和夏季，从而影响西伯利亚上空的反气旋环流异常，最终影响中国西北地区的水汽输送，增加该地区湿度。总之，该研究利用遥感技术，揭示了海冰变化对中国西北干旱的影响机制，对提高中国西北干旱预测能力具有重要意义。,"['Sea ice concentration', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Drought monitoring', 'Water vapor', 'Temperature', 'Wind']",Yang Liu;Jianqi Sun,How Does the East Siberian Sea Ice Affect the June Drought Over Northwest China After 2000?,"
Changes in Arctic sea ice have exerted remarkably effects on the Eurasian climates, but it is unclear whether Arctic sea ice also contributes to Northwest China's ongoing summer drought. This study investigates the influence of the interannual variability of Arctic sea ice on the June drought in Northwest China from 1979 to 2021. It reveals that the early‐autumn sea ice in the East Siberian Sea is correlated with drought conditions in June in Northwest China, with a more pronounced connection during the period of 2000/2001–2020/2021 (P2) compared to 1979/1980–1999/2000 (P1). Mitigated drought in Northwest China is associated with anomalously high sea ice concentration (SIC) in the East Siberian Sea. Further analysis suggests that the strengthened link may be due to greater SIC variability in the East Siberian Sea during P2 than P1. In P2, positive early‐autumn SIC anomaly is linked to anomalous northeasterly winds, promoting drier soil and widespread cooling in the East European Plain. This dry soil signal may persist into the ensuing spring and early summer, inducing an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over Siberia, which could facilitate the water vapor convergence in Northwest China, thereby enhancing humidity conditions in the region. The insights from this study could offer valuable information for improved prediction of droughts in Northwest China."

In this study, we proposed an interpretable and accurate hybrid machine learning (ML) model, that explicitly represented the controls of fuel flammability, fuel availability, and human suppression effects on fires. The model demonstrated notable accuracy with a F1‐score of 0.846 ± 0.012, surpassing process‐driven fire danger indices and four commonly used ML models by up to 40% and 9%, respectively. More importantly, the ML model showed remarkably higher interpretability relative to other ML models. Specifically, by demystifying the “black box” of each ML model using the explainable AI techniques, we identified substantial structural differences across ML fire models, even among those with similar accuracy. The relationships between fires and their drivers, identified by our model, were aligned closer with established fire physical principles. The ML structural discrepancy led to diverse fire predictions and our model predictions exhibited greater consistency with actual fire occurrence. With the highly interpretable and accurate model, we revealed the strong compound effects from multiple climate variables related to evaporative demand, energy release component, temperature, and wind speed, on the dynamics of large fires and megafires in the western US. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the structural integrity of models in addition to their accuracy. They also underscore the critical need to address the rise in compound climate extremes linked to large wildfires."

Fire significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The current global burned area (BA) products mainly have coarse native spatial resolution, which leads to underestimation of global BA and carbon emissions from biomass burning. Performances of BA products in Africa from GABAM (30 m), MCD64A1 (500 m), GFED4s (0.25°), FireCCI51 (250 m), and GFED5 (0.25°) were compared. From 2014 to 2020, GFED5 detected the most BA, 1.58 times more than GABAM during the same period. GABAM detected 0.09 Mkm2 more burned area than FireCCI51 on average. From 2014 to 2016, GABAM detected an average of 2.99 Mkm2 of BA in Africa, which was 1.03 times more than GFED4s. From 2014 to 2021, the average African BA derived from GABAM was 2.89 Mkm2, 1.22 times more than MCD64A1. The increase in BA will inevitably lead to an increase in the estimation of carbon emissions from biomass burning. Based on GABAM products and GFED framework, we estimated the average vegetation burning carbon emissions in Africa from 2014 to 2021 to be 1113.25 Tg, which is higher than GFED4s' carbon emissions in the same time period. This shows that the use of high‐resolution (30 m) burned area products to estimate carbon emissions can effectively avoid the underestimation of overall fire carbon emissions."

 Various combustion processes occur concurrently during biomass burning events, emitting a complex mixture of particulate and gaseous pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions undergo chemical transformations facilitated by factors such as solar radiation and cloud formation, thereby altering the composition of aerosols. Additionally, these pollutants can affect the region of origin and neighboring countries, presenting regional and global environmental challenges. Therefore, precise evaluation of the particulate and gaseous pollutants emitted during biomass burning is essential to formulate effective management strategies. This study aimed to assess the concentration and chemical characteristics of particulate matter emitted during biomass burning in South Korea. On June 7, 2021, a research flight was conducted utilizing a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) for airborne measurements over South Korea inland areas. For data analysis based on administrative regions, the flight path was divided into four major areas (Areas A, B, C, and D). During the research flight, evidence of biomass burning events was observed primarily in Area C. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis categorized the organic aerosols (OA) into five factors: biomass burning OA (BBOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA1, HOA2), low-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). Across all areas, MO-OOA accounted for the highest proportion of aerosols, whereas BBOA dominated in Area C at 23.8%, indicating the significant influence of biomass burning in this region. Instead of running a PMF analysis with all measurement data, a BBOA formula was derived from the previous study and this one. This allows us to estimate BBOA concentration without running PMF."

Our results highlight that despite a record-breaking area burned, only a small amount of smoke managed to enter the stratosphere. This shows that the conditions for deep convection were rarely met in the 2023 wildfire season, suggesting that even a massive area burned is not necessarily an indicator of stratospheric perturbations. 
 Pyrocumulonimbus clouds (pyroCbs) generated by intense wildfires can serve as a direct pathway for the injection of aerosols and gaseous pollutants into the lower stratosphere, resulting in significant chemical, radiative, and dynamical changes. Canada experienced an extremely severe wildfire season in 2023, with a total area burned that substantially exceeded those of previous events known to have impacted the stratosphere (such as the 2020 Australian fires). This season also had record-high pyroCb activity, which raises the question of whether the 2023 Canadian event resulted in significant stratospheric perturbations. Here, we investigate this anomalous wildfire season using retrievals from multiple satellite instruments, ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment – Fourier transform spectrometer), OMPS LP (Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler), and MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder), to determine the vertical extents of the wildfire smoke along with chemical signatures of biomass burning. These data show that smoke primarily reached the upper troposphere, and only a nominal amount managed to penetrate the tropopause. Only a few ACE-FTS occultations captured elevated abundances of biomass-burning products in the lowermost stratosphere. OMPS LP aerosol measurements also indicate that any smoke that made it past the tropopause did not last long enough or reach high enough to significantly perturb stratospheric composition. While this work focuses on Canadian wildfires given the extensive burned area, pyroCbs at other longitudes (e.g., Siberia) are also captured in the compositional analysis. These results highlight that despite the formation of many pyroCbs in major wildfires, those capable of penetrating the tropopause are extremely rare; this in turn means that even a massive area burned is not necessarily an indicator of stratospheric effects."

More specifically, we qualitatively investigate a recently discovered chemical reaction channel for one of the most important short-lived radical compounds, peroxy radicals, and discover which of these reactions are most atmospherically important. 
 The least volatile organic compounds participating in atmospheric new-particle formation are very likely accretion products from self- and cross-reactions of peroxy radicals (RO2). It has long been assumed that the only possible accretion product channel in this reaction is that forming a peroxide (RO2+RO2→ROOR+O2), but it has recently been discovered that a rapid alkoxy radical (RO) decomposition may precede the accretion step of the mechanism, forming slightly fragmented but more stable ether (ROR) or ester (RC′(O)OR) accretion products. In this work, the atmospheric implications of this new reaction channel have been explored further by using a modified version of the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A) software to generate a large amount of representative RO2 + RO2 reactive pairs formed from the oxidation of typical primary hydrocarbons and by applying structure–activity relationships (SARs) to predict the potential accretion products. These data are analysed in terms of the formation of low-volatility products, and new discoveries are presented on what types of RO2 are especially efficient (and which are surprisingly inefficient) at forming accretion products. These findings are discussed in terms of the atmospheric relevance of these new RO2 + RO2 reaction channels. As the generation of these data rests on several simplifications and assumptions, many open questions worthy of later studies are also raised."

Here, using direct measurements and kinetic modeling, we probe the nocturnal synergistic-oxidation mechanism of α-pinene by O3 and NO3 radicals and in particular the fate of peroxy radical intermediates of different origins, which will deepen our understanding of the monoterpene oxidation chemistry and its contribution to atmospheric particle formation. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are often subject to synergistic oxidation by different oxidants in the atmosphere. However, the exact synergistic-oxidation mechanism of atmospheric VOCs and its role in particle formation remain poorly understood. In particular, the reaction kinetics of the key reactive intermediates, organic peroxy radicals (RO2), during synergistic oxidation is rarely studied. Here, we conducted a combined experimental and kinetic modeling study of the nocturnal synergistic oxidation of α-pinene (the most abundant monoterpene) by O3 and NO3 radicals as well as its influences on the formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) and particles. We find that in the synergistic O3 + NO3 regime, where OH radicals are abundantly formed via decomposition of ozonolysis-derived Criegee intermediates, the production of CxHyOz HOMs is substantially suppressed compared to that in the O3-only regime, mainly because of the depletion of α-pinene RO2 derived from ozonolysis and OH oxidation by those arising from NO3 oxidation via cross reactions. Measurement–model comparisons further reveal that the cross-reaction rate constants of NO3-derived RO2 with O3-derived RO2 are on average 10–100 times larger than those of NO3-derived RO2 with OH-derived RO2. Despite a strong production of organic nitrates in the synergistic-oxidation regime, the substantial decrease in CxHyOz HOM formation leads to a significant reduction in ultralow- and extremely low-volatility organic compounds, which significantly inhibits the formation of new particles. This work provides valuable mechanistic and quantitative insights into the nocturnal synergistic-oxidation chemistry of biogenic emissions and will help to better understand the formation of low-volatility organic compounds and particles in the atmosphere."

A good agreement was observed between their model-estimated and experimental HGFs. 
 Organosulfur (OS) compounds are important sulfur species in atmospheric aerosol particles, due to the reduction of global inorganic sulfur emissions. Understanding the physicochemical properties, such as hygroscopicity, of OS compounds is important for predicting future aerosol–cloud–climate interactions. However, their hygroscopicity is not yet well understood due to the scarcity of authentic standards. In this work, we investigated a group of OS compounds with short carbon chains (C1–C5) and oxygen-containing functional groups in the form of sodium, potassium, or ammonium salts and their mixtures with ammonium sulfate. The hygroscopic growth factors (HGFs) of these OS compounds have been experimentally studied. Here, the HGFs were calculated from mass fraction of water that was computed using the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS). A good agreement was found between the model-estimated and experimental HGFs for the studied OS compounds. This quantum-chemistry-based approach for HGF estimation will open up the possibility of investigating the hygroscopicity of other OS compounds present in the atmosphere."

The product is highly beneficial for supporting vegetation monitoring and sustainable water management at the river basin scale. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is responsible for regulating the hydrological cycle, with a relevant impact on air humidity and precipitation that is particularly important in the context of acute drought events in recent years. With the intensification of rainfall deficits and extreme heat events, the Mediterranean region requires regular monitoring to enhance water resource management. Even though remote sensing provides spatially continuous information for estimating ET on large scales, existing global products with spatial resolutions ≥ 0.5 km are insufficient for capturing spatial detail at a local level. In the framework of ESA's 4DMED-Hydrology project, we generate an ET dataset at both high spatial and high temporal resolutions using the Priestley–Taylor Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB-PT) model driven by Copernicus satellite data. We build an automatic workflow to generate a 100 m ET product by combining data from Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (S3) land surface temperature (LST) with ERA5 climate reanalysis derived within the period 2017–2021 over four Mediterranean basins in Italy, Spain, France, and Tunisia (Po, Ebro, Hérault, and Medjerda). First, original S2 data are pre-processed before deriving 100 m inputs for the ET estimation. Next, biophysical variables, like leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover, are generated, and then they are temporally composited within a 10 d window according to S3 acquisitions. Consequently, decadal S2 mosaics are used to derive the remaining TSEB-PT inputs. In parallel, we sharpen 1 km S3 by exploiting the dependency between coarse-resolution LST and 100 m S2 reflectances using a decision tree algorithm. Afterwards, climate forcings are utilized to model energy fluxes and then for daily ET retrieval. The daily ET composites demonstrate reasonable TSEB-PT estimates. Based on the validation results against eight eddy covariance (EC) towers between 2017 and 2021, the model predicts 100 m ET with an average RMSE of 1.38 mm d−1 and a Pearson coefficient equal to 0.60. Regardless of some constraints mostly related to the high complexity of EC sites, TSEB-PT can effectively estimate 100 m ET, which opens up new opportunities for monitoring the hydrological cycle on a regional scale.

The dataset shows significant spatiotemporal variations of fire PM2.5 in the past decades, serving a useful tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health. 
 Fires are a significant disturbance in Earth’s systems. Smoke aerosols emitted from fires can cause environmental degradation and climatic perturbations, leading to exacerbated air pollution and posing hazards to public health. However, research on the climatic and health impacts of fire emissions is severely limited by the scarcity of air pollution data directly attributed to these emissions. Here, we develop a global daily fire-sourced PM2.5 concentration ([PM2.5]) dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.25° for the period 2000–2023, using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven with two fire emission inventories, the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 with small fires (GFED4.1s) and the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.5r1 (QFED2.5) . Simulated all-source [PM2.5] are bias-corrected using a machine learning algorithm, which incorporates ground observations from over 9000 monitoring sites worldwide. Then the simulated ratios between fire- and all-source [PM2.5] at individual grids are applied to derive fire-sourced [PM2.5]. Globally, the average fire-sourced [PM2.5] is estimated to be 1.94 μg m-3 with GFED4.1s and 3.74 μg m-3 with QFED2.5. Both datasets show consistent spatial distributions with regional hotspots in central Africa and widespread decreasing trends over most areas. While the mean levels of fire-sourced [PM2.5] are much larger at low latitudes, fire episodes at the boreal regions can cause comparable PM2.5 levels as in the tropics. This dataset serves as a valuable tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health, enabling accurate assessments and supports for decision-making in environmental management and policy."

Our methodology ensures consistent, reliable elevation change data, now publicly available via NASA's ITS_LIVE project. The GrIS lost an average of -173 ± 19 Gt a-1 and peripheral glaciers -23 ± 5 Gt a-1 from 1992–2022. The study highlights the importance of continued monitoring to understand climate change impacts on Earth's Cryosphere. 
 The integration of data from multiple satellite altimetry missions, each offering unique observational characteristics, has enabled us to discern both short-term variability and long-term climate trends affecting Greenland’s peripheral glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Our methodology, adapted and informed by lessons learned from our similar efforts in Antarctica, ensures the consistency and reliability of the derived elevation change dataset. The data covers the years 1992–2023 and is made publicly available as part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Inter-Mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project. Our analysis of the dataset reveals significant patterns of mass loss across the GrIS. We find that the ice sheet and peripheral glaciers have experienced an average mass loss of -173 ± 19 Gt a-1 and -23 ± 5 Gt a-1 respectively over the 1992–2022 time period (given temporal availability of selected firn models), with notable variations over time. Specifically, the early years of the record exhibit a positive mass balance, likely due to anomalously positive surface mass balance. However, this trend shifts in subsequent years, with a pronounced increase in mass loss rates, highlighting the accelerating impact of a changing climate on ice sheet dynamics and surface mass balance. Moreover, our analysis underscores the importance of considering peripheral glaciers in addition to the continental ice sheet when assessing overall mass trends. By incorporating data from peripheral glaciers, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of Greenland’s total contributions to global sea level rise. Our findings reveal not only the magnitude of mass loss but also its evolution over time, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and research to better understand the impacts of climate change on Earth's cryosphere."

Both EC and OC are known to be photoactive under solar radiation. However, research on their coupling effect during photochemical aging remains limited. This study examines how the optical properties and oxidative potential (OP) of wood, coal, and diesel soot particles with varying EC and OC levels are affected by exposure to visible light. Wood soot, which has the highest OC content, showed the most significant changes in both optical properties and OP, indicating its highest sensitivity to visible light aging. Molecular composition analysis revealed that the reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and methyl-PAHs primarily affects the optical properties, while oxygenated PAHs play a major role in OP. Combined with the results from reactive oxygen species detection, it is suggested that EC initiates photoreactions by generating superoxide anions, while OC undergoes compositional changes that result in subsequent atmospheric effects.

 In 2022, Europe faced an extensive summer drought with severe socioeconomic consequences. Quantifying the influence of human-induced climate change on such an extreme event can help prepare for future droughts. Here, by combining observations and climate model outputs with hydrological and land-surface simulations, we show that Central and Southern Europe experienced the highest observed total water storage deficit since satellite observations began in 2002, probably representing the highest and most widespread soil moisture deficit in the past six decades. While precipitation deficits primarily drove the soil moisture drought, human-induced global warming contributed to over 30% of the drought intensity and its spatial extent via enhanced evaporation. We identify that 14–41% of the climate change contribution was mediated by the warming-driven drying of the soil that occurred before the hydrological year of 2022, indicating the importance of considering lagged climate change effects to avoid underestimating associated risks. Human-induced climate change had qualitatively similar effects on the extremely low observed river discharges. These results highlight that global warming effects on droughts are already underway, widespread and long lasting, and that drought risk may escalate with further human-induced warming in the future. An attribution analysis using observations, hydrological models and climate models suggests that both direct and lagged effects of climate warming contributed to Europe experiencing the highest observed water storage deficit in the satellite era during the widespread drought of 2022."

 Climate change intensifies fire smoke, emitting hazardous air pollutants that impact human health. However, the global influence of climate change on fire-induced health impacts remains unquantified. Here we used three well-tested fire–vegetation models in combination with a chemical transport model and health risk assessment framework to attribute global human mortality from fire fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions to climate change. Of the 46,401 (1960s) to 98,748 (2010s) annual fire PM2.5 mortalities, 669 (1.2%, 1960s) to 12,566 (12.8%, 2010s) were attributed to climate change. The most substantial influence of climate change on fire mortality occurred in South America, Australia and Europe, coinciding with decreased relative humidity and in boreal forests with increased air temperature. Increasing relative humidity lowered fire mortality in other regions, such as South Asia.

 Fire behaviour is changing in many regions worldwide. However, nonlinear interactions between fire weather, fuel, land use, management and ignitions have impeded formal attribution of global burned area changes. Here, we demonstrate that climate change increasingly explains regional burned area patterns, using an ensemble of global fire models. The simulations show that climate change increased global burned area by 15.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) [13.1–18.7]) for 2003–2019 and increased the probability of experiencing months with above-average global burned area by 22% (95% CI [18–26]). In contrast, other human forcings contributed to lowering burned area by 19.1% (95% CI [21.9–15.8]) over the same period. Moreover, the contribution of climate change to burned area increased by 0.22% (95% CI [0.22–0.24]) per year globally, with the largest increase in central Australia. Our results highlight the importance of immediate, drastic and sustained GHG emission reductions along with landscape and fire management strategies to stabilize fire impacts on lives, livelihoods and ecosystems.

 Pantropical climate interactions across ocean basins operate on a wide range of timescales and can improve the accuracy of climate predictions. Here, we show in observations that Central Pacific (CP) El Niño-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies have coevolved with tropical South Atlantic SST anomalies on a quasi-decadal (~10-year) timescale over the past seven decades. During the austral autumn–winter season, decadal warm SSTs in the tropical CP effectively induce tropical SST cooling in the South Atlantic, mainly by strengthening the South Atlantic subtropical anticyclone via an extratropical atmospheric wave teleconnection in the southern hemisphere. Partially coupled pacemaker simulations corroborate the observational findings, indicating that tropical CP decadal SSTs play a primary pacing role, while Atlantic feedback is of secondary importance throughout the study period.

 Existing evidence suggests that exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) causes various adverse health outcomes through systemic inflammation. We explored the association between PM exposure and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in a Korean population. This cross-sectional study included a representative sample of 21,154 Korean individuals, linked to modeled air quality data from 2015 to 2018. Concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were estimated for 1-week (short-term), 2-month, 4-month, 6-month (medium-term), and 1-year (long-term) moving averages before the survey date for each participant. The association between log-transformed hs-CRP levels and PM exposure was assessed using linear regression. The effect sizes were expressed as percent changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

 The temporal and spatial variations in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fluxes in a city are vital for understanding the magnitude of emissions, their attributes, and the dynamics of air pollutants. We measured NO2 and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes concurrently using the eddy covariance method at 112 m above the ground from 2021 to 2023 in the city center of Sakai, Japan. The mean half-hourly NO2 flux was 13.3 ± 11.9 (±1 standard deviation; SD) nmol m−2 s−1 from January to December 2021–2023. The diurnal pattern of the NO2 flux exhibited a daytime peak, and the daytime NO2 flux was 1.8 times higher on weekdays than on weekends, regardless of the season. Based on flux footprint analysis, the NO2 fluxes were higher on the western side (20–24 nmol m−2 s−1 on average) than on the eastern side (6–10 nmol m−2 s−1 on average). To identify the main emission source areas at a high resolution, we further obtained the NO2, NO, and CO2 concentrations in each street, including major roads leading to industrial areas and nonmajor roads in residential areas, via mobile measurements with a bicycle or vehicle within the flux footprint from October 2022 to August 2023. Notably, the NO2 emission hotspots were major roads leading to the city center and waterfront industrial areas where the traffic volume of heavy-duty trucks mostly comprised diesel-powered vehicles. In addition, we examined the ratio of the NO2 and CO2 fluxes (FNO2/FCO2), which will be beneficial for identifying the characteristics of NO2 because CO2 is co-emitted as vehicle exhaust. The observed flux ratio during day (approximately 0.77 nmol μmol−1) was rescaled to 1.35–1.54 nmol μmol−1 for vehicle origin when contributions of vehicles to CO2 fluxes and contributions of nitric monoxide (NO) fluxes to total NOx (=NO2 + NO) fluxes were approximated. The rescaled ratio was close to the ratio of NOx and CO2 concentrations observed in the tunnel where photochemical reactions can be neglected. Compared to those in other cities, the NO2 fluxes in Sakai were lower, possibly due to the lower prevalence of diesel vehicles. Measured NO2 fluxes are useful for modeling atmospheric pollutants, validating emission inventories, and assessing emission reductions under the implementation of policies issued by local governments."

Since it was initially detected in Uganda in 1998, Ug99 variants have now been identified in thirteen countries in Africa and the Middle East. Stem rust has been a major problem in the past, and concern is increasing about the risk of return to Central and East Asia. Whilst control programs in North America and Europe relied on the use of resistant cultivars in combination with eradication of barberry (Berberis spp.), the alternate host required for the stem rust pathogen to complete its full lifecycle, the focus in East Asia was principally on the use of resistant wheat cultivars. Here, we investigate potential airborne transmission pathways for stem rust outbreaks in the Middle East to reach East Asia using an integrated modelling framework combining estimates of fungal spore deposition from an atmospheric dispersion model, environmental suitability for spore germination, and crop calendar information. We consider the role of mountain ranges in restricting transmission pathways, and we incorporate a representation of a generic barberry species into the lifecycle. We find viable transmission pathways to East Asia from the Middle East to the north via Central Asia and to the south via South Asia and that an initial infection in the Middle East could persist in East Asia for up to three years due to the presence of the alternate host. Our results indicate the need for further assessment of barberry species distributions in East Asia and appropriate methods for targeted surveillance and mitigation strategies should stem rust incidence increase in the Middle East region."

Without activities that create removals by carbon sequestration it will not be possible to balance residual emissions. Policies that focus solely on reducing deforestation will only lower future emissions. On the other hand, activities that include regeneration or regrowth of tree biomass can be used to create net-zero emissions through carbon sequestration and atmospheric removals now. New methods demonstrated here using high resolution remote sensing and deep machine learning enable analyses of carbon stocks of individual trees outside of forests (TOF). Allometric scaling models based on tree crowns at very high spatial resolution (<0.5 m) can map carbon stocks across large landscapes of millions of trees outside of forests. In addition to carbon removals, these landscapes are also important to livelihoods for millions of rural farmers and most TOF activities have the capacity to bring more countries into climate mitigation while also providing adaptation benefits. Here were present a multi-resolution, multi-sensor method that provides a way to measure carbon at the individual tree level in TOF landscapes in India. The results of this analysis show the effectiveness of mapping trees outside of forest across a range of satellite data resolution from 0.5 m to 10 m and for measuring carbon across large landscapes at the individual tree scale."

However, identifying the influence of fire severity on tree cover loss (TCL) is challenging using commonly used categorical metrics. In this study, we quantify regional trends in wildfire-driven TCL as the product of annual burned area, average forest exposure (pre-fire tree cover), and average fire severity (relative loss of tree cover). We quantified these trends with Landsat-based 30 m resolution fire and tree cover datasets for California wildfires from 1986–2021. Rates of TCL rose faster than trends in burned area, with the magnitude of tree cover area loss per unit of area burned increasing by 70% from 0.20 ± 0.05 during 1986–1996 to 0.34 ± 0.10 during 2011–2021. Forest exposure (pre-fire tree cover) within fires increased by 41% from a decadal mean of 23.4% ± 5.5% (1986–1996) to 33.1% ± 7.8% (2011–2021). Increasing forest exposure is associated with a recent expansion of fires in dense northern forests. Concurrently, fire severity (relative TCL) rose by 30% from a decadal mean of 50.4% ± 7.2% during 1986–1996 to 65.6% ± 6.5% during 2011–2021. We developed and applied a simple conceptual framework to quantify the combined effect of wildfires affecting denser forests and burning more severely. The combined effect of these two processes contributed to nearly half (47%) of the TCL since 1986, highlighting that recent changes in burned areas alone cannot explain observed tree cover trends. Linear regression analysis revealed that warmer summers and drier winters were significant drivers of increasing forest exposure, fire severity, and burned area (R2 from 0.54 to 0.80, p ⩽ 0.001), particularly in the northern forests. Climate extremes had a disproportionate impact on dense forests that were once more resistant to wildfire but now face risks from a shifting wildfire regime."

The supplement covers data-processing details. We include examples of output products, comparisons with independent data, and examples of the network capability to provide near-real-time aerosol fields over Italy. ALICENET is expected to benefit the sectors of air quality, radiative budget/solar energy, and aviation safety. 
 Vertically resolved information on aerosol particles represents a key aspect in many atmospheric studies, including aerosol–climate interactions and aerosol impacts on air quality and human health. This information is primarily derived by lidar active remote sensing, in particular with extensive networks currently in operation worldwide. In Italy, the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (ISAC) of the National Research Council (CNR) established the ALICENET network of automated lidar ceilometers (ALCs) in 2015. Since then, ALICENET has grown as a cooperative effort of Italian institutions dealing with atmospheric science and monitoring, and it currently includes instruments run by regional environmental protection agencies, universities, research centres, and private companies. In the current configuration, the network makes use of both single-channel ALCs and dual-channel, polarisation-sensitive-system ALCs (referred to as PLCs). The systems operate in very different environments (urban, coastal, mountainous, and volcanic areas) from northern to southern Italy, thus allowing the continuous monitoring of the aerosol vertical distribution across the country. ALICENET also contributes to the EUMETNET programme E-PROFILE, filling an Italian observational gap compared to other EU member states, which generally run extended ALC networks through national meteorological services. In this work, we present the ALICENET infrastructure and the specifically developed data processing centralised at CNR-ISAC, converting raw instrumental data into quantitative, quality-controlled information on aerosol properties ranging from attenuated backscatter to aerosol mass and vertical stratifications. This setup allows us to get insights into the 4D aerosol field over Italy with applications from near-real-time monitoring to long-term analyses, examples of which are reported in this work. Specific comparisons of the ALICENET products to independent measurements obtained with different techniques, such as particulate matter (PM) concentrations from in situ samplers and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from sun photometers, are also included here, revealing the good performances of the ALICENET algorithms. Overall, ALICENET represents a valuable resource to extend the current aerosol observational capabilities in Italy and in the Mediterranean area, and it contributes to bridging the gap between atmospheric science and its application to specific sectors, among which are air quality, solar energy, and aviation safety."

However, the mechanism of toxicity evolution is not fully clarified currently. This study demonstrates that photoaging promotes an increase in the oxidative potential (OP) of atmospheric PM by about 30%, and the increased OP is mainly attributed to the production of secondary organic compounds, while water-soluble metal ions contribute only 11%. The OP of nonextractable matters (NEMs) of atmospheric PM was mostly increased after photoaging, followed by water-soluble matters (WSMs). NEM can produce quinone-like functional groups and secondary persistent free radicals during photoaging, which are most likely to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). For WSM, the conversion of low-oxidation humic-like substances (HULIS) to high-oxidation HULIS is the main reason for the increase in OP. Quinones, nitrophenols, and N-containing heterocycles are the OP contributors produced during the conversion process. Among them, quinones are the main secondary oxidizing active compounds, while nitro-phenolic compounds and N-containing heterocyclic compounds may play a catalyst-like role, facilitating the production of oxidizing active compounds and ROS in the newly converted high-oxidation HULIS. This study clarifies the secondary OP generation mechanism and provides new insights into the uncertainty of PM toxicity during atmospheric aging."

Thereinto, metal organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts have been widely employed for heterogeneous catalysis because of their high porosity to confine noble metal particles faraway from aggregation. However, the potential reactions between residual species from the material synthesis process and target pollutants, which could form highly toxic byproducts, are often neglected. Herein, we took the widely used Zr-MOF, UiO-66, with highly thermal stability supported Pd catalysts as the example to investigate how the residual species in catalysts are involved in aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) degradation reaction. The results showed that residual Cl species originated from the ZrCl4 metal precursor participated in the VOC degradation reaction, leading to the production of various chlorine-containing byproducts, even the hypertoxicity dioxin precursor, dichlorobenzene. Meanwhile, the chlorination mechanism for the formation of chlorine-containing byproducts was revealed by density functional theory calculation. Furthermore, the highly efficient residual Cl removal approaches are proposed. Importantly, the migration and transformation of residual Cl during the degradation of five benzene series VOCs are comprehensively studied and elucidated. We anticipate that these findings will raise alarm about the neglected issue of residual species in MOF-based catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis, especially environmentally friendly catalysis."

BBOA adversely affects public health and perturbs the climate. Although African fires account for over 50% of worldwide BB-derived organic emissions, few studies have systematically analyzed molecular tracers of BBOA in fresh versus photochemically aged BB emissions representative of African fires. Therefore, by using gas chromatography interfaced to electron ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS), we chemically characterized aerosol filter samples collected from both fresh and photochemically aged BB emissions of six biomass fuels found in Sub-Saharan Africa (Cordia africana, Baikiaea plurijuga, Acacia erioloba, Colophospermum mopane, cow dung, and a fuel mixture). BB emissions were generated from a furnace mimicking smoldering combustion and subsequently injected into a humidified laboratory chamber (70% ± 3% RH). Seventeen known BBOA tracer compounds (e.g., levoglucosan, mannosan, coniferyl alcohol, catechol, and palmitic acid) were targeted, quantified, and compared between fresh and photochemically aged BB emissions. Furthermore, total-suspended atmospheric particulate matter (PM) samples collected from Botswana during the fire season were also analyzed by GC/EI-MS. We identified laboratory-generated BBOA constituents that were also found in Botswana PM that could plausibly serve as unique tracers (e.g., D-pinitol) for African BBOA during future field studies."

A Nationally Representative Cohort Study (2007–2017),"Several studies reported that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use could alleviate subclinical effects of short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, whether chronic NSAID use could mitigate the long-term effects of PM2.5 and its components on population mortality has been unknown. Based on a national representative survey of 47,086 adults (2007–2010) with follow-up information on the primary cause of death (until 2017), we investigated the long-term associations of PM2.5 and its major components, including black carbon (BC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3–), organic matter (OM), and sulfate (SO42–), with all-cause and cause-specific mortality using the Cox proportional hazards model. We also evaluated the effect modification by NSAID use (including broad NSAIDs, aspirin, or ibuprofen) on the associations using interaction models. Long-term exposures to PM2.5 and its components were associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, where BC, OM, and SO42– showed stronger associations. Ibuprofen use could mitigate the associations of PM2.5 and its components with mortality risks, while no significant modifying effects of aspirin were observed. For instance, along with per interquartile range increment in PM2.5 concentration (34.8 μg/m3), the hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality were 1.21 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.22) and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) in nonibuprofen and ibuprofen use groups (P for interaction = 0.026), respectively. Cause-specific analyses indicated that ibuprofen use could mainly mitigate risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) especially ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality attributable to PM2.5 components. Stratified analyses found more apparent mitigating effects of ibuprofen use among participants without chronic diseases, participants ≤50 years, female participants, rural residents, and those with lower education levels. Our findings suggested potential implications in reducing population mortality caused by long-term exposures to PM2.5 and its components through personalized interventions."

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) interact with biomolecules in intracellular and microenvironments, such as the epithelial lining fluid (ELF), leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS trigger cellular inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, contributing to a spectrum of diseases affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. Extensive epidemiological and toxicological research highlights the pivotal role of ROS in air pollution-related diseases. It is crucial to comprehend the intricate chemical processes and accompanying physiological effects of ROS from air pollutants. This review aims to systematically summarize ROS generation mechanisms in the ELF and measurement techniques of oxidative potential (OP), taking the kinetic reactions of ROS cycling in the ELF as an example, and discusses the general health implications of ROS in respiratory, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems.

The eastward‐moving large‐scale convective system associated with the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) significantly impact global weather and climate. Recent decades have seen notable changes in the MJO's lifecycle due to non‐uniform tropical ocean warming, with the roles of natural climate variability and anthropogenic influence still requiring quantification. This study examines observed and projected long‐term changes in the MJO phase speed using four twentieth‐century reanalyses and CMIP6 simulations. We find a substantial increase in MJO phase speed in three reanalyses during the twentieth century (0.6–1.2 m s⁻1 century⁻1) and further increase in MJO phase speed during the twenty‐first century (0.3–1.5 m s⁻1 century⁻1), with notable multidecadal fluctuations. We attribute the overall acceleration of the MJO to the global warming‐driven increase in the meridional moisture gradient around the warm pool while attributing the multidecadal variability in the MJO phase speed to changes in the zonal moisture gradient associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation."

Our method reproduces the general features that the eruption plume types depend on, both the meteorological conditions and eruption conditions, and successfully reproduces the classification of the plume types for historical eruption events. Application of the method to Monte Carlo simulations revealed that eruption plumes at a low latitude tend to form strong plumes due to weak ambient winds, whereas eruption plumes at a mid latitude tend to form weak plumes due to the strong ambient winds associated with the jet stream. The simulation also revealed that mid‐latitude eruption plumes tend to be strong plumes in the summer when ambient winds are lowered by a weakening and poleward movement of the jet stream."

The long‐term SST increase associated with climate change is identified by comparing detrended and original anomalies. Detrending removes the effect of the intensification of SST anomaly over time, revealing that no significant anomalies generally emerge in the early stages of the TLC lifetimes. Conversely, winter events exhibit early‐stage positive SST anomalies. Also, high SST values were observed during the intensification of the most intense cyclones. A cold SST anomaly is left after the passage of the cyclones, due to the intense sea surface fluxes extracting heat from the sea."

Arnold;Stefano Decesari;Gilberto J. Fochesatto;Jingqiu Mao;William Simpson,Unraveling Urban NOx Emission Sources in Polluted Arctic Wintertime Using NO2 Nitrogen Isotopes,"
Nitrogen (N) isotopic fractionation during nitrogen oxides (NOx) cycling and conversion into atmospheric nitrate alters the original N isotopic composition (δ15N) of NOx emissions. Limited quantification of these isotopic effects in urban settings hampers the δ15N‐based identification and apportionment of NOx sources. δ15N of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured during winter in downtown Fairbanks, Alaska, displayed a large temporal variability, from −10.2 to 24.1‰. δ15N(NO2) records are found to be driven by equilibrium isotopic fractionation, at a rate in very close agreement with theoretical predictions. This result confirms that N isotopic partitioning between NO and NO2 can be accurately predicted over a wide range of conditions. This represents an important step for inferring NOx emission sources from isotopic composition measurement of reactive nitrogen species. After correcting our δ15N(NO2) measurements for N fractionation effects, a δ15N‐based source apportionment analysis identifies vehicle and space heating oil emissions as the dominant sources of breathing‐level NOx at this urban site. Despite their large NOx emissions, coal‐fired power plants with elevated chimney stacks (>26 m) appear to make a small contribution to surface NOx levels in downtown Fairbanks (likely less than 18% on average). The combined uncertainties of the δ15N of NOx from heating oil combustion and of the influence of low temperatures on the δ15N of NOx emitted by vehicle exhaust prevent a more detailed partitioning of surface NOx sources in Fairbanks."

 China successfully launched the Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (AEMS) equipped with an Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Lidar (ACDL) on April 16, 2022, which is the world's first satellite based on Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) technique to detect the atmospheric CO2 column-weighted dry-air mixing ratio (XCO2). In order to accurately and quickly process the AEMS measurements, we proposed a systematic retrieval algorithm for the AEMS ACDL and conducted two airborne campaigns to validate its performance. The first airborne campaign was conducted in the land-sea interface region of northeast China in 2019. The CO2 retrieval algorithm distinguished significant horizontal XCO2 gradients over different underlying surfaces and obtained an apparent XCO2 enhancement of 8–18 ppm between the urban and forests. The CO2 retrievals not only demonstrated the excellent detection capability of the ACDL for carbon sources and sinks, but also proved the feasibility of the retrieval algorithm in complex terrain and variable atmospheric conditions. The second airborne experiment was conducted in 2021 in the interior desert region of China, which is an excellent flight field to explore the accuracy and precision limits of the retrieval algorithm. We validated the XCO2 retrievals with the airborne in-situ CO2 profiles and demonstrated that the XCO2 accuracy and precision were 0.29 ppm and 0.63 ppm with 1.5-km averages over the desert surface, indicating the accuracy of the retrieval algorithm. The hard target elevation (HTE) retrieval validation results indicate that the IPDA lidar ranging precision is 0.69 m and 6.29 m for the ocean and land surface, respectively. In addition, further analysis combined with the space-borne IPDA lidar simulator showed high consistency in CO2 precision between airborne measurements and simulation results in East Asia, demonstrating the robustness of the retrieval algorithm at continental scales."

 Surface albedo (SA) is crucial for understanding land surface processes and climate simulation. This study analyzed SA changes and its influencing factors in Central Asia from 2001 to 2020, with projections 2025 to 2100. Factors analyzed included snow cover fraction, fractional vegetation cover, soil moisture, average state climate indices (temperature and precipitation), and extreme climate indices (heatwave indices and extreme precipitation indices). Pearson correlation coefficient, geographical convergent cross mapping, and geographical detector were used to quantify the correlation, causal relationship strength, and impact degree between SA and the influencing factors. To address multicollinearity, ridge regression (RR), geographically weighted ridge regression (GWRR), and piecewise structural equation modeling (pSEM) were combined to construct RR-pSEM and GWRR-pSEM models. Results indicated that SA in Central Asia increased from 2001 to 2010 and decreased from 2011 to 2020, with a projected future decline. There is a strong correlation and significant causality between SA and each factor. Snow cover fraction was identified as the most critical factor influencing SA. Average temperature and precipitation had a greater impact on SA than extreme climate indices, with a 1 °C temperature increase corresponding to a 0.004 decrease in SA. This study enhances understanding of SA changes under climate change, and provides a methodological framework for analyzing complex systems with multicollinearity. The proposed models offer valuable tools for studying interrelated factors in Earth system science."

 Meiyu (plume rain) is a distinctive weather phenomenon during boreal early summer, known for its increased precipitation during El Niño decay years bridged through the northwest Pacific anticyclone (NWPAC). It has been widely acknowledged that super El Niño (SEN) events consistently correspond to more Meiyu. This study highlights the instability in the relationship between El Niño and Meiyu, particularly during normal El Niño (NEN) decay years, where the probability of more or less Meiyu is almost equal by statistical analysis. Using the Liang-Kleeman information flow (LIF), our findings confirm that warming in the Maritime Continent (MC) induced by SEN leads to tropical North Atlantic warming in boreal spring. This suppresses northwest Pacific convection via Kevin waves and forms the north-south dipole mode of the NWPAC (EOF2), corresponding to strong Meiyu. Moreover, it is found that subtropical North Pacific cooling induced by NEN leads to the tropical North Atlantic warming in boreal spring via Pacific North American (PNA) pattern, reinforcing the region-wide consistent mode of the NWPAC (EOF1) via Rossby waves and resulting in strong Meiyu. Conversely, warming in the tropical North Atlantic induced by NEN in boreal early summer leads to anticyclonic circulation over the east of Japan (EOF3) and weak Meiyu. The contributions of these three causal structures to the uncertainty of Meiyu are 31 %, 25.7 %, and 28.2 %, respectively. This study sheds new light on the understanding the significance of NEN for Meiyu, emphasizing the importance of its causal relationship with warming in the tropical North Atlantic."

We study the impact of burning fossil and sustainable aviation fuel on nitrogen oxide emissions at different engine settings related to combustor temperature, pressure and fuel flow. Further, we compare observations with engine emission models. 
 Nitrogen oxides, emitted from air traffic, are of concern due to their impact on climate by changing atmospheric ozone and methane levels. Using the DLR research aircraft Falcon, total reactive nitrogen (NOy) in-flight measurements were carried out at high altitudes to characterize emissions in the fresh aircraft exhaust from the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engine aboard the long-range Airbus A350-941 aircraft during the ECLIF3 (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels 3) experiment. The impact of different engine thrust settings, monitored in terms of combustor inlet temperature, pressure and engine fuel flow, was tested for two different fuel types: Jet A-1 and, for the first time, a 100 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) under similar atmospheric conditions. In addition, a range of combustor temperatures and an additional blended SAF were tested during ground-based emission measurements. For the data measured during ECLIF3, we confirm that the NOx emission index increases with increasing combustion temperature, pressure and fuel flow. We find that as expected, the fuel type has no measurable effect on the NOx emission index. These measurements are used to compare to cruise NOx emission index estimates from three engine emission prediction methods. Our measurements thus help to understand the ground to cruise correlation of current engine emission prediction methods while serving as input for climate modelling and extending the extremely sparse data set on in-flight aircraft nitrogen oxide emissions to newer engine generations."

 Temperature fluctuations induced by mountain waves can play a crucial role in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). In particular, the cold phase of the waves can lower local temperatures sufficiently to trigger PSC formation, even when large-scale background temperatures are too high. To provide new quantitative constraints on the relevance of this effect, this study analyzes a decade (2002–2012) of ice PSC detections obtained from Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) measurements and ERA5 data in the polar winter lower stratosphere. In the MIPAS observations, we find that approximately 52 % of the Arctic ice PSCs and 26 % of the Antarctic ice PSCs are detected at temperatures above the local Tice. Ice PSCs above Tice are concentrated around mountainous regions and their downwind directions. A backward-trajectory analysis is performed to investigate the temperature history of each ice PSC observation. The cumulative fraction of ice PSCs above Tice increases as the trajectory gets closer to the observation point. The most significant change in the fraction of ice PSCs above Tice occurs within the 6 h preceding the observations. At the observation point, the mean fractions of ice PSCs above Tice, taking into account temperature fluctuations along the backward trajectory, are 33 % in the Arctic and 9 % in the Antarctic. The results provide a quantitative assessment of the occurrence of ice PSCs above Tice in connection with orographic waves. Additionally, the observational statistics presented can be utilized for comparison with chemistry climate simulations."
10.5194/acp-24-11791-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了挪威北极地区冷空气爆发事件中气溶胶粒子的尺寸分布特性。研究发现，冷空气爆发期间，海盐气溶胶浓度增加，霍佩尔最小粒径减小，有效过饱和度降低，积累模态粒子被清除。这些结果有助于改进气候模型中冷空气爆发气溶胶-云相互作用的模拟。虽然论文本身没有直接使用卫星遥感数据，但其研究结果对于改进利用卫星观测反演气溶胶和云特性，以及进行大气成分分析至关重要，因为更准确的气溶胶参数化方案能够提高遥感反演的精度。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Aerosol size distribution', 'Cloud condensation nuclei', 'Ice nuclei', 'Sea spray', 'Cold-air outbreaks', 'Arctic aerosols', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations (indirectly)']",Abigail S.

DeMott;Paul Zieger;Radovan Krejci,Aerosol size distribution properties associated with cold-air outbreaks in the Norwegian Arctic,"The measured aerosol size distribution modes reveal distinct properties characteristic of cold-air outbreaks in the Norwegian Arctic. We find higher sea spray number concentrations, smaller Hoppel minima, lower effective supersaturations, and accumulation-mode particle scavenging during cold-air outbreaks. These results advance our understanding of cold-air outbreak aerosol–cloud interactions in order to improve their accurate representation in models. 
 The aerosol particles serving as cloud condensation and ice nuclei contribute to key cloud processes associated with cold-air outbreak (CAO) events but are poorly constrained in climate models due to sparse observations. Here we retrieve aerosol number size distribution modes from measurements at Andenes, Norway, during the Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) and at Zeppelin Observatory, approximately 1000 km upwind from Andenes at Svalbard. During CAO events at Andenes, the sea-spray-mode number concentration is correlated with strong over-ocean winds with a mean of 8±4 cm−3 that is 71 % higher than during non-CAO conditions. Additionally, during CAO events at Andenes, the mean Hoppel minimum diameter is 6 nm smaller than during non-CAO conditions, though the estimated supersaturation is lower, and the mean number concentration of particles that likely activated in-cloud is 109±61 cm−3 with no statistically significant difference from the non-CAO mean of 99±66 cm−3. For CAO trajectories between Zeppelin Observatory and Andenes, the upwind-to-downwind change in number concentration is the largest for the accumulation mode with a mean decrease of 93±95 cm−3, likely attributable primarily to precipitation scavenging. These characteristic properties of aerosol number size distributions during CAO events provide guidance for evaluating CAO aerosol–cloud interaction processes in models."

Compared to hot days alone, ozone concentration decreased notably in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) but increased in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during tropical cyclones and hot days. The YRD benefited from strong and clean sea winds aiding ozone elimination. In contrast, the PRD experienced strong northeasterly winds that potentially transport ozone pollution. 
 China has implemented some air pollution management measures in recent years, yet severe ozone pollution remains a significant issue. The southeastern coast of China (SECC) is often influenced by hot extremes and tropical cyclones (TCs), and the two can occur simultaneously (TC–HDs). The compound TC–HDs show a rising trend in the summers of 2014–2019, potentially affecting ozone pollution. Here, we found that surface ozone concentrations over the SECC are more elevated during extremely hot days than the summer climatology. However, compared to extremely hot days alone (AHDs), the maximum 8 h average ozone (MDA8 O3) concentration increases by an average of 6.8 µg m−3 in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and decreases by 13.2 µg m−3 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during the compound TC–HDs. The meteorological conditions during AHDs favor the chemical production of ozone over the SECC, exhibiting increased temperature and solar radiation and decreased relative humidity. Relative to AHDs, strong northeasterly winds prevail in the SECC during TC–HDs, suggesting the potential of ozone cross-regional transport between YRD and PRD. The process analysis in the chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) suggests that relative to AHDs, the chemical production of ozone is enhanced in YRD during TC–HDs, while horizontal transport alleviates ozone pollution in YRD but worsens it in PRD through cross-regional transport. The results highlight the significant effects of cross-regional transport in modulating ozone pollution in the two megacity clusters during hot extremes accompanied by TC activities, giving insight into future ozone control measures over the SECC under global warming."

Meyer;Lisa R. Welp,Water vapor stable isotope memory effects of common tubing materials,"Water molecules stick to air intake tubing wall surfaces, smoothing measurements of fast isotopic variability in the atmosphere. We tested this stickiness and saw small differences in isotopic signal speed between materials, tubing inner dimensions, and isotopic switch direction, although no consistent temperature effects. Researchers can confidently compare measurements across observation systems using different commonly used tubing materials and plan for optimal inlet designs of new systems. 
 Water molecules in vapor can exchange with gaseous water molecules sticking to surfaces of sampling tubing, and exchange rates are unique for each water isotopologue and tubing material. Therefore, water molecules on tubing walls take some time to reach isotopic equilibrium with a new vapor isotopic signal. This creates a memory effect that is observed as attenuation time for signal propagation in continuous stable water vapor isotope measurement systems. Tubing memory effects in δD and δ18O measurements can limit the ability to observe fast changes, and because δD and δ18O memory are not identical, this introduces transient deuterium excess (D-excess, defined as δD-8×δ18O) artifacts in time-varying observations. To our knowledge, a comprehensive performance comparison of commonly used tubing material water exchange properties in laser-based measurement systems has not been published.We compared how a large isotopic step change propagated through five commonly used tubing materials for water isotopic studies – perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and copper – at two different temperatures and an airflow rate of 0.635 L min−1 through approximately 100 ft (30.5 m) of 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) outer diameter (o.d.) tubing. All commonly used tubing materials performed similarly to each other in terms of attenuation times, reaching δ18O-location-adjusted δD and δ18O 95 % completion in less than 45 s, with slight variations based on temperature. PFA does appear to perform slightly better than the other materials, although memory metric differences are small. A tubing material commonly used in the early 2000s but reported to have memory effects on δD, Dekabon, was also tested at ambient temperature and changing humidities. The Dekabon isotopic equilibrium was not reached until nearly an hour after source transition, much later than H2O mixing ratios equilibrated. Bev-A-Line XX (used in some soil O2 and CO2 gas studies) was also tested at ambient temperature, but it did not approach isotopic equilibrium until after nearly 6 h of testing. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of Bev-A-Line XX or Dekabon in water vapor isotope applications. Source transition from heavy to light or from light to heavy affected isotopic transition speed only in experiments where H2O ppmv was changing. While a shorter tubing lengths and smaller inner diameters shorten the delay of signal propagation through the tubing, they did not greatly change the attenuation curves under these conditions for the current commonly used tubing materials tested. However, in Dekabon, attenuation curves were greatly extended with increased tubing length. Our results show that the commonly used plastic tubing materials tested were not inferior to copper in terms of isotopic memory under these conditions, and they are easier to work with and are less expensive than copper."

Meijer;Sebastian D. Eastham;Ian A. Waitz;Steven R. H. Barrett,Contrail altitude estimation using GOES-16 ABI data and deep learning,"Aviation's climate impact is partly due to contrails: the clouds that form behind aircraft and which can linger for hours under certain atmospheric conditions. Accurately forecasting these conditions could allow aircraft to avoid forming these contrails and thus reduce their environmental footprint. Our research uses deep learning to identify three-dimensional contrail locations in two-dimensional satellite imagery, which can be used to assess and improve these forecasts. 
 The climate impact of persistent aircraft contrails is currently estimated to be comparable to that due to aviation-emitted CO2. A potential near-term and low-cost mitigation option is contrail avoidance, which involves rerouting aircraft around ice-supersaturated regions, preventing the formation of persistent contrails. Current forecasting methods for these regions of ice supersaturation have been found to be inaccurate when compared to in situ measurements. Further assessment and improvements of the quality of these predictions can be realized by comparison with observations of persistent contrails, such as those found in satellite imagery. In order to further enable comparison between these observations and contrail predictions, we develop a deep learning algorithm to estimate contrail altitudes based on GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)  infrared imagery. This algorithm is trained using a dataset of 3267 contrails found within Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data and achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 570 m. The altitude estimation algorithm outputs probability distributions for the contrail top altitude in order to represent predictive uncertainty. The 95 % confidence intervals constructed using these distributions, which are shown to contain approximately 95 % of the contrail data points, are found to be 2.2 km thick on average. These intervals are found to be 34.1 % smaller than the 95 % confidence intervals constructed using flight altitude information alone, which are 3.3 km thick on average. Furthermore, we show that the contrail altitude estimates are consistent in time and, in combination with contrail detections, can be used to observe the persistence and three-dimensional (3D) evolution of contrail-forming regions from satellite images alone."

The DLR GEMS NO2 retrieval algorithm follows the heritage from previous and existing algorithms, but improved approaches are applied to reflect the specific features of geostationary satellites. The DLR GEMS NO2 retrievals demonstrate a good capability for monitoring diurnal variability with a high spatial resolution. 
 In this study, we develop an advanced retrieval algorithm for tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the geostationary satellite instruments and apply it to Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) observations. Overall, the algorithm follows previous heritage for the polar-orbiting satellites Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), but several improvements are implemented to account for specific features of geostationary satellites.The DLR GEMS NO2 retrieval employs an extended fitting window compared to the current fitting window used in GEMS operational v2.0 NO2 retrieval, which results in improved spectral fit quality and lower uncertainties. For the stratosphere–troposphere separation in GEMS measurements, two methods are developed and evaluated: (1) STRatospheric Estimation Algorithm from Mainz (STREAM) as used in the DLR TROPOMI NO2 retrieval and adapted to GEMS and (2) estimation of stratospheric NO2 columns from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Integrated Forecast System (IFS) cycle 48R1 model data, which introduce full stratospheric chemistry as it will be used in the operational Sentinel-4 NO2 retrieval. While STREAM provides hourly estimates of stratospheric NO2, it has limitations in describing small-scale variations and exhibits systematic biases near the boundary of the field of view. In this respect, the use of estimated stratospheric NO2 columns from the CAMS forecast model profile demonstrates better applicability by describing not only diurnal variation but also small-scale variations.For the improved air mass factor (AMF) calculation, sensitivity tests are performed using different input data. In our algorithm, cloud fractions retrieved from the Optical Cloud Recognition Algorithm (OCRA) adapted to GEMS level 1 data are applied instead of the GEMS v2.0 cloud fraction. OCRA is used operationally in TROPOMI and Sentinel-4. Compared to the GEMS level 2 cloud fraction which is typically set to around 0.1 for clear-sky scenes, OCRA sets cloud fractions close to or at 0. The OCRA-based cloud corrections result in increased tropospheric AMFs and decreased tropospheric NO2 vertical columns, leading to better agreement with results from existing TROPOMI observations. The effects of surface albedo on GEMS tropospheric NO2 retrievals are assessed by comparing the GEMS v2.0 background surface reflectance (BSR) and TROPOMI Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) climatology v2.0 product. The differences between the two surface albedo products and their impact on tropospheric AMF are particularly pronounced over snow/ice scenes during winter. A priori NO2 profiles from the CAMS forecast model, applied in the DLR GEMS algorithm, effectively capture variations in NO2 concentrations throughout the day with high spatial resolution and the advanced chemical mechanism, which demonstrates its suitability for geostationary satellite measurements.The retrieved DLR GEMS tropospheric NO2 columns show good capability for capturing hotspot signals at the scale of city clusters and describe spatial gradients from city centres to surrounding areas. Diurnal variations of tropospheric NO2 columns over Asia are well described through hourly sampling of GEMS. Evaluation of DLR GEMS tropospheric NO2 columns against TROPOMI v2.4 and GEMS v2.0 operational products shows overall good agreement. The uncertainty of DLR GEMS tropospheric NO2 vertical columns varies based on observation scenarios. In regions with low pollution levels such as open-ocean and remote rural areas, retrieval uncertainties typically range from 10 % to 50 %, primarily due to uncertainties in slant columns. For heavily polluted regions, uncertainties in tropospheric NO2 columns are mainly driven by errors in tropospheric AMF calculations. Notably, the total uncertainty in GEMS tropospheric NO2 columns is most significant in winter, particularly over heavily polluted regions with low-level clouds below or near the NO2 peak."

However, the viscosity of sea spray aerosols (SSA) has not been widely studied. This research explored the relationship between particle size and viscosity of authentic SSA particles through particle bounce, atomic force microscopy analysis, and predictive viscosity modeling from molecular composition. The study found that 40 nm SSA particles had estimated viscosities around 104 Pa·s and bounce fractions three times higher than 100 and 200 nm particles with less than 102 Pa·s at a relative humidity (RH) of 60%. Additional studies revealed the Kelvin effect and particle density, influenced by particle size, have a greater impact on size-dependent bounce fractions than changes in RH across impactor stages. While changes in the level of surfactants can impact particle bounce, the increased viscosity in smaller SSA is attributed to the formation of gel-like phase states caused by cation–organic cross-links between divalent calcium ions and organic anions enriched in the smaller particles. This work shows the smallest gel-like SSA particles observed in the field are highly viscous, which has implications for cloud formation, secondary aerosol growth, and pollutant transport in coastal environments."

During processing in deep convective cloud systems, highly viscous or glassy secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles can develop a porous structure through a process known as atmospheric freeze‐drying. This structural modification may enhance their heterogeneous ice nucleation ability under cirrus conditions through the pore condensation and freezing mechanism. Pristine, compact SOA particles, on the other hand, are recommended to be treated as ice‐inactive in models. This recommendation also applies to internally mixed particles, where a coating layer of secondary organic matter (SOM) deactivates the intrinsic ice nucleation ability of the core, which may be a mineral dust grain. Ice cloud‐processing may also improve the ice nucleation ability of such a composite particle by inducing structural changes in the coating layer, which can release active sites on the mineral surface. In this work, we investigated the change in the ice nucleation ability of pure SOA particles from the ozonolysis of α‐pinene and two types of internally mixed particles (zeolite and coal fly ash particles coated with SOM) after being subjected to the atmospheric freeze‐drying process simulated in an expansion cloud chamber. For pure α‐pinene SOA, we found only a slight improvement in the ice nucleation ability of the ice cloud‐processed, porous particles compared to their pristine, compact counterparts at 221 and 217 K. In contrast, the zeolite and coal fly ash particles, which were initially deactivated by the organic coating, became significantly more ice‐active after atmospheric freeze‐drying, emphasizing that such composite particles cannot be excluded from model simulations of heterogeneous ice formation."

Permafrost ecosystems in high‐latitudes stock a large amount of carbon and are vulnerable to wildfires under climate warming. However, major knowledge gap remains in the effects of direct carbon loss from increasing wildfire biomass burning on permafrost ecosystem carbon sink. In this study, we used observation‐derived data sets and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations to investigate how carbon emissions from wildfire biomass burning offset permafrost ecosystem carbon sink under climate warming in the 21st century. We show that the fraction of permafrost ecosystem carbon sink offset by wildfire emissions was 14%–25% during the past two decades. The fraction is projected to be 28%–45% at the end of this century under different warming scenarios. The weakening carbon sink is caused by greater increase in wildfire emissions than net ecosystem production in permafrost regions under climate warming. The increased fraction of ecosystem carbon sink offset by wildfire carbon loss is especially pronounced in continuous permafrost region during the past two decades. Although uncertainties exist in simulations of wildfire emissions and ecosystem carbon budget, results from different models still show that wildfire emissions offset more permafrost ecosystem carbon sink in the 21st century. These findings highlight that carbon sink capacity of permafrost ecosystems is increasingly threatened by wildfires under the warming climate."

 Solar Radiation Management (SRM) is a climate intervention strategy aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing incoming solar radiation. We investigate the potential influence of SRM on Andean glacier-wide surface mass balance, as glaciers are crucial for downstream ecological functions along the west coast of South America. We numerically simulate the surface mass balance response of thousands of glaciers to SRM and other climate change scenarios throughout the 21st century. Results indicate Pan-Andean negative mass balance, irrespective of the scenario or glacier-climate regimes. However, SRM tends to modify interannual variability and temperature sensitivity in several regions. Our findings also suggest that if SRM had been implemented in the late 1980’s, it would have been effective in avoiding the negative trajectory seen today. The Andes feature nearly all mountain hydroclimatic regimes, representing a globally relevant example of SRM impacts. These findings emphasize the urgency of drastic emissions reduction."

 In August 2022, Pakistan experienced unprecedented monsoon rains, leading to devastating floods and landslides affecting millions. While previous research has mainly focused on the contributions of seasonal and synoptic anomalies, this study elucidates the dominant influences of tropical and extratropical intraseasonal oscillations on both the occurrence and subseasonal prediction of this extreme rainfall event. Our scale-decomposed moisture budget analysis revealed that intense rainfall in Pakistan was triggered and sustained by enhanced vertical moisture transport anomalies, primarily driven by interactions between intraseasonal circulation anomalies and the prevailing background moisture field when tropical and mid-latitude systems coincided over Pakistan. Evaluation of subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction models further highlighted the critical role of tropical intraseasonal modes in causing this extreme rainfall event in Pakistan. Models that accurately predicted northward-propagating intraseasonal convection with a forecast lead time of 8–22 days demonstrated good skill in predicting the extreme event over Pakistan."

 During the past decade, substantial efforts have been dedicated to advancing cost-effective sensor platforms for air quality monitoring. Calibration is a crucial step in ensuring that the data quality of low-cost air monitoring systems meets established standards. Recent research has extensively evaluated low-cost air monitoring platforms against the data quality objectives set by the European Directive. This paper introduces a novel calibration model for low-cost air quality sensors, significantly improving the accuracy of the measurement of nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10), while promoting accessibility and adaptability in environmental monitoring technologies. This study extends the evaluation of a developed platform capable of integrating a diverse array of sensors to measure up to 12 parameters. Our proposed models demonstrate a significant improvement, achieving a 60% better accuracy for SO2. Additionally, these models deliver similar results for PMx and NO or exceed those of state of the art research. The calibration methodology meets the requirements of the Data Quality Objectives (DQO) for all monitored parameters and also achieves indicative levels for PM parameters."

Observational constraints revealed opposing trends in the mass absorption cross sections of black carbon (BC MAC) and brown carbon (BrC MAC) during long-range transport. Models estimating the climate effects of BC aerosols may have underestimated the ambient BC MAC over distant receptor areas, leading to discrepancies in aerosol absorption predicted by observation-constrained models. 
 Atmospheric aerosols strongly influence the global climate through their light absorption properties (e.g., black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC)) and scattering properties (e.g., sulfate). This study presents simultaneous measurements of ambient-aerosol light absorption properties and chemical composition obtained at three large-footprint southern Asian receptor sites during the South Asian Pollution Experiment (SAPOEX) from December 2017 to March 2018. The BC mass absorption cross section (BC-MAC678) values increased from 3.5 ± 1.3 at the Bangladesh Climate Observatory at Bhola (BCOB), located at the exit outflow of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, to 6.4 ± 1.3 at two regional receptor observatories, the Maldives Climate Observatory at Hanimaadhoo (MCOH) and the Maldives Climate Observatory at Gan (MCOG), representing an increase of 80 %. This likely reflects a scavenging fractionation, resulting in a population of finer BC with higher MAC678 that has greater longevity. At the same time, BrC-MAC365 decreased by a factor of 3 from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) exit to the equatorial Indian Ocean, likely due to photochemical bleaching of organic chromophores. The high chlorine-to-sodium ratio at the BCOB, located near the source region, suggests a significant contribution of chorine from anthropogenic activities. Particulate Cl− has the potential to be converted into Cl radicals, which can affect the oxidation capacity of polluted air. Moreover, Cl− is shown to be nearly fully consumed during long-range transport. The results of this synoptic study, conducted on a large southern Asian scale, provide rare observational constraints on the optical properties of ambient BC (and BrC) aerosols over regional scales, away from emission sources. They also contribute significantly to understanding the aging effect of the optical and chemical properties of aerosols as pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plain disperses over the tropical ocean."

 Accurate estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks are critical for understanding the carbon cycle and identifying key drivers of anthropogenic climate change. In this study, we investigate the variability in CO and CO2 concentrations and their ratio over the Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) using long-term, time-resolved columnar measurements at three stations, employing solar-absorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Using a simple model and the mixed-layer height derived from a ceilometer, we determined the CO and CO2 concentrations in the mixed layer from the total column measurements and found good agreement with surface cavity ring-down spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we used the diurnal pattern of CO columnar measurements at specific time intervals to estimate an average growth rate that, when combined with the space-based Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) CO measurements, allowed for the derivation of annual CO and CO2 MCMA emissions from 2016 to 2021. A CO emission decrease of more than 50 % was found during the COVID-19 lockdown period with respect to the year 2018. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using long-term EM27/SUN column measurements to monitor the annual variability in the anthropogenic CO2 and CO emissions in Mexico City without recourse to complex transport models. This simple methodology could be adapted to other urban areas if the orography of the regions favours low ventilation for several hours per day and the column growth rate is dominated by the emission flux."

Sá;Alessandro Araújo;Jürgen Kesselmeier;Jos Lelieveld;Jonathan Williams,Investigating carbonyl compounds above the Amazon rainforest using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) with NO+ chemical ionization,"We show the average height distribution of separately observed aldehydes and ketones over a day and discuss their rainforest-specific sources and sinks as well as their seasonal changes above the Amazon. Ketones have much longer atmospheric lifetimes than aldehydes and thus different implications for atmospheric chemistry. However, they are commonly observed together, which we overcome by measuring with a NO+ chemical ionization mass spectrometer for the first time in the Amazon rainforest. 
 The photochemistry of carbonyl compounds significantly influences tropospheric chemical composition by altering the local oxidative capacity; free radical abundance in the upper troposphere; and formation of ozone, peroxycarboxylic nitric anhydride (PAN), and secondary organic aerosol particles. Carbonyl compounds can be emitted directly from the biosphere into the atmosphere and are formed through photochemical degradation of various precursor compounds. Aldehydes have atmospheric lifetimes of hours to days, whereas ketones persist for up to several weeks. While standard operating conditions for a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) using H3O+ ions are unable to separate aldehydes and ketones, the use of NO+ reagent ions allows for the differential detection of isomeric carbonyl compounds with a high temporal resolution. Here we study the temporal (24 h) and vertical (80–325 m) variability of individual carbonyl compounds in the Amazon rainforest atmosphere with respect to their rainforest-specific sources and sinks. We found strong sources of ketones within or just above the canopy (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and C5 ketones). A common feature of the carbonyls was nocturnal deposition observed by loss rates, most likely since oxidized volatile organic compounds are rapidly metabolized and utilized by the biosphere. With NO+ chemical ionization, we show that the dominant carbonyl species include acetone and propanal, which are present at a ratio of 1 : 10 in the wet-to-dry transition season and 1 : 20 in the dry season."

This study presents a conceptual model of the formation of HIWC in tropical MCSs based on in situ observations and numerical simulation. 
 The phenomenon of high ice water content (HIWC) occurs in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) when a large number of small ice particles with typical sizes of a few hundred micrometers, concentrations of the order of 102–103 L−1, and IWC exceeding 1 g m−3 are present at high altitudes. HIWC regions in MCSs may extend vertically up to 10 km above the melting layer and horizontally up to hundreds of kilometers, filling large volumes of the convective systems. HIWC has great geophysical significance due to its effect on precipitation formation, the hydrological cycle, and the radiative properties of MCSs. It is also recognized as a hazard for commercial aviation operations since it can result in engine power loss and in the malfunctioning of aircraft data probes. This study summarizes observational and numerical simulation efforts leading to the development of a conceptual model for the production of HIWC in tropical MCSs based on the data collected during the HAIC–HIWC campaign. It is hypothesized that secondary ice production (SIP) in the vicinity of the melting layer plays a key role in the formation and sustainability of HIWC. In situ observations suggest that the major SIP mechanism in the vicinity of the melting layer is related to the fragmentation of freezing drops (FFDs). Both in situ data and numerical simulations suggest that the recirculation of drops through the melting layer led to the amplification of SIP. The proposed conceptual model and simulation results motivate further efforts to extend reproducible laboratory measurements."

 Sea ice altimetry currently remains the primary method for estimating sea ice thickness from space, however time-series of sea ice thickness estimates are of limited use without having been quality-controlled against reference measurements. Such reference observations for sea ice thickness validation in the polar regions are sparse and rarely presented in a format matching the satellite-derived products. Here, the first published comprehensive collection of sea ice reference observations including freeboard, thickness, draft and snow depth from sea ice-covered regions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is presented. The observations have been collected using airborne sensors, autonomous drifting buoys, moored and submarine-mounted upward-looking sonars, and visual observations. The data package has been prepared to match the spatial (25 km for NH and 50 km for SH) and temporal (monthly) resolutions of conventional satellite altimetry-derived sea ice thickness data products for a direct evaluation of these.

Subtropical forests are crucial in carbon and water exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere. However, the NBL characteristics and their impact on atmospheric species over these forests remain unknown. This study conducted vertical measurements of atmospheric species such as O3 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), along with meteorological variables, over a national forest reserve in Southern China. Results reveal that the NBL height ranged from 180 to 300 m in the summer and from 80 to 160 m in the winter. The vertical distribution of chemical species varied by time and season, with greater concentration gradients observed in the summer. Over 90% of VOCs above the NBL were anthropogenic, while biogenic VOCs were mainly found within the NBL. Higher O3 concentration and VOC product-to-reactant ratios were observed in the residual layer, suggesting enhanced oxidation levels. This unique vertical distribution of atmospheric species at night is driven by factors, such as emission, deposition, turbulence, and atmospheric chemistry, potentially affecting ecosystem functions. Results from this study highlight the importance of incorporating NBL dynamics into atmospheric models to better understand the evolution of chemical species and their ecological effects over forests."

Both lateral transport and in situ oxic methane production (OMP) have been suggested as potential sources. While the latter has been recently supported by increasing evidence, quantifying the exact contribution of OMP to atmospheric emissions remains challenging. Based on a large high-resolution field data set collected during 2019–2020 in the deep stratified Lake Stechlin and on three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, we improved existing CH4 budgets by resolving each component of the mass balance model at a seasonal scale and therefore better constrained the residual OMP. All terms in our model showed a large temporal variability at scales from intraday to seasonal, and the modeled OMP was most sensitive to the surface CH4 flux estimates. Future efforts are needed to reduce the uncertainties in estimating OMP rates using the mass balance approach by increasing the frequency of atmospheric CH4 flux measurements."

Therefore, understanding whether the formation of O3 is NOx- or VOC-limited is essential for effective air quality management. Recently, we demonstrated that the distribution of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) can be used as a real-time indicator to determine the sensitivity of the O3 formation regime in monoterpene oxidation chamber studies. The key reactions between peroxy radicals and NO that form O3 also determine the branching between nitrate-containing and non-nitrate HOM species. However,  validation outside laboratory conditions is lacking. This study evaluates the HOM-based indicator’s applicability at a boreal forest station in Hyytiälä, Finland. Using model scenarios with doubled NOx or VOC emissions as references, we find that the monoterpene HOM-based indicator can determine O3 formation sensitivity regimes at this site.

Skill in predicting where damaging convective storms will occur is limited, particularly in the tropics. In principle, near‐surface soil moisture (SM) patterns from previous storms provide an important source of skill at the mesoscale, yet these structures are often short‐lived (hours to days), due to both soil drying processes and the impact of new storms. Here, we use satellite observations over the Sahel to examine how the strong, locally negative, SM‐precipitation feedback there impacts rainfall patterns over subsequent days. The memory of an initial storm pattern decays rapidly over the first 3–4 days, but a weak signature is still detected in surface observations 10–20 days later. The wet soil suppresses rainfall over the storm track for the first 2–8 days, depending on aridity regime. Whilst the negative SM feedback initially enhances mesoscale rainfall predictability, the transient nature of SM likely limits forecast skill on sub‐seasonal time scales."

The results of probabilistic event attribution studies depend on the choice of the extreme value statistics used in the analysis, particularly with the arbitrariness in the selection of appropriate thresholds to define extremes. We bypass this issue by using the Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (ExtGPD), which jointly models low precipitation with a generalized Pareto distribution and extremes with a different Pareto tail, to conduct daily precipitation attribution across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We apply the ExtGPD to 12 general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and compare counterfactual scenarios with and without anthropogenic emissions. Observed precipitation by the Climate Prediction Center is used for evaluating the GCMs. We find that greenhouse gases rather than natural variability can explain the observed magnitude of extreme daily precipitation, especially in the temperate regions.

We compute fractal parameters which compactly characterize the scaling behavior of clouds and can be compared across simulations and observations. We use this method to evaluate the nextGEMS ICON simulations via comparison with observations from the geostationary satellite GOES‐16. We find that multifractal scaling exponents in the ICON model are significantly lower than in observations.

This study implemented a coupled WRF‐Urban Asymmetric Convective Model (WRF‐UACM) for Delhi, India, integrating explicit urban physics with Sentinel‐updated USGS land‐use and urban morphological parameters derived from the UT‐GLOBUS dataset. When evaluated against the baseline Asymmetric Convective Model (WRF‐BACM) using Winter Fog Experiment (WiFEX) data, WRF‐UACM significantly improved urban meteorological variables such as diurnal variations in 10‐m wind speed, 2‐m air temperature (T2), and 2‐m relative humidity (RH2) during a fog event. UACM also demonstrates improved accuracy in simulating temperature and significantly reducing biases for wind speed and daytime RH2 under clear sky conditions. UACM reproduced the nighttime urban heat island effect within the city, showing realistic diurnal heating and cooling patterns that are important for accurate fog onset and duration. UACM effectively predicts the onset, evolution, and dissipation of fog, aligning well with observed data and satellite imagery. Compared to WRF‐BACM, WRF‐UACM reduces the cold bias soon after sunset, thus improving the fog onset error by ∼3 hr. This study highlights the UACM's potential to improve fog prediction and its application in operational settings. With further investigation into different fog types, the UACM can provide crucial insights for preventive measures and reducing disruptions in urban areas."

Aeolus winds improve the tropospheric wind and temperature forecasts by about 0.7%–0.9% of error reduction (a 15%–20% effect compared to the impact of operational wind products) while having little impact on specific humidity. In particular, Aeolus winds have an impact on forecasts of strong wind days on the wind and temperature fields that is double the impact for weaker wind days. On the other hand, the operational wind products do not show as large a discrepancy in impact between forecasts of disturbed and normal days.

 Air pollution in South Asia is a health emergency, responsible for 2 million deaths every year1. Crop residue burning accounts for 40–60% of peak pollution during the winter harvest months2,3. Despite being illegal, this practice remains widespread4,5. Any solution to curb the problem necessitates government action at scale. Here we study whether leveraging the incentives of bureaucrats tasked with controlling burning can mitigate this phenomenon. Using a decade of wind, fire and health data from satellites and surveys from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, we show that crop burning responds to bureaucrat incentives: fires increase by 15% when wind is most likely to direct pollution to neighbouring jurisdictions, and decrease by 14.5% when it pollutes their own. These effects intensify with stronger bureaucratic incentives and capacity. We also find that bureaucrat action against burning deters future polluters, further reducing fires by 13%. Finally, using an atmospheric model, we estimate that one log increase in in utero exposure to pollution from burning raises child mortality by 30–36 deaths per 1,000 births, underscoring the importance of bureaucrat action. Contrary to the growing beliefs that the problem of crop burning is intractable6,7, these findings highlight specific ways in which existing bureaucrats, when properly incentivized, can improve environmental management and public health outcomes. Around 1.8–2.7 deaths per 1,000 births (4.4–6.6% of the average child mortality) could be prevented in Pakistan and India if bureaucrats control crop burning across all areas of their jurisdiction as they do in places where fires would pollute their own district."

 Heat extremes pose pronounced threats to social-ecological systems and are projected to become more intense, frequent, and longer. However, the mechanisms driving heatwaves vary across heatwave types and are not yet fully understood. Here we decompose perturbations in the surface energy budget to categorize global heatwave-days into four distinct types: sunny–humid (38%), sunny-dry (26%), advective (18%), and adiabatic (18%). Notably, sunny-dry heatwave-days decrease net ecosystem carbon uptake by 0.09 gC m−2 day−1 over harvested areas, while advective heatwave-days increase the thermal stress index by 6.20 K in populated regions.

 Concerns have been raised about the sustainability of large-scale afforestation in semi-arid regions due to potential water constraints. This study investigated whether increased humidity in the semi-arid regions of northwest China could sustain the continued expansion of afforestation efforts. Using multi-source remote sensing data, we found that between 2012 to 2020, annual cumulative precipitation increased by 2.5 millimeters per year, while annual average carbon sequestration in afforested areas declined by 0.002 kilograms of carbon per square meter per year, indicating asynchronous trends. This disparity was primarily attributed to the trade-off between vegetation photosynthesis and transpiration in response to external water conditions, which led to a decline in the water use efficiency of afforested vegetation. The effect of water use efficiency on carbon sequestration was driven by gross primary productivity, rather than evapotranspiration. These findings underscore the importance of targeted afforestation in semi-arid regions, considering local water resource sustainability.

 Satellite products provide the best way to monitor the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface on a global scale. However, their capability to monitor solar radiation trends needs to be constantly evaluated. This depends on their temporal stability and the accurate representation of all processes driving solar radiation. This study evaluates these aspects by comparing and cross-comparing different solar radiation products (ERA5, CAMS-RAD 4.6, SARAH-3, CLARA-A3, CERES-EBAF 4.2) against in-situ measurements over Europe.All products show a moderate positive bias over Europe but strong differences in their root mean squared deviation (RMSD) related to their different cloud transmittance models. Geostationary-based products (SARAH-3, CAMS-RAD 4.6) provide the smallest RMSD closely followed by CLARA-A3, whereas ERA5 shows a large RMSD due to random errors in cloud transmittance.All products show an increase in surface solar radiation, or brightening, over the last 40 years over Europe, but the magnitude of the trends and their spatiotemporal variability differ between products. Despite finding temporal inhomogeneities in some products, the different trends are mostly due to different aerosol modeling approaches implemented by each product. Both SARAH-3 (+2.3 W/m2/decade, 2001–22) and CERES-EBAF 4.2 (+2.2 W/m2/decade, 2001–22) provide the most consistent trends compared to in-situ data, showing that after stabilizing in the late 2000s, brightening is particularly recovering in Western Europe. In-situ measurements show a reduction of aerosol optical depth from 2001 to 2022 that has been accentuated in the last 10 years, particularly in Western Europe. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that brightening recovery is driven by an aerosol reduction, though other analyses suggest that clouds also play a role in this recovery. More work is needed to understand the contribution of aerosols to solar radiation trends and the exact aerosol effects represented by each solar radiation product."

Satellites are becoming a powerful tool to detect and quantify methane emissions, but there is no evidence of their ability to monitor those from POM ponds. In this work, we have tested the potential of methane-capable satellite instruments to detect and quantify emissions from these ponds. We have focused on the satellite missions with the highest sensitivity to methane emissions, namely the GHGSat commercial constellation and the PRISMA, EnMAP, and EMIT imaging spectroscopy missions. We have also tested the AVIRIS-NG airborne imaging spectrometer. We report three methane plumes from POMs in Indonesia with GHGSat and two in Colombia with AVIRIS-NG. In the cases of EnMAP, PRISMA and EMIT, we observed substantial methane concentration enhancements over several ponds in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Colombia. It remains unclear whether they are due to retrieval artifacts caused by the particular albedo of the ponds, although the low spatial correlation between those enhancements and the ponds suggests that at least a fraction of the enhancements is caused by real emissions. By leveraging advanced imaging techniques and satellite data, this research contributes to progressing strategies to address new methane emissions sources with high mitigation potential, providing a first step toward the satellite-based monitoring of methane emissions from POMs."

 The vertical distribution of tropospheric O3 from ozonesondes is compared with that from In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) measurements collected at 23 pairs of sites between about 30° S and 55° N from 1995 to 2021. Profiles of tropospheric O3 from IAGOS are generally in good agreement with ozonesonde observations from electrochemical concentration cells (ECCs), Brewer–Mast sondes, and carbon–iodine sensors, with average biases of 2.58, −0.28, and 0.67 ppb and correlation coefficients (R) of 0.72, 0.82, and 0.66, respectively. Agreement between aircraft and Indian-sonde observations is poor, with an average bias of 15.32 ppb and an R value of 0.44. The O3 concentration observed by ECC sondes is, on average, 5 %–10 % higher than that observed by IAGOS, and the relative bias increases modestly with altitude. For other sonde types, there are some seasonal and altitudinal  variations in the relative bias with respect to the IAGOS measurements, but these appear to be caused by local differences. The distance between the station and airport, when within 4° (latitude and longitude), has little effect on the comparison results. For the ECC ozonesondes, the overall bias with respect to the IAGOS measurements varies from 5.7 to 9.8 ppb when the station pairs are grouped by station–airport distances of <1° (latitude and longitude), 1–2°, and 2–4°. Correlations for these groups correspond to R=0.8, 0.9, and 0.7. These comparison results provide important information for merging ozonesonde and IAGOS measurement datasets. They can also be used to evaluate the relative biases of different sonde types in the troposphere, using the aircraft as a transfer standard."

The presented measurements and operational experience demonstrate that the CIC provides precise and robust long-term measurements of small ion concentrations of both polarities, with low noise, fast time response and excellent reliability. 
 A dilute plasma is continuously maintained in the troposphere by ionising particle radiation from galactic cosmic rays and radon decay. Small ions in the 1–2 nm size range play an important role in atmospheric processes such as ion-induced nucleation of aerosol particles. Consequently there is a need for precise and robust instruments to measure small ions both for atmospheric observations and for laboratory experiments that simulate the atmosphere. Here we describe the design and performance of the Cluster Ion Counter (CIC, Airel OÜ), which simultaneously measures the number concentrations of positively- and negatively-charged ions and particles below 5 nm mobility diameter, with low noise and fast time response. The detection efficiency is above 80 % for ions and charged particles between 1.2 and 2.0 nm, and above 90 % between 2.0 and 3.0 nm. The ion concentrations measured by the CIC agree well with reference instruments. The noise level (1 σ of background measurements) is typically between 20 and 30 ions cm-3 at 1 Hz sampling rate and an air flow rate of 7 l min-1 per analyzer. The noise level improves when higher flow rates and longer sampling periods are used. The CIC responds rapidly with 1 s time resolution to pulses of ionisation produced in the CLOUD chamber by a CERN particle beam."

This study generated a global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite data and a deep learning model. The dataset accurately depicts global and regional XCO2 patterns, advancing the monitoring of carbon emissions and understanding of global carbon dynamics. 
 The irreversible trend for global warming underscores the necessity for accurate monitoring and analysis of atmospheric carbon dynamics on a global scale. Carbon satellites hold significant potential for atmospheric CO2 monitoring. However, existing studies on global CO2 are constrained by coarse resolution (ranging from 0.25° to 2°) and limited spatial coverage. In this study, we developed a new global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite observations, multi-source satellite products, and an improved deep learning model. We then investigated changes in global atmospheric CO2 and anomalies from 2015 to 2021. The reconstructed XCO2 products show a better agreement with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements, with R2 of 0.92 and RSME of 1.54 ppm. The products also provide more accurate information on the global and regional spatial patterns of XCO2 compared to origin carbon satellite monitoring and previous XCO2 products. The global pattern of XCO2 exhibited a distinct increasing trend with a growth rate of 2.32 ppm/year, reaching 414.00 ppm in 2021. Globally, XCO2 showed obvious spatial variability across different latitudes and continents. Higher XCO2 concentrations were primarily observed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in regions with intensive anthropogenic activity, such as East Asia and North America. We also validated the effectiveness of our XCO2 products in detecting intensive CO2 emission sources. The XCO2 dataset is publicly accessible on the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12706142 (Wang et al., 2024). Our findings represent a promising advancement in monitoring carbon emission across various countries and enhancing the understanding of global carbon dynamics."

This study utilized cyclohexene as a surrogate to explore first-generation products from its ozonolysis through laboratory experiments and mechanistic modeling. We employed proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry with NH4+ ion sources (NH4+-CIMS) and a custom-built OH calibration source to quantify organic peroxy radicals (RO2) and closed-shell species. Under near-real atmospheric conditions in a Potential Aerosol Mass-Oxidation Flow Reactor, we identified 30 ozonolysis products, expanding previous data sets of low-oxygen compounds. Combined with simulations based on the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere and relevant literature, our results revealed that OH dominates over ozone in cyclohexene oxidation at typical atmospheric oxidant levels with H-abstraction contributing 30% of initial RO2 radicals. Highly oxidized molecules primarily arise from RO2 autoxidation initiated by ozone, and at least 15% of ozone oxidation products follow the overlooked nonvinyl hydroperoxides pathway. Gaps remain especially in understanding RO2 cross-reactions, and the structural complexity of monoterpenes further complicates research. As emissions decrease and afforestation increases, understanding these mechanisms becomes increasingly critical."

Fog and low stratus clouds (FLS) form as a result of complex interactions of multiple factors in the atmosphere and at the land surface and impact both the anthropogenic and natural environments. Here, we analyze the role of synoptic conditions and aerosol loading on FLS occurrence and persistence in the Po valley in northern Italy. By applying k‐means clustering to reanalysis data, we find that FLS formation in the Po valley is either based on radiative processes or moisture advection from the Mediterranean sea. Satellite‐based data on FLS persistence shows longer persistence of radiatively formed FLS events, likely due to air mass stagnation and a temperature inversion. Ground‐based aerosol optical depth observations further reveal that FLS event duration is significantly higher under high aerosol loading. The results underline the combined effect of topography, moisture advection and aerosol loading on the FLS life cycle in the Po valley."

Studies suggest that forests are crucial for moisture recycling, although the specific contribution of different vegetation to precipitation remains unclear. Using a moisture recycling approach, we investigate the contribution of transpiration from trees and non‐tree vegetation to precipitation over Africa. We use precipitation source regions from simulated atmospheric moisture trajectories, constrained by observation‐based evaporation and precipitation products, and fractional vegetation cover data. Our findings show that trees provide a higher flux to precipitation (∼777 mm year−1) than non‐tree vegetation (∼342 mm year−1). However, considering the smaller spatial extent of trees compared to non‐tree vegetation, precipitation in most watersheds effectively depends more on the latter. Overall, non‐tree vegetation appears equally important as trees in terms of volumetric contributions to precipitation, and deserves attention in further research, considering ongoing land use changes that affect the continental water cycle."

Here, we developed a new technique for the identification of convective turbulent regions and deriving the vertical distribution of aerosol turbulent mass fluxes within PBL. The algorithm uses retrievals from coherent Doppler lidars and a high spectral resolution lidar. The technique was applied to study particle mass fluxes over 2 months (November–December 2020) during the campaign conducted at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Lamont, Oklahoma. The algorithm developed here is capable of continuously deriving vertically resolved (curtains) aerosol mass fluxes. Our data analysis shows that at the site, the 30‐min averaged fluxes at 135 m above the surface were mainly positive (upward) at ∼1 μg m−2 s−1, suggesting that the surface is the primary source of the particle mass supplied to the boundary layer at the SGP site. Analyses of the individual case studies have revealed that not all the derived fluxes can be linked to surface emissions. Both positive and negative values in a range of ±5 μg m−2 s−1 can be caused by convective thermals interacting between the residual layer and the mixed layer and by rotation of the horizontal wind with the height. Large erroneous negative fluxes can also be caused by drizzling/precipitating clouds. We anticipate that the application of the current technique will lead to a more realistic representation of aerosol mass budgets and bidirectional mixing rates."

However, the inﬂuence of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) on these dry‐hot conditions and their impacts on SAD occurrences remains uncertain. Here, both observations and simulations show that an ACC‐driven T increase led to the greater likelihood of dry‐hot conditions from August to November 1901–2020 in MLRYR. Using the self‐calibrating Palmer drought index (scPDSI) to assess SAD severity, we find an increasing likelihood of SAD occurrence (from 33.3% in 1901–2000 to 85.7% in 2001–2020) in MLRYR associated with more frequent dry‐hot conditions. Under a business‐as‐usual scenario, future dry‐hot association is projected to be stronger, with exceptional dry‐hot conditions to increase by +10% per century. ACC‐induced increase in dry‐hot conditions would elevate the likelihood of SAD events like the 2019 event from 1.59% (1961–2020) to 17.82% (2041–2100). Therefore, effective measures are needed in MLRYR to adapt to increasing dry‐hot conditions and associated SAD occurrences under anthropogenic warming."

The Antarctic vortex of October–December 2020 was the strongest on record in the satellite era for the season in the mid‐ to lower stratosphere. However, it was poorly predicted by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's operational seasonal climate forecast system of that time, ACCESS‐S1, even at a short lead time of a month. Using the current operational forecast system, ACCESS‐S2, we have, therefore, tried to find a primary cause of the limited predictability of this event and conducted forecast sensitivity experiments to understand the potential role of ozone in the event and its associated anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and rainfall over south–eastern Australia and western Patagonia. Here, we show that the 2020 strong vortex event did not follow the canonical dynamical evolution seen in previous strong vortex events in spring but suddenly appeared as a result of the record‐low upward propagating wave activity in September 2020. The ACCESS‐S2 forecasts significantly underestimated the negative wave forcing in September even at zero lead time, irrespective of the ozone configuration, therefore falling short in predicting the record strength of the polar vortex in late spring 2020. Nevertheless, ACCESS‐S2 with prescribed realistic ozone that had large anomalies in the Antarctic stratosphere significantly better predicted the strong vortex and the subsequent positive SAM and related rainfall anomalies over south–eastern Australia and western Patagonia in the austral summer of 2020–21. This highlights the potentially important role of ozone variations for seasonal climate forecasting as a source of long‐lead predictability."

This study investigates the physical processes behind extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in the Himalayas, notorious for causing frequent floods and significant loss of life and property. Due to the presence of complex terrain, understanding the driving factors of these EPEs is challenging. Here, we decipher the precipitation characteristics and their driving factors responsible for the occurrence of EPEs in the Western Himalayas (WH) for the period 1979–2020. EPEs are defined as events exceeding the 99th percentile threshold. The extreme precipitation in the WH is contributed by both large‐scale precipitation (accounting for 61%) and convective precipitation (39%). Moreover, 25.49% of EPEs in this region are directly associated with monsoon depressions. The presence of distinct upper‐tropospheric gyres flanking the WH, along with a prominent zonal wave pattern, promotes a southward extension of the trough. This intensifies the low‐level convergence of moisture‐laden winds from the adjoining seas, resulting in substantial moisture availability for the EPEs. An omega‐type blocking pattern emerges 4 days before EPEs, facilitating the intrusion of an extratropical cyclonic circulation. This circulation, characterized by its slow eastward and equatorward movement, leads to low‐level moisture flux convergence and ascending motions, which in turn trigger the EPEs. This highlights the crucial role of extratropical signals in driving EPEs and implies that tropical‐extratropical interactions play an important role in these EPEs. Furthermore, the shifting of the Intertropical Convergence Zone is strongly linked to the enhancement of the intensity of EPEs. Moreover, moisture budget analysis shows that EPEs over the WH are primarily driven by vertical advection, with the dynamic (thermodynamic) terms explaining 92% (8%) contribution. The intensified diabatic heating structure further enhances the convection, facilitating the development of deep convection which controls the local thermodynamics of these EREs. Lastly, our study demonstrated that most intensified and persistent EPEs over the Himalayas are found to be linked with Quasi‐Resonance Amplification, which is driven by baroclinic waves with 5 and 8 zonal wave numbers that contribute to these EPEs."

They show that changes in snow cover duration play a more significant role than rising air temperatures alone in driving greening patterns. 
 Declining seasonal snow cover duration leads to changing conditions for plant recruitment and growth in temperate mountains. Yet capturing the intricacy of snow cover and vegetation dynamics at multidecadal scale in complex terrains poses a great challenge. Here we show that over the last four decades the greenness trend in European mountains increases with the annual date of the seasonal snow cover disappearance. By combining satellite data of high spatial resolution and downscaled climate re-analysis we show that the reduction in snow cover duration surpasses elevated temperatures in influencing heat accumulation during the growing season. This accumulation is a key driver of the pronounced greening observed in late snow-melting sites, particularly in sparsely vegetated, north-facing screes. Our results provide a comprehensive account of rapid vegetation changes in waning snowfields and highlight the pivotal role played by snow cover dynamics to unravel the complexity of greening within the temperate alpine zone. The authors use multidecadal, high-resolution data to investigate the spatial variability of vegetation greening in European mountains.

 The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) has been warming due largely to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, but its impact on Arctic sea ice remains unclear. Our study finds a significant negative correlation between the IPWP index and sea ice concentration in northeastern Canada during boreal autumn (October-December). Our results suggest that IPWP warming statistically accounts for 45% of sea ice loss observed in this region. We introduce the “Arctic capacitor effect of the IPWP”, a novel concept that expounds upon the distant connection between greenhouse gas emissions and Arctic sea ice loss. Specifically, as greenhouse gases elevate temperatures in the IPWP, increasing temperature gradient and tropical convection, a planetary wavetrain is initiated. This wavetrain, along with transit eddy feedback, traverses towards the Arctic and thereby influences the strength of the Arctic vortex and its associated effects on Arctic sea ice. Our findings highlight the crucial role of tropical oceans in the broader context of global climate change, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for their impact on polar climate."

 After a period of relative stability, the Antarctic sea ice extent has abruptly decreased in 2016 and has remained low since then. Both atmospheric and oceanic processes likely contributed to this drop but many questions remain regarding the underlying dynamics and it is unknown if this drop is unprecedented. Here we produce a new multi-variate spatial reconstruction covering 1958–2023 and show that a similar drop in sea ice extent occurred at the end of the 1970s, albeit with a smaller magnitude. Both drops show similar spatial patterns, with a higher sea ice loss in the East Antarctic sector than in the West Antarctic sector where the variability is strongly modulated by wind-driven changes. The ocean integrates the atmospheric forcing and provides memory that amplifies the magnitude of both drops.

 Marine heatwaves have attracted great attention for their devastating impacts on marine organisms. However, the influence of marine heatwaves on phytoplankton community structure, a key aspect of pelagic ecosystems, remains elusive, especially in the biologically productive eastern boundary upwelling systems. Here, using a combination of multi-satellite observations and model outputs, we discover that phytoplankton in these upwelling systems exhibit not only a marked reduction in biomass (~50%), but also a significant shift toward smaller species in community structures during marine heatwaves, featuring a substantially increased/decreased dominance in picophytoplankton/microphytoplankton. This change in community structure is positively related to the intensity and duration of marine heatwaves, and is likely a result of community competition under reduced nutrient supply due to weakened coastal upwelling associated with poleward wind anomalies. These findings invite us to rethink the dominance of phytoplankton in the eastern boundary upwelling systems under extreme conditions, and may have important implications for local fisheries and carbon cycle under the ongoing warming. Longer and more intense marine heatwaves are associated with a dominance of smaller plankton species and lower overall biomass, according to an analysis of ocean color satellite data and distribution modeling."

 Temperature prediction over decades provides crucial information for quantifying the expected effects of future climate changes. However, such predictions are extremely challenging due to the chaotic nature of temperature variations. Here we devise a prediction method involving an information tracking mechanism that aims to track and adapt to changes in temperature dynamics during the prediction phase by providing probabilistic feedback on the prediction error of the next step based on the current prediction. We integrate this information tracking mechanism, which can be considered as a model calibrator, into the objective function of the proposed method to obtain the corrections needed to avoid error accumulation. Experimental results on the task of global weekly land surface temperature prediction over a decade validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

 Large-scale anticyclonic vortices forming along the Gulf of Alaska continental slope serve as fertile ecosystems for marine life, significantly shaping the distribution of primary productivity, with 40–80% of the gulf’s open ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentrated in their cores. Between 2013 and 2023, Alaska experienced some of the largest and longest marine heatwaves ever recorded in the world’s oceans, persistently altering its ecosystem and fisheries. Here, using 30 years of satellite and reanalysis data, we find that the coastal upwelling atmospheric forcing conditions associated with the heatwaves have also significantly suppressed the Gulf of Alaska’s ocean circulation and the formation of large anticyclones. Climate model simulations spanning from 1850 to 2100 suggest that future changes in the Aleutian Low pressure system will lead to a 60% increase in upwelling extremes (>2 standard deviations), further weakening the ocean anticyclones. However, large uncertainties remain in the mechanisms controlling the Aleutian Low’s response to climate forcing in the models.

 Utilizing regional air quality models to accurately forecast surface ozone (O3) concentrations, particularly high concentrations, is essential for protecting public health. However, forecasts of air quality model often deviate from site observations due to the limitation of grid resolution and uncertainties from emission sources, meteorological conditions, and chemical reaction mechanisms. Especially, the underestimation is significant under condition of high O3 concentrations. Moreover, such deviations tend to accumulate as forecast lead time increases, compounding the challenges associated with reliable air quality forecast. In this study, we employed AlexNet architecture, a classical convolutional neural network, combined with multiple variables related to meteorology, chemistry, emission and geography to establish a non-linear relationship between grid-scale input variables and site-scale hourly O3 forecast biases in Eastern China, aiming to realize accurate city-level ozone forecast based on a regional air quality prediction model (i.e., Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System, NAQPMS). By assigning weights to high-bias samples and high-concentration samples within the loss function, the proposed Weighted AlexNet model (W_AlexNet) effectively reduced forecast biases and enhanced its capability to predict O3 pollution levels. Compared to NAQPMS, W_AlexNet model demonstrated a 25.71% improvement in RMSE and a 7.17% increase in IOA averagely for hourly O3 (O3-1h) forecasts across four different lead times (24-h, 48-h, 72-h, and 96-h). Notably, W_AlexNet model alleviated the tendency of NAQPMS to underestimate high concentrations and showed a superior performance in improving O3-1h pollution level forecasts, particularly for the 72-h and 96-h lead times. W_AlexNet model can effectively mitigate the bias accumulation effect over increasing lead times, thereby enhancing the reliability of longer-term forecasts. Thus, the W_AlexNet model serves as a post-processing model that can calibrate forecast biases in air quality prediction models, significantly improving the accuracy of O3 high concentration forecasts and providing more precise early warnings of O3 pollution. This underscores its utility in air quality management."

Notably, national sulfur dioxide emissions could increase by 16–20% if all batteries have nickel- and cobalt-based cathodes and are produced domestically.

How—and whether—this hemispheric albedo symmetry is maintained remains a mystery. We decompose Earth's hemispheric albedo symmetry into components associated with the surface, clear‐sky atmosphere, and different cloud types as defined by cloud effective pressure and optical thickness. Climatologically, greater reflection by the surface, aerosols, and high clouds in the Northern Hemisphere is balanced by greater low and mid‐level cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere. Both hemispheres have darkened at similar rates over the past two decades; whether the darkening from more rapidly declining aerosol in the Northern Hemisphere is causing a departure from all‐sky symmetry remains uncertain. Natural experiments including long‐term trends, sea ice loss, and volcanic eruptions provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that extratropical low clouds compensate changing clear‐sky asymmetries on annual‐to‐decadal timescales but some evidence that tropical high cloud shifts may do so."
10.1029/2024JD041398,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了戈壁沙漠风沙数值模拟及其对沙尘通量的影响。戈壁沙漠是东亚地区沙尘暴的重要源地，准确模拟其沙尘传输对于全球沙尘循环模型至关重要。研究者通过建立数值模型，模拟了戈壁风沙的跃移结构，发现戈壁地区的沙尘质量浓度垂直衰减率和沙粒水平速度与其他沙漠地区存在差异。基于模拟结果，提出了适用于戈壁地区的沙尘跃移通量公式。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为准确的沙尘通量参数化对于改进沙尘暴预报和空气质量监测至关重要，可用于改进卫星遥感反演算法，提高对沙尘气溶胶时空分布的监测精度。,"['dust', 'aerosols', 'sandstorms', 'air quality', 'satellite remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition', 'numerical modeling']",C. Zhang;Y. Wang;N. Huang;H. C. Dun,Numerical Insights Into Gobi Wind‐Blown Sand: Deriving a Saltation Flux Scheme,"Dust emissions from land‐air interaction in arid and semi‐arid regions are crucial for predicting the global dust cycle. However, a comprehensive understanding of the complex physical mechanisms contributing to dust emissions from Gobi surfaces remains elusive. The expansive Gobi Desert, spanning northern China and Mongolia, significantly intensifies sandstorms in East Asia. Although researchers use models to study global dust transport, current models primarily depend on the aerodynamic roughness of the Gobi Desert. They often overlook the particle‐bed collision processes unique to the Gobi bed surface, which differ significantly from those of desert surfaces, thus compromising the accuracy of global dust cycle simulations. In this article, we establish a numerical model for drift sand in the Gobi based on existing theoretical and experimental studies. The model accurately simulates the wind‐blown sand in the Gobi and been used to investigate the saltation structure of sand transport. Simulations reveal an exponential decay of mass concentration with height, with an average attenuation rate of 0.00385 in the Gobi compared to 0.00806 in sandy deserts. The horizontal velocity of saltating particles increases with height following a power law. Through quantitative analysis of this structure, we present a saltation flux formula suitable for the Gobi."

To quantify the urban CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emissions in the MCMA, we independently assimilated observations from a dense column‐integrated Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) network and OCO‐3 Snapshot Area Map observations between October 2020 and May 2021. Applying a computationally efficient analytical Bayesian inversion technique, we inverted for surface fluxes at high spatio‐temporal resolutions (1‐km and 1‐hr). The fossil fuel (FF) emission estimates of 5.08 and 6.77 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr reported by the global and local emission inventories were optimized to 4.85 and 5.51 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr based on FTIR observations over this 7 month period, highlighting a convergence of posterior estimates. The modeled biogenic flux estimate of −0.14 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr was improved to −0.33 to −0.27 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr, respectively. It is worth noting that utilizing observations from three primary sites significantly enhanced the accuracy of estimates (13.6 ∼ ${\sim} $ 29.2%) around the other four. Using FTIR posterior estimates can improve simulation with the OCO‐3 data set. OCO‐3 shows a similar decreasing trend in FF emissions (from 6.37 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr to 6.36 and 5.04 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr) as FTIR, but its correction trends for biogenic sources differ, changing from 0.37 to 0.48 GgCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$/hr. The primary reason is OCO‐3's lower temporal sampling density. Aligning the FTIR inversion timing with that of OCO‐3 yielded comparable corrections for FF emissions, yet discrepancies in biogenic emissions persisted, which can be attributed to their different sampling locations in the rural region and discrepancy in XCO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ observations. Our findings mark a significant step toward validating OCO‐3 and FTIR inversion results in metropolitan region."
10.1029/2024JD041453,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了中国2013-2020年期间减排对对流层臭氧的影响。研究发现，尽管中国采取了严格的减排措施，但近地表臭氧污染持续存在，甚至在华北地区有所增加。然而，令人意外的是，中国的减排措施却显著降低了全球对流层臭氧的总量和辐射强迫。这其中的原因在于氮氧化物（NOx）的非线性化学反应和高度相关的输送模式。研究结果表明，中国区域减排对全球对流层臭氧的缓解具有重大意义。未来，如果要进一步降低全球对流层臭氧，需要持续控制NOx排放，但与此同时，除非NOx减排量超过2019年水平的53%，否则区域地表臭氧可能仍然会增加。该研究使用了多种测量数据和全球模型模拟，这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Emission reductions', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Global model simulations', 'Nitrogen oxides (NOx)']",Han Han;Lin Zhang;Xiaolin Wang;Xiao Lu,Contrasting Domestic and Global Impacts of Emission Reductions in China on Tropospheric Ozone,"Sustained near‐surface ozone pollution despite stringent emission controls in China has drawn wide attention. However, how such rapid regional emission reductions affect global tropospheric ozone remains unexplored. Here, using an ensemble of measurements and global model simulations, we find Chinese emission reductions during 2013–2020 have increased domestic surface ozone; particularly in North China, they have decreased the global tropospheric ozone burden by 2.7 Tg (54% of China's anthropogenic contribution and 7% of global anthropogenic contribution in 2019) and ozone radiative forcing by 8.8 mW m−2 (64% of China's anthropogenic contribution and 9% of global anthropogenic contribution in 2019). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) associated nonlinear chemistry and height‐dependent atmospheric transport patterns primarily cause the contrasting impacts. Future Chinese NOx emission controls would continue to decrease global tropospheric ozone, while regional surface ozone may still increase unless NOx reductions exceed ∼53% of the 2019 level. Our results reveal the substantial benefit of regional emission reductions in China on global tropospheric ozone mitigation."

 The stratosphere-troposphere and the tropics-Arctic couplings were intermittently enhanced in the 2023/24 winter. Here we used ERA5 reanalysis data and found that due to the amplification of planetary wavenumber 1 and 2 pulses, three displacement-type sudden stratospheric warming events occurred in one winter under the background conditions of warming equatorial middle and east Pacific, active equatorial convections, and easterly stratospheric equatorial winds. During the sudden stratospheric warming events, the stratospheric disturbances propagated downward to the surface, followed by continental cold surges. The residual meridional circulation was strengthened across the tropics and Arctic, anomalously more water vapor was transported into the stratosphere in tropics, while ozone content diminished in the lower stratosphere and grew in the upper stratosphere over the tropics. Meanwhile, water vapor and ozone over the Arctic exhibited a dipping pattern from the upper to the lower stratosphere. In early 2024, three sudden stratospheric warming events occurred due to warming equatorial middle and east Pacific, active equatorial convections, and easterly equatorial winds, enhancing stratosphere- troposphere and tropics-Arctic coupling, according to analysis of zonal wind, temperature, and geopotential height from ERA5 reanalysis data."

From 14 January to 16 January, the Chinese X‐ray astronomy satellite, Insight‐HXMT, was observing the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The X‐ray data obtained during Earth's atmospheric occultations allowed us to measure neutral densities in the altitude range of ∼ ${\sim} $90–150 km. The density profiles above 110 km altitude obtained before the major eruption are in reasonable agreement with expectations by both GAIA and NRLMSIS 2.0 models. In contrast, after the HTHH eruption, a severe density depletion was found up to 1,000 km away from the epicenter, and a relatively weak depletion extending up to ∼7,000 ${\sim} 7,000$ km for over 8 hr after the eruption. In addition, density profiles showed wavy structures with a typical length scale of either ∼ ${\sim} $20 km (vertical) or ∼ ${\sim} $1,000 km (horizontal). This may be caused by Lamb waves or gravity waves triggered by the volcanic eruption."

In the Northwest Pacific where sea‐salt aerosols (SSAs) are abundant and the large‐scale environment is dominated by the dry subsidence of the WNPSH during summer, inhomogeneous SSAs form as a product of the environment. However, the extent to which inhomogeneous SSAs affect the WNPSH remains unclear. This study investigates the radiative effects of SSAs through numerical simulations, revealing a novel mechanism for the strengthening of the WNPSH. The results demonstrate that inhomogeneous SSAs enhance the WNPSH by generating diabatic cooling in the upper troposphere and associated unstable subsidence motion. Further considering the radiative hysteresis effects of inhomogeneous SSAs, the WNPSH further strengthens under the combined dynamic and thermodynamic influences associated with upper‐level radiative cooling. Inhomogeneous SSAs not only enhance the WNPSH but also influence the location where the central area of high pressure intensifies."
