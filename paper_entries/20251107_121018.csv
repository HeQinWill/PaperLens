10.1088/1748-9326/ae1151,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要探讨了平流层气溶胶气候干预（SAI）对农作物蛋白质浓度的影响。虽然SAI涉及向大气中释放气溶胶，但其重点在于气候干预的农业影响，而非大气环境遥感技术的应用。论文研究了SAI情景下玉米、水稻、大豆和小麦的蛋白质浓度变化，以及对蛋白质摄入的影响，与空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等遥感技术关联不大。,"['stratospheric aerosol intervention', 'sulfate aerosols', 'climate change', 'crop protein', 'global gridded crop models']",Brendan Clark;Alan Robock;Lili Xia;Sam S Rabin;Jose R Guarin;Jonas Jägermeyr,Stratospheric aerosol climate intervention could reduce crop nutritional value,"The deliberate addition of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere to form reflective sulfate aerosols, reflect sunlight, and reduce surface temperatures is increasingly being considered as an option for minimizing the impacts of climate change. This strategy would create an unprecedented climate where the relationship between surface temperature and carbon dioxide concentration is decoupled. The implications of stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI) for global crop protein concentrations have not yet been explored. While elevated CO2 concentrations are expected to reduce crop protein, higher temperatures may increase crop protein concentrations. Here we report changes of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat protein concentrations under a medium emissions climate change scenario and a SAI scenario to maintain global average temperatures at 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels, as simulated by three global gridded crop models. We show that using SAI to offset surface temperature increases would create decreases in the global protein concentrations of maize and rice, with minimal impact on wheat and soybean. Some already protein-deficient and malnourished nations that rely heavily on these crops to meet protein demands would show large decreases in protein intake under SAI with the current diet pattern, which could exacerbate their nutrient scarcity. The range of results between crop models highlights the need for a more comprehensive analysis using additional crop models, climate models, a broader range of climate intervention scenarios, and advancements in crop models to better represent protein responses to climate changes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae15a6,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化会议（COP）对股票市场的影响，特别是化石燃料公司、绿色公司和可再生能源公司的股票表现。论文分析了在气候谈判期间，这些公司的股价变化情况，并与石油输出国组织（OPEC）会议的影响进行了对比。研究结果表明，在COP会议期间，绿色评级高的公司股票价值有所增加，但可再生能源公司和化石燃料公司的股票变化并不明显或不稳定。因此，该论文主要关注金融市场对气候政策的反应，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Robin Lamboll;Alaa Al Khourdajie;Setu Pelz,How stocks judge COPs: market impacts of climate conferences,"International efforts to combat climate change almost inevitably entail relative earnings reductions for fossil fuel companies, and gains by renewable companies. This study investigates the relationship between climate change conference of the parties (COP) meetings and the stock market performance of selected publicly listed companies. Specifically, we compare the price formation of fossil fuel companies, ethically-rated (‘green’) companies and renewable energy companies during international climate negotiations, compared to the periods around them. We investigate changes in market behaviour during COPs using two different statistical approaches to assess both whole of the period and daily effects. Both methods find distinct increases in the values of stocks with high green ratings, but no changes in stocks of renewable companies and weaker and more statistically inconsistent decreases in the values of fossil fuel companies. No consistent results are found for variability measurements, other than general market variability increases during COPs. We show that, by contrast, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meetings produce very strong increases in the stock values and variabilities of fossil fuel companies, and fairly strong decreases in the value of renewables companies, showing that detectable changes during predictable events are generally plausible. We conclude that market behaviour so far appears to favour companies with lower environmental impact during COPs but does not convincingly shift company price formation in line with the necessary green transition."
10.5194/acp-25-14967-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了西太平洋地区大气中挥发性氯代烃（VCHCs）的分布和来源，重点关注海洋通风和陆地输送对这些物质的影响。研究发现，西太平洋地区既是某些VCHCs的源，又是四氯化碳的汇。研究使用了叶绿素a等指标来评估海洋生物活动对VCHCs的影响，并结合海气通量估算，揭示了该区域在调节大气VCHCs浓度中的作用，特别是对四氯化碳的吸收能力。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究结果对于理解全球VCHCs的排放和吸收，以及改进大气成分模型具有重要意义，这些模型可以与遥感数据结合使用。,"['Volatile Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Air-sea flux', 'Ocean ventilation', 'Terrestrial transport', 'Chlorophyll a', 'Western Pacific', 'Source and Sink', 'Ozone-depleting substances', 'Greenhouse gases']",Shan-Shan Liu;Jie Ni;Jin-Ming Song;Xu-Xu Gao;Zhen He;Gui-Peng Yang,Influence of oceanic ventilation and terrestrial transport on the atmospheric volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons over the Western Pacific,"Volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (VCHCs) influence the ozone layer and climate, yet the Western Pacific's role in their budget was unclear. This study showed that ocean ventilation and terrestrial inputs jointly controlled VCHCs levels in the Western Pacific, with the region acting as a source for some VCHCs but a sink for carbon tetrachloride. These findings highlighted the ocean's regulatory role and provided essential data to refine global VCHCs' budget estimates. 
 Volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (VCHCs), key ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases, depend on oceanic emission and uptake for their atmospheric budget. However, data on VCHCs in the Western Pacific remain limited. This study investigated the distribution and sources of VCHCs (CHCl3, C2HCl3, CCl4, and CH3CCl3) in the Western Pacific during 2019-2020. Elevated seawater concentrations of CHCl3 and C2HCl3 in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension were driven by mesoscale eddies, enhancing primary productivity, while CCl4 and CH3CCl3 concentrations were mainly influenced by atmospheric inputs. Atmospheric concentrations of VCHCs decreased from coastal to open ocean areas, with terrestrial air masses contributing significantly. Additionally, positive saturation anomalies and correlations with chlorophyll a indicated the marine biological source for atmospheric CHCl3 and C2HCl3. However, the atmospheric concentration variability of these gases was not fully consistent with oceanic emissions indicators (saturation anomalies and sea–air fluxes) and showed strong correlations with terrestrial tracers, indicating that land-derived atmospheric transport primarily influenced atmospheric CHCl3 and C2HCl3. The estimated sea–air flux indicated that the Western Pacific acted as a source for CHCl3 and C2HCl3 but a sink for CCl4 and CH3CCl3, with the potential to absorb 14.3 ± 6.8 % of CCl4 emissions from Eastern China, 5.6 ± 2.5 % from Eastern Asia, and 2.1 ± 1.1 % of global emissions. Additionally, this region accounted for 6.3 ± 2.8 % of the global oceanic absorption of CCl4. These findings underscore the Western Pacific's key role in regulating atmospheric CCl4 concentrations and mitigating its accumulation in Eastern Asia, providing essential data for global VCHCs emission and uptake estimates."

Vertical gradients of aerosol optical and chemical properties were evaluated on different atmospheric conditions, and showed distinct characteristics of these particles. Intercontinental transport events bring to the region particles with a contrasting chemical composition, while vertical transport processes influence the aerosol properties by promoting the development of coating and aging. 
 In central Amazonia, aerosol sources, weather, and chemical processes create a highly variable aerosol population. The aerosols' optical properties, shaped by composition and size, determine sunlight interaction and the regional radiation budget. Previous studies observed differences in the particles' physical properties during smoke events and described their vertical gradients during clean periods. However, a complete characterization of these properties at two height levels considering both seasons is still missing. This study connects aerosol optical measurements from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), at 60 and 325 m heights, to particle composition and sources, characterizing different aerosol populations, assessing their vertical gradients, and associating them with the influence of various emission sources and atmospheric processes. A seasonally segregated clustering method was applied to five years of optical data (2018–2023), allowing for the identification of periods with low biomass-burning impact, long-range transport (LRT) events, and regional pollution episodes. Aerosols from Saharan dust events showed the highest real and imaginary refractive index, along with a large inorganic mass fraction (around 26 %), which differs from typical Amazonian conditions. Furthermore, regional biomass-burning emissions during the dry season promoted elevated fine-mode particle concentrations (median 2250 cm−3), dominated by absorbing carbonaceous material. These particles also showed the maximum mass scattering efficiency, which was consistently higher at the 60 m height, underscoring the importance of vertical transport and aerosol aging processes. These results indicate that the clustering method can discriminate between aerosol populations and elucidate differences between particles of different sources and processes influencing the Amazonian atmosphere."

Ryerson;Chelsea R. Thompson;Jeff Peischl;Róisín Commane;Bruce Daube;Ilann Bourgeois;Jos Lelieveld;Horst Fischer,Enhancement of O3–CO ratios at tropospheric subtropical latitudes: Photochemistry and stratospheric influence,"This study investigates the role of lightning emissions on the O3–CO ratio in the northern subtropics. We used in situ observations and a global circulation model to show an effect of up to 40 % onto the subtropical O3–CO ratio by tropical air masses transported via the Hadley cell. This influence of lightning emissions and its photochemistry has a global effect on trace and greenhouse gases and needs to be considered for global chemical distributions. 
 The subtropics are influenced by stratosphere-troposphere exchange processes through the subtropical jet streams and tropopause folding events, which are commonly identified by the opposing gradients of ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) and thus their ratio. Here, we used airborne observations of CO and O3, as well as the global three-dimensional ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, to investigate whether there is another important mechanism that conditions the subtropics. We show that high O3–CO ratios extend deeply into the troposphere in the subtropics, which is evident in both in situ observations and model results. Tropospheric photochemistry leads to similar O3–CO ratios as those for stratospheric air diluted into the troposphere. In the upper tropical troposphere, frequent deep convective events produce lightning that leads to high concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO+NO2), which drive O3 production and which further catalyze the recycling of hydroxyl (OH) radicals, which reduces CO. These lightning-affected air masses can be transported from the tropics into the subtropics via the Hadley circulation. We have excluded NO production through lightning in a sensitivity run of the EMAC model and see an annual relative reduction of the O3–CO ratio of up to almost 50 % in the tropics and up to 40 % in the northern subtropics, with even larger seasonal variability and major effects on the vertical profiles of O3 and CO. We therefore show that photochemistry is an additional key factor alongside stratosphere-troposphere mixing in determining O3-rich and CO-poor air masses in the troposphere."

Marsh;Thomas Reddmann;Eugene Rozanov;Timofei Sukhodolov;Monika E. Szelag;Jan Maik Wissing,Thermospheric nitric oxide is modulated by the ratio of atomic to molecular oxygen and thermospheric dynamics during solar minimum,"Nitric oxide in the upper atmosphere varies with solar activity. Observations show that this starts a chain of processes affecting the ozone layer and climate system. This is often underestimated in models. We compare five models which show large differences in simulated NO. Analysis of these discrepancies identify two processes which interact with each other: the balance between atomic and molecular oxygen in the thermosphere, and a poleward - downward transport in the winter thermosphere. 
 The formation of nitric oxide (NO) by geomagnetic activity and EUV photoionization in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and its subsequent impact on ozone, contributes to the natural forcing of the climate system, and has been recommended to be included in chemistry-climate model experiments since CMIP6. We compare NO concentrations in the mesosphere and thermosphere simulated by five high-top chemistry-climate models  – WACCM-X, EMAC, HAMMONIA, WACCM-D and KASIMA – with satellite observations during a period of low geomagnetic and solar forcing in January 2010. We find disagreements ranging from several orders of magnitude in the high-latitude winter lower thermosphere to about one order of magnitude in the low-latitude thermosphere. Possible reasons for this are explored by analyzing formation and loss reactions of NO at 12:00 UT on 9 January 2010. Two processes that interact with each other are identified as likely sources of these discrepancies, quenching of N(2D) by atomic oxygen in the mid-thermosphere, and meridional transport and mixing from the mid-thermosphere to the lower thermosphere. In the mid-thermosphere, the amount of atomic oxygen available from dissociation of molecular oxygen balances N(4S) and N(2D) via quenching of N(2D). N(4S) can then be transported or mixed into the lower thermosphere, where it efficiently destroys NO, leading to lower values of NO there. In winter, downward and poleward transport of N(4S) from the low and mid-latitude middle thermosphere into the high-latitude lower thermosphere modulates the NO lifetime. This transport is affected by gravity waves, and therefore depends on each models' gravity wave drag scheme and their resolved gravity wave spectra."

Giangrande;John Rausch;Lihong Ma;Meng Wang;Dié Wang;Michael P. Jensen;Ching-Shu Hung;J. Christine Chiu,Marine and continental stratocumulus cloud microphysical properties obtained from routine ARM Cimel sunphotometer observations,"Photometer observations of stratocumulus cloud properties are evaluated for a multiyear archive. Retrievals for cloud optical depth, cloud droplet effective radius, and liquid water path show solid agreement with collocated references. Continental stratocumulus clouds sorted by cloud thickness indicate double the cloud optical depth and liquid water path of their marine counterparts, while exhibiting similar bulk cloud droplet effective radius. 
 This study investigates marine and continental stratocumulus (Sc) cloud properties obtained from an automated implementation of a multispectral  photometer retrieval. Photometer methods simultaneously retrieve cloud optical depth (τ) and cloud droplet effective radius (re),  with estimates for liquid water path (LWP) calculated on the availability of those quantities. These applied methods evaluate retrieved cloud  properties for Sc identified during a recent 6 year period over the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program sites  in Oklahoma, USA (SGP) and in the Azores, Portugal (ENA).Modest agreement in key quantity retrievals is found between the routine photometer products and multisensor collocated profiling references. Cumulative breakdowns contingent on cloud thickness indicate increases in all retrieved quantities in thicker clouds, with larger discrepancies in the relative performance between the retrievals collected in the presence of drizzle. Under continental cloud conditions, the clouds of a similar thickness and re to those sampled under marine conditions report a factor of 1.5 larger τ and LWP. An r2≅0.65 is found between photometer τ retrievals and shadowband radiometer measurements, with photometer retrievals reporting a high (relative) bias. The τ intercomparisons indicate that variability between retrievals is a factor of three larger than errors reported from individual retrieval input perturbation tests. Photometer re retrievals suggest a low r2 (< 0.1) having a standard deviation ≅ 3 µm when compared to ARM baseline multi-sensor radar/radiometer references (accounting for offsets in the cloud droplet number concentration assumptions of the latter). However, photometer LWP calculations remain relatively unbiased in non-drizzling conditions, with errors O (50 g m−2) and r2≅0.5 to collocated radiometer and interferometer references. Additional sensitivity tests for island influences on marine Sc properties suggest that while island-influenced winds may promote larger cloud LWP or thickness, the influence could be within retrieval method uncertainty and/or collocated instrument variability."

While holographic imaging enables detailed analysis of cloud droplet size, shape, and distribution, processing errors remain poorly quantified. To address this, we developed CloudTarget, a patterned photomask that can quantify the detection efficiency and uncertainties. Additionally, our AI-based classification enhances both accuracy and speed, achieving over 90 % precision while accelerating analysis 100-fold. 
 Accurate measurements of cloud particle size, shape, and concentration are essential for microphysical cloud research. Holographic imaging is ideal for three-dimensional analyses of particle size, shape, and spatial distribution in large sample volumes, but its post-processing often leads to operator-dependent results and introduces uncertainties in detection efficiency. Here we present CloudTarget, a set of chrome photomasks with a customized pattern of opaque circles, serving as a verification tool to quantify detection efficiency and evaluate size and position errors. CloudTarget provides a ground truth for optimizing hologram processing parameters, including detection, sizing, and classification thresholds, and it facilitates evaluations of size- and position-dependent detection efficiency and uncertainties. Additionally, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object classification that achieves high accuracy with moderate training data. In a holography setup featuring a 5120 × 5120 pixel imaging sensor, a 3 µm effective pixel size, and 355 nm illumination, the CNN achieves over 90 % recall and precision for particles larger than 7 µm in a 10 cm × 1.3 cm × 1.3 cm detection volume. The average focus position error remains below 150 µm (1.5 times the reconstruction resolution) for particles <10 cm from the image plane, with in-plane random position detection errors below 5 pixels (mean <2 pixels). By combining inverse techniques with CloudTarget, the sizing error standard deviation is reduced to about 2 µm. Overall, classification performance improves significantly, and a 100-fold increase in classification speed is achieved."

We identified different types of small but important measurement error inherent to the instruments. Understanding these issues helps improve data quality and supports better short-term weather forecasts using sensor networks across Europe. 
 To enhance observations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the European Meteorological Network (EUMETNET), and the Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS) are currently collaborating to establish networks of microwave radiometers (MWRs). MWRs can be used to derive thermodynamic profiles within the ABL. Understanding and assessing instrument uncertainties of state-of-the-art MWRs are therefore crucial for accurate observations and also data assimilation purposes. Some national weather services are currently exploring the potential of MWR networks to improve short-term weather forecasts. In this paper, we discuss uncertainties inherent to the MWR instrument itself, namely (1) radiometric noise, (2) long-term drifts and jumps, (3) calibration repeatability, (4) biases/systematic differences between instruments, and (5) radome degradation. These uncertainties are expressed in brightness temperatures. For state-of-the-art MWRs (here, the Generation 5 Humidity and Temperature Profiler, HATPRO-Gen5), radiometric noise at ambient temperatures is a maximum of 0.32 K in the V-band but usually lower, especially near cold load temperature ranges in the K-band (≤0.11 K). Long-term drifts or jumps between calibrations, which are at least 2 months apart, are usually below 0.4 K in the K-band and 1.0 K in the V-band but can also be higher. Drifts do not follow a discernable timely pattern and are therefore not easily quantifiable in a meaningful way. Calibrating at least every 6 months is thus advised. Calibration repeatability is shown to be well under 0.16 K. Mean brightness temperature differences between two HATPRO-Gen5 instruments are shown to be as high as 0.15 K in the K-band and 0.58 K in the V-band in the zenith viewing direction. The radome has significantly degraded due to weathering and needs to be replaced if, 10 min after a rain event, residual water on its surface still causes a temperature deviation of more than 2 K, compared with a dry radome."

The method is fast, sensitive, and suitable for low-mass samples. Its application to a 6-year dataset from the Jungfraujoch site highlights its potential for source identification and understanding of biogenic and biomass burning tracers. 
 Sugars compose an important class of compounds by mass in atmospheric particulate matter (PM), often with biogenic and anthropogenic sources, many of them still poorly characterized. These sugars are mainly analysed by gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or ion chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (IC-PAD). However, these techniques present several disadvantages such as a complex preparation for GC-MS, or a limited range of possible analytes and elevated limits of quantification for IC-PAD. This hinders our capability to perform analyses of extensive time series, in order to develop our knowledge of the phenomenology of these species. In this paper, we present the validation of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 21 sugars in atmospheric PM. The sample preparation is simple, fast and safe, consisting of an aqueous extraction. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, and recovery. This technique showed excellent linearity (r2>0.99), precision (relative standard deviation RSD <25 %) and extraction yields (results between 70 % and 120 %). The suitability of the method for analyses of samples from sites with very low PM concentrations was demonstrated with samples from the High-Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ), Switzerland. A series of samples spanning a 6-year period is presented. Results for arabitol, levoglucosan and 2-methyl-tetrols display strong seasonality, due to seasonal variation in chemical production and boundary layer dynamics, with atmospheric convection and transport from the valleys to high altitudes mostly in summer. This simple and fast method facilitates the analysis of large sets of PM samples and sugar compounds, and opens the door to a better understanding and attribution of their sources."

The methodology identifies patterns with timescales of impact for one or more forcers using idealised experiments and anomaly calculations. Results for precipitation and temperature show good model performance and can reproduce hysteresis for overshoot scenarios. 
 Resolved spatial information for climate change projections is critical to any robust assessment of climate impacts and adaptation options. However, the range of spatially resolved future scenario assessments available is limited, due to the significant computational and human demands of Earth System Model (ESM) pipelines. In order to explore a wider variety of societal outcomes and to enable coupling of climate impacts into societal modelling frameworks, rapid spatial emulation of ESM responses to climate change is therefore desirable. Many existing pattern scaling methods assume spatial climate signals which scale linearly with global temperature change, where the pattern of response is independent of the nature and timing of emissions. However, this assumption may introduce biases in emulated climates, especially under net negative emissions and overshoot scenarios. To address these biases, we propose a novel emulation system, METEOR, which represents multi-timescale spatial climate responses to multiple climate forcers. The mapping of emissions to forcing is provided by the CICERO Simple Climate Model, combined with a calibration system that can be used to train model-specific pattern response engines using only core training simulations from CMIP. Here, we demonstrate that our fitted spatial emulation system is capable of rapidly and accurately predicting gridded annual mean temperature and precipitation responses to out-of-sample scenarios."

Our study reveals stripe patterns arise from mismatches between dynamic and physical calculations in models. Simplified experiments demonstrate that adjusting their connection eliminates stripes. This advances numerical weather prediction understanding, aiding forecasters and the public. Our diagnostic methods provide a framework for solving this global meteorological modeling challenge. 
 An unphysical stripe pattern is identified in low-level wind field in China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA-GFS), characterized by meridional stripes in u-component and zonal stripes in v-component. This stripe noise is primarily confined to the planetary boundary layer over land. The structural mismatch between static field variations and the observed 2Δx noise amplitude suggests that locally forced mechanisms from surface inhomogeneity alone cannot explain the wind stripe patterns. Meanwhile, pure dynamical core simulations exhibit no such noise, confirming that the dynamical core itself does not generate these patterns. These results suggest that staggered-grid mismatch in physics-dynamics coupling is likely the primary mechanism. Idealized two-dimensional experiments demonstrate that combining one-dimensional dynamic-core advection and physics-based vertical diffusion on a staggered grid generates 2Δx-wavelength spurious waves when surface friction is non-uniform. One-dimensional linear wave analysis further confirms that staggered-grid coupling between dynamic advection and inhomogeneous damping forcing induces dispersion errors in wave solutions. Sensitivity tests validate that eliminating grid mismatch in physics-dynamics coupling removes this stripe noise. These findings collectively indicate that while staggered grids benefit the dynamic core's numerical stability and accuracy, their inherent grid mismatch with physics parameterizations requires specialized coupling strategies to avoid spurious noise. Potential solutions to remedy this issue are discussed."

In this study, we address this ambiguity by introducing a physically constrained classification framework that applies advanced computer vision techniques to CloudSat‐CALIPSO observations. By tracking the complete physical evolution of cloud systems from their convective origins, this method enables a robust global separation of anvil and in situ cirrus. Our results illuminate stark contrasts in their macro‐ and micro‐properties, governed by fundamentally different mechanisms. Anvil cirrus extent is tightly coupled to dynamic factors, whereas in situ cirrus, while linked to local tropopause thermodynamics, exhibits strong modulation by remote atmospheric influences from the opposite hemisphere. This identified linkage shows a previously unrecognized interhemispheric teleconnection: wherein large‐scale deep convective systems in one hemisphere rapidly influence in situ cirrus formation in the other. We hypothesize that this coupling is mediated by planetary‐scale waves—likely fast‐propagating Kelvin waves that transmit energy across the equator, cooling the remote tropical tropopause layer, with subsequent interactions with the subtropical jet fostering mid‐latitude in situ development. This newly quantified atmospheric coupling provides a pathway for improving representation of cirrus in climate models and suggests a mechanism by which regional shifts in convection under global warming could reshape global cirrus distributions and their radiative impact."

Using a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model including solar wind, ionospheric, and plasmaspheric H+ and O+ components, coupled with ring current and polar wind models, we simulate the 8 September 2017 storm. The modeled plasmaspheric density closely matches RBSP observations on the dayside. Plasmaspheric‐origin H+ contributes significantly to plasma sheet mass density throughout the storm and becomes a major pressure source during the early main phase, accounting for up to 60% of the total pressure in localized regions. This pressure dominance occurs when pre‐existing plasmaspheric ions, accumulated in the dawnside plasma sheet due to asymmetric erosion, are energized by storm‐time processes. As the plasmasphere becomes depleted and refilling lags behind convection, this contribution diminishes. These results reveal a previously underappreciated role of plasmaspheric‐origin ions in pressure dynamics and provide new insight into storm‐time mass and energy transport."

Dipole moment tomography grids generated from the physics‐informed numerical inversion is first used to train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that maps surface SP sequences to 2D source distributions. While the numerical method is more responsive to transient signals, the ViT model better captures persistent spatial structures.

This study presents a global assessment of flash drought onset speed using satellite‐based evaporative stress estimates and Shapley Additive Explanation interpretation to identify dominant hydrometeorological factors that govern drought acceleration. We find that while humid regions experience flash droughts more frequently, events in drylands intensify more rapidly. This contrast reflects differences in energy and water constraints: net radiation plays a greater role in humid regions, whereas surface drying dominates in drylands. Moreover, short‐term antecedent moisture recovery followed by rapid drying accelerates the onset, with soil moisture depths and timescales exerting region‐specific influences. These results reveal climate‐dependent mechanisms underlying flash drought intensification and highlight the need for tailored monitoring strategies in diverse hydroclimatic contexts."

Additionally, diurnal variation in cloud properties of DCSs and their internal regions is revealed for the first time.

Auroral resonance scattering of an N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ 1NG (0, 1) (427.8 nm) emission starts to increase from the east, and then the increase of this resonance scattering emission extends to the magnetic zenith. The volume emission rate is evaluated from the rise in resonance scattering emission (time derivative of emission intensity). The volume emission rate of N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ (427.8 nm) reaches its maximum when the sunlight shadow height reaches 200 km, although the GLOW model predicted a peak altitude of N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ (427.8 nm) of 120 km. The higher altitude of the resonance scattering emission peak observed with HySCAI supports the idea that N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ is produced by the charge exchange between N2 ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ and O+ ${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$ existing at high altitudes.

Bernath,Analysis of Aerosols in the Asian Monsoon Anticyclone as Observed by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment,"During the Asian summer monsoon season, pollutants from the lower troposphere are transported through deep convection to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Surface pollutants such as CO are transported upward and trapped in the anticyclone during this unique atmospheric phenomenon. Associated with the anticyclone is a layer of enhanced aerosols located near the tropopause often referred to as the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL). The chemical and physical properties of aerosols in the ATAL are not yet fully understood as direct observations of the aerosols are limited. The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) is a satellite mission that provides high‐resolution infrared observations of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols. ACE observes chemical isolation in the anticyclone and identifies three main types of aerosols in the ATAL: solid ammonium nitrate (AN), sulfate aerosols, and ice. ACE observes four main features in the spectrum of AN; the previously known 831 cm−1 feature and the first‐ever identification of the spectral bands at 1,390–1,450 cm−1, 3,080 cm−1, and 3,220 cm−1. Simulated spectra reproduce the 831 cm−1, 3,080 cm−1, and 3,220 cm−1 features well but the 1,390–1,450 cm−1 spectral feature is poorly reproduced. In rare circumstances, ACE observes aerosols similar to AN far outside of the monsoon region. In these aerosols the 3,080 cm−1 and 3,220 cm−1 features align well with AN observed in the ATAL. The 831 cm−1 feature is suppressed and shifted to 829 cm−1, suggesting that AN aerosols outside the ATAL are liquid, or potentially an alternative phase of AN."

Based on the Self‐Organizing Map method, this study analyzed the typical synoptic types causing extreme summer precipitation events in the NTP and the role of local and non‐local land surface thermal changes. Results show that there are two typical synoptic types that are conducive to the occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the NTP and with an increasing trend, namely the shortwave type and the zonal high‐pressure type. Coupling with these two synoptic types, the reduced soil moisture (SM) in the southwestern and northeastern TP has a prior promotion on extreme precipitation events corresponding to two typical synoptic types in the NTP. The reduction in non‐local SM in the southwestern TP results in a dipole circulation pattern, which leads to convergence of warm and cold air and promotes the transport of moisture from the southwestern TP to the NTP. The reduction in local SM in the northeastern TP contributes to the development of an anticyclone over the northern TP that drives monsoon moisture from the east of the TP, while simultaneously suppressing the eastward export of moisture from the westerlies, leading to increased precipitation in the NTP. This study demonstrates that both local and non‐local thermal effects of the TP can drive extreme precipitation when coupling with specific synoptic types, and it provides some assistance in disaster forecasting and prediction."

Here, we analyzed 5481h $5\,481\,\mathrm{h}$ of lidar data gathered near Manaus, Brazil (July 2011–December 2017), to characterize the cirrus clouds over the Amazon rainforest. An automated routine set cloud boundaries, and multiple‐scattering‐corrected retrievals yielded cloud optical depth (COD) and the lidar ratio. Cirrus were found to occur with a frequency of 73.1%. Thin layers (COD=0.03 $\text{COD}=0.03$‐0.30) are the most prevalent with a 48.4% relative frequency, followed by opaque (>0.30 ${ >} 0.30$; 26.4%) and subvisual (<0.03 ${< } 0.03$; 25.2%). The mean base and top altitudes were 12.8±2.2km $12.8\pm 2.2\,\text{km}$ and 14.4±1.9km $14.4\pm 1.9\,\text{km}$, and the lidar ratio averaged 26.1±8.3sr $26.1\pm 8.3\,\text{sr}$. Thinner clouds clustered near the tropopause, while higher tops tracked the tropopause variability. A clear diurnal cycle shows a noon minimum frequency of occurrence and a late‐afternoon maximum, strongest for opaque cirrus and consistent with convective‐anvil outflow. Optical properties such as COD, lidar ratio, and geometric properties follow a well‐defined daily rhythm. Seasonally, cirrus are more frequent in the wet season (81.8%) than in the dry (56.7%). Bases, tops, and thickness are likewise larger in the wet season, whereas lidar ratios peak in the dry season. This long‐term record benchmarks satellite retrievals, sharpens radiative impact calculations, and clarifies cirrus formation over tropical forests."

Development of Algorithm Theoretical Basis,"This paper presents the first part of a two‐part study to develop a new algorithm to retrieve the aerosol vertical extinction profile using the hyperspectral measurements at ultraviolet bands, O2 A‐band and B‐band, from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We represent the aerosol vertical profile by the weighted sum of 3–5 most important EOFs (empirical orthogonal function, i.e., eigenvectors) from the principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15‐year record of aerosol extinction profiles from spaceborne lidar Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Hence, the retrieval is simplified to derive 3–5 coefficients or weights of corresponding EOFs to capture the variation of aerosol vertical profiles. A new PCA module was developed in the Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL‐VRTM) for calculating the Jacobians of top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) reflectance with respect to the weights of EOFs, which is used to facilitate the optimal inversion of the EOF weights. The analytical Jacobian calculations are validated against the Jacobians computed from a finite difference method. The averaging kernel analysis for directly retrieving the aerosol extinction profiles from measurements of TROPOMI and high‐resolution metagrating spectropolarimeter for aerosol profiling was provided. Finally, the retrieval experiments with synthetic TROPOMI measurements generated by UNL‐VRTM were conducted to verify the self‐consistency and feasibility of the inversion algorithm on a theoretical basis."

This study examines the impacts of three types of LLJs (Central, Northern, and Andes) on Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs), using a 4 km horizontal grid spacing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation and satellite‐based data. The Central and Andes LLJ types facilitate significant moisture flux convergence over the La Plata Basin (LPB), contributing to intense MCS activity and heavy precipitation. In contrast, the Northern LLJ type, operating over the eastern slopes of the northern Andes, exerts a weaker impact on MCS development over the Amazon Basin, leading to more scattered convection. Stronger LLJs support larger, longer‐lived MCSs with higher mean precipitation in jet exit regions. El Niño Southern Oscillation modulates these relationships, with El Niño increasing MCS size and duration in the Central LLJ region, while La Niña enhances MCS frequency in the Andes and Northern LLJ regions. The WRF model captures many of these dynamics but produces higher extreme MCS mean precipitation than IMERG. These findings highlight the importance of LLJ variability in modulating MCSs and suggest that future LLJ changes could alter the hydroclimate and extreme weather patterns in the region. This study underscores the utility of km‐scale models in representing the complex interactions of LLJs and MCSs, making them a promising tool to improve our understanding of these interactions and to assess the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and extreme weather in South America."

In this study, we leverage high‐altitude in situ observations from the NASA Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) field campaign—including data acquired near convection and at altitudes rarely covered by commercial aircraft—to investigate turbulence and its potential link to UTLS composition. We find that strong turbulence occurs frequently within 2 km above the tropopause, which corresponds to 1–2 km above deep convective cloud tops, particularly within moist convective plumes characterized by enhanced water vapor. The occurrence of strong turbulence increases with proximity to convection with elevated frequencies persisting out to 100 km from convective cores. In particular, enhanced turbulence potential occurs near UTLS convective outflows, which is supported by favorable environmental factors such as strong vertical wind shear, flow deformation, and large divergence tendencies. Furthermore, although turbulence intensity and water vapor are generally weakly correlated, positive correlations occur more frequently near the tropopause and under strong vertical wind shear, suggesting that turbulent mixing may contribute to localized stratospheric moistening under certain atmospheric conditions. The findings demonstrate the utility of high‐altitude in situ observations for advancing our understanding of UTLS turbulence and its influence on atmospheric composition, with implications not only for climate but also for future high‐altitude aviation applications."

In 2019–2024, numerous large‐scale wildfires occurred across the United States (US) and surrounding regions. We collected daily PM2.5 and maximum daily 8‐hr average O3 (MDA8) data from ∼800 US air quality monitoring sites (April–October, 2019–2024) and incorporated model‐based meteorological data (MERRA‐2 and HYSPLIT) and satellite‐derived parameters (HMS and TROPOMI) for use in a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Smoke days were identified using HMS and PM2.5 data, and GAMs were developed individually at each site for the MDA8 using non‐smoke days. Our results demonstrate that incorporating interaction smooth terms improves GAM performance, particularly for high‐altitude mountainous sites where simple models struggle with MDA8 predictions. We then applied the same model to the smoke days to quantify the smoke O3 contribution to the MDA8 (SMO). We estimated an overall mean SMO of 3.8 ppb across the US, adjusted to 2.8 ppb after bias correction via Empirical Distribution Matching (EDM) for a more conservative estimate. Exceedance days (>70 ppb) with significant SMO across the US totaled 5,393 (∼33%) and 4,099 (∼25%) in the uncorrected GAM and GAM‐EDM, respectively. A key advantage of our approach is its reliance on satellite and model‐based data, ensuring nationwide coverage and consistency. Our method can be broadly applied across the US to improve the understanding of smoke impacts on O3 and support regulatory decision making."

Our analysis shows that high‐O3 episodes now expand into spring and autumn in China, with warm‐season (April–September) maximum daily average 8‐hr (MDA8) O3 concentrations rising at 5.2 μg m−3 yr−1 during 2014–2023. Current O3 mitigation focuses on anthropogenic NOx emissions (ANOx) while neglecting the contribution of soil NOx emissions (SNOx) to tropospheric O3 formation. Here, we developed an innovative framework combining the machine learning model (XGBoost) with the Unified Inputs for WRF‐Chem (UI‐WRF‐Chem) to quantify the impacts of ANOx and SNOx on O3 increases during 2015–2019. Results show that although warm‐season SNOx constitute only 23%–27% of total NOx emissions in China (2015–2022), they generally drive O3 increases, exhibiting distinct regional and seasonal heterogeneities. Compared to urban areas, the O3 formation regimes in rural areas of the Yangtze River Delta region predominantly shift to NOx‐limited, making O3 highly sensitive to SNOx. SNOx changes lead to warm‐season MDA8 O3 increases of 1.0–1.3 μg m−3 during 2016–2019 relative to 2015. Although similar regime shifts have occurred, rural areas in the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei and Fenwei Plain regions still retain strong VOCs‐limited characteristics; thus, SNOx perturbation impacts on O3 are smaller. Although summer SNOx are higher, their contribution to O3 increases in transitional seasons (April, May, and September) shows an upward trend, suggesting more attention should be paid to fertilization‐driven SNOx. Our study highlights that future O3 control strategies should account for SNOx and their regional and seasonal differences."

However, unconcern about the subseasonal variability of SSTKOE substantially existed in previous studies. We first systematic exposed that the phase reversals of SSTKOE anomalies are an intrinsic and objective phenomenon, that is, the persistently warm SSTKOE anomalies in early‐autumn turns to cool in late‐autumn, and vice versa. This SSTKOE anomalies reversals, occurring in one‐quarter of years, accompanied by subsurface thermal, gradients and marine heatwaves undergo great changes in early‐ and late‐autumn. Utilizing observations and ocean model intercomparison project simulations, the impacts of atmospheric and oceanic variability were separated, and SSTKOE anomalies reversal was found to be mainly due to the atmospheric forcing. Specifically, the local anticyclonic circulation anomalies in early‐autumn enhanced the sinking motion and shortwave radiation, thus heating the sea surface. In late‐autumn, this region shifted to cyclonic circulation anomalies control, with enhanced cold ocean currents and increased cloudiness suppressing shortwave radiation, leading to SSTKOE reversal. The phase reversal of SSTKOE anomalies not only alters the ocean seasonality, but may also provide new predictors for mid‐ and low‐latitude extreme climate prediction."

Their future changes under warming is critical to the society. However, the exact impacts of thermodynamic environmental changes on them are difficult to resolve using climate model simulations which integrate both dynamic and thermodynamic factors. This study explores a theoretical modeling approach to isolate environmental thermodynamic effects on their future changes through a case study. For a 50‐day period during the 2020 summer, a pair of convection‐permitting model simulations indicate contrasting changes in MCSs and IDC between inland and coastal regions under pseudo global warming. Driven by the thermodynamic environments of these simulations, a single‐column parcel model indicates a decrease in the frequency of IDC occurrences, along with increases in duration and precipitation amount under warming, attributable to rising most unstable convective available potential energy (MUCAPE), convective inhibition (MUCIN), and precipitable water (PW). A multi‐column parcel model reveals contrasting changes in the frequency and mean area of MCSs between inland and coastal regions, underscoring the increase in mean MUCIN over inland regions and increases in mean MUCAPE and PW over coastal regions. The increase in mean MCS area over inland regions is linked to the interplay between accelerated gust fronts and enhanced subsidence strength, which is further traced to the unchanged mean MUCIN but increased mean MUCAPE in large‐scale environments. These case study results suggest a major role of thermodynamic environmental changes in controlling characteristics of MCSs and IDC under warming."

Current studies have mainly focused on the temperature effects of changes in land cover types; however, the impacts of vegetation self‐greening, characterized by natural physiological processes such as aging and canopy structure development, on land surface temperature (LST) remain unclear. Here, we employed a space‐for‐time approach to quantify the biophysical effects of vegetation greening on LST (i.e., ΔLST) across China from 2000 to 2018 using multi‐year satellite observations. We found that vegetation greening caused significant daytime cooling (−0.36 K), surpassing that of nighttime (−0.07 K) over the study period. Spatially, pronounced cooling dominated lower latitudes, contrasting with slight warming in mid‐to‐high latitudes, with this warming phenomenon being more evident at nighttime. The latitudinal transition of LST from cooling to warming occurred at around 47°N for daytime, nighttime, and daily mean values. This latitudinal pattern was season‐dependent, shifting to its northernmost extent in summer and southward to around 40°N in winter. Data‐driven methods revealed that albedo decreased by −0.0035 ± 0.009 in total, contributing to warming in Northeastern China, while evapotranspiration (ET) increased by 37.3 ± 33.9 mm across China, driving cooling in other regions. Our findings highlight the importance of vegetation greening in shaping local climate and advance understanding of vegetation feedback on climate, providing valuable insights for developing targeted land management strategies."

In Europe, floods now surpass other natural disasters in severity, causing substantial economic losses, particularly in the companies (commercial and industrial sectors). While river flood impacts on agriculture and residential properties have been extensively studied, research on companies losses remain limited despite their significantly high direct damages. This study enhances fluvial flood risk assessment for company assets by integrating flood hazard scenarios with flexible state‐of‐the‐art Bayesian Network‐based flood loss model and object‐specific exposure data. It estimates the expected annual damage (EAD) to company properties across Europe under a baseline and potential future scenarios shaped by climate change, exposure dynamics, and their combined effects. Additionally, the study assesses the potential of property‐level precautionary measures to mitigate flood risks. Results indicate that, compared to the baseline (year—1995), the EAD values could rise more than 5‐fold under RCP4.5 scenario and 7‐fold under RCP8.5 scenario by the end of the century. However, a policy scenario in which all companies implement at least one precautionary measure (“measures for all”) effectively offsets these projected losses by up to 67%.

However, changes in heat stress and labor capacity in major urban centers that attract rural‐to‐urban work migrants remain unexplored. Moreover, it remains unclear how the increased heat stress and reduced labor capacity under the warming climate will alter the most preferred workplaces for migrant laborers in India. Here, we use station‐based observations, reanalysis data, and climate model projections to reconstruct trends and variability in heat stress metrics, including wet‐bulb temperature for indoor exposure and wet‐bulb globe temperature for outdoor exposure based on migrant data from the 2011 Census. We show that during 1980–2021, most rural‐to‐urban migration hotspots in north, east, and southern India witnessed a significant (p < 0.05) rise in Tw, indicating elevated indoor heat stress. Over that interval, outdoor heat stress has considerably increased and led to a ∼10% decline in labor capacity in these hotspots. A substantial rise in the indoor and outdoor heat stress exposure of migrants and a reduction in their physical labor capacity is projected with each additional degree of global warming. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation variability can also significantly enhance these effects. Effective mitigation and adaptation options are needed to reduce the risks migrant workers face due to increasing indoor and outdoor heat stress in India."

Using generalized additive models fit to clinic‐level drought and flood exposures, we show how exposures vary across and within countries, model each clinic's probability of exposure to a drought or flood to identify high‐risk areas, and describe how this historical exposure record could ultimately be used to identify at‐risk populations for a wide variety of study designs. While EWEs occurred at HIV care clinics around the globe, we found that clinic locations in Southern Africa are particularly vulnerable to flood and drought events as compared to other IeDEA clinic regions and locations."

 The nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) is an important step in eukaryotic gene expression1. Despite recent molecular insights into how newly transcribed mRNAs are packaged into ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs)2,3, the subsequent events that govern mRNA export are poorly understood. Here, we uncover the molecular basis underlying key events of human mRNA export, including the remodeling of mRNP-bound transcription-export complexes (TREX), the formation of export-competent mRNPs, the docking of mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and the release of mRNPs at the NPC to initiate their export.

 Water on the surface of the Moon is a key factor in tracing lunar surface processes and represents a potential future resource for lunar exploration. Samples from the Apollo and Luna missions provide constraints on the content and possible origin of this water, but represent only low latitudes on the Moon’s nearside. Information about the lunar farside has been restricted to remote sensing observations and thus the global distribution and origin of lunar surface water are still debated. Here we performed laboratory analyses of samples from the lunar farside at mid-latitudes returned by the Chang’e-6 mission. We find that the samples have very low δD values (as low as −983‰) and high water contents (up to 1.7 wt%) in the topmost layers of grains, indicating that solar-wind implantation is the primary source. The water contents are comparable to those reported for Chang’e-5 samples from mid-latitudes on the nearside, but nearly double those of Apollo samples. Infrared reflectance spectra further reveal that the bulk Chang’e-6 samples exhibit stronger OH/H2O features and higher maturity than Chang’e-5 samples, despite both showing similar water content profiles with depth. These findings suggest that the distribution of water on the lunar surface is strongly dependent on latitude, with the bulk water content also depending on regolith maturity. Our findings imply that lunar surface water may be more abundant in highly mature regolith in high-latitude regions. Analyses of Chang’e-6 samples from the lunar farside reveal high water contents and low δD values, with comparisons to other lunar samples suggesting that solar-wind-implanted surface water varies with latitude and regolith maturity."

 Transition metal-catalyzed C–C reductive coupling reactions avoid the direct use of sensitive metal reagents, representing a practical approach for constructing the skeletons of organic compounds. However, such reactions face significant challenges in constructing quaternary carbon centers. Herein, we report an example of iron-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling reaction of tertiary alkyl halides with allyl halides by using phosphine ligands. A directing strategy is developed for diverse reductive couplings of 3o C(sp3) with 1o C(sp3) and even 2o C(sp3). The directing effect of the carbonyl of amides and esters facilitates the iron catalyst in overcoming the substantial steric hindrance and numerous competing side reactions, allowing the reaction to proceed smoothly.

 Mucosal influenza vaccines may provide improved protection against infection and transmission, but their development is hindered by absence of immune correlates of protection. Here, we report a randomized, controlled phase I trial of a recombinant influenza A/H5 (A/Indonesia/05/2005, clade 2.1) hemagglutinin vaccine formulated with a nanoemulsion adjuvant (W805EC). The vaccine is administered intranasally in two doses 28 days apart at three antigen levels. Controls receive unadjuvanted H5 or placebo. Six months later, participants receive an intramuscular boost with unadjuvanted inactivated A/H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, clade 1) vaccine. Primary outcomes are solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs), laboratory safety abnormalities, medically-attended AEs, potential immune-mediated conditions, new-onset chronic conditions, and serious AEs. All vaccines are well tolerated. After the intranasal series, hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization responses are minimal. However, adjuvanted H5 recipients show significant increases in mucosal and serum IgG/IgA, surface plasmon resonance antibody binding, memory B and CD4 T cell activity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

 Compute-in-memory technology offers promising solutions for neural network acceleration but its potential is severely limited by inflexible and resource-intensive analog-to-digital converters. Here, we present a memristor-based analog-to-digital converter featuring adaptive quantization for diverse output distributions. Our design employs analog content-addressable memory cells with programmable overlapped boundaries to establish optimized quantization thresholds, demonstrating excellent integral and differential non-linearities. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of our approach by achieving 89.55% accuracy on CIFAR-10 (VGG8) at 5-bit adaptive quantized precision and maintaining competitive performance on ImageNet (ResNet18) through a proposed super-resolution strategy under experimental memristor variations. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, our converter achieves a 15.1× improvement in energy efficiency and a 12.9× reduction in area.

Here, the authors fill this gap showing that such representations can successfully and rigorously approximate bosonic physics. 
 Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect to Bose–Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typically, truncating their infinite-dimensional state space or restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to these simple classes, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional spaces. Can we trust that results obtained with such simplifying assumptions capture real effects? We solve this outstanding problem, showing that these effective descriptions do correctly capture the physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contributions are twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical bosonic unitary evolution can be accurately approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, show that polynomial Hamiltonians generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and lead to a bosonic Solovay–Kitaev theorem. Bosonic systems live in an infinite-dimensional space, and in order to be able to describe them one usually reduces it to an effective finite dimension or constrain the dynamics in some way, but it is not fully understood whether this captures all the physics at play.

Here, the authors discover an alternate site on nuclear receptors that can be targeted by degraders. 
 Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) containing a target protein ligand linked to an E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand induce target protein degradation through E3 recruitment. Most PROTACs bind a surface cleft of the protein of interest rather than a buried pocket. Using the nuclear receptor PXR, we previously described the inherent difficulties of PROTAC targeting via a deep solvent-inaccessible ligand binding pocket. Here, we discover that the CRBN-dependent MDM2 PROTAC MD-224 is a potent PXR degrader that achieves its activity from binding adjacent to the ligand-binding pocket. Furthermore, because the proximal region is a structural feature common among nuclear receptors, MD-224 also targets additional receptors for proteasomal degradation. Using structure- and activity-guided medicinal chemistry, we ablated MDM2 degradation and generated MD-224 analogs with activities skewed toward different receptors. Thus, we describe (1) PROTAC repurposing as a potential route of degrader discovery and (2) nuclear receptor-targeted degradation through a noncanonical binding site. Chemically induced protein degradation is a powerful alternative to classical inhibition, but some proteins have deeply masked binding pockets that make the development of degrader molecules difficult.

 The human circadian clock integrates external environmental changes and internal physiological signals to generate natural oscillations of secreted endocrine signals to regulate diverse biological processes. Here, we explore human receptors responsive to molecules displaying in vivo oscillatory patterns and identify melatonin receptor 1A (MTNR1A) as a promising molecular sensor to trigger transgene expression. We engineer a melatonin-inducible gene switch consisting of ectopically expressed MTNR1A linked to an amplifier module utilizing the native Gαs protein-mediated cell signaling cascade, which involves adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, protein kinase A and the cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB, to drive transgene expression from a synthetic promoter. This system operates within the physiological melatonin concentration range, selectively responding to night-phase levels of the diurnal rhythm, while remaining unresponsive to day-phase levels. Such temporal control suggests its potential for personalized cell- and gene-based therapies requiring once-per-day dosing regimen. As proof-of-concept, we show that alginate-encapsulated engineered cells implanted in C3H/HeJ male mice can translate circadian inputs or clinically licensed MTNR1A agonists into regulated GLP-1 expression as a therapeutic output exclusively secreted during nighttime, highlighting potential as an experimental cell therapy for obesity-dependent type-2 diabetes.

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends describing low-probability outcomes using negative verbal probability terms such as unlikely, rather than positive terms such as a small probability. However, we propose that this choice of probability terms might undermine public perception and understanding of climate science. Across eight preregistered experiments (N = 4,150), we find that participants perceive outcomes described with negative low probability terms as reflecting lower scientific consensus than probabilistically equivalent but positively framed terms. The effect persists after controlling for beliefs in climate change, familiarity with the IPCC and political orientation, although it weakens when the projected values exceeded participants’ personal expectations. Participants also associate negative low-probability terms more strongly with extreme outcomes and judge them as less evidence-based than their positive counterparts. We recommend using positive verbal probabilities to communicate comparable levels of uncertainty without undermining perceptions of scientific consensus and evidence.

 The Atlantic Niño is the dominant mode of interannual variability in the Tropical Atlantic with significant impacts on local and remote climate patterns. Despite recent advances in understanding the mechanisms leading to weakened Atlantic Niño variability, its primary causes remain unknown. Here, we use an Earth System Model to show that the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modulates air-sea feedbacks in the equatorial Atlantic through both atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections. The combination of a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the propagation of oceanic downwelling Kelvin waves due to an AMOC weakening, generated in the subpolar North Atlantic, deepens the eastern thermocline and weakens the equatorial trade winds, leading to a decoupling in air-sea feedbacks.

 Phytoplankton net primary production in the Arctic has historically been constrained to a short, intense summer bloom that sustains fish, seabird, and marine mammal populations.

We use an ensemble of Earth system model simulations to isolate the impact of climate change on the timing, duration, and importance (relative contribution to total net primary production) of the bloom. Earlier blooms emerge across 71% of the Arctic Ocean by 2100, when blooms begin 34 days earlier and last 15 days longer than in 1970. Productivity is less concentrated in a single bloom in sub-Arctic seas and on Arctic inflow shelves by 2100, indicating that the bloom declines in importance.

 During an earthquake rupture, both dynamic and static stress drop play a key role in controlling how much energy is radiated as seismic waves, how large is the fault slip, and how quickly the rupture spreads out of the nucleation zone. Using a time-domain analysis of P- and S-wave log-displacement records, we estimate seismic moment, rupture velocity, static stress drop, and source radius of 56 Md 3+ earthquakes detected during the 2020-2025 seismic crisis at Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy. Fractures propagated at sub-shear velocities (0.4-0.9 of the shear wave velocity) along 100-1000 m in radius fault surfaces. Independent stress release estimates show a statistically significant inverse relation with the rupture velocity. The measured low seismic radiation efficiency, with a median value of 0.1, suggests that only a small portion of the stress drop is radiated as seismic waves, implying that a significant amount of energy is likely dissipated through frictional and inelastic processes, including off-fault damage. The findings suggest that in this volcanic caldera, earthquakes with higher stress drop may enhance fault-surrounding damage, which acts as a natural barrier to rupture propagation. Consequently, this mechanism could limit rupture extent and constrain the maximum magnitude of earthquakes in the area.

 The expansion of natural gas production and utilization worldwide has led to the decline of many once-productive wells, eventually resulting in costly well-plugging and unused infrastructure. However, in areas like the Michigan basin, MI, where the majority of natural gas is biogenically produced, microbial communities could potentially be stimulated to generate additional methane, increasing gas supply and reducing the need to drill new wells. In this study, we performed metaproteomic, metagenomic, and geochemical analyses of Antrim Shale formation water from a marginally producing natural gas well to evaluate resident microbial community functions in the context of potential bioenergy production. Functional proteins involved in methanogenesis, degradation/catabolism (including organic matter degradation), biosynthesis, energy utilization, transmembrane transport, and stress response were among the most commonly identified groups. Three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were characterized, including Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanothrix, and Smithella. For each, the identified proteins involved in methanogenesis and the degradation of diverse organic compounds, strongly suggest their role in utilizing shale-derived organic matter. These findings provide an increased understanding of the microorganisms and their metabolisms generating natural gas in the Antrim Shale and establish a foundation for future stimulation efforts aimed at enhancing biogenic methane production in marginal gas wells.

 Accurate maps of cropland soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and clay content are essential for climate-smart agriculture. Soil reflectance composites (SRC), derived from multispectral bare soil observations, offer a scalable approach to high-resolution soil mapping. While studies often focus on maximizing model performance, challenges remain regarding (1) the bias introduced by masking and excluding soil samples during SRC generation and (2) the accurate representation of the full range and distribution of soil properties in the resulting maps. Evaluating different SRC parameters, we found that commonly used indices such as the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were significantly correlated with clay content and SOCS, respectively. These dependencies can lead to the systematic exclusion of high SOCS (>80 Mg ha−1) and clay (>30 mass%) samples during SRC generation, introducing bias in the resulting maps. Models trained solely on SRC bands failed to capture the full range of the training data, limiting the applicability of the soil property maps. While the inclusion of additional remote sensing features, such as spectral-temporal metrics and indices, significantly improved the prediction accuracy, the representation of the imbalanced samples remained challenging. We demonstrated that a combined framework of spatial data augmentation and majority undersampling was effective in improving the range and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the predictions (SOCS = 0.82; Clay = 0.9). Our findings emphasize the importance of (1) evaluating excluded samples to identify potential SRC-induced bias, and (2) optimizing model predictions reflecting the observed data range to improve the reliability and usability of the resulting soil maps."

 High-resolution monitoring of root-zone soil moisture is essential for optimizing irrigation in precision agriculture. This study demonstrates the potential of drone-borne Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) to map spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics across an agricultural field over an entire growing season. Using the innovative gprSense® system, which combines a frequency-domain radar with full-wave inversion, we achieved precise and automated data acquisition and processing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement time-lapse, root-zone soil moisture mapping using drone-borne GPR combined with real-time full-wave inversion. Time-lapse mapping was conducted in a spinach field, yielding eight high-resolution soil moisture maps that captured dynamic variations driven by precipitation and irrigation. Operating in the frequency range 110–120 MHz, the system measured soil moisture down to a depth of approximately 35–40 cm, with comparisons performed using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and mass balance analyses. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) provided complementary data into soil electrical conductivity patterns. Results revealed strong agreement between GPR-derived soil moisture estimates and conventional methods, with spatial patterns aligning closely with predictions from Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models.

 Current disaster and emergency management services produce flood maps within hours using satellite data. To handle large-scale events efficiently, a reliable automated method is needed to generate an initial flood extent map, which can then be refined manually.Launched in December 2022, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, equipped with the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn), provides high-resolution radar observations used here for flood detection. While not initially designed for detailed flood mapping in vegetated or urban regions, the performance of SWOT’s Pixel Cloud products was assessed during four major flood events in Greece, France, Brazil, and the USA. Each event is paired with Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 imagery within a 3-hour time frame, providing a valuable opportunity to compare and evaluate SWOT’s flood detection capabilities.Three radar variables of the Pixel Cloud products are studied for extracting flood extents: σ0, coherent power, and interferometric coherence — which is computed from the two complex interferograms. They are compared to the built-in classification and flood masks computed from Sentinel-1/2. The study demonstrates the capabilities of the SWOT satellite in detecting flooded vegetation, flooded urban areas, and even regions with high snow cover. However, limitations are observed: (1) when high soil moisture is observed, causing signal saturation, (2) SWOT can be sensitive to the incidence angle, both of which lead to less reliable flood extent estimation. These findings highlight the potential of SWOT satellite for improving global flood mapping, as well as the need for further exploration to address current limitations and enhance flood monitoring capabilities in the near future."

 With the continuous advancement of global urbanization and industrialization, the pollution issue (e.g., light pollution) has become increasingly severe, posing a serious threat to the global dark sky quality. Evaluating the global dark sky quality and conducting site selection for potential dark sky parks not only contribute to the protection of natural ecosystems and the safeguarding of ecological security, but also provide scientific reference for sustainable ecotourism. Thus, our study integrated remote sensing nighttime light, cloud cover, and other data to develop a global dark sky quality identification based on the random forest model, effectively achieving interannual and seasonal dynamic identification of global dark sky quality. Then, the study defined global construction potential constraints and conducted site selection research for potential conventional dark sky parks and potential seasonal dark sky parks. The results show that in 2023, areas with high dark sky quality accounted for only 20.6 % globally, mainly distributed in high-altitude or arid regions worldwide, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, inland Australia, and other areas. From 2012 to 2023, global dark sky quality exhibited an interannual fluctuation pattern of “decline–rise–decline” and further showed significant seasonal differences. In addition, the identified potential conventional dark sky parks are mainly distributed in southern Africa, the southwestern United States, and other regions, while potential seasonal dark sky parks are mainly located in the Korean Peninsula, southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and other areas.

 Seafloor topography is a fundamental element of the marine environment, playing a critical role in understanding geological evolution, hydrodynamic patterns, sediment distribution and benthic habitat structure. However, due to the low resolution of existing seafloor digital elevation models (DEMs), refined modelling techniques that can accurately represent the complexity of seafloor topographic environment are urgently needed. Aiming to address this need, this study introduces Bathy-DDPM, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) that incorporates shipborne bathymetric data into its loss function to enhance DEM super-resolution. Leveraging GEBCO DEM data and single-beam bathymetric measurements, the model employs transfer learning by pretraining on land-based data and fine-tuning with limited marine datasets. Experimental results show that Bathy-DDPM consistently outperforms traditional interpolation methods and existing deep learning models (Bathy-CNN, Bathy-GAN, Bathy-TfaSR and Bathy-MSRResNet) across all the evaluation metrics. Compared to the advanced MSRResNet model, Bathy-DDPM achieves 18.2% reduction in MAE and a 15.2% reduction in RMSE, highlighting the efficacy of DDPM-based architectures in reconstructing complex seafloor topography. Additionally, Bathy-DDPM exhibits rapid convergence during training, improving training efficiency. The integration of shipborne bathymetric points also enhances performance across various deep learning models, particularly within GAN-based architectures. Furthermore, analysis results of bathymetry loss weight and measurement point density reveal that both factors notably influence model performance, with optimal results achieved at moderate loss weights and high spatial sampling densities. Overall, Bathy-DDPM shows strong potential for high-resolution seafloor reconstruction in data-scarce regions, offering valuable support for geospatial analysis and marine scientific research."

 Under the dual pressures of climate change and rapid urbanization, the frequent occurrence of flood disasters has become a global challenge. The widespread use of social media provides new perspectives for broader and more comprehensive perception of flood disaster events, and a social media-enabled flood disaster informatics framework has gradually taken shape.

The literature review indicates that social media has been proven effective in compensating for the limitations of traditional flood monitoring approaches. In particular, multimodal data fusion and the application of artificial intelligence techniques can significantly enhance global flood monitoring capabilities. However, current research still faces challenges such as verifying data authenticity and integrating information across platforms.

 Daily actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial variable for efficient water resource management and irrigation planning, highlighting the need for timely and accurate ET products to support agricultural decision-making. This study presents a practical workflow for generating all-weather, daily ET data by integrating remote sensing and meteorological inputs. A pixel-wise land surface temperature (LST)–fractional vegetation cover (FVC) space is constructed based on energy balance theory, and a combination of remote sensing, meteorological, and physical model outputs are used as input features for machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate ET. To address data gaps caused by cloud cover, land surface temperature (LST) derived from the Noah land surface model was utilized to supplement missing MODIS LST data, and separate ML models were developed for cloud-free and cloud-cover conditions. The ET predicted by both these models were integrated to produce all-weather ET. A comparative analysis between latent heat flux (LE) derived from this workflow and in-situ measurements collected in Nebraska (NE) during 2004 and 2012 demonstrated robust performance, R2 and RMSE are 0.70 and 90.03 W/M2 (NE1), 0.75 and 78.50 W/m2 (NE2) and 0.75 and 79.77 W/m2 (NE3), respectively.

 The gas-phase hydration of SO3 by water, forming sulfuric acid, is the primary atmospheric removal pathway for SO3. However, in some circumstances, this reaction competes with the formation of organosulfates (OSs) from SO3 and small hydroxyl-containing molecules. The mechanism for aromatic OS formation via reactions of phenols or aromatic alcohols with SO3 remains poorly understood. This study employs quantum chemistry calculations to investigate aromatic OS formation in the gas phase for monocyclic hydroxylated aromatics (phenols and aromatic alcohols). For the ternary reactions (SO3 + H2O + phenol/aromatic alcohol), two pathways occur: aromatic OS formation (catalyzed by H2O); sulfuric acid formation (catalyzed by the phenol/aromatic alcohol). Comparison of Gibbs free energy barriers and reaction rates shows the aromatic OS formation pathway predominates. Furthermore, while the Gibbs free energy barriers for uncatalyzed aromatic OS formation (19.29–30.89 kcal mol−1) are significantly higher than that for water-catalyzed SO3 hydration (7.86 kcal mol−1), the inclusion of a catalytic water molecule drastically lowers these barriers: phenols + SO3 + H2O: 6.35–11.68 kcal mol−1; aromatic alcohols + SO3 + H2O: 2.10–2.62 kcal mol−1.

 In climatology, the South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon (SCSSM) onset features rapid establishment of low-level westerlies and convection across the entire basin, in contrast to Indian summer monsoon onset which begins with northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Diverse SCSSM onset pathways complicate subseasonal rainfall forecasts in the surrounding region during boreal spring. Besides simultaneous onset in the SCS, this study recognizes two other types of SCSSM onset: northern-initiated and southern-initiated pathways. In the northern-initiated type, the low-level westerly wind begins over northern SCS, accompanied by a positive Tripole mode in the North Atlantic and decaying El Niño SSTAs in the Pacific. This SSTA configuration regulates the extra-tropical meridional cell and tropical Walker circulation to shift the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) southward, suppressing (intensifying) westerly wind in the southern (northern) SCS. In contrast, the southern-initiated type features initiation of westerly wind in the southern SCS. This type is ascribed to the tropical southern Indian Ocean cooling and negative Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM)-like pattern. The colder Indian Ocean boosts northward migration of ITCZ over Arabian Sea, which strengthens low-level westerly wind over the southern SCS by enhancing cross-equatorial Somali jet and shifts the WPSH northward, thereby suppressing the monsoon onset over the northern SCS.

 This study reports the first observation of dual upward positive leaders (UPL1 and UPL2) emerging between the initial continuous current (ICC) termination and the first return stroke (RS1) in rocket-triggered lightning. Synchronized current, electric field measurements, and high-speed optical imaging were used to analyze the propagation characteristics and triggering mechanisms of these two leaders. Bipolar variations in the electric field indicate that both UPLs were related to the approach of intracloud negative leaders. UPL1, an attempted leader that failed to connect to the cloud, exhibited a two-dimensional (2-D) propagation speed ranging from 0.10 × 106 to 4.31 × 106 m/s, with an average speed of 1.63 × 106 m/s, significantly higher than that of traditional UPLs in triggered lightning. The high speed was due to the pre-ionized channel by the ICC stage. UPL2 successfully connected to the negative charge region in the cloud, establishing a stable discharge channel. Analysis of optical and electric field diagrams indicates that the successful connection was closely related to improved channel conditions and UPL1-induced dynamic modulation of the ambient electric field. These findings shed light on the physical mechanisms of multiple leader attempts during the ICC-RS transition, providing new insights into the complexity of lightning discharge processes."
