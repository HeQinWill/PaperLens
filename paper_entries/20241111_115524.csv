10.1021/acs.est.4c08060,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了如何将国家层面电力系统模型的年运行数据细化到小时尺度的排放数据，以更好地与大气污染物输送模型结合。它提出了一种新的基于机理的时空下推方法 (TDM)，通过优化发电机调度来考虑天气敏感型电力需求和风能、太阳能发电的波动对排放的影响。论文以弗吉尼亚-卡罗来纳地区为例，将TDM的结果与传统的统计下推方法（SMOKE模型）进行了比较。结果表明，TDM生成的排放曲线能够对天气变化做出响应，例如氮氧化物排放与臭氧形成条件正相关，而SMOKE模型由于依赖历史运行模式，对天气条件不敏感，尤其是在高比例可再生能源渗透率和气候变化情景下存在偏差。该研究对于提高电力行业排放清单的精度和准确性，以及更准确地评估电力系统运行和排放政策的影响具有重要意义，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为更精确的排放清单是进行大气环境遥感数据分析和反演的基础。,"['Nitrogen oxide', 'Ozone', 'Air quality modeling', 'Emission inventory', 'Downscaling', 'Power sector emissions']",Shen Wang;Hanzhi Wang;J. Hugh Ellis;Benjamin F. Hobbs,Linking Electricity and Air Quality Models by Downscaling: Weather-Informed Hourly Dispatch of Generation Accounting for Renewable and Load Temporal Variability Scenarios,"National models of the electric sector typically consider a handful of generator operating periods per year, while pollutant fate and transport models have an hourly resolution. We bridge that scale gap by introducing a novel fundamental-based temporal downscaling method (TDM) for translating national or regional energy scenarios to hourly emissions. Optimization-based generator dispatch is used to account for variations in emissions stemming from weather-sensitive power demands and wind and solar generation. The TDM is demonstrated by downscaling emissions from the electricity market module in the National Energy Model System. As a case study, we implement the TDM in the Virginia–Carolinas region and compare its results with traditional statistical downscaling used in the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) processing model. We find that the TDM emission profiles respond to weather and that nitrogen oxide emissions are positively correlated with conditions conducive to ozone formation. In contrast, SMOKE emission time series, which are rooted in historical operating patterns, exhibit insensitivity to weather conditions and potential biases, particularly with high renewable penetration and climate change. Relying on SMOKE profiles can also obscure variations in emission patterns across different policy scenarios, potentially downplaying their impacts on power system operations and emissions."

Ultrasound cavitation, renowned for its capacity to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), has garnered considerable attention in environmental remediation. This study reveals a highly synergistic mechanism in ultrasound coupled stirring (US-ST), establishing optimal coupling conditions through sound field monitoring and quantification of ROS. In comparison to ultrasound treatment alone (US), the sound pressure amplitude significantly increased from ±18 to ±30 kPa in US-ST, markedly reducing the cavitation nucleation threshold and augmenting the steady-state concentration of hydroxyl radicals (HO•) by 13-fold. Further, with appropriate charge transfer conditions enabled by the acoustoelectric characteristics of the passive film on stirring paddles, the concentrations of superoxide (•O2–) and singlet oxygen (1O2) elevated to 9.54 × 10–10 M and 8.43 × 10–13 M, respectively. Under the regulation of 500 rpm stirring vortex, a maximum sonochemical efficiency of 6.5 × 105 mg J–1 was achieved. In the context of domestic wastewater, ammonia nitrogen degradation was achieved through the oxidation and thermal dissociation effects of US-ST. The concentration decreased from 27.5 to 3.4 mg/L after 2 h, with an impressive N2 selectivity of 96.8%. This study elucidates the targeted conversion mechanism of ammonia nitrogen in US-ST, introducing an emerging water treatment technology propelled by mechanical energy."

Pennell,"Accurate Determination of Perfluorooctanoate Aqueous Solubility, Critical Micelle Concentration, and Acid Dissociation Constant","Although physical-chemical properties are critical for understanding the behavior of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment, data reported in the literature can vary by orders of magnitude. The goal of this research was to accurately determine the aqueous solubility (Saq), critical micelle concentration (CMC), and acid dissociation constant (pKa) of perfluorooctanoic acid (HPFO) and ammonium perfluoro-n-octanoate (APFO). The aqueous solubilities of HPFO in deionized (DI) water and 100 mM NaCl were ∼4500 and ∼12,500 mg/L, respectively, while APFO yielded aqueous solubilities of ∼47,000 and ∼45,000 mg/L in DI water and 100 mM NH4Cl, respectively. Based on surface tension measurements, no CMC value was obtained for HPFO because the solubility limit was reached before micelle formation occurred, while in 100 mM NaCl the CMC was ∼3000 mg/L. The CMCs of APFO in DI water and 100 mM NH4Cl were ∼12,700 and ∼4,900 mg/L, respectively. These findings demonstrate that PFOA (1) is unlikely to form micelles in solution at environmentally relevant concentrations, (2) reported CMC values may actually correspond to the solubility limit rather than micelle formation, and (3) aqueous solubility values can vary by orders of magnitude depending upon the counterion species and solution properties."

Frajka‐Williams,Turbulent Vertical Velocities in Labrador Sea Convection,"Turbulent vertical velocity measurements are scarce in regions prone to convection such as the Labrador Sea, which hinders our understanding of deep convection dynamics. Vertical velocity, w $w$, is retrieved from wintertime glider deployments in the convective region. From w $w$, downward convective plumes of dense waters are identified. These plumes only cover a small fraction of the convective area. Throughout the convective area, the standard deviation of w $w$ agrees with scaling relations for the atmospheric surface and boundary layers. It initially depends on surface buoyancy loss in winter, and later, on wind stress after mid‐March. Both periods are characterized by positive turbulent vertical buoyancy flux. During convective periods in winter, the positive buoyancy flux is mostly forced by surface heat loss. After mid‐March, when buoyancy loss to the atmosphere is reduced, the positive buoyancy flux results from a restratifying upward freshwater flux, potentially of lateral origins and without much atmospheric influence."

Various metrics have been used to quantify AA based on SAT anomalies, trends, or variability, and they can yield quite different conclusions regarding the magnitude and temporal patterns of AA. This study examines and compares various AA metrics for their temporal consistency in the region north of 70°N from the early twentieth to the early 21st century using observational data and reanalysis products. We also quantify contributions of different radiative feedback mechanisms to AA based on short‐term climate variability in reanalysis and model data using the Kernel‐Gregory approach. Albedo and lapse rate feedbacks are positive and comparable, with albedo feedback being the leading contributor for all AA metrics. The net cloud feedback, which has large uncertainties, depends strongly on the data sets and AA metrics used. By quantifying the influence of internal variability on AA and related feedbacks based on global climate model ensemble simulations, we find that water vapor and cloud feedbacks are most heavily affected by internal variability."

It is critical to reasonably simulate the hydrological cycle over the TP in order to assess future climate risks to agriculture, water resources and ecosystem services. To address the chronic wet biases over the TP in state‐of‐the‐art climate models, we have compared 12 high‐resolution (HR) climate models (25–50 km) to their corresponding low‐resolution versions (100–200 km) with respect to the 1979–2014 climatology. It is found that the HR models consistently reduce about half of the wet biases over the TP, mainly from better resolved orography. The wet biases are reduced by 41% over the northern and western TP, mainly contributed by decreased frequency of light precipitation (0.1–10 mm day−1), which is attributed to reduced evaporation because of weakened surface wind by raised orography. The most significant reduction of biases (53%) rising from decreased frequency of mid‐heavy precipitation (10–50 mm day−1), appears over the southern and eastern TP, on the leeside of elevated orography where steeper orography enhances rain shadow effect by stronger downward motion along the sharper slope, while partly compensated by air column convergence due to vertical stretching of the downward flow for potential vorticity conservation. This study highlights the importance of surface processes and resolving complex orography in simulating precipitation and large‐scale hydrology around the TP which potentially benefits the future hydrological projection."

Here, we investigate the concentrations and isotopic compositions of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) at four rural sites in the TP and three urban sites surrounding the TP to quantify the sources of GEM in the TP. GEM concentrations in the surrounding cities (site‐specific means: 2.36–9.12 ng m−3) were highly elevated mainly due to strong local anthropogenic emissions as indicated by their negative δ202Hg and near zero Δ199Hg and Δ200Hg signatures. GEM isotopes indicate that GEM pollution in the TP, typically observed during the summer monsoon and the pre‐monsoon, were mainly caused by trans‐boundary transport of anthropogenic Hg from surroundings. Using an Hg isotope mixing model, we estimate that exogenous anthropogenic emissions on average contributed 26 ± 5% (1sd) to the GEM in the TP. Further analysis of the transport of anthropogenic Hg emissions based on the backward trajectory and gridded anthropogenic Hg emissions suggests that 16 ± 9% and 6 ± 13% of the GEM in the TP were derived from anthropogenic sources in South Asia and China, respectively. Our study suggests that anthropogenic Hg emissions in South Asia could be effectively transported to the TP across the Himalayan range. Future studies are needed to better assess the role of rapidly increasing anthropogenic Hg emissions in South Asia on the regional to global scale atmospheric Hg cycling."

Reed,Exploring the Spatially Compounding Multi‐Sectoral Drought Vulnerabilities in Colorado's West Slope River Basins,"The state of Colorado's West Slope Basins are critical headwaters of the Colorado River and play a vital role in supporting Colorado's local economy and natural environment. However, balancing the multi‐sectoral water demands in the West Slope Basins while maintaining crucial downstream deliveries to Lake Powell is an increasing challenge for water managers. Internal variability of the hydroclimatic system and climate change complicate future vulnerability assessments. This work contributes a detailed accounting of multi‐sectoral drought vulnerability in the West Slope Basins and the impacts of drought on downstream deliveries. We first introduce a novel multi‐site Hidden Markov Model (HMM)‐based synthetic streamflow generator to create an ensemble of streamflows for all West Slope basins that better characterizes the region's drought extremes. We capture the effects of climate change by perturbing the HMM to generate an ensemble of streamflows reflecting plausible changes in climate. We then route both ensembles through StateMod, Colorado's water allocation model, to evaluate spatially compounding drought impacts across the West Slope Basins. Our results illustrate how drought events emerging from the system's stationary internal variability in the absence of climate change can significantly impact local water uses and deliveries to Lake Powell, exceeding extreme conditions in the historical record. Further, we find that even modest climate change can cause a regime shift where historically low downstream delivery volumes and extreme drought impacts become routine. These results can inform future Colorado River planning efforts, and our methodology can be expanded to other snow‐dominated regions that face persistent droughts."

Cholera, an acute waterborne diarrheal disease, remains a major global health challenge. Despite being curable and preventable, it can be fatal if left untreated, especially for children. Bangladesh, a cholera‐endemic country with a high disease burden, experiences two peaks annually, during the dry pre‐monsoon spring and the wet post‐monsoon fall seasons. An early warning system for disseminating cholera risk, which has potential to reduce the disease burden, currently does not exist in Bangladesh. Such systems can raise timely awareness and allow households in rural, riverine areas like Matlab to make behavioral adjustments with water usage and around water resources to reduce contracting and transmitting cholera. Current dissemination approaches typically target local government and public health organizations; however, the vulnerable rural populations largely remain outside the information chain. Here, we develop and evaluate the accuracy of an early warning system—CholeraMap that uses high‐resolution earth observations to forecast cholera risk and disseminate geocoded risk maps directly to Matlab's population via a mobile smartphone application. Instead of relying on difficult to obtain station‐based environmental and hydroclimatological data, this study offers a new opportunity to use remote sensing data sets for designing and operating a disease early warning system. CholeraMap delivers monthly, color‐coded geospatial maps (1 km × 1 km spatial resolution) with household and community cholera risk information. Our results demonstrate that the satellite‐derived local‐scale risk model satisfactorily captured the seasonal cholera pattern for the Matlab region, and a detailed high‐resolution picture of the spatial progression of at‐risk areas during outbreak months."

Here, the authors develop a biomimetic model of dividing cells to characterize the cytoskeleton’s mechanical power prior to division. 
 The spatial and temporal dynamics of forces in cells coordinate essential behaviors like division, polarization, and migration. While intracellular signaling initiates contractile ring assembly during cell division, how mechanical forces coordinate division and their energetic costs remain unclear. Here, we develop an in vitro model where myosin-induced stress drives division-like shape changes in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs, liposomes). Myosin activity is controlled by light patterns globally or locally at the equator. Global activation causes slow, shallow cleavage furrows due to a tug-of-war between the equatorial and polar forces. By contrast, local activation leads to faster, deeper, and symmetric division as equatorial forces dominate. Dissociating the actin cortex at the poles is crucial for inducing significant furrowing. During furrowing, actomyosin flows align actin filaments parallel to the division plane, forming a contractile ring-like structure. Mechanical power is not greatest during contraction, but is maximized just before furrowing. This study reveals the quantitative relationship between force patterning and mechanical energy during division-like shape changes, providing insights into cell division mechanics.

 Many plants associate with endophytic microbes that improve root phosphorus (P) uptake. Understanding the interactions between roots and endophytes can enable efforts to improve P utilization. Here, we characterize the interactions between lateral roots of endophytes in a core collection of 50 rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) genotypes with differing sensitivities to low P conditions. With the correlation analysis result between bacterial abundance and plant physiological indices of rapeseeds, and inoculation experiments on plates and soil, we identify one Flavobacterium strain (C2) that significantly alleviates the P deficiency phenotype of rapeseeds. The underlying mechanisms are explored by performing the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), and conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using Flavobacterium abundance as a quantitative trait. Under P-limited conditions, C2 regulates fatty acid and lipid metabolic pathways. For example, C2 improves metabolism of linoleic acid, which mediates root suberin biosynthesis, and enhances P uptake efficiency. In addition, C2 suppresses root jasmonic acid biosynthesis, which depends on α-linolenic acid metabolism, improving C2 colonization and activating P uptake. This study demonstrates that adjusting the endophyte composition can modulate P uptake in B. napus plants, providing a basis for developing agricultural microbial agents.

The tunneling current flowing through the tip-molecule-substrate junction generates a narrow-line emission of light corresponding to the fluorescence of the negatively charged molecule suspended at the apex of the tip, i.e., the emission of the excited molecular anion. The fluorescence of this molecular probe is recorded for tip-substrate nanocavities featuring different plasmonic resonances, for different tip-substrate distances and applied bias voltages, and on different substrates. We demonstrate that the width of the emission peak can be used as a probe of the exciton-plasmon coupling strength and that the energy of the emitted photons is governed by the molecule interactions with its environment. Additionally, we theoretically elucidate why the direct contact of the suspended molecule with the metallic tip does not totally quench the radiative emission of the molecule. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) gives access to the atomic-scale properties of matter. Here, the authors showcase the fluorescent functionalization of an STM tip using a single molecule in direct metal contact, permitting the local electrostatic and -dynamic environment to be probed."

Here the authors show in a non-human primate model that pre-existing dengue-2 or Zika virus immunity results in lower yellow fever viremia compared to naïve animals, limiting the transmission potential by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. 
 During the recent yellow fever (YF) epidemics in Brazil, human cases were attributed to spillover infections via sylvatic mosquito transmission. Despite YF virus (YFV) transmission in major urban centers with insufficient vaccination coverage and abundant populations of the domestic vector, Aedes aegypti, there was no evidence of human-amplified transmission. Furthermore, the historic absence of YF in Asia, despite abundant Ae. aegypti and an immunologically naive human population, is unexplained. We tested the hypothesis that pre-existing, heterologous flavivirus immunity, specifically from dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, limits YFV viremia and transmission by Ae. aegypti. We infected cynomolgus macaques with DENV or ZIKV, then challenged them 6–9 months later with YFV. We then measured viremia and disease and allowed Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to feed during peak macaque viremia. Although prior heterologous immunity had variable effects on disease, DENV and ZIKV immunity consistently suppressed YFV viremia. Despite no statistical difference due to a small sample size, the suppression in viremia led to a significant reduction in Ae. aegypti infection and a lack of transmission potential. These results support the hypothesis that, in DENV- and ZIKV-endemic regions such as South America and Asia, human flavivirus immunity suppresses YFV human amplification potential, reducing the risk of urban outbreaks. Epidemiology of yellow fever suggests that other flaviviruses may provide some level of cross-protection.

 Controlling light at subwavelength scales is crucial in nanophotonics. Hyperbolic polaritons, supporting arbitrarily large wavevectors, enable extreme light confinement beyond the diffraction limit. Traditional hyperbolic metamaterials suffer from high losses due to metallic components, while natural low-loss hyperbolic phonon polaritons are limited to the mid-infrared range. Some hyperbolic materials at visible frequencies have been studied, but they are either very lossy or only feature out-of-plane hyperbolicity. Here, we demonstrate the presence of low-loss, in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared in thin-films of MoOCl2, a natural van der Waals crystal. The polariton dispersion is predicted based on the framework of light propagation in biaxial media and experimentally confirmed by real space nano imaging on exfoliated flakes. MoOCl2 constitutes an ideal material platform for visible range applications leveraging the unboundedness of hyperbolic modes, such as hyperlensing, Purcell factor enhancement, and super-resolution imaging, without the drawbacks of metamaterials.

 Cloud distribution significantly impacts global climate change, ecosystem health, urban environments, and satellite remote sensing observations. However, past research has primarily focused on the meteorological characteristics of clouds with limitations in scale and resolution, leading to an insufficient understanding of large-scale cloud distribution and its relationship with land surface cover and urbanization. This study investigates the cloud distribution characteristics of typical urban agglomerations in different climatic regions of China using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and the Google Earth Engine platform. A cloud probability descriptor was constructed based on three years of high spatiotemporal resolution observations. The results revealed significant differences in cloud distribution among urban agglomerations, challenging the traditional understanding based on climate zoning. The Northeast urban agglomeration in the temperate zone exhibited high cloud coverage (37.54%), while the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration in the subtropical zone and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau urban agglomeration in the plateau climate zone had even higher average cloud probabilities (50.72% and 43.27%, respectively). The analysis suggests land surface cover, urbanization, and other surface factors may influence cloud distribution patterns. These findings emphasize the ubiquity of cloud cover and highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions among geographical factors when characterizing cloud cover diversity. This study contributes to providing new insights for enhancing meteorological models and remote sensing observation strategies in cloudy environments across different climate zones."

 Machine learning, especially deep learning, can outperform traditional atmospheric models in air quality assessment, offering enhanced efficiency and accuracy without relying on detailed emission inventories and atmospheric chemical mechanisms. Despite their predictive power, deep learning models often grapple with the perception of being “black boxes” due to their intricate architectures. Here, we develop an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN-attention) model that incorporates observational data, the parallelized large-eddy-simulation model (PALM), and urban morphology data for high-resolution spatial estimation of urban air quality. Our findings indicate that the CNN-attention model outperforms traditional CNN with higher accuracy and efficiency, achieving R2 = 0.987 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.15 mg/m3, while significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Compared to traditional machine learning models, the CNN exhibits higher R2 values and lower RMSE, showcasing its adeptness at capturing complex nonlinear patterns. The inclusion of attention layer further improves the model's performance by dynamically assigning attention scores to key features, enabling the model to focus on areas of critical emissions and distinctive urban features such as highways, arterial roads, intersections, and dense building clusters. This approach also reveals fluid dynamical principles, highlighting the significant disparities in pollutant concentration across roadways caused by atmospheric turbulence, and the distinct plume formations influenced by land use and topography. When applied to various urban settings, the CNN-attention model exhibits superior generalizability and transferability.

 In light of increasing climate hazards globally that pose risk to public health, the compounded effects of two major hazards, heatwaves and air pollution, have become a focal point for environmental and health research. This study explores the intricate relationship between extreme temperature events in North China (NC) and South China (SC) – two prominent areas of aerosol exposure in East Asia – and the associated changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) across the region. The heatwave events and regional AOD distribution revealed distinct patterns in their respective regions from June to September. Both NC and SC showed reduced AOD during heatwave events, while downstream regions experienced increased AOD levels. From the perspective of heatwaves in NC and SC, we present a more holistic picture of how large-scale modulators contribute to inducing air pollution hazards across East Asia. The analysis revealed a link between blocking high-pressure system and heatwave occurrences in NC, while a dominant Rossby wave train, influenced by the South China Sea, was identified as a major modulator in SC. Additionally, other large-scale circulatory systems, such as the Western Pacific Subtropical High, the East Asian jet stream, and the South Asian High, also play crucial roles in shaping these events. This suggests the potential for predicting downstream AOD events. The study underscores the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of meteorological and air quality phenomena to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts in East Asia."

 This study employs the ERA5 and JRA-55 monthly reanalysis datasets to examine the monthly impact of the Scandinavian (SCA) teleconnection pattern on the surface air temperature (SAT) over Asia in boreal winters from 1958 to 2021. We demonstrate that the monthly impacts of the SCA vary by month and region. Notably, the accumulated SAT anomalies over the region to the north of Tibetan Plateau (NP) due to the SCA tend to propagate southward to the eastern China (EC) during late winter, which is associated with the gradually intensifying westward gradient of the air temperature over the EC. Furthermore, both the November and January SCA patterns can significantly cause one-month-lagged SAT anomalies over the NP, albeit through different mechanisms. For the November SCA pattern, it induces significant snowfall anomalies over the NP and the associated snow cover anomalies can persist until December, facilitating the formation of local significant SAT anomalies via anomalous sensible heat flux. In contrast, from January to February, the background states for the air temperature in the lower troposphere and absolute vorticity in the upper troposphere change in such a way that creates a more favorable condition for the vertical coupling between the upper and lower circulation anomalies associated with the SCA pattern. Consequently, the SCA pattern tends to persist from January to February, leading to significant SAT anomalies over both the NP and EC in February."
