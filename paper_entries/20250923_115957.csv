10.5194/acp-25-10887-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了2022年Hunga火山爆发后，火山羽流对印度洋上空臭氧层的影响。通过使用红外大气探测干涉仪（IASI）、微波临边探测仪（MLS）和臭氧绘图与剖面套件临边剖面仪（OMPS-LP）等卫星数据以及地面观测数据，研究发现火山爆发导致了瞬时臭氧损耗事件，并且臭氧减少发生在两个不同的高度层，与水汽异常和硫酸盐气溶胶云有关。这表明该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是利用卫星观测进行大气成分分析和空气质量监测。,"['ozone depletion', 'satellite data', 'atmospheric composition', 'sulfur dioxide', 'water vapor', 'Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI)', 'Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)', 'Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP)', 'total column ozone', 'stratospheric column ozone', 'aerosol extinction', 'air quality monitoring']",Tristan Millet;Hassan Bencherif;Thierry Portafaix;Nelson Bègue;Alexandre Baron;Valentin Duflot;Cathy Clerbaux;Pierre-François Coheur;Andrea Pazmiño;Michaël Sicard;Anne Boynard;Jean-Marc Metzger;Guillaume Payen;Nicolas Marquestaut;Sophie Godin-Beekmann,Evidence of a transient ozone depletion event in the early Hunga plume above the Indian Ocean,"On 15 January 2022, the Hunga volcano erupted, releasing sulfur dioxide and water vapor into the stratosphere, impacting ozone levels over the Indian Ocean. Satellite data show the presence of a transient ozone depletion event related to the water vapor anomalies and sulfate aerosol clouds. Ozone reduction was confined to two distinct layers. On 21 January, the fifth percentile of total and stratospheric column ozone anomalies reached −18.6 and −14.5 DU, respectively. 
 On 15 January 2022, the Hunga volcano (20.5° S, 175.4° E) erupted, releasing significant amounts of water vapor (H2O) and a moderate quantity of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. The resulting volcanic plume traveled westward with the southern hemispheric stratospheric circulation, reaching the Indian Ocean and Réunion (21.1° S, 55.5° E) within days. This study presents the first analysis of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) ozone data to investigate the impact of the Hunga eruption, and also incorporates Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) data, as well as ground-based measurements from Réunion. IASI observations revealed a transient ozone depletion event in the first week following the eruption. OMPS-LP aerosol extinction profiles, sun-photometer measurements, and lidar observations characterized the plume's vertical and latitudinal extent, showing its presence over Réunion at altitudes ranging from 26.8 to 29.7 km and its spread across more than 30° longitude and 20° latitude by 21 January. IASI ozone spatial distributions showed marked decreases in total and stratospheric ozone on that date, with the fifth percentile of the anomaly reaching −18.6 DU for total column ozone and −14.5 DU for stratospheric column ozone. A key finding, as shown by MLS profiles, is that the ozone reduction was confined to two separate layers (-0.7±(1σ) 0.6 ppmv in the 14.68–12.12 hPa range, and -0.6±(1σ) 0.5 ppmv in the 31.62–21.54 hPa range), each associated with a distinct aerosol cloud with excess H2O. This layered structure of ozone loss offers new insight into the chemical and radiative effects of the Hunga plume on stratospheric ozone."

Without ARIs, added aerosols do not significantly affect precipitation due to cloud competition for moisture. ARIs can stabilize or enhance convection. High aerosol levels lead to a combined ARI and ACI effect that greatly reduces precipitation. 
 Atmospheric aerosols influence clouds and precipitation by aerosol–radiation interactions (ARIs) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs). In this study, the synergetic effect of ARIs and ACIs on the development and precipitation of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that occurred in the Guanzhong Basin (GZB) of central China have been examined using a cloud-resolving fully coupled weather research and forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem). The model reasonably reproduces the temporal variation and spatial distribution of air pollutants, the hourly rain rate, and daily precipitation distribution against observations in the GZB. Sensitivity simulations are conducted under different aerosol scenarios by adjusting the anthropogenic emissions. When the ARI effect is not considered, the daily precipitation does not show an increasing trend with increasing aerosols in the GZB. This primarily reflects the effects of ACIs due to competition among convective clouds to available water vapor in the development of the MCS. ARIs exert two opposite effects on convection: a stabilizing effect to suppress convection and a lifting effect to foster convection, which counteract each other. When the lifting effect outweighs stabilizing effect, the updraft is enhanced, which increases precipitation in the GZB. However, the synergetic effect of ARIs and ACIs significantly suppress precipitation when the particulate-matter (PM) pollution is severe. Note that the synergetic effect consistently decreases the precipitation in the whole domain with increasing aerosols, but ARIs play a more important role in the decreasing trend of the precipitation with deterioration of PM pollution."
10.5194/acp-25-10853-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了北非冬季陆地-海洋热力对比对春季跨大陆沙尘传输路径的影响，发现自20世纪90年代末以来，由于海陆热力驱动、北大西洋涛动和西风急流的相互作用，北非的春季沙尘更有可能向东传输，甚至到达北美。此前，向西传输的路径更为常见。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它研究的沙尘传输是一个重要的环境问题，与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关。沙尘暴的远程传输会影响下游地区的空气质量，因此，了解其传输路径和影响因素对于利用遥感数据进行空气质量预报和大气成分建模具有重要意义。所以可以认为该研究与大气环境遥感技术有较强的相关性。,"['dust transport', 'North Africa', 'land-sea thermal contrast', 'North Atlantic Oscillation', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'long-range transport']",Qi Wen;Yan Li;Mengying Du;Wenjun Song;Linbo Wei;Zhilan Wang;Xu Li,Interdecadal shift in the impact of winter land–sea thermal contrasts on following spring transcontinental dust transport pathways in North Africa,"We find that, through an interdecadal coupling of sea–land thermal forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the westerly jet, springtime dust from North Africa has been more likely to be transported eastward (extending into North America) since the late 1990s, whereas before that time, westward transport paths were more frequent.  Under the influence of thermal forcing, wind speed and drought contribute to dust emissions in the two periods, respectively. 
 North Africa, the largest and most active dust source region globally, plays a critical role in the Earth's environment by dispersing dust over remote areas, especially in terms of circum-global transport that has occurred many times since the start of the 21st century. As a key indicator of the thermodynamic structure and dynamical circulation of the troposphere, the land–sea thermal contrast (LSC) can influence the variability in dust and subsequent large-scale propagation, but the extent of such influence is still unknown. This study reveals that in around the late 1990s, the influence of pre-winter LSC on the spring dust transport pathway was reversed in North Africa, which is attributed to the bridging effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Before 2000, the warm land–cold ocean (+WLCO) pattern in pre-winter was typically associated with the NAO+ mode, and the anomalous northeasterly and zonal circulation in the following spring facilitated the westward transport of dust from the lower troposphere in western North Africa towards the Atlantic. Since 2000, the reversed zonal temperature pattern (−WLCO) has led to the NAO− mode and enhanced mid-latitude westerlies in winter, which has persisted into the next spring. Under conditions of unusually dry soil and strong dry convection, dust has been mixed into the middle to upper troposphere and subsequently transported eastward globally, affecting regions including West Asia, northern China, the Pacific, and southeastern North America after 2000. This study underscores the critical role of sea–land–atmosphere interaction in circum-global dust propagation and offers new perspectives for investigating dust change mechanisms in the context of climate change."
10.5194/acp-25-10907-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了环境条件和云过程如何影响砧状云的反照率和辐射效应，重点关注云微物理过程（如云滴数量和冰核粒子）对高云反照率的影响。通过观测数据和模型实验，论文提出了区分不同影响的“指纹”指标，并分析了相对湿度等环境因素与反照率之间的关系。虽然没有直接提及特定的卫星或传感器，但研究结果与卫星观测密切相关，因为卫星数据常用于研究云的性质和辐射效应，从而提高气候模型的预测精度。,"['anvil cloud albedo', 'cloud microphysics', 'radiative effect', 'ice water path', 'cloud droplet number', 'ice-nucleating particles', 'high cloud', 'satellite observations (implied)']",Declan L. Finney;Alan M. Blyth;Paul R. Field;Martin I. Daily;Benjamin J. Murray;Mengyu Sun;Paul J. Connolly;Zhiqiang Cui;Steven Böing,Microphysical fingerprints in anvil cloud albedo,"We present observation-informed modelling from the Deep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) to study how environmental conditions and cloud processes affect anvil cloud albedo and radiation. Aerosols influencing cloud droplets or influencing ice formation yield varying radiative effects. We introduce fingerprint metrics to discern these effects. Using detailed observations and modelling, we offer insights into high-cloud radiative effects and feedbacks. 
 Improved understanding of anvil cloud radiative effect (CRE) and feedback is critical for reducing uncertainty in climate projections, with recent research highlighting cloud microphysics and anvil albedo as requiring further investigation. In this study, we use nine observation-informed model experiments to simulate a 24 d period from the Deep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX), with our analysis quantifying the influence of cloud microphysics on high-cloud albedo. We find that increasing cloud droplet number (2×) or ice-nucleating particles (INPs) (∼10×), within the range of observed variability, significantly increased high-cloud albedo by 1 %–3 % (p value <0.05). To isolate the microphysical drivers of albedo changes, we introduce fingerprint metrics based on an ice water path (IWP) threshold, distinguishing between thick and thin high clouds. We find that increased droplet number enhances albedo in both thick and thin clouds, while higher INP concentrations primarily affect thick cloud albedo. These fingerprints offer a novel approach for elucidating causes of variability in high-cloud albedo in both models and observations. Future work should explore how the fingerprints translate across different high-cloud regimes and global climate context. Beyond direct microphysical influences, we also identify strong correlations between albedo and large-scale environmental factors such as relative humidity, thereby motivating future investigation of anvil albedo feedback using cloud controlling factor analysis. Our study highlights both the large-scale environment and microphysical processes as important for accurate prediction of CREs and feedbacks in climate models."
10.5194/acp-25-10869-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文探讨了如何利用大气数据的快照来理解随时间演变的大气过程，重点关注云和大气物理。它讨论了飞机测量和卫星遥感等技术如何提供云和气溶胶的属性信息，并分析了从这些快照中获取过程层面理解的程度。论文提到了空间-时间交换、遍历性以及过程与观测时间尺度等概念，旨在鼓励大气科学界更深入地探索这些概念的价值。虽然没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但卫星观测和气溶胶属性检索与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['cloud physics', 'atmospheric physics', 'satellite-based remote sensing', 'cloud properties retrieval', 'aerosol properties retrieval', 'atmospheric boundary layer']",Graham Feingold;Franziska Glassmeier;Jianhao Zhang;Fabian Hoffmann,Opinion: Inferring process from snapshots of cloud systems,"Scientists usually use snapshots of atmospheric data to glean understanding of time-evolving atmospheric processes. We examine how much can be learned about processes from snapshots using examples from cloud and atmospheric physics. We couch the analysis in terms of the theory of ergodic systems, space-time-exchange, and the Deborah number – concepts that are commonly applied in other branches of physics. We discuss the reasons for the varying degrees of success. 
 The cloudy atmospheric boundary layer is a complex, open, dynamical system that is difficult to fully characterize through observations. Aircraft measurements provide cloud dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical properties along a flightpath, at high spatial/temporal resolution (order 10 m/0.1 s). These data are essentially contiguous “snapshots” in time of the state of the cloud and its environment. Polar-orbiting satellite-based remote sensing yields snapshots of retrieved cloud and aerosol properties once or twice a day at spatial scales on the order of 250 m, but these are usually averaged to scales of ≈20–100 km to reduce data variability. Neither approach tracks a parcel of air in time, a view that would yield more direct insights into the evolving system.  Nevertheless, our long experience with aircraft and satellite-based remote sensing has taught us much about atmospheric processes, suggesting that one can gain insights into processes from these snapshots. Using mostly previously published work we present examples of collections of observation snapshots that reveal various degrees of process-level understanding. We couch the discussion in terms of the concepts of space-time exchange, ergodicity, and process vs. observation timescales. It is our hope that this paper will encourage the atmospheric sciences community to explore the value of these concepts more deeply."

In this paper, we introduce MetFluxNet, a deep learning model for methane plume source rate estimation. This model is trained on a new synthetic dataset designed to avoid network overfit. MetFluxNet can accurately estimate low source rates even in the case of heterogeneous backgrounds. To demonstrate its reliability for real-world plume estimation, we validated its predictions on real plumes with known source rates. 
 Reducing methane emissions from human activities is essential to tackle climate change. To monitor these emissions, we rely on satellite observations, which enable regular, global-scale tracking. Methane emissions are typically quantified by their source rate – the mass of gas emitted per unit of time. Our goal here is to estimate the emission source rate of methane plumes detected by hyperspectral imagers such as PRISMA or EnMAP. For this task, we generated a large synthetic dataset using large eddy simulation (LES) to train a deep learning model. This dataset was specifically designed to avoid network overfitting with careful plume temporal sampling and plume scaling. Our deep learning network, MetFluxNet, does not require any wind information or a plume mask. Moreover, it accurately predicts the source rate even in the presence of false positives. MetFluxNet performs well on our dataset with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.3 % over a wide range of source rates from 500 to 25 000 kg h−1. Notably, it remains effective at lower source rates, where background noise is typically high. To validate its real-world applicability, we tested MetFluxNet on real plumes with known ground-truth fluxes. The predicted source rates fell systematically within the 95 % confidence intervals, demonstrating its reliability for real-world plume estimation. Finally, in a comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, MetFluxNet outperformed the deep learning-based S2MetNet and the physics-based integrated mass enhancement (IME) method."
10.5194/essd-17-4627-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,该研究论文开发了一个新的全球氮氧化物（NO2）数据集，利用TROPOMI卫星在2018年至2021年间的数据。该数据集通过改进误差计算和时空缩减方法，提高了精度和细节，符合国际气候数据标准。研究重点在于对流层NO2柱浓度，并进行了详细的不确定性分析，以提高数据质量。该研究对空气质量监测和全球污染治理具有重要意义，通过卫星观测和大气成分分析，为更准确地了解和解决空气污染问题提供了支持。,"['tropospheric nitrogen dioxide', 'TROPOMI', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'uncertainty analysis', 'error correlation']",Isolde Glissenaar;Klaas Folkert Boersma;Isidora Anglou;Pieter Rijsdijk;Tijl Verhoelst;Steven Compernolle;Gaia Pinardi;Jean-Christopher Lambert;Michel Van Roozendael;Henk Eskes,TROPOMI Level 3 tropospheric NO2 dataset with advanced uncertainty analysis from the ESA CCI+ ECV precursor project,"We developed a new global dataset of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the lower atmosphere, using data from TROPOMI for 2018–2021. This dataset offers improved accuracy and detail compared to earlier versions, meeting high international standards for climate data. By refining how measurement errors are calculated and reduced over time and space, we provide clearer insights into pollution patterns. This work supports better air quality monitoring and informs actions to address pollution globally. 
 We introduce the new ESA Climate Change Initiative TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) global monthly clear-sky Level 3 (L3) dataset of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for May 2018 to December 2021. The dataset provides spatiotemporally averaged tropospheric NO2 columns, associated averaging kernels, and L3 uncertainties at spatial resolutions of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0° on a monthly timescale (https://doi.org/10.21944/CCI-NO2-TROPOMI-L3, KNMI, 2025). To improve our understanding of what fraction of the Level 2 (L2) uncertainty cancels when averaging over space or time (i.e. the random component of the L2 uncertainty) and what fraction persists despite the averaging (systematic component), we first determine spatial and temporal error correlations for all sources of uncertainty in the L2 retrieval. Spatial error correlations arise mainly from the stratosphere–troposphere correction and from coarse-gridded albedo climatologies used in the L2 air mass factor calculation and have been quantified in previous studies. We find the temporal error correlation in both the stratospheric uncertainty and the air mass factor uncertainty to be 30 %. Using these estimates, the L3 uncertainty budget has been established for every grid cell based on input L2 uncertainties and new methods to estimate spatial and temporal representativeness uncertainties and to propagate measurement uncertainties through space and time. The total relative uncertainty in the resulting L3 dataset is in the range of 15 %–20 % in polluted areas, which is significantly lower than in individual L2 orbit retrievals, and brings the tropospheric NO2 data to within the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) “goal” and “breakthrough” requirements. Validation of the tropospheric, stratospheric, and total columns confirms better correlation and reduced dispersion in the differences between satellite and ground-based reference data for the L3 data with respect to the underlying L2, albeit with a more pronounced negative bias in the tropospheric columns at pollution hot spots, most probably related to stronger spatial smearing."

Oswald,The Potsdam Soil Moisture Observatory: High-coverage reference observations at kilometer scale,"This data paper describes a comprehensive collection of soil moisture and related data from an extensive cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) network at an agricultural research site in north-east Germany. The data set comprises not only soil moisture observations at different spatio-temporal scales, but also a wealth of accompanying data that provide the context to interpret soil moisture dynamics within a broader hydrological and environmental framework. 
 Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has gained popularity for estimating soil water content (SWC) due to its innovative capability to measure at an intermediate scale – a notable advantage over point-scale sensors, which are often sparsely installed and due to small-scale heterogeneity result in uncertain absolute values. CRNS serves as a crucial link between small and large scales and has been emerging as a reference measurement for remote sensing algorithm validation for its ability to link the small and large scales. Yet, the sparse availability of long-term datasets limits use of this possibility. Within the framework of project SoMMet (21GRD08), multi-scale soil moisture monitoring was implemented to integrate CRNS with complementary in-situ observations. In this paper, we present harmonized soil moisture data from different sensor types including a CRNS cluster, shallow soil moisture measurements and soil moisture profile data, creating a ready-to-use dataset as reference observation for remote sensing products, covering a highly-instrumented agricultural site in the northeast of Germany. The data include 16 stationary CRNS sensors, with co-located point-scale SWC sensors (mostly permanent), two groundwater observation wells, meteorological records, and data from intensive manual sampling campaigns (covering SWC, bulk density, organic matter, etc.). This dataset distinguishes itself from prior studies by the increased area of approx. 1 km² while still having a high sensor density and overlapping footprints of CRNS. This allows a reasonable degree of geostatistical interpolation to obtain complete coverage. The data are available under the (https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.db88e149f7924919be376909856739f1) (Grosse et al., 2025), providing a new reference data set for remote sensing products, hydrological or land-surface models and for other products linked to soil water balance."

Instead of manually adjusting many parameters, the method uses a mathematical tool to find the most appropriate settings for the model. It can be especially helpful for researchers who introduce new physical parameters into climate models to assess their impact on model results and optimize them along with the old ones. 
 A new tool for objective parameter tuning of regional climate models is presented. The climate model output was emulated using a linear regression approach for each grid point on a monthly mean basis. This linear approximation showed decent accuracy over a 6-year period. The root-mean-square error norm between the Meta-Model and the observational data sets was minimized using the gradient-based, limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno method with box constraints. We refer to this framework as LiMMo (Linear Meta-Model optimization). The LiMMo framework was applied to the state-of-the-art regional climate model ICON-CLM, tuned to the E-OBS and HOAPS observational data sets. Different optimization objectives were explored by assigning varying weights to model variables in the error norm definition. The combination of a linear emulator with fast gradient-based optimization allows the proposed method to scale linearly with the number of model variables and parameters, facilitating the tuning of dozens of parameters simultaneously."

Silber,Survey and Modeling of Windblown Ejecta Deposits on Venus,"Venus' thick atmosphere rotates in the same direction as the solid body, but ∼60 times faster. This atmospheric superrotation has produced dozens of windblown ejecta deposits (“parabolas”) on the surface of Venus. The formation and modification of parabolas is an interplay between impacts, aeolian modification, and atmospheric dynamics. We conducted a survey to explore the nature of these sedimentary surface features. First, we observe trends in parabolas' morphology that shed light on how they are deposited and gradated. Changes in the size and radar albedo of parabolas are likely linked to the height and density (respectively) of ejecta plumes at time of formation. Next, we discovered that parabolas show orientations inconsistent with present atmospheric dynamics. This discrepancy may record a change in these dynamics or geologically recent true polar wander at a rate of ∼1° Myr−1, which is similar to that observed on Earth over the past century.

Selvadurai;Xiangyuan Peng;Shuangyong Dong;Ying Li,Interplay of Loading and Adsorption Controls Elastic Deformation of Clastic and Crystalline Rocks,"Rock elasticity varies with both mechanical loading and moisture content. Studies to date have only examined each effect independently, although moisture interactions with pore walls are likely coupled to mechanical stress. Here, we present experimental data specifically collected in sandstone and granite under simultaneous control of cyclic loading alongside ambient humidity approaching saturated vapor. Adsorption can account for 40% reduction in Young's modulus, which reduces to < ${< } $10% as uniaxial stress increases from below 1 MPa to below the elastic limit. The observation is explained by a micromechanical model linking grain‐scale contact stiffness to pore‐scale vapor adsorption, quantitatively capturing coupled stress‐induced stiffening and adsorption‐induced softening. The coupled behavior is interpreted as adsorption‐induced softening becoming inhibited under greater mechanical loads. Our results suggest the coupled effects are strongest at overburden stresses between 3.3 and 10.6 MPa (140–450 m) in sandstone and 6–30.3 MPa (235–1,200 m) in granite."

Here, we offer a novel perspective on rupture termination by examining the arrest of the 1906 M 8.0 Manas earthquake in northwestern China. Integrated field surveys, seismic profiles, and microseismicity data reveal that rupture terminated at the actively growing Xiaodushan anticline. This anticline lies parallel to and in the hanging wall of the seismogenic fault. We propose active folding acts as an efficient rupture‐arrest barrier, partitioning seismic energy into strata uplift and microseismicity. Furthermore, comparative analysis of global thrust earthquakes identifies two termination mechanisms: fault geometric complexities and external structural barriers. These findings contribute to deeper understanding of rupture lengths and earthquake magnitudes for seismic hazard assessment in convergent margins globally."

Using data from six GCMs, this signal was computed using differences between data averaged over current‐day and pre‐industrial time intervals. Relative to counter‐factual simulations, factual simulations exhibited overall more hail, particularly for diameters ≥3 cm. This is consistent with increased CAPE but minimal changes in melting depth over this region in the current day.

To investigate the effect of heating rate on stability of thermally induced fault slip, we conducted three experiments of thermally induced fault reactivation on a granite sample containing an inclined sawcut fracture under conditions of varying heating rates spanning two orders of magnitude. We find that the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature and the resultant thermal stress control the timing and size of induced stick‐slip events. A fast heating rate induces earlier but smaller stick‐slip events. In contrast, a slow heating rate promotes a uniform distribution of temperature and thermal stress, facilitating larger stick‐slip events that occur later and exhibit higher apparent frictional strength.

Throughout ensemble members, there are coherent multi‐centennial shifts in landfalls with persistent intervals of increased (decreased) occurrence along the eastern US concurrent with inverse activity in the southwest Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, associated with basin‐scale redistributions of storm tracks. The emergent TC‐dipole from modeled climate provides context and support for its presence within proxy‐reconstructions.

The lag times are an order of magnitude greater than those associated with the S phases of crustal earthquakes.

In simplified models, nonlinear phase trapping by high‐amplitude waves can increase electron energy by several MeV within seconds. However, the acceleration rate in realistic wave packets is slower due to small‐scale wave field structures reducing trapping efficiency. While previous studies focused on short field‐aligned amplitude modulations and phase jumps, we examine the effects of transverse modulations, which have been observed to reach scales comparable to ultrarelativistic electron gyroradii. Using test‐particle simulations, we demonstrate that these modulations disrupt the acceleration process. Our numerical results suggest that nonlinear trapping plays a negligible role in accelerating electrons above a certain energy limit, reinforcing the diffusive nature of wave‐driven electron transport at multi‐MeV energies. Unlike field‐aligned structures, transverse phase incoherence modifies the effective wave spectrum and allows for resonance, making amplitude modulations a necessary component for suppression of acceleration."

 The redox state of Earth’s mantle is governed by the oxidation state of iron and carbon and influences key physical and chemical mantle parameters. Mantle xenoliths, and experimental and thermodynamic studies reveal a decrease in oxygen fugacity with depth, down to ~250 km. A further more modest drop is linked to the predicted stabilization of nickel-rich metallic alloy at 250–300 km. However, garnets from 250–500 km record more oxidized conditions, and no nickel-rich alloy has been reported from these depths to account as natural evidence for the predictions. Here we report nickel–iron metallic nanoinclusions and Ni-rich carbonate microinclusions in two diamonds from the Voorspoed mine, South Africa. Various pressure indicators confirm their origin in the deep upper mantle or the shallow transition zone (280–470 km). The coexistence of nickel-rich metal and carbonate indicates a reaction between oxidized carbonatitic melt and reduced metal-bearing peridotite that led to nickel enrichment and diamond growth. This reaction captures a snapshot of the dynamics of metasomatism, including the formation of intermediate products that may later react. The diamonds provide direct evidence for nickel-rich alloy at its predicted depth within the mantle. They also indicate the presence of deep carbonatitic–silicic melts, which episodically oxidize small volumes of the mantle and play a role in the formation of kimberlites and alkali basalts. Reduced nickel-rich metal and oxidized nickel carbonate inclusions within diamonds provide evidence of metasomatic redox reactions and support the role of carbonatitic melts in oxidizing small volumes of the deep upper mantle and transition zone."

Here, we demonstrate that NR3C1 acts as a key regulator of early postnatal astrocyte development, shaping long-term immune responses in mice. Through integrative analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and long-range chromatin interactions, we identify 55 stage-specific TFs, with NR3C1 uniquely associated with early postnatal maturation. Although mice lacking astrocytic NR3C1 exhibit no detectable developmental abnormalities, these mice display heightened susceptibility to exacerbated immune responses following adult-onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Many of the dysregulated EAE response genes are linked to candidate cis-regulatory elements altered by early NR3C1 loss, driving exacerbated inflammatory responses. Notably, only NR3C1 depletion during early, but not late, astrocyte development induces long-lasting epigenetic reprogramming that primes astrocytic immune responses. How genetic predisposition drives late-onset disease risk remains unclear. Here, the authors show that epigenetic predisposition via NR3C1-dependent early postnatal 3D gene regulation primes astrocytes for lifelong immune vulnerability."

This study shows multiple independent transfers of a key gene for metal ion transport (NAS) to various plant lineages, highlighting a complex and dynamic history of gene exchange. 
 The evolution of land plants is marked by major innovations enhancing their vegetative and reproductive fitness. Despite their extensive adaptations to terrestrial habitats, plants rely on ecological interactions with microbes for various physiological processes. Beyond their role as critical partners in the conquest of, and diversification on land, fungi and bacteria also serve as sources of genetic tools. Analyses of the gene space of land plant model organisms suggest that such transfers are unique and ancient. However here, using genomic data spanning the diversity of mosses, we demonstrate that a metallophore-synthesis gene was acquired independently from distinct microbial donors by at least five plant lineages. Furthermore we find that the first NAS gene acquired by mosses was later replaced by another fungal copy, transferred to another major moss lineage. Such a complex history of acquisition of a gene may reflect a more general pattern of highly dynamic gene exchange across the tree of life.

 Sjögren’s disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease that causes salivary gland dysfunction due to immune-mediated destruction. While autoantibodies such as anti-SSA and anti-centromere (CENT) are associated with distinct clinical manifestations, the molecular features remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply multi-modal single-cell technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell and B cell receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to salivary gland lesions, aiming to elucidate common and unique cellular and transcriptional signatures linked to different autoantibody profiles. Our analysis demonstrates that GZMB+GNLY+ CD8+ T cells are the main expanded subset across different autoantibody statuses, highlighting their central role in SjD pathogenesis, while the enrichment of memory B cells is more prominent in anti-CENT-positive patients. Cytokine signaling also differs by autoantibody profile, with an activated interferon signature in anti-SSA-positive patients, whereas TGFβ signaling is enhanced in anti-CENT-positive patients. Furthermore, spatial profiling reveals THY1+ fibroblasts, expressing complement genes and chemokines, as key hubs orchestrating inflammation within the salivary glands.

 Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a fatal disease characterized by the remodelling of pulmonary veins and haemosiderin accumulation in macrophages. Although (General Control Nonderepressible 2) GCN2 deficiency has been reported in PVOD patients, the underlying mechanism by which GCN2 deficiency affects the pulmonary venous cells and the surrounding cells, remains unclear. Here, we perform immunohistochemistry and scRNA-sequencing analyses to show that macrophages are the major population affected by GCN2 deficiency and ferroptosis pathway-related genes are upregulated in lung macrophages of PVOD patients. Treatment with the specific ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) reverses the changes in haemodynamic indices observed in Eif2ak4K1488X/K1488X hypoxia mice and PVOD model rats. Furthermore, GCN2 deficiency increases HMOX1 and iron levels to facilitate ferroptosis in macrophages, and enhances arterial marker expression in venous endothelial cells (VECs). Specifically, spatial transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of NRP1, KDR and EFNB2 through ETS1 in VECs from PVOD patients.

 Convergent evolution of proteins provides insights into repeatability of genetic adaptation. While local convergence of proteins at residue or domain level has been characterized, global structural convergence by inter-domain/molecular interactions remains largely unknown. Here we present structural convergent evolution on fusion enzymes of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). We discover BdhE (bifunctional dehydrogenase E), an enzyme clade that emerged independently from the previously known AdhE family through distinct gene fusion events. AdhE and BdhE show shared enzymatic activities and non-overlapping phylogenetic distribution, suggesting common functions in different species. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals BdhEs form donut-like homotetramers, contrasting AdhE’s helical homopolymers. Intriguingly, despite distinct quaternary structures and < 30% amino acid sequence identity, both enzymes forms resemble dimeric structure units by ALDH-ADH interactions via convergently elongated loop structures. These findings suggest convergent gene fusions recurrently led to substrate channeling evolution to enhance two-step reaction efficiency.

 Amid escalating climate impacts, understanding private sector adaptation is critical.

The agriculture sector leads in adaptation efforts, while transport, construction and utilities—that is potential sources of system-wide cascading effects—lag. Small, medium and large businesses prioritize hard and soft measures, barely investing in ecosystem-based adaptations. Adding to the multifaceted discourse on adaptation effectiveness, our panel data reveal positive, although inelastic in the short run, relationships between private sector adaptations and aggregate regional economic performance. Business adaptations in the construction, transport and health sectors associate positively with regional economic performance, with the accommodation and food services sector yielding the highest return per euro invested in adaptation.

Retreat was weakly associated with historical experiences of coastal climate hazards but accelerated in regions with greater vulnerability to coastal climate hazards—indicated by lower infrastructure protection and less adaptive capacity.

 The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value-added chemicals and fuels with reduced greenhouse gas emissions by leveraging renewable electricity. However, the economic viability of this technology is limited by high full-cell voltages due to the combination of various materials and processes between the anode and the cathode. Here we analyse voltage distributions within systems that are candidates for achieving energy-efficient CO2 electroreduction: CO2 reduction (CO2R) in acidic media, cascade CO2R-CO electroreduction and CO2 reactive capture. By measuring and resolving the individual contributions to the overall cell voltage, we show that the cascade approach is, at present, the most energy-efficient candidate for achieving economic and scalable CO2R. The membrane and cathode overpotentials dominate in direct CO2R approaches (acidic CO2R and CO2R with forward-biased bipolar membranes). By contrast, the reactive capture approach benefits from a low membrane overpotential (<0.2 V) as a result of the high proton conductivity of the cation exchange membrane, with remaining overpotentials at the cathode, anode and intrinsic Nernstian pH gradient. Applying these insights, we optimize the CO electroreduction system to reach a full-cell voltage of 1.95 V at 200 mA cm−2.

 Soil phosphorus (P) cycling microorganisms (PCMs) facilitate organic P mineralization (represented by the phoD gene) and inorganic P dissolution (pqqC), driving terrestrial P cycling and enhancing P availability to plants. However, the interactive effects (i.e., additive, synergistic, and antagonistic interactions) of multiple environmental stressors (i.e., acidification, salinization, drought, metal pollution and human disturbance) on PCMs remain unclear. Combining a large-scale survey and controlled experiments, we found that the interactive effects of stressors with significance on PCM abundance and diversity were more ubiquitous than the effects of individual stressors. Specifically, acidification and drought had antagonistic and synergistic effects on the abundances of organic P mineralization microorganisms and inorganic P dissolution microorganisms, respectively, while antagonistic effects between drought and metal pollution were observed on the diversity of these microorganisms. The PCM changes were associated with soil P-related stoichiometric parameters under interactive effects, indicating that interactive stressors strongly influenced microbial-regulated P cycling and P availability in soil.

Results demonstrate strong agreement between satellite-derived NCP and in situ measurements (RMSD = 9.52 mmol C m−2 d−1), underscoring the utility of NSAM for quantifying the Arctic BCP.

 Recent advancements in hyperspectral satellite technology, including sensors like EnMAP, are promising for monitoring grassland ecosystems at the landscape scale. These developments include detailed vegetation analysis capabilities, crucial for understanding plant traits and species composition. However, technical restrictions of recent hyperspectral satellite missions can hinder comprehensive coverage of research areas resulting in a temporal mismatch of field measurements and satellite data.Here we utilize hyperspectral data from the DESIS, PRISMA, and EnMAP mission, along with field measurements from 74 grassland plots of the German Biodiversity Exploratories in Schorfheide-Chorin and Hainich, collected in May 2020 and 2023. We focus on the impact of different satellite sensors and their acquisition timing grouped within five phenological seasons (early April to August) on the accuracy of biomass and species composition models using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Procrustes randomization tests. Additionally, we are evaluating the effectiveness of two spectral transformations in improving model accuracy and reliability.Our findings reveal significant differences in the relationship of hyperspectral satellite data with grassland biomass and species composition. Even though comparison of DESIS biomass models indicated that sensor data from the beginning of April achieved best results for biomass (R2 = 0.48), sensor data covering the SWIR from late April and June showed slightly better modeling results (EnMAP: R2 = 0.51, PRISMA: R2 = 0.53). Species composition was significantly related to spectral composition, with sensor data from late April showing the strongest relationships. The performance of sensors, including VNIR and VNIR-SWIR, was almost equal (e.g., DESIS: R2 = 0.54, PRISMA: R2 = 0.59). Overall, the results highlight the benefit of SWIR bands for biomass modeling, while their importance was minor in relation to species composition. A trend of improved model performance was observed with mean normalization for EnMAP and PRISMA data, while continuum removal led to a decrease in performance. Our study underscores the critical role of temporal and spectral data selection in improving grassland models, suggesting potential pathways for refining remote sensing approaches in ecological monitoring and management."

 Digital twin systems for transportation are widely regarded as a core technology for enabling full life-cycle management of traffic information and providing intelligent decision support, with the goals of improving traffic efficiency and reducing accident risks. However, existing research primarily focuses on simulation and prediction of traffic flow, lacking a unified framework that integrates static infrastructure, dynamic states, and microscopic behaviors. To address this gap, this paper proposes a lightweight behavior-cognitive architecture for high-definition (HD) maps to support multiscale information representation in transportation digital twin. It consists of three layers: (1) a global road network layer that models transportation infrastructure and static geographic features; (2) a dynamic target layer organizing the real time status and trajectory of traffic participants; (3) a behavioral cognition layer for behavior interpretation and understanding. Based on this architecture, a construction method for transportation digital twin systems is developed and validated through experiments conducted in real-world traffic scenarios and simulation environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high adaptability and accuracy, offering effective support for building digital twin systems in complex traffic environments."

To this end, we thoroughly investigate the difficulties of Mamba in large-scale LiDAR point cloud learning and resolve this bottleneck by combining Mamba with convolution. Specifically, we introduce convolution as an information propagator to address the long-range collapse issue, which effectively enhances the global modeling ability of Mamba and enables it to handle the large-scale point clouds without patches. Besides, we redesign the bidirectional Mamba and serialization strategy to expand the receptive field of Mamba for point cloud semantic segmentation task. Furthermore, we further investigate the selectivity of Mamba, and exploit Mamba in the down-sampling stage for feature aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on two indoor and two outdoor public point cloud datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art networks."

 Mapping standing dead trees is critical for assessing forest health, monitoring biodiversity, and mitigating wildfire risks, for which aerial imagery has proven useful. However, dense canopy structures, spectral overlaps between living and dead vegetation, and over-segmentation errors limit the reliability of existing methods. This study introduces a hybrid post-processing framework that refines deep learning-based tree segmentation by integrating watershed algorithms with adaptive filtering to enhance instance separation and boundary precision. Leveraging a dual-task learning architecture with a Self-Attention U-Net, the framework simultaneously predicts segmentation masks, centroid heatmaps, and hybrid boundary maps, optimizing for both pixel-level accuracy and instance-level detection. Tested on high-resolution aerial imagery from boreal forests, the framework, compared to the U-Net baseline, improved instance-level segmentation accuracy by 41.5% (Tree IoU of 0.3810 vs. 0.2694) and reduced positional errors by 57% (centroid error of 3.70 pixels vs. 5.10 pixels), demonstrating robust performance in the densely vegetated boreal forest regions tested. By balancing detection accuracy (F1-score of 0.5895) and over-segmentation artifacts, the method enabled the accurate identification of individual dead trees, which is critical for ecological monitoring. The framework’s computational efficiency supports scalable applications, such as wall-to-wall tree mortality mapping over large geographic regions using aerial or satellite imagery. These capabilities directly benefit wildfire risk assessment, carbon stock estimation, and precision forestry. This work advances tools for large-scale ecological conservation and climate resilience planning."

Boden,"Examining the association between air pollution exposure (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) across the lifecourse on behavioural and mental health outcomes in adulthood in the Christchurch Health and Development study: a prospective birth cohort study","•Employed a spatial lifecourse epidemiological framework. •Historical and contemporary air pollution were estimated for a large prospective birth cohort study. •While air pollution exposure was related to some outcomes, any effects were often small. •Associations were largely attenuated in fully adjusted models. •More robust data are needed to confirm our findings. 
 The adverse effects of air pollution on human physical health are well established, but potential links with behavioural and mental health problems are also suggested. However, evidence is limited, with few studies employing spatial life course methods or considering the effects of unmeasured and residual confounding factors. This study addresses the identified gap by using prospective longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study to examine associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and subsequent behaviour and mental health outcomes in adulthood. The study sample consists of a birth cohort of 1265 individuals born during 1977 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Individual-level residential address data were linked to air pollution estimates, including annual black smoke levels (micrograms per cubic meter of air or μg/m3) from during pregnancy to age 10 years (1976–1987), and PM10 (21–40 years), PM2.5 (30–40 years), and NO2 (40 years) in adulthood. Behavioural (i.e. nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit substance use disorders) and mental health outcomes (i.e. depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation) were prospectively assessed from age 21–40 years. Findings from unadjusted population-averaged GEE logistic regression models indicated only weak associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and some behavioural and mental health outcomes. In fully adjusted models, associations were fully attenuated, other than PM2.5 exposure and nicotine abuse/dependence (OR = 1.074 [1.0156, 1.136]). While further research is needed to confirm our findings, air pollution exposure may be less important than more proximal factors for behaviour and mental health outcomes in adulthood."

 Despite being a leading cause of health issues, air pollution in smaller cities is often overlooked. To address this gap, annual monitoring of Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Black Carbon (BC), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) was conducted at a residential site in a semi-urban area and, for comparison, in an urban area. The sampling site was affected by multiple, co-located sources, including the National Highway (NH-19), traffic intersections, street vendor stalls, and other commercial areas, resulting in high exposure levels. The collected data were analyzed to understand the dynamics, variations, morphology, and chemical composition of particles; these levels were then assessed concerning passive cigarette smoke (PSC) exposure, evaluating potential health impacts. Four health outcomes—cardiovascular mortality (CM), lung cancer (LC), low birth weight (LBW), and decreased lung function (DLF) in school-aged children—were assessed to quantify the burden. The results indicate that even minimal concentrations can significantly affect human health, as a rise of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2, along with 1 μg/m3 in BC, is associated with mean increases and standard errors of 8.1 (3.98), 8.5 (4.48), and 3.03 (1.22) PSC per day across the four health outcomes, respectively. Seasonally, the post-monsoon period showed predominance due to extensive use of biomass and fossil fuels for heating and cooking in semi-urban regions, leading to an elevated prevalence of decreased lung function (DLF), with 18 passive cigarettes identified as the most significant risk factor among the various outcomes. This study emphasizes the need for population-based monitoring to issue public health advisories that protect vulnerable groups, especially in smaller cities such as Tundla, located in Northern India."
