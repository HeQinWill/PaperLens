10.1088/1748-9326/ad616c,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是 REDD+ 项目中森林损失基线的评估方法。REDD+ 项目旨在通过减少森林砍伐和森林退化来减少碳排放，而基线的设定对于评估项目的有效性至关重要。该研究提出了一种新的方法，通过整合来自多个对照区域的实际森林损失率来建立一个“合理精度区域”，从而更客观地评估 REDD+ 项目的基线。文中使用了来自全球和当地校准的两个地理空间数据集，并将该方法应用于柬埔寨的案例研究。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它利用了卫星遥感数据来监测森林损失，并通过对森林损失的量化评估来间接推断碳排放量的变化。虽然它没有直接测量大气成分，但它为评估基于自然的解决方案（如 REDD+ 项目）对碳减排的有效性提供了一种更可靠的方法，这对于利用遥感技术监测气候变化和环境保护至关重要。,"['Forest loss', 'Deforestation', 'Satellite imagery', 'Remote sensing', 'Carbon emissions', 'Geospatial data', 'Baseline assessment', 'REDD+']",Maren Pauly;William Crosse;Colin Moore;Kevin Brown;Oliver Griffin;Edward T A Mitchard;Jeremy Freund;Joshua Tosteson,A holistic approach to assessing REDD+ forest loss baselines through ex post analysis,"The implementation of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) projects has become a key Nature Based Solutions strategy to protect at-risk forests using the sale of verified emission reductions (carbon credits) as financing, generated by reducing forest loss against counterfactual baseline scenarios. Controversy over the reasonableness of such baseline scenarios has thrown this nascent market mechanism into disarray. While new technical approaches to baseline-setting that promise wider market acceptance are set to roll out in the coming years, existing projects are becoming unviable, as carbon credit buyers reduce investment due to lost confidence in the integrity of emissions reduction claims. Transparent, reproducible methods to assess existing REDD+ project baselines are needed in order to provide a clearer picture of the real impact of projects, and provide an objective basis on which investment decisions can be made today. Here we introduce such a method. In contrast to existing studies which utilize only one method to create a single ‘control,’ we integrate actual forest loss rates from a variety of control sites to establish a ‘zone of reasonable accuracy (or ZORA)’. Application of our method in Cambodia, using two geospatial datasets (one global and one locally calibrated), shows that all three project baselines fall within or below ZORA. This approach is fully reproducible, and provides a transparent way for analysts to assess REDD+ baselines during this critical time when investment in forest protection must increase dramatically and without delay."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9036,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注的是早期生活饮用水和卫生条件对青少年认知能力的影响。研究使用了来自埃塞俄比亚、印度、秘鲁和越南的8000多名儿童的匹配样本，考察了改善饮用水和卫生设施的早期生活接触与15岁时认知能力之间的关系。结果发现，在改善饮用水条件下长大的儿童在数学、阅读和词汇测试中的得分高出1.6-2.8个百分点。改善卫生设施的早期生活接触也显示出类似的模式，尽管测量精度较低。研究还按性别进行了分析，发现改善饮用水获取对女孩的影响更大、更显著。进一步研究了这些关系背后的潜在机制，初步证据表明，终身学习是一个主要的机制。总的来说，这项研究定量分析了改善饮用水和卫生设施对认知能力的长期益处，为了解如何更好地配置资源以促进全球公平获取改善的饮用水和卫生设施提供了见解。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关系。,[],Emily L Pakhtigian,Improved water and sanitation in early life and cognition in adolescence: evidence from four countries *,"Early life environmental exposures, such as drinking water quality and sanitation, can have long lasting effects on human capital accumulation. Using matched samples of over 8000 children across Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam, this paper examines the relationship between early life access to improved drinking water and improved sanitation and cognition at the age of fifteen. It finds that children with early life access to improved drinking water score 1.6–2.8 percentage points higher on math, reading, and vocabulary tests. A similar, yet less precisely measured, pattern emerges for early life access to improved sanitation. Analysis by gender shows that the effects of early life drinking water access are stronger and more precise among girls. An examination of pathways underlying these relationships provides preliminary evidence that learning over the life course is a leading mechanism. Quantifying these long-term cognitive benefits provides insight for directing and prioritizing resources for global efforts to increase equitable access to improved drinking water and sanitation."

The article claims that land abandonment was driven by mismanagement of irrigation through neoliberal economic policies before the 2006–10 Syrian drought and that agriculture quickly recovered after the drought. We use inferential statistics to test the authors’ claims. We find that before the drought, land abandonment occurred in areas with more rain-fed agriculture and was associated with population growth in sub-districts with more urban land cover. This finding suggests that pre-drought land abandonment was driven by increased urban development, rather than water mismanagement and irrigation policy reform. After drought onset, we find climatic stress caused first-year land abandonment, consistent with the authors’ claims. We also find third-year land abandonment is associated with population decline through 2010, going against the claim of a quick recovery. Our evidence suggests that the drought interrupted a long-term trend of decreasing agricultural use related to local urban expansion, bringing about a new trend of agricultural abandonment as a result of climate-induced out-migration. We find no evidence that land abandonment is associated with neoliberal policy reforms, or that there was a recovery when the drought ended."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9507,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是干旱对中国北方温带草原生态系统碳通量最佳温度的影响。研究使用了长期涡动观测数据，分析了生态系统总初级生产力（GPP）、生态系统呼吸（ER）和净生态系统生产力（NEP）的最佳温度，以及干旱对这些温度的影响。文章发现不同碳通量的最佳温度存在差异，干旱显著降低了最佳温度，并改变了其发生日期。水分和植被共同调控了最佳温度的时空变化。在干旱年份，降水和土壤含水量起主导作用；而在湿润年份，植被结构和生理特性更为重要。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它主要关注的是地面生态系统碳循环过程，而非大气成分的遥感监测。,"['carbon fluxes', 'ecosystem respiration', 'gross primary productivity', 'net ecosystem productivity', 'drought', 'temperature']",Tiancheng Su;Yanbing Wang;Cuihai You;Xingguo Han;Shiping Chen,Effects of drought on optimum temperature of carbon fluxes in temperate grasslands,"Ecosystem carbon flux components, including ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP), are the most direct indicators of ecosystem production capacity, carbon sequestration, and climate regulation strength. Nevertheless, little is known about how water availability affects the temperature responses of carbon flux components in water-limited ecosystems. Based on a long-term eddy observation dataset of temperate grasslands in northern China, we analyzed the effects of drought on the optimum temperature of carbon flux components ( ) in temperate grassland ecosystems and clarified the relative contributions of vegetation and climate factors to .

10.5194/acp-24-13317-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇文章探讨了对流层化学机制发展中的挑战和需求。文章的核心是化学机制的构建，这直接关系到大气模型的准确性，而大气模型是进行空气质量预测和气候变化研究的基础。文中提到了化学机制构建过程中需要考虑的实验数据（实验室、野外、环境舱）和理论数据（量子化学、理论动力学、机器学习），以及数据收集、机制构建和评估的严格程序。文章还讨论了在全球变化背景下（例如排放情景变化导致新的化学体系，野火，特大城市）发展新的气相和水相化学机制的需求，以及改进机制以更好地模拟氧化能力和气溶胶化学对气候、人类和生态系统健康的影响。由于文章关注的是大气化学机制的构建及其在空气质量和气候变化研究中的应用，而这些研究都与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有很强的相关性。,"['tropospheric chemistry', 'air pollution', 'climate change', 'chemical mechanism', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality modeling', 'satellite observation', 'remote sensing']",Barbara Ervens;Andrew Rickard;Bernard Aumont;William P.

Wallington,Opinion: Challenges and needs of tropospheric chemical mechanism development,"Chemical mechanisms describe the chemical processes in atmospheric models that are used to describe the changes in the atmospheric composition. Therefore, accurate chemical mechanisms are necessary to predict the evolution of air pollution and climate change. The article describes all steps that are needed to build chemical mechanisms and discusses the advances and needs of experimental and theoretical research activities needed to build reliable chemical mechanisms. 
 Chemical mechanisms form the core of atmospheric models to describe degradation pathways of pollutants and ultimately inform air quality and climate policymakers and other stakeholders. The accuracy of chemical mechanisms relies on the quality of their input data, which originate from experimental (laboratory, field, chamber) and theoretical (quantum chemistry, theoretical kinetics, machine learning) studies. The development of robust mechanisms requires rigorous and transparent procedures for data collection, mechanism construction and evaluation and the creation of reduced or operationally defined mechanisms. Developments in analytical techniques have led to a large number of identified chemical species in the atmospheric multiphase system that have proved invaluable for our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. At the same time, advances in software and machine learning tools have enabled automated mechanism generation. We discuss strategies for mechanism development, applying empirical or mechanistic approaches. We show the general workflows, how either approach can lead to robust mechanisms and that the two approaches complement each other, resulting in reliable predictions. Current challenges are discussed related to global change, including shifts in emission scenarios that result in new chemical regimes (e.g., low-NO scenarios, wildfires, mega- and gigacities) and that require the development of new or expanded gas- and aqueous-phase mechanisms. In addition, new mechanisms should be developed to also target oxidation capacity and aerosol chemistry impacting climate, human and ecosystem health."
10.5194/acp-24-13269-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了船舶排放的微粒对云的影响，特别是对液态水路径（LWP）的影响。研究者利用船舶航迹作为天然实验，结合卫星观测数据，分析了气溶胶扰动后云的演变。他们发现，先前研究中存在系统性偏差，导致高估了气溶胶对LWP的影响。修正偏差后，他们发现平均而言，气溶胶扰动对LWP的影响较弱，只有在特定情况下（例如，降水或清洁的海洋层积云）才观察到明显的正响应。这项研究强调了在分析孤立的机遇性实验中的细微之处，修正了先前研究中关于气溶胶对LWP响应的差异，对气候变化研究中辐射强迫的估算具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol', 'Cloud', 'Liquid Water Path (LWP)', 'Satellite observation', 'Ship tracks', 'Radiative forcing', 'Climate change', 'Marine stratocumulus clouds']",Anna Tippett;Edward Gryspeerdt;Peter Manshausen;Philip Stier;Tristan W. P. Smith,Weak liquid water path response in ship tracks,"Ship emissions can form artificially brightened clouds, known as ship tracks, and provide us with an opportunity to investigate how aerosols interact with clouds. Previous studies that used ship tracks suggest that clouds can experience large increases in the amount of water (LWP) from aerosols. Here, we show that there is a bias in previous research and that, when we account for this bias, the LWP response to aerosols is much weaker than previously reported. 
 The assessment of aerosol–cloud interactions remains a major source of uncertainty in understanding climate change, partly due to the difficulty in making accurate observations of aerosol impacts on clouds. Ships can release large numbers of aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei, which can create artificially brightened clouds known as ship tracks. These aerosol emissions offer a “natural”, or “opportunistic”, experiment to explore aerosol effects on clouds, while also disentangling meteorological influences. Utilizing ship positions and reanalysis wind fields, we predict ship track locations, colocating them with satellite data to depict the temporal evolution of cloud properties after an aerosol perturbation.  Repeating our analysis for a null experiment does not necessarily recover zero signal as expected; instead, it reveals subtleties between different null-experiment methodologies. This study uncovers a systematic bias in prior ship track research, due to the assumption that background gradients will, on average, be linear. We correct for this bias, which is linked to the correlation between wind fields and cloud properties, to reveal the true ship track response.We find that, once this bias is corrected for, the liquid water path (LWP) response after an aerosol perturbation is weak on average. This has important implications for estimates of radiative forcings due to LWP adjustments, as previous responses in unstable cases were overestimated. A noticeable LWP response is only recovered in specific cases, such as marine stratocumulus clouds, where a positive LWP response is found in precipitating or clean clouds. This work highlights subtleties in the analysis of isolated opportunistic experiments, reconciling differences in the LWP response to aerosols reported in previous studies."

Phuleria;Rajan K. Chakrabarty,Brownness of organics in anthropogenic biomass burning aerosols over South Asia,"Brown carbon (BrC) aerosols show an order-of-magnitude variation in their light absorption strength. Our understanding of BrC from real-world biomass burning remains limited, complicating the determination of its radiative impact. Our study reports absorption properties of BrC emitted from four major biomass burning sources using field measurements in India. It develops an absorption parameterization for BrC and examines the spatial variability in BrC's absorption strength across India. 
 In South Asia, biomass is burned for energy and waste disposal, producing brown carbon (BrC) aerosols whose climatic impacts are highly uncertain. To assess these impacts, a real-world understanding of BrC's physio-optical properties is essential. For this region, the order-of-magnitude variability in BrC's spectral refractive index as a function of particle volatility distribution is poorly understood. This leads to oversimplified model parameterization and subsequent uncertainty in regional radiative forcing. Here we used the field-collected aerosol samples from major anthropogenic biomass activities to examine the methanol-soluble BrC optical properties. We show a strong relation between the absorption strength, wavelength dependence, and thermo-optical fractions of carbonaceous aerosols. Our observations show strongly absorbing BrC near the Himalayan foothills that may accelerate glacier melt, further highlighting the limitations of climate models where variable BrC properties are not considered. These findings provide crucial inputs for refining climate models and developing effective regional strategies to mitigate BrC emissions."

By using a global atmospheric model and reanalysis data, it is found that the stratospheric QBO winds can affect the mesospheric diurnal tides by modulating the subtropical ozone variability in the upper stratosphere and the interaction between tides and gravity waves in the mesosphere. 
 A quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) disruption is a very rare phenomenon in which QBO westward wind is temporarily interrupted by the occurrence of a band of westward wind in the tropical stratosphere. This phenomenon is important as it could greatly affect the global atmospheric circulation, especially in the mesosphere. Past observational and modelling studies have shown the QBO varying mesospheric diurnal tide, but the mechanism is still not fully understood. In this study, we report on the strong response of mesospheric diurnal tides to the two QBO disruptions that occurred in 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 and their possible mechanisms. The diurnal tidal winds are observed by a meteor radar chain, consisting of meteor radars located at Kunming (25.6° N, 103.8° E), Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.2° E), Mengcheng (33.4° N, 116.5° E), Beijing (40.3° N, 116.2° E), and Mohe (53.5° N, 122.3° E) in China. These observations provide clear evidence that mesospheric diurnal tides are unusually weakened (by ∼ −6 m s−1) during these QBO disruptions, over Kunming, Wuhan, Mengcheng, and Beijing. Using the Specific Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (SD-WACCM-X) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset, the analysis indicates that the QBO wind affects mid-latitude mesospheric diurnal tides by modulating both the solar radiative absorption by subtropical stratospheric ozone (∼ 5 to 0.5 hPa) and the tidal–gravity wave interaction in the mesosphere (∼ 60 to 100 km). Thus, these unexpected QBO disruptions provide an opportunity to better understand the coupling between climate change and middle-atmospheric dynamics."

We present a new dataset of three years of NO2 vertical profiles in Toronto, Canada, and evaluate it using NO2 from satellite and surface monitoring networks and simulations by an air quality forecast model. We quantify and explain the differences among the datasets to provide information that can be used to understand NO2 variability. 
 The purpose of this work is to derive new NO2 vertical profiling data products from Pandora spectrometers and investigate the factors contributing to the bias of this dataset relative to established ground-based and spaceborne datasets. Possible applications of the NO2 vertical profile dataset include air quality monitoring and satellite validation studies. We explore the application of the optimal estimation method to Pandora multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements to retrieve vertical profile information for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). We use the Heidelberg Profile (HeiPro) retrieval algorithm to derive, for the first time, NO2 profiles and partial columns (0–4 km) from Pandora MAX-DOAS measurements from 2018–2020 at Downsview, a suburban neighbourhood in the north end of Toronto, Canada that is subject to local traffic emissions and urban influences. Validation of the new dataset was done via comparison with official Pandora direct-Sun measurements, in situ observations, satellite data, and an air quality forecasting model. We find that, for tropospheric partial column comparisons, the HeiPro dataset has a positive mean relative bias to Pandora direct-Sun (61 % ± 9.7 %) and TROPOMI (41 % ± 47 %) observations, as well as the GEM-MACH model output (61 % ± 7.5 %), with similar seasonal and diurnal cycles in the bias with Pandora direct-Sun and GEM-MACH. Contributing factors to the large bias of HeiPro to Pandora direct-Sun were investigated, and NO2 heterogeneity, combined with differences between direct-Sun and multi-axis viewing geometries, was found to contribute a maximum of 52 % of the total relative bias during morning measurement times. For surface NO2 comparisons, we find that HeiPro measurements capture the magnitude and diurnal variability of surface NO2 reasonably well (mean relative bias to in situ surface NO2: −8.9 % ± 7.6 %) but are low-biased compared to GEM-MACH (mean relative bias: −36 % ± 2.4 %). Compared to HeiPro, the GEM-MACH model profiles are high-biased in the lower boundary layer and low-biased in the free troposphere."

The gridded nighttime AOT retrievals, compared against Aerosol Robotic Network data, show reasonable skill levels for potential data assimilation, air quality and climate studies of significant events. 
 Using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day-Night Band (DNB), we examined the feasibility of developing a gridded nighttime aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data set based on the spatial derivative of measured top-of-atmosphere attenuated upwelling artificial lights at night (ALAN) over the US, Middle-East and Indian Subcontinent regions for 2017. We also studied the potential of using NASA’s standard operational Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) for estimating the spatial derivatives of surface artificial light emissions, that is one of the key lower boundary conditions for the retrieval process. Sensitivity of nighttime aerosol retrievals to observing conditions and different methods of estimating the spatial derivative of surface artificial light emissions were also explored. Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of ~ ~0.15 and ~0.18 and correlations of ~0.8 and ~0.6 were found between VIIRS nighttime AOT and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) nighttime and daytime data, respectively, suggesting that the proposed gridded nighttime AOT retrievals have reasonable skill levels for potential data assimilation, air quality and climate studies of significant events. We also found that NASA Black Marble products can be used to estimate the spatial derivative of surface artificial light emissions for nighttime AOT retrievals over regions that are not frequently contaminated by aerosol plumes, such as the USA. This study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing a gridded nighttime AOT data, using artificial lights, for monitoring of nighttime aerosol events over large spatial and temporal domains. Given the deployment of VIIRS instruments (currently in orbit and forthcoming) on board the NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System series satellites, this study can be viewed as a precursor for gridded nighttime AOT retrievals at both regional and global scales in the future. We also show that the use of the NASA Black Marble products, which would greatly save processing time of this method, is challenging over regions with frequent aerosol pollution such as the Indian Subcontinent and further exploration is required."

 The self-potential (SP) method is a sensitive geophysical technique to locate seafloor polymetallic sulfide deposits. Reasonable SP forward modeling can provide a good foundation for the inversion and interpretation of the measured data. Based on the mirror image theory, we proposed a method to derive the three-dimensional analytical solution of the SP generated by regularly polarized bodies in layered media, which is explained in detail within the context of the models. We discussed the analytical solutions for different types of layered models, considering variations in the number of layers and the distribution of sources. A lab-based oxidation–reduction experiment was conducted to record SP data. These data are used to simulate the SP generated by seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits and validate the previous analytical solution. The result shows that the measured SP data match the analytical solution well, demonstrating the correctness of the proposed method and the corresponding analytical solution.

Milne;Parviz Ajourlou;Soran Parang;Lev Tarasov;Konstantin Latychev,A fast surrogate model for 3D Earth glacial isostatic adjustment using Tensorflow (v2.8.0) artificial neural networks,"A relatively recent advance in glacial isostatic adjustment modeling has been the development of models that include 3D Earth structure, as opposed to 1D structure. However, a major limitation is the computational expense. We have developed a method using artificial neural networks to emulate the influence of 3D Earth models to affordably constrain the viscosity parameter space. Our results indicate that the misfits are of a scale such that useful predictions of relative sea level can be made. 
 Models of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) play a central role in the interpretation of various geologic and geodetic data to understand and simulate past and future changes in ice sheets and sea level, as well as to infer rheological properties of the deep Earth. During the past few decades, a major advance has been the development of models that include 3D Earth structure, as opposed to 1D spherically symmetric (SS) structure. However, a major limitation in employing 3D GIA models is their high computational expense. As such, we have developed a method using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the Tensorflow library to predict the influence of 3D Earth models with the goal of more affordably exploring the parameter space of these models, specifically the radial (1D) viscosity profile to which the lateral variations are added.Our goal is to test whether the use of an ANN to produce a fast surrogate model can accurately predict the difference in GIA model outputs (i.e., relative sea level (RSL) and uplift rates) for the 3D case relative to the SS case. If so, the surrogate model can be used with a computationally efficient SS (Earth) GIA model to generate output that replicates that from a 3D (Earth) GIA model. Evaluation of the surrogate model performance for deglacial RSL indicates that it is able to provide useful estimates of this field throughout the parameter space when trained on only ≈15 % (≈50) of the parameter vectors considered (330 in total).We applied the surrogate model in a model–data comparison exercise using RSL data distributed along the North American coasts from the Canadian Arctic to the US Gulf Coast. We found that the surrogate model is able to successfully reproduce the model–data misfit values such that the region of minimum misfit either generally overlaps the 3D GIA model results or is within two increments of the radial viscosity model parameter space (defined here as lithosphere thickness, upper-mantle viscosity, and lower-mantle viscosity). The surrogate model can, therefore, be used to accurately explore this aspect of the 3D Earth model parameter space. In summary, this work demonstrates the utility of machine learning in 3D Earth GIA modelling, and so future work to expand on this initial proof-of-concept analysis is warranted."

Errors in the ECMWF model's scheme for predicting ocean skin temperature prompted a revision of the ocean mixed layer model. Validation against infrared measurements and buoys showed a good correlation with minimal deviations. The revised model accurately simulates SST variations and aligns with solar radiation distributions, showing promise for weather and climate models. 
 Sea surface temperature (SST) is a crucial parameter in climate, weather, and ocean sciences due to its decisive role in ocean–atmosphere interactions. Identifying errors in the prognostic scheme used by the current European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model for predicting the diurnal variation in ocean skin temperature led to a revisit and revision of the ocean mixed layer (OML) model. Validation of the revised model was conducted by comparing simulated temperatures at the sub-skin level and 1 m depth with observations from shipborne infrared measurements and buoys. These comparisons revealed a strong correlation, with an absolute mean deviation of less than 0.1 K and a standard deviation under 0.5 K, which are found to be comparable to errors in satellite observations of SST. Given that these results are derived from the same model simulations, the error statistics for the simulated skin temperature and its diurnal variation should have the same degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the simulation results closely align with anticipated solar radiation distributions, whereas ERA5 ocean skin temperature shows a significant lack of alignment with solar radiation. Consequently, the revised OML model shows promising potential for improving the simulation of diurnal SST variations in weather and climate models."

A sum of 142,982 participants without GI cancer at baseline were derived from the National Urban Cancer Screening Program in Beijing (2013–2019). The 5 year averaged concentrations of PM2.5 mass and its five constituents, namely, black carbon (BC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3–), organic matter (OM), and inorganic sulfate (SO42–), were estimated by using a hybrid machine learning model. The Cox proportional hazard model with fixed effects was used to explore the associations between PM2.5 mass and its constituents with the incidence of GI cancer. The double-exposure linear model, the mixture exposure model of quantile-based g-computation, and an explainable machine learning model were utilized to evaluate the importance of different PM2.5 constituents. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 mass and its constituents was linearly associated with GI cancer; the estimated hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of per standard deviation increment were 1.367 (95% CI: 1.257 to 1.487) for PM2.5 mass, 1.434 (95% CI: 1.307 to 1.574) for BC, 1.255 (95% CI: 1.169 to 1.349) for NH4+, 1.217 (95% CI: 1.139 to 1.301) for NO3–, 1.410 (95% CI: 1.287 to 1.546) for OM, and 1.410 (95% CI: 1.288 to 1.542) for SO42–.

However, the scalable preparation of carbon electrocatalysts to achieve satisfactory H2O2 yield in acidic media remains a grand challenge. Here, we present the design of a carbon nanoreactor series that integrates precise O/N codoping alongside well-regulated geometric structures targeting high-efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2. Theoretical computations reveal that strategic N/O codoping facilitates partial electron transfer from C sites to O sites, realizing electronic rearrangement that optimizes C-site adsorption of *OOH. Concurrently, the O–O bond in *OOH is strengthened by charge transfer from antibonding to π-orbitals, stabilizing the O–O bond and preventing its dissociation. The carbon nanoreactor with a hollow bowl geometry also facilitates the mass transport of O2 and H2O2, achieving an H2O2 selectivity of 96% in acidic media. Furthermore, a flow cell integrated with the refined nanoreactor catalyst achieves an impressive H2O2 production rate of 2942.4 mg L–1 h–1, coupled with stable operation of nearly 80 h, surpassing the state-of-the-art metal-free analogs. The feasibility of the electro-synthesized H2O2 is further demonstrated to be highly efficient in wastewater remediation."

However, the overall surface and subsurface effects of eddies on the Southern Ocean biogeochemistry have not been quantified observationally at a large scale. Here, we co‐locate eddies, identified in the Meta3.2DT satellite altimeter‐based product, with biogeochemical Argo floats to determine the effects of eddies on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrate, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the upper 1,500 m of the ice‐free Southern Ocean, as well as the eddy effects on the carbon fluxes in this region. DIC and nitrate concentrations are lower in anticyclonic eddies (AEs) and increased in cyclonic eddies (CEs), while dissolved oxygen anomalies switch signs above (CEs: positive, AEs: negative) and below the mixed layer (CEs: negative, AEs: positive). We attribute these anomalies primarily to eddy pumping (isopycnal heave), as well as eddy trapping for oxygen. Maximum anomalies in all tracers occur at greater depths in the subduction zone north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) compared to the upwelling region in the ACC, reflecting differences in background vertical structures. Eddy effects on air–sea CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ exchange have significant seasonal variability, with additional outgassing in CEs in fall (physical process) and additional oceanic uptake in AEs and CEs in spring (biological and physical process). Integrated over the Southern Ocean, AEs contribute ∼0.03± ${\sim} 0.03\pm $ 0.01 Pg C yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ (7 ±2% $\pm 2\%$) to the Southern Ocean carbon uptake, and CEs offset this by ∼0.01± ${\sim} 0.01\pm $0.01 Pg C yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ (2 ±2% $\pm 2\%$).

The two protocols are compared by using a seismological forecasting methodology coupled with a hydro‐mechanical model reproducing flow, poroelastic stress and fault failure in a domain including a discrete fault network based on Basel EGS (Switzerland, 2006). Unlike bleed‐off, shut‐in mitigates early post‐injection seismicity by smoothly reducing pressure, and consequently poroelastic stress changes in the modelled Basel EGS.

In the initial 3 years, the equatorial SST responses exhibit an opposite sign to the forcings in the northern extratropics but align with those in the southern extratropics. At this stage, heating the northern extratropics is more effective at cooling the equatorial Pacific than cooling the southern extratropics. This occurs because the anomalous warming in the northern extratropics is blocked by the rainband and can only enter the equatorial Pacific from the west, triggering Bjerknes feedback more effectively. Over a decade, all experiments show enhanced equatorial responses aligning with the signs of the forcings.

Nevertheless, it is statistically possible for Antarctica to experience a calving event up to several times greater than any in the observational record."

Phosphorus and/or fixed nitrogen are widely expected to limit primary production in most freshwater environments, however the role of micronutrients is largely un‐characterized. We measured dissolved nitrate and nitrite, phosphate, cobalt, iron, manganese and zinc in a selection of Greenland and Antarctic lakes, and report the first evaluation of cobalt regulating phytoplankton growth in these systems using bioassay incubations. Results showed cobalt potentially co‐limited phytoplankton in three of the eight sites tested. A time‐series of dissolved cobalt measured in Kobbefjord (southwest Greenland) runoff corroborated low cobalt availability during summer. This was in contrast to manganese and iron which remained at high concentrations throughout summer. We hypothesize that high manganese:cobalt and/or zinc:cobalt ratios in runoff, may impede cellular cobalt acquisition, meaning cobalt co‐limitation of primary production is plausible in many polar freshwater environments."

Non‐Maxwellian electron distributions are strong indicators of kinetic‐scale processes near the electron diffusion region, yet they remain incompletely understood. Using in‐situ spacecraft data from 29 magnetopause reconnection events, we unambiguously identify a non‐Maxwellian capsule electron distribution near the electron diffusion region. This distribution comprises an elongated component parallel with the magnetic field at lower energies and a butterfly component (with peaks at pitch angles near 45° $45{}^{\circ}$ and 135° $135{}^{\circ}$) at higher energies. We provide evidence that these distributions are partly linked to electron trapping and preferential heating along the direction of magnetic fields. The parallel electric potentials needed for the parallel heating may be linked to kinetic Alfvén waves. These capsule‐like electron distributions are also found to generate whistler emissions. Our results suggest that these kinetic processes are prevalent in magnetic reconnection."

TerraWind enhances accuracy by incorporating topographic factors and inter‐station linkages, capturing wind field interactions with terrain at multiple scales. Experimental results in Eastern China demonstrate that TerraWind reduces wind speed Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by an average of 42.6% $\%$ and 33.3% $\%$, respectively, compared to three interpolation methods (bicubic, bilinear, and Inverse Distance Weighting).

The iridescence, visible through three‐color imaging, arises from locally uniform particle sizes resulting from similar growth histories.

In contrast, a similar trend cannot be observed in the coastal regions. The rapid increase of TC‐induced damage in the inland areas of East China is directly related to an increase of the annual number of disastrous TCs, which is a result of the increased TC landfall frequency and the increased TC decay timescale after landfall.

AS concentrations and contributions were similar in urban and rural regions and contributed <20% annually to RCFM, considerably less than two decades ago. In general, urban concentrations were greater for AN, POM, and EC, suggesting additional urban sources.

A uniformly dry SM patch at a 5° × 5° scale is centered at the point of a documented MCS initiation to observe spatiotemporal changes of the simulated MCS events, totaling 97 cases between 2004 and 2017. A storm‐centered composite analysis of SM at the location of simulated MCS events depicted SM heterogeneity [O(100) km] structured as significantly drier soils to the southwest (SW) transitioning to wetter soils northeast (NE) of the mean simulated initiation. Further analyses showed that this SM configuration influenced near‐surface fluxes, which created a gradient of 2m‐temperature and 2m‐humidity, also aligned SW‐to‐NE, which affected the growth of the planetary boundary layer to trigger MCS initiations earlier in time (∼1–2 hr on average) compared to Control simulations. The implementation of the dry SM perturbation introduced drier‐to‐wetter SM gradients along the edges of the perturbed area, and MCS initiations were subsequently preferred on the drier side of those transition zones, with the most common orientation of simulated MCS events embedded within southwesterly flow. These results emphasize the importance of the low‐level wind field alignment to organized SM gradients, which suggests that SM heterogeneity can drive MCS initiation related to near‐surface atmospheric variable fluctuations as the main mechanism of interaction in weakly forced synoptic environments."

The excellent spatial and temporal coverage of satellite data makes them critical to the validation of ash dispersion model forecasts. This study investigates the limitations of satellite‐retrieved volcanic ash data through the production of simulated radiances for a range of ash cloud properties encompassing the satellite retrieval's sensitivity. We run a detection and retrieval algorithm (Francis et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016788) on these simulated ash clouds and assess the sensitivity and performance of the algorithms. Expected limitations are highlighted, including a lack of sensitivity to particles larger than ∼10 μm in radius and challenges in accurately retrieving heights in the stratosphere. However, other previously poorly defined limitations are also constrained, such as the reduction in sensitivity as ash column loading increases in optically thick ash clouds and increasingly underestimated column loading when column loadings are >∼7 g m−2. We consider the implications of the identified limitations when using satellite‐retrieved ash column loadings to verify dispersion model output. We show that, accounting for the limitations of the satellite retrieval, a significant proportion of mass in the model output can lie outside the sensitivity range of the satellite detection and retrieval. This demonstrates the importance of understanding observations' limitations when comparing to model output. This knowledge should be used when verifying operational volcanic ash cloud forecasts."

Although the simulation portrays gravity waves in the stratosphere in a complex structure, it reveals a concentric‐ring pattern of gravity waves in the mesosphere. The waves closely resemble the airglow image acquired by Suomi National Polar‐orbiting Partnership satellite near the mesopause. This intriguing phenomenon of the emergence of concentric rings after passing the stratopause is investigated by analyzing wave characteristics, including horizontal wavenumbers, frequency, and phase speed. The analysis reveals that the wind filtering effect directly influences the behavior of gravity waves, leading to variations in their appearance with altitude. The wind filtering effect, which typically breaks symmetric ring waves, could help reveal the ring pattern when the waves are subject to interference. Consequently, the concentric rings, propagating faster than the background winds, are shown to originate from the cloud tops of the storm complex. A wind duct at a specific location is identified through spectral analysis. This mechanism is further elucidated with the assistance of the dispersion relation of a classical linear theory."

Aerosol pH was diagnosed as the limiting factor governing the production rates of HMS via the traditional aqueous processing. However, the disparities between the theoretical formation rates and observed concentrations implied the possibility of a new formation mechanism for HMS. Strong correlations were found between methanesulfonate (MSA) and HMS, with machine learning simulation indicating MSA as the most pivotal contributor. Through the density functional theory calculations, HMS can be generated by gas‐phase organic reactions between the •OOCH2SO3H radical (formed from the isomerization of methylsulfonoxyl radical (CH3SO3•) and oxidation) and NO or CH3OO• radical, leading to the cogeneration of HMS and MSA.

The organic aerosols (OA) source apportionment identified two major factors—Hydrocarbon‐like OA and Biomass‐burning OA—as well as two secondary factors—MO‐OOA (more oxidized‐oxygenated OA) and LO‐OOA (low oxidized oxygenated OA). NPF events were frequently observed during the day (mostly well‐defined nucleation events) and at night (burst of ultrafine mode particles without any discernible growth). A condensation sink value of (9.4 ± 4.0) × 10−3 s−1 during Campaign 1 and (14.2 ± 6.0) × 10−3 s−1 during Campaign 2 was obtained. The daytime events were associated with enhanced sulfuric acid proxy concentrations of (2–12) × 106 molecules cm−3, suggesting the role of gas‐phase photochemistry in promoting NPF. A novel approach of hybrid positive matrix factorization analysis was used to deconvolve the chemical species responsible for the observed events. The results suggest the involvement of multiple components, including ammonium sulfate and MO‐OOA, in the nucleation; Nitrate, HOA and LO‐OOA participate in the subsequent particle growth for the daytime events.

However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive understanding on their origins and formation pathways. In this study, 14 particulate NACs were measured at high time resolution at the summit of Mount Tai over North China Plain in winter with an average concentration of 30.5 ng m−3. The relatively higher concentrations and distinct diurnal profiles of NACs suggest the occurrence of strong secondary formation driven from polluted urban plumes transported by mountain‐valley breezes, elevated NOx and precursor levels, and strong oxidation capacity. An observationally constrained multiphase chemical box model was developed and employed to elucidate the origins and formation pathways of NACs.

10.1029/2024JD041324,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了2000年代初以来东北亚春季植被年际变化强度显著增加的现象。研究利用了1982年至2020年的叶面积指数（LAI）和归一化植被指数（NDVI）数据，发现春季植被年际变化强度与地表气温的年际变化强度密切相关。进一步分析表明，北大西洋涛动（NAO）对植被年际变化强度的增强具有显著影响。研究发现，2002-2016年期间，3月份NAO的年际变化强度比1986-2001年期间显著增加，这种变化通过影响净热通量，导致3月份北大西洋三极子（NAT）海表温度（SST）出现正位相。由于SST的持续性，正NAT SST模式持续到4月份，随后通过从北大西洋起源并向下游传播的波列，导致东北亚地区出现正高度异常，从而导致东北亚地区地表气温升高，最终影响当地植被生长。因此，3月份NAO年际变化强度的增加导致了东北亚地区春季植被年际变化强度的增强。该研究使用了卫星遥感技术获取植被指数数据，并结合气象数据分析了大气环流对植被的影响，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Leaf Area Index (LAI)', 'Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Surface air temperature', 'North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)', 'Vegetation monitoring', 'Interannual variability']",Ning Xin;Botao Zhou;Haishan Chen;Shanlei Sun;Miao Yu,NAO Signal in the Increased Interannual Variability of Spring Vegetation in Northeast Asia After the Early 2000s,"Based on the leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1982 to 2020, this study reveals a significant increase in the intensity of interannual variability (IIV) in spring (April–May) vegetation over Northeast Asia since the early 2000s. This change is closely linked to the notable increase in the IIV of April surface air temperatures over Northeast Asia from the former period (1986–2001) to the latter period (2002–2016). Further analysis also highlights a salient impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the strengthened IIV in vegetation. During the latter period, there is a substantial increase in the IIV of the March NAO compared with the former period. This greater variability allows the positive NAO to significantly influence the net heat fluxes, thereby leading to a positive phase of the North Atlantic tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature (SST) pattern in March. Given the persistence of SSTs, the positive NAT SST pattern lasts to April, subsequently causing positive height anomalies over Northeast Asia through a wave train that originates from the North Atlantic and propagates downstream. This process consequently results in an increase in surface air temperature over Northeast Asia and hence the local vegetation. Thus, the increased IIV of the March NAO is conducive to enhancing the IIV in spring vegetation over Northeast Asia."

All the simulations agreed with the main observed characteristics of this storm, with some discrepancies in magnitude and location, which vary with CP and MP schemes. These discrepancies were larger during the mature phase of the storm. In the CP‐on simulations, the non‐scale aware Kain–Fritsch (KF) scheme typically resulted in higher precipitation, while the Betts‐Miller‐Janjic (BMJ) scheme led to lower precipitation compared to the CP‐off simulations (C0). The tendency of the KF scheme to consume available convective potential energy at a relatively high rate (i.e., short time scale) resulted in high mass fluxes and latent heat release, leading to strengthened convective activity and, hence, precipitation. The multi‐scale aware (MSKF) substantially reduces the precipitation compared to KF due to the reduced contribution of convective scale precipitation. It also modulates the spatial structure precipitation compared to KF, especially light precipitation over the outer bands, and the contribution of grid‐scale precipitation to total precipitation. KF shows the lowest contribution, around 50%, whereas BMJ exhibits a slightly higher contribution, and MSKF versions nearly reach 100%, making it closer to CP‐off. The improved performance in MSKF compared to KF highlights the importance of MSKF convection parameterization for gray zone (~1–4 km) simulation. The persistent discrepancy in landfall location in CP‐on and CP‐off simulation underscored the need of further investigating other physics parameterizations and dynamical mechanisms."

On the spatial scale, the agglomeration area is located in cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Urbanization and air pollution are the main driving factors of the incidence rate of influenza.

Influenza is an acute respiratory infection that spreads rapidly and widely in densely populated areas with low vaccination coverage. The trends and drivers of the spatial and temporal dynamics of influenza incidence among residents of mainland China have not been systematically studied. This study comprehensively analyses the dynamics and spatial correlation of influenza using long‐term scale data and spatial panel data. It then identifies the interactive process of socio‐economic and natural elements on the incidence of influenza. The highest prevalence of influenza was found in the 0–4 years age group in mainland China (mean prevalence, 67.56/100,000). In addition, influenza in mainland China shows seasonality, with fall and winter being the periods of high incidence. Between 2014 and 2017, influenza incidence was clustered in Hubei and Anhui provinces, and the spatial clustering was statistically significant (Z value > 1.96, P < 0.05). Moreover, the directionality of influenza onset continued to increase each year. Specifically, the clustering of influenza onset was stronger in the northwest‐southeast direction than in the southwest‐northeast direction between 2014 and 2018. The significant role of socioeconomic factors as a primary influence on influenza incidence, while their interaction with natural factors, such as air quality (NOx and PM2.5) and climatic conditions can exacerbate regional outbreaks.

The housing price‐to‐income ratio (HPIR) and the rental household proportion (RHP) are positively correlated to cancer incidence, whereas the per capita living area (PCLA) has a negative correlation with cancer incidence. (b) The differences in the impact of housing hardship on cancer incidence between the UAs and the NUAs are reflected mainly in the differences in the PCLA and the RHP. The PCLA has a strong association with cancer incidence in the UAs, whereas the RHP demonstrates a strong correlation with cancer incidence in the NUAs.

 Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen, causing diseases ranging from local to life-threating systemic infections. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a crucial mediator in several cytokine signaling pathways, has been associated with protective functions in various microbial infections. However, its specific contribution in the immune response to fungal infections has remained elusive. In this study, we show that mice lacking TYK2 or its enzymatic activity exhibit enhanced resistance to C. albicans skin infections, limiting fungal spread and accelerating wound healing. Impaired TYK2-signaling prompted the formation of a distinctive layer of necrotic neutrophils around the fungal pathogens. Transcriptomic analysis revealed TYK2’s pivotal role in regulating interferon-inducible genes in neutrophils, thereby impacting their antifungal capacity during infection. Furthermore, we show that TYK2-dependent interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production contributes to fungal dissemination from the skin to the kidneys.

 Proinsulin translation and folding is crucial for glucose homeostasis. However, islet β-cell control of Proinsulin translation remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify OSGEP, an enzyme responsible for t6A37 modification of tRNANNU that tunes glucose metabolism in β-cells. Global Osgep deletion causes glucose intolerance, while β-cell-specific deletion induces hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to impaired insulin activity. Transcriptomics and proteomics reveal activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis signaling pathways in Osgep-deficient islets, linked to an increase in misfolded Proinsulin from reduced t6A37 modification. Osgep overexpression in pancreas rescues insulin secretion and mitigates diabetes in high-fat diet mice. Osgep enhances translational fidelity and alleviates UPR signaling, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diabetes. Individuals carrying the C allele at rs74512655, which promotes OSGEP transcription, may show reduced susceptibility to T2DM.

 Glaciers in the Arctic have lost considerable mass during the last two decades. About a third of the glaciers by area drains into the ocean, yet the mechanisms and drivers governing mass loss at glacier calving fronts are poorly constrained in part due to few long-term glacier-ocean observations. Here, we combine a detailed satellite-based record of calving front ablation for Austfonna, the largest ice cap on Svalbard, with in-situ ocean records from an offshore mooring and modelled freshwater runoff for the period 2018-2022. We show that submarine melting and calving occur almost exclusively in autumn for all types of outlet glaciers, even for the surging and fast-flowing glacier Storisstraumen. Ocean temperature controls the observed frontal ablation, whereas subglacial runoff of surface meltwater appears to have little direct impact on the total ablation. The seasonal warming of the offshore waters varies both in magnitude, depth and timing, suggesting a complex interplay between inflowing Atlantic-influenced water at depth and seasonally warmed surface water in the Barents Sea. The immediate response of frontal ablation to seasonal ocean warming suggests that marine-terminating glaciers in high Arctic regions exposed to Atlantification are prone to rapid changes that should be accounted for in future glacier projections.

In this process, trigger waves gradually replace transient phase waves, with spatial heterogeneities accelerating the transition. 
 Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity rises and falls throughout the cell cycle: a cell-autonomous process called mitotic oscillations. Mitotic oscillators can synchronize when spatially coupled, facilitating rapid, synchronous divisions in large early embryos of Drosophila (~0.5 mm) and Xenopus (~1.2 mm). Diffusion alone cannot achieve such long-range coordination. Instead, studies proposed mitotic waves—phase and trigger waves—as mechanisms of the coordination. How waves establish over time remains unclear. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and a Cdk1 Förster resonance energy transfer sensor, we observe a transition from phase to trigger wave dynamics in initially homogeneous cytosol. Spatial heterogeneity promotes this transition. Adding nuclei accelerates entrainment. The system transitions almost immediately when driven by metaphase-arrested extracts. Numerical simulations suggest phase waves appear transiently as trigger waves take time to entrain the system. Therefore, we show that both waves belong to a single biological process capable of coordinating the cell cycle over long distances. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and a Cdk1 FRET sensor, the authors demonstrate how rapid cell cycles achieve long-range cytoplasmic synchronization through mitotic waves.

This analysis examines how these ‘silos’ may hamper further research. 
 There is no consensus in society on how to achieve sustainability. Scientists’ limited experience in reflecting on their guiding assumptions, combined with a tendency to inflate their own research findings, hinders interdisciplinary dialogue and limits the usefulness of science. Through bibliometrics and discourse analysis, we analysed highly cited articles on agroecology and sustainable intensification. In broad terms, agroecology prioritizes diversity while sidelining productivity and adheres to relational epistemology, while sustainable intensification emphasizes boosting crop production while reducing environmental impact within a reductionist epistemology. Both discourses claim to have the solution to agricultural sustainability but are largely inexplicit about their guiding assumptions and their own limitations, and rarely engage with research in the other discourse. Interdisciplinary dialogue based on transparent and self-critical reflection on the assumptions and limitations of research could increase the relevance of science in societal dialogues about alternative pathways towards sustainable agriculture.

 Natural climate solutions (NCS) play a critical role in climate change mitigation. NCS can generate win–win co-benefits for biodiversity and human well-being, but they can also involve trade-offs (co-impacts). However, the massive evidence base on NCS co-benefits and possible trade-offs is poorly understood. We employ large language models to assess over 2 million published journal articles, primarily written in English, finding 257,266 relevant studies on NCS co-impacts. Using machine learning methods to extract data (for example, study location, species and other key variables), we create a global evidence map on NCS co-impacts. We find that global evidence on NCS co-impacts has grown approximately tenfold in three decades, and some of the most abundant evidence relates to NCS that have lower mitigation potential. Studies often examine multiple NCS, indicating some natural complementarities. Finally, we identify countries with high carbon mitigation potential but a relatively weak body of evidence on NCS co-impacts. Through effective methods and systematic and representative data on NCS co-impacts, we provide timely insights to inform NCS-related research and action globally.

 The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), one of the leading modes of atmospheric variability in the Northern Hemisphere and key driver of surface climate anomalies, was long considered to be spatially stable. Yet, its northern center-of-action – the Icelandic Low (IL) – shifted eastward in the late 1970s compared to the preceding decades of the mid-20th century. The responsible processes are still uncertain, particularly after the decline of the positive NAO trend in the 21st century. Here, we present observational and model evidence that the NAO-IL moves naturally alternating between two preferential locations, west/east of Iceland, with no need for changes in anthropogenic forcing or low-frequency oceanic variability. These recurrent longitudinal displacements of the NAO pattern appear linked to zonal changes in the fluctuations (not mean-state) of transient-eddy activity, emphasizing the relevance of internal atmospheric variability, and could represent a major source of uncertainty in regional climate prediction and projection."

 Despite its pronounced global impacts, tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV) is poorly predicted by current climate models due to model deficiencies and a limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Using observational data and a hierarchy of model simulations including decadal hindcasts, we find that decadal isopycnal depth variability driven by oceanic Rossby waves in the tropical Pacific provides the most important source of predictability for TPDV. The predictability arising from initial isopycnal depth conditions is further amplified by tropical ocean-atmosphere coupling and variations in the strength of subtropical cells in the Pacific throughout the decadal forecasts. Regional initialization experiments that effectively isolate the impact of different ocean basins on TPDV predictability highlight the essential role of the tropical Pacific. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms governing TPDV predictability, offering crucial insights for improving the accuracy of decadal predictions."

 Photovoltaic (PV) installations have rapidly and extensively been deployed worldwide as a promising alternative renewable energy source. However, weather anomalies could expose them to challenges in supply security by causing very low power production. Using reanalysis weather data from 1986 to 2021 and a high-resolution global inventory of PV installations, we assess the impact of extreme low-production (ELP) events across various regions. Our results reveal that regions between 60°N and 60°S experience an average of 27 ELP events annually, with 17% of these events being high-intensity. Regions with dense PV installations—including Southern China, Central and Northern Europe, Central and Eastern America, and Japan—are particularly affected. These areas, which collectively host approximately half of the global PV installations, see 44% of ELP events being high-intensity. Maintaining a daily backup supply equivalent to the average event intensity could recover 39% to 81% of events across different sites.

 Subduction initiation remains elusive because no present example exists. Ophiolites formed over nascent subduction zones in the past provide the key to constraining the processes of subduction initiation. Here we document three Cambrian ophiolites with supra-subduction zone affinity, which likely reflect the inception of a plate-boundary scale subduction zone within the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Our findings, together with a compilation of Cambrian ophiolites in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, indicate diachronous subduction initiation(s) along a > 6000 kilometer zone within the Paleo-Asian Ocean between 536 and 528 million years ago. The subduction initiation of the Paleo-Asian Ocean coincides with the closure of the Mirovoi Ocean following the collision of a series of microcontinents with the Siberian craton, likely representing a typical record of collision-induced subduction jump. Our observations and numerical modeling provide a new scenario that subduction initiations would locate at oceanic weak zones rather than passive margins of accreted microcontinents during collision-induced subduction process.

 Plastic pollution transported in rivers remains poorly understood due to the diversity of shapes, sizes, and densities of plastics, as well as their complex interactions with biofilms. While previous studies have explored the settling velocities of plastics and their interactions with biofilms, they often overlook how biofouling alters plastic dynamics and settling behaviour. To address this, over 800 settling experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the dynamics and falling velocities of isotropic (spheres) and anisotropic (square and rectangle plates) macroplastics of different densities (1050 to 2200 kg/m3) are significantly impacted by biofouling. Three-dimensional tracking of plastic trajectories revealed that biofilm colonisation on the surface of anisotropic plastic plates triggered them to exhibit more chaotic trajectories, larger horizontal dispersion and higher oscillatory frequencies. These dynamics reduced the average vertical settling velocity of anisotropic biofouled plates by up to 12%—despite greater plastic densities and considering the multimodal distribution of a plate’s fall velocity—compared to their pristine counterparts. Results highlight the necessity of accounting for the intricate multimodal settling dynamics of plastics, including their interactions with biofilms, to provide more reliable predictions of plastic transport and fate in aquatic environments.

Distinct seasonal patterns emerge, with winter and spring exhibiting the highest pollution levels, while pronounced regional differences highlight seasonal pollution hotspots in the western Iberian Peninsula, French coastline, Irish Sea and Skagerrak region. These peaks are attributed to riverine emissions and aquaculture activities, highlighting the potential impact of these sources on beach pollution.

 Permafrost thaw in warming Arctic landscapes alters hydrology and saturation-driven biogeochemical processes. Models assume that aerobic respiration occurs in drained soils while saturated soils support methanogenesis; however, saturated soils maintain redox gradients that host a range of anaerobic metabolisms. We evaluated how redox potential and redox-active solutes vary with soil moisture in the active layer of permafrost-affected acidic and non-acidic tundra hillslopes. Oxidizing conditions persisted in highly permeable organic horizons of both unsaturated tussock tundra and saturated wet sedge meadows. Redox potential decreased with depth in all soils as increasing soil bulk density restricted groundwater flow and oxygen diffusion. High concentrations of dissolved iron, phosphate, and organic carbon coincided with redox boundaries below the soil surface in acidic tundra, indicating active iron redox cycling and potential release of adsorbed phosphate during iron (oxyhydr)oxide dissolution. In non-acidic tundra, weatherable minerals affected nutrient dynamics more than redox-driven iron cycling, especially in low-lying, saturated areas where thaw reached mineral soils. The role of thaw depth and the ability of saturated soils to maintain oxidizing conditions in organic surface layers highlight the importance of soil physical properties and hydrology in predicting biogeochemical processes and greenhouse gas emissions.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that critically contributes to Earth’ s climate. Thermal anisotropy is a major challenge that must be addressed while generating long-term LST products from satellites. For instance, the differences between GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products caused by thermal anisotropy have not yet been resolved, which impacts the high-frequency monitoring of the land surface. The coupled contributions of the gap fraction and hotspot effects in the thermal infrared domain result in the existence of thermal anisotropy effect. The time-evolving kernel-driven model (TEKDM) is a recently proposed practical tool for conducting LST angular normalization for geostationary satellites. However, the existing six-parameter TEKDM considers only the hotspot effect and ignores the gap fraction effect, which may limit the TEKDM-based angular normalization method. In this study, we proposed an extended seven-parameter TEKDM considering both the gap fraction and hotspot effects and normalized the angular effect of GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products over the overlapping region using this model. The accuracy of this seven-parameter TEKDM was evaluated using a physically based discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) simulation dataset. Subsequently, the seven-parameter TEKDM-based angular normalization method was evaluated using the GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products of the overlapping region for one year against ten AmeriFlux sites. The results showed that the seven-parameter TEKDM had a RMSE (MBE) of 0.36 K (0.0019 K). Compared with the RMSE of the NOAA-released GOES LST products, the seven-parameter TEKDM-based normalization method could reduce the RMSE of GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products from 2.2 K and 2.6 K to 1.7 K, respectively, with a reduction of 0.5 K (22.7 %) and 0.9 K (34.6 %), respectively. Furthermore, the RMSE/MBE of GOES-17 LST exhibited a different diurnal variation pattern than that of GOES-16 LST, which could be explained by the different illumination-viewing geometries of the two satellites. This emphasizes the necessity of conducting angular normalization of current geostationary satellite LST products. The seven-parameter TEKDM provides a feasible method for generating long-term high-quality LST datasets for remote sensing communities."

 Understanding the optical properties of dorsiventral leaves and quantifying leaf biochemical traits through physical models are important for interpreting canopy radiative transfer and monitoring plant growth. Previous models, such as the dorsiventral leaf model (DLM), have effectively accounted for the inner asymmetry of the leaf but neglected the asymmetry of surface structures between the upper and lower epidermis. In this study, we found marked differences in bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves under multi-angular measurements due to surface structural distinctions. To address this asymmetry in both internal and surface leaf structures, we subsequently proposed an advanced DLM model (MADLM) for simulating both multi-angular and spectral BRF of two leaf sides, linking the angular reflection of leaf adaxial and abaxial sides to surface structural parameters (roughness and refractive index) based on microfacet theory. Results show that MADLM accurately simulates multi-angular and spectral BRF for both sides of dorsiventral leaves, and yields satisfactory retrieval accuracy of leaf traits from all observation geometries. For close-range hyperspectral imaging applications, we further introduced a simplified version, sMADLM, which characterizes the surface reflection of two leaf sides in terms of the product of a leaf-side dependent parameter and the wavelength-dependent Fresnel factor. The sMADLM improves the mapping accuracy of leaf biochemical traits by effectively reducing the surface reflection effects in dorsiventral leaves. The MADLM and sMADLM deepen our understanding of the optical properties of dorsiventral leaves and provide practical methods for retrieving leaf biochemical traits via optical remote sensing."

Atkinson,Unsupervised object-based spectral unmixing for subpixel mapping,"•An unsupervised object-based subpixel mapping (UO-SPM) model was proposed. •Object-based analysis was used to enhance spectral unmixing and subpixel mapping. •Various SPM methods are enhanced effectively within the UO-SPM framework. •UO-SPM consistently produces more accurate results across various study sites. 
 Subpixel mapping (SPM) addresses the widespread mixed pixel problem in remote sensing images by predicting the spatial distribution of land cover within mixed pixels. However, conventional pixel-based spectral unmixing, a key pre-processing step for SPM, neglects valuable spatial contextual information and struggles with spectral variability, ultimately undermining SPM accuracy. Additionally, while extensively utilized, supervised spectral unmixing is labor-intensive and user-unfriendly. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fully automatic, unsupervised object-based SPM (UO-SPM) model that exploits object-scale information to reduce spectral unmixing errors and subsequently enhance SPM. Given that mixed pixels are typically located at the edges of objects (i.e., the inner part of objects is characterized by pure pixels), segmentation and morphological erosion are employed to identify pure pixels within objects and mixed pixels at the edges. More accurate endmembers are extracted from the identified pure pixels for the secondary spectral unmixing of the remaining mixed pixels. Experimental results on 10 study sites demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised object (UO)-based analysis is an effective model for enhancing both spectral unmixing and SPM. Specifically, the spectral unmixing results of UO show an average increase of 3.65 % and 1.09 % in correlation coefficient (R) compared to Fuzzy-C means (FCM) and linear spectral mixture model (LSMM)-derived coarse proportions, respectively. Moreover, the UO-derived results of four SPM methods (i.e., Hopfield neural network (HNN), Markov random field (MRF), pixel swapping (PSA) and radial basis function interpolation (RBF)) exhibit an average increase of 5.89 % and 3.04 % in overall accuracy (OA) across the four SPM methods and 10 study sites compared to the FCM and LSMM-based results, respectively. Moreover, the proportions of both mixed and pure pixels are more accurately predicted. The advantage of UO-SPM is more evident when the size of land cover objects is larger, benefiting from more accurate identification of objects."

 Volcanoes are dynamic systems whose surfaces constantly evolve. During volcanic eruptions, which can pose great threat to local communities, significant changes to the local topography occur as edifices build up and/or collapse and lava, tephra and other eruptive products are deposited. Monitoring such changes in topography is crucial to risk assessment and the prediction of further eruptive behaviour. Multistatic Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing modality particularly suited to this task as it allows for the creation of digital elevation models (DEMs) that can accurately map out three-dimensional changes in the topography, regardless of weather conditions and temporal decorrelation caused by volcanic activity. Few such missions are however currently operational. Harmony is an upcoming ESA mission that will be operating alongside Sentinel-1 and will provide multistatic InSAR capabilities for the measurement of stress and deformation across the cryosphere, the oceans and the solid earth, with the monitoring of topographic change due to volcanic eruptions being one of the specific areas of focus for the mission.In this work we demonstrate the use of high resolution bistatic interferometric data from TanDEM-X for the measurement of topographic change after recent eruptions in El Reventador, Ecuador and La Soufrière, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Additionally, we simulate data at the lower, 20 m resolution of Harmony so as to gain insights into its capability in quantifying topographic change. Our results demonstrate that Harmony’s resolution can be sufficient to resolve and measure accurately topographic change such as the emplacement of lava flows, but may be challenged in areas of steep topography where unwrapping errors can occur. The experimental results highlight the effect of acquisition pass direction with respect to local topography, the challenges arising in areas of steep topography and the importance of masking results based on estimates of precision and resolution. Finally we discuss some of the challenges, as well as implications of the Harmony mission for the future of volcano monitoring."

 Deep convective clouds (DCCs) are crucial in the Earth's energy budget. Although the abundant DCC-generated ice-phase anvil and cirrus theoretically have a warming effect, the reported observations of their cloud radiative effect (CRE) by previous studies are unexpectedly negative. Here, we find that the apparent contradiction between theory and observations resulted from neglecting the radiative contribution of background underlying clouds based on the five-years active and passive satellite observations in global. The probability of underlying clouds below the anvils is up to 2/3. They can contribute up to 70 % of the observed total shortwave cooling effect when they fully overlap with anvils. After excluding the effect of underlying clouds, most of the anvil CRE changes sign from negative to positive, increasing by over +25 W/m2, especially over land. This revelation suggests a substantially underestimated warming effect of DCC anvils and cirrus in previous observations. Also, it may imply an underestimated aerosol-driven positive radiative forcing on DCC, which has been estimated as neutral previously."

Fonte;Alberto Cardoso,Remotely geolocating static events observed by citizens using data collected by mobile devices,"•Citizens contribute observations using mobile devices to identify static events. •Our approach mitigates the uncertainty of bearing measurements. •Metrics to assess the reliability of the resulting region are provided. 
 The increasing use of smartphones has led to a surge in crowdsourcing initiatives, where citizens easily collect and upload information using advanced sensors, leveraging the collective efforts of the crowd. However, these devices face accuracy issues that must be addressed before they can be used effectively in certain applications. While most research has focused on GNSS-based positioning errors, compass-based orientation errors have received far less attention. This paper presents a novel method for determining the geolocation of static events by combining contributions from multiple volunteers located around a target event. Instead of straight lines, the method applies funnel-shaped regions to represent the azimuths toward the target location and encompasses various phases to address errors stemming from measured azimuths. These compass-based orientation errors have attracted less attention compared to GNSS-based positioning errors. The approach mitigates the uncertainty in azimuth measurements, producing a set of regions that contain the target location with different levels of confidence. Its reliability was tested in three case studies with known target locations, using metrics such as area and compactness. The results were promising, indicating that the developed approach is particularly useful in applications that do not require a high degree of accuracy (common in many crowdsourcing projects), such as the geolocation of forest fire ignitions − once in the vicinity they can be easily spotted. Implementing this approach within a system that collates citizens’ contributions can furnish invaluable information to authorities, empowering prompt action during emergency scenarios."

 Machine learning (ML) models have been widely utilized for the prediction of ground-level ozone (O3), one of the most concerning air pollutants in China. However, many of the ML models tend to underestimate high O3 levels, likely due to the class imbalance issue within the input training data. In this study, we combined data from ground monitoring stations (CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, MDA8 O3, longitude, and latitude), satellite observations (HCHO column concentration) and meteorological variables (2m temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind components, surface pressure, precipitation, evaporation, boundary layer height, and cloud cover) to assess the impact of data imbalance on prediction performance. Results demonstrated that ML models without considering data imbalance issue severely underestimate high O3 levels. We proposed a sample weighting-based support vector regression model (SVR-W) that fully considered the data imbalance. Based on data from 2026 monitoring stations across 31 provinces in China, the SVR-W model achieved an average bin-slope value between observed and predicted O3 of 0.74 ± 0.12 (s.d.), which is significantly better than commonly used ML models (0.64 ± 0.11). The average bin-RMSE of the SVR-W model was 26.7μg/m3, outperforming other models. The average recall of high O3 levels was 11–31% higher than commonly used ML models.

The samples were analyzed for 20 targeted poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by HPLC-MS/MS. The concentrations of PFAS ranged from 125 pg/m3 to 200 pg/m3 and were dominated by perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), 2-perfluorohexyl ethanoic acid (6:2 FTCA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Seasonal variations of PFAS were distinct, with the highest concentrations in winter, followed by autumn, and with lowest levels in summer. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a dry deposition model were used to apportion sources and to estimate the dry deposition fluxes of the 20 PFAS, respectively. PMF analysis indicated that, based on the annual average, paper packaging production (28.1%) and the degradation of precursor compounds and emissions from PFCA production (27.8%) were the two major sources, followed by electronic product manufacturing (24.0%) and textile production (20.1%), although there were significant differences in sources between seasons. The average annual dry deposition flux of PFAS was estimated to be 18.0 ng/m2/day. However, the wet deposition of PFAS was estimated to account for 82.2% of the total atmospheric deposition flux, suggesting it plays a more important role. Estimated daily intakes (EDI) and hazard quotients (HQ) were utilized to evaluate the risks to humans via exposure to PFAS through inhalation and were found to be insignificant (HQ ≪1).

 The Dark Target (DT) algorithm has been applied to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) and NOAA-20 satellites to extend the aerosol data record from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). The newly released VIIRS DT Version 2.0 (V2.0) dataset includes NOAA-20 aerosol products for the first time. This study provides the first evaluation of NOAA-20 VIIRS DT aerosol products, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångstrom exponent (AE), for the period 2018–2022 using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. In addition, the operational DT aerosol products from SNPP VIIRS (V2.0) and MODIS (Collection 6.1) are also used for comparison purposes. Overall, NOAA-20 AODs over land and ocean exhibit good validation metrics globally, showing comparability to MODIS products and superiority over overestimated SNPP products. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in South Africa specifically, NOAA-20 land AODs tends to display more pronounced negative biases, despite all products being underestimated. Furthermore, all ocean AE products demonstrate high correlation coefficients (>0.83) with the ground-based data, meeting the fraction of expected accuracy (>80%). Encouragingly, NOAA-20 AE product has significantly improved the persistent issue of overestimation at low-value in MODIS product, making it a more preferable choice for usage. Error analysis reveals that the performance of all three land products decreases in sparsely vegetated areas and when the solar zenith angle is small. However, NOAA-20 AOD exhibits relatively stable performance and is less affected by variations in aerosol loading, observation geometry, and surface vegetation cover. In addition, the performance of AOD and AE over ocean is significantly influenced by scattering angle and wind speed. This research is anticipated to serve as a reference for the utilization of operational VIIRS DT aerosol products and possible algorithm optimization."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120946,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了塔克拉玛干沙漠地区沙尘天气对气温日较差的影响。研究利用2002年至2013年的地面观测数据，分析了沙尘/云天条件下气温日较差的变化，以及沙尘天气的能见度与气温日较差之间的关系。结果表明，平均气温日较差与平均能见度成正比；当能见度大于6公里时，沙尘云天和晴天沙尘天气下的气温日较差差异更显著；模拟结果显示，沙尘和云对气温日较差的影响存在协同作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用地面观测数据研究沙尘和云对地表温度的影响，这与卫星遥感观测到的气溶胶和云数据密切相关，并能为改进大气环境遥感模型提供数据支持，从而更好地进行空气质量监测和气候变化研究。,"['Aerosol', 'Dust', 'Cloud', 'Radiative Transfer', 'Diurnal Temperature Range', 'Remote Sensing', 'Satellite Observation', 'Ground-based Observation', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Taklimakan Desert']",Yong Chen;Junling An;Yu Qu;Hong Wang,Dust- versus cloud-radiation impacts on the diurnal temperature range for long-lasting dust weather over the Taklimakan Desert,"•Dust and cloud radiative effects on the diurnal temperature range (DTR) in the Taklimakan Desert were analyzed. •Mean DTR was proportional to the mean visibility in dust days. •DTR difference between cloudy and cloudless dust days was more significant when visibility was >6 km. •Pure dust and cloud radiation impacts reduced DTR but their synergistic radiation impact mostly increased DTR. 
 The diurnal temperature range (DTR), determined by the difference between daily maximum and minimum air temperature, is an important index of global climate change. The dust direct radiative effect on DTR in cloudy conditions in the Taklimakan Desert (TD) area is still unclear. Based on springtime ground observation data from 2002 to 2013, the DTR variation in dust/cloudy days and the DTR-visibility relationship in dust days in TD were analyzed and summarized. The mean DTR was proportional to the mean visibility, with a slow DTR increase in the southwestern TD caused by cloud-induced radiation when visibility was 4–10 km; the DTR difference between cloudy and cloudless dust days was more significant (1.8–4.2 °C) when visibility was >6 km. The simulation of a long-lasting dust-cloud coexisting event (4 days) with the factor separation technique showed that both pure dust- and cloud-radiation impacts reduced DTR but their synergistic radiation impact mostly increased DTR in TD. Both simulated and observed results indicated that when the daily visibility of dust weather increased from 4-6 km to 6–10 km, the important pure dust impact on DTR weakened whereas the cloud impact became significant."

 This study investigates the meteorological conditions, dynamics, and microphysical characteristics of convective precipitation in Longmen, South China, during the Pre-summer Rainy Season (PRS) from 2016 to 2020, focusing on the influence of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) onset. Utilizing the ERA5 reanalysis dataset and observations from the C-band Vertical Pointing Radar (VPRC) and Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD), we analyzed 4560 Convective Precipitation Features (CPFs) and classified them into shallow convection (SC), middle convection (MC), and deep convection (DC) based on the maximum height of 35 dBZ echo-top. Key findings reveal that the onset of the SCSSM significantly enhances convective rainfall. Specifically, it increases the proportion of convective rainfall by 11 % and intensifies rainfall duration and intensity by approximately 2.2 times. Enhanced moisture convergence and stronger convective instability drive these changes. The microphysical processes are distinct across different CPF types. SCs display warm-rain processes, MCs indicate mixed-phase processes, and DCs are associated with ice-phase processes. Each type contributes uniquely to precipitation characteristics, vertical reflectivity profiles, and raindrop size distributions. These insights emphasize the SCSSM's critical role in regional precipitation patterns and provide valuable insights into the underlying processes affecting convective systems in South China, ultimately contributing to improving the capabilities of prediction in atmospheric research."

 Different types of atmospheric aerosols have different climatic effects. In this study, MERRA-2 reanalysis data of absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) products at 550 nm from 1980 to 2018 were used to analyse the long-term distribution characteristics and evolution trends of the AAOD of different chemical components globally and in 12 typical study areas. We also analysed the seasonal and interannual monthly variations of the different chemical components of AAOD. In the 40-year study period from 1980 to 2018, the maximum value of total AAOD (TAAOD) appears in the southern regions of SD (Sahara Desert), CSA (Central Southern Africa), NC (Northern China), SC (Southern China), and SEA (Southeastern Asia) (> 0.040). The highest value of dust AAOD (DUAAOD) is in SD (0.030–0.040), and the contribution rate reaches 80 %; while in SC, SEA, and AMZ, black carbon AAOD (BCAAOD) contributes 80 %–90 %. The high-value area of DUAAOD in SD-ME-NWC expands in spring, and the dust belt formed in summer results in a larger DUAAOD (> 0.050). The proportion of BCAAOD in autumn and winter is larger in the dust belt, which is another major contributor to AAOD in this region. The monthly distributions of TAAOD in SEA, CSA, NC, and AMZ are mainly affected by biomass combustion, while the DU in ME (Middle East), NWC (Northwestern China), and SD has a greater effect on AAOD, and the TAAOD in NEA (Northeastern Asia), WEU (Western Europe), EUS (Eastern United States), SC, SA (Southern Asia), and other regions is mainly affected by both DU and BC + OC (in which OC refers to organic carbon). The interannual variations of BCAAOD and OCAAOD tend to be flat before 2000, and then show an increasing trend. BCAAOD has the largest relative contribution (at about 60 %), followed by DUAAOD (at about 30 %), and then OCAAOD has the smallest contribution (at less than 10 %). From a global perspective, AAOD shows different increasing trends during 1980–2018, 1980–1992, and 1993–2005, and decreases or even completely reverses during 2006–2018. This paper provides the distribution characteristics and evolutionary trends of different chemical components of AAOD, which can improve scientific understanding of global- and regional-scale aerosols and their climatic effects."

 This study investigates the sensitivity of dust event simulation to dust emission schemes and meteorological forcing datasets in the Belt and Road regions, which we divided into three dust-affected regions: North Africa, the Middle East-central Asia, and East Asia. The Weather Research and Forecasting model with online coupled chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to simulate a dust event in the Belt and Road regions from June 15 to 20, 2016. Nine experiments were conducted using three sets of dust emission schemes (GOCART, Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport; AFWA, Air Force Weather Agency; UoC, University of Cologne) and three meteorological forcing datasets (NCEP FNL, National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final; ECMWF ERA5, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5; JMA JRA-55, Japan Meteorological Agency 55-year Reanalysis). The accuracy and applicability of the schemes and datasets were verified and evaluated by the global atmospheric reanalysis data, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), as well as observed data from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and CloudAerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The main conclusions drawn from the simulation of this dust event are as follows: In the Middle East-central Asia and East Asia, the uncertainty in the dust emission schemes is greater than that in the meteorological forcing datasets, while in North Africa, they are comparable. Among the schemes, GOCART is generally more applicable across the three dust-affected regions compared to AFWA and UoC. Additionally, JRA-55 shows a slight advantage over FNL and ERA5 in North Africa and the Middle East-central Asia. Significant differences in the spatial distribution of dust emissions are observed among experiments using different dust emission schemes, whereas slight differences are noted among those with different meteorological forcing datasets; notably, dust optical depth (DOD) distribution closely aligns with dust emissions."

 This paper presents an analysis of the dominant cloud microphysical processes of the extreme rainfall event on 7 May 2017, using a series of convective-permitting simulations. Special emphasis is placed on the microphysical processes of two extreme-rain-producing storms, yielding hourly rainfalls exceeding 120 mm. For the Huashan (HS) storm, a large amount of cloud water is produced through condensation (PRW_VCD) within the storm, and significant rainwater is generated by the collection of cloud water by raindrops (PRR_RCW). As for the Jiulong (JL) storm, warm rain microphysical processes are as same as the HS storm. Additionally, considerable rainwater is produced via the collection of graupel by raindrops (PRR_RCG), with contributions also coming from the melting of graupel (PRR_GML). It is noteworthy that there is slight evaporation of raindrops (PRV_REV) in both storms. To verify the dominant cloud microphysical processes of the extreme rainfalls, an experiment has been conducted using a simple ice microphysics scheme that covers the aforementioned dominant microphysical processes. The results indicate that extreme rainfalls are well replicated with the simple microphysics scheme, showing good agreement in spatial distribution and temporal evolution with observations and the control run. The experiment confirms largely the dominant cloud microphysical processes responsible for the extreme rainfall. Based on the results, we propose that placing special emphasis on the treatment of snow terminal velocity in the Thompson scheme would improve the performance of the scheme for heavy rainfall simulation. The findings gained here may help further understand cloud microphysical processes for localized extreme rainfall over southern China, and provide guidance for the improvement of cloud microphysics schemes."

 Regarding global warming and climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important greenhouse gases. Simulating CO2 gas at hourly/weekly time intervals and desired vertical resolution is challenging due to the coarse horizontal resolution of global models. In this study, both column-averaged CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) and vertical cross sections of CO2 mixing ratio were simulated by the Weather Research and Forecast Green House gas (WRF-GHG) model at spatial resolutions of 30 and 10 km for the Middle East region as the first domain, and Iran as the second domain. Simulations consider the primary CO2 sources (anthropogenic, biogenic, fire, and oceanic) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) dataset. XCO2 retrieved from GOSAT satellite observations was employed to evaluate the simulation results of the column-averaged CO2 concentrations in February and August 2010. The evaluations showed that the spatiotemporal variability of meteorological variables was well simulated by WRF-GHG with correlation coefficients r of 0.86–0.92, 0.67–0.75, and 0.76–0.82 for temperature, wind, and relative humidity, respectively, during February and August 2010. The evaluations also indicated that the WRF-GHG simulations outperformed the global model TM3, with mean bias error values of − 0.79 and 0.45 PPMV for WRF-GHG in February and August, respectively. The percentage contribution of net CO2 emissions from human activities in Iran was calculated as (38.33 % and 23.70 %) of the total emissions, respectively, with values of 4.4 and 0.85 kg/km2 in each month. The net emissions contributions of biogenic, fire, and oceanic sources were evaluated in February and August, with biogenic emissions contributing (31.901 % and 27.66 %), biogenic absorption contributing (24.07 % and 46.63 %), fire emissions contributing (5.7 % and 2.064 %), and oceanic emissions contributing (3.23 × 10−6 % and 2.23 × 10−6 %). Large-scale circulations and biogenic activity are responsible for the major features of the spatial and seasonal distribution of CO2 in the area. In February, column mixing ratios are higher in more northern latitudes; in August, they are higher to the south. Furthermore, the simulated vertical cross sections show high CO2 mixing ratios in the mid-lower troposphere and northerly/northeasterly advection in February; the vertical profile is inverted in August with high concentrations in the lower stratosphere associated with southwesterly advection. However, the interaction between the synoptic and sub-synoptic features with the topography determines the precise dispersion and distribution of CO2. Despite the negligible emissions in central and eastern Iran, these factors play an important role in the observed concentrations in February and August. In August, the areas between the 120-day low-level monsoon flow of Sistan in eastern Iran, and the westerlies over western/southwestern Iran and the Zagros Mountain range, interact with the heat-low in the Iranian plains and with the Arabian subtropical high. In February, the dominant winds in western Asia were west winds, with the main source of pollution coming from the northeastern regions flowing towards central and eastern Iran. The equatorward displacement of the polar jet stream and the passage of low-pressure systems from the west in winter cause a temporary reduction in CO2 concentrations."
