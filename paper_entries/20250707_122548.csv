This review highlights recent advancements and explores future prospects for their application in atmospheric chemistry. The UAV-based techniques have demonstrated excellent capabilities in characterizing the spatial distribution of gaseous pollutants using both real-time, low-cost sensors, and offline analytical methods. These platforms have also proven effective in profiling the physicochemical properties of airborne particulate matter, providing insights into its sources, chemical transformation, and environmental and climate impacts. In regard to the applications, this review underscores the diverse roles of UAVs related to atmospheric chemistry, including emission characterization (e.g., forest volatile and bioaerosol emissions), hazard assessment (e.g., wildfire and volcanic plume monitoring), and meteorology and climate research (e.g., aerosol–cloud interactions). The review also addresses key challenges in current UAV techniques, such as payload and battery limitations, regulatory constraints, propeller-induced disturbances, and explores emerging directions, such as UAVs in biosphere-atmosphere interactions and indoor air quality monitoring. Overall, UAVs are reshaping atmospheric chemistry research by providing high-resolution spatial data sets that complement traditional methods. These advancements further enhance our understanding of atmospheric processes and facilitate the development of precise and adaptable environmental monitoring strategies."

Traditional numerical weather prediction faces challenges in delivering high‐resolution nowcasts due to computational limitations. We presents CPrecNet, a deep learning model utilizing a Swin Transformer‐based architecture and high‐resolution radar data (500 m and 5 min) to improve nowcasting accuracy. Based on an observation that precipitation fields rapidly decorrelate in space, we divide the whole domain into smaller 128 × 128 km regions and train on adjacent areas, addressing network size and data scarcity issues. The model uses a residual add method to enhance rainfall prediction accuracy by focusing on the evolution of small‐scale components. Test results show that CPrecNet outperforms existing models such as Pysteps in root‐mean‐squared error (RMSE) and maintains competitive critical success index performance for various precipitation thresholds. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning based on physical considerations to enhance high‐resolution precipitation nowcasting for better decision‐making in weather‐sensitive applications."

The spatiotemporal distribution of the FAIs was nearly consistent with that of the EPBs. However, certain FAIs were located outside the EPBs. Oblique band‐like echoes extended beyond the EPBs between 12:30 and 13:30 UT, with the opposite line‐of‐sight velocities of the echo components above and below. Electrostatic reconnection between adjacent bubbles was considered a driving mechanism for the irregularities extending outward. Between 14:30 and 15:30 UT, certain FAIs were located outside the eastern wall of the bubble. The upward electric field component in the westward tilted bubble will transport the plasma from eastern wall and make the high density gradient region extend outside the bubble, and the irregularities appeared due to the polarization electric field extending outside the bubble."

The temperature at which residents turn on natural gas home heating systems (critical temperature) varies by as much as 25°C from the northern to southern United States (U.S.). Here we derive temperature dependent CO2 emissions in three U.S. cities using a dense ground‐based CO2 observation network. A Bayesian inverse modeling methodology is used to update a 1‐km emission inventory in each of the three cities. This method is able to correctly identify the critical temperature of home heating even when this information is withheld from the prior inventory, as verified by natural gas distribution data. Variance in regional heating practices has not been previously demonstrated with ground‐based networks of CO2 observations. This result provides evidence that a Bayesian inverse modeling framework is sensitive to emissions of the home heating sector."

Nevertheless, the evolution and the ion dynamics inside SLAMS are still unclear. In this study, we performed a superposed analysis of SLAMS near the Earth's bow shock to investigate their properties and internal ion dynamics throughout their evolution. Our results support previously summarized evolutionary trends of SLAMS. Through the wave‐particle interaction, the kinetic energy of solar wind ions is efficiently converted into thermal energy and magnetic field amplification. This interaction gradually transforms the ion distribution within SLAMS, leading to a magnetosheath‐like state upstream of the bow shock inside the SLAMS. The solar wind ion resonance is crucial for the SLAMS development. Our study provides new insights into the formation and energy conversion of the collisionless shock."

However, how these processes vary on orbital‐millennial timescales remains poorly understood. Here, we present high‐resolution proxy data and model simulations on the variability of biological productivity and deep water circulation for the abyssal northwestern Pacific Ocean spanning 20–60 kyr. We found that enhanced surface productivity increased during Heinrich Stadials (HS) and long term, caused by intensified westerly winds and associated dust fertilization, implying CO2 extraction from the atmosphere and increased nutrient supply to the euphotic zone. A similar increase in productivity for the Southern Ocean during Heinrich events implies enhanced upwelling and exhalation of CO2 to the atmosphere, indicative for an interhemispheric carbon cycle seesaw on millennial time scales. However, the longer‐term global cooling demonstrates that deep ocean carbon storage and degassing was predominantly modulated by the North Pacific Ocean."

This study investigates the Iceland‐Faroe Ridge (IFR), a key boundary between the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, southeast of Iceland. A warming of surface waters of 1° ${}^{\circ}$C over the past 40 years in the region has shifted thermal structures, potentially impacting the upper cell of the global thermohaline circulation. Using newly available high‐resolution SWOT altimetry and numerical modeling, we directly observe mesoscale turbulence atop the IFR for the first time and quantify its role in driving significant vertical heat fluxes. This turbulence provides a pathway for heat transfer from warming surface waters to the deep Iceland‐Scotland Overflow Water, likely contributing to its observed warming over the past four decades. These findings highlight the critical role of mesoscale dynamics in heat redistribution and the need for enhanced monitoring in this climatically sensitive region."

As a result, the soil moisture modulates the airborne dust abundance, which in turn modulates the Earth's radiative balance. The importance of these soil moisture modulations on the radiative balance is unknown, however. Herein we use WRF‐Chem simulations to quantify the role of soil moisture modulations on the dust direct radiative effect. We focus on the contiguous U.S. due to the presence of important dust sources and good observational networks. Our results, based on the year of 2015, used a range of dust emissions and positive/negative soil moisture anomalies of ±25% and reveal a non‐negligible impact of around 15% in the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere and surface, with a smaller impact in the atmosphere."

Although previous research suggests ARs will widen with global warming, a precise response has been muddled by the large sensitivity of width to a diverse set of AR detection techniques (ARDTs). Here, we propose a methodology that removes the influence of the ARDT by modeling AR‐integrated vapor transport (IVT) profiles as idealized exponential curves with free parameters given by background IVT, intensity above background IVT, and profile width. Notably, our definition for AR profile width does not include any explicit numerical thresholds, relative or absolute, for IVT. We apply our approach to a series of idealized aquaplanet experiments, first with a baseline sea surface temperature (SST) distribution, and then with +2K, +4K, and +6K uniform warming, so as to determine the contributions of each free parameter to AR width. We also apply our approach to high‐resolution atmosphere‐only models forced with SSTs modified to preserve historical variability but following projected warming over 2016–2050. Our results show that contributions to impacts‐relevant AR widening comes primarily from enhancements in background IVT and AR intensity, as opposed to from dynamic width changes."

Observation‐based forcing estimates have been typically given more weight as they do not rely on assumptions and parameterizations in models. Traditional estimation of direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) based on observation is realized by regressing the observed radiative fluxes against aerosol optical depth (AOD). Here we improve this procedure by considering more aerosol parameters such as single scattering albedo (SSA) and adopting a machine learning‐based method (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to establish the relationship between top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes and aerosol properties. Our approach gives a global mean DARF of −0.80 ± 0.73 W/m2 under clear sky, which largely agrees with previously reported results. The DARF uncertainty includes the impact of measurement errors and the XGBoost model, in which AOD and SSA uncertainties cause ∼0.66 and ∼0.14 W/m2 changes in the DARF respectively."

A global 60‐3 km variable‐resolution mesh with a refined region centered over eastern China is applied in this study. The GRIST with the conventional new Tiedtke (GRIST‐NTDK) convection parameterization scheme (CPS), the scale‐aware NTDK CPS (GRIST‐SAT), and the explicit convection (GRIST‐noCPS) setups are intercompared. GRIST‐noCPS forecasts are also compared with those from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, using equivalent configurations (WRF‐noCPS) over the refined region. Compared to the WRF‐noCPS experiment, both spatial distributions and statistical metrics reveal that the GRIST‐NTDK, GRIST‐SAT, and GRIST‐noCPS experiments can capture the observed rainfall for a few days, although with some overestimation. Most of the rainfall overestimation from GRIST experiments is due to nocturnal rainfall bias, which is associated with excessive water vapor transport in the lower troposphere. Relative to GRIST‐NTDK and GRIST‐SAT, GRIST‐noCPS could somewhat alleviate the pressure gradients and southerly winds bias, favoring less severe overestimation. Although scale‐aware configurations of CPS can reduce light rainfall and increase heavy rainfall over the refined region to some degree, there are still some gaps between the GRIST‐SAT and observations in terms of rainfall frequencies. In contrast, GRIST‐noCPS can mitigate the widespread light rain, as exhibited in GRIST‐NTDK and GRIST‐SAT, resulting in improved quantitative precipitation forecast skills. Notably, the performances of GRIST over the refined region demonstrate its potential to overcome the time limit of regional models, such as WRF, at extended forecasting periods."

Despite extensive research on the formation of OSs, the origins of over 50% of OSs mass in ambient aerosols remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that thiophenes, emitted from multiple anthropogenic sources (e.g., coke fuel production) and contributing ∼44 Gg of sulfur emissions annually, are previously unrecognized potential OSs precursors in the urban atmosphere. For instance, C5H8O5S and C4H6O5S were previously detected in the urban atmosphere but their origins were unknown. Our study identified these two OSs as products of the nighttime oxidation of 2‐methylthiophene, suggesting that 2‐methylthiophene may act as a potential precursor for C5H8O5S and C4H6O5S in ambient aerosols. Both 2‐methylthiophene and benzothiophene can lead to the formation of OSs that were solely attributed to the photooxidation of isoprene and naphthalenes in prior field studies (e.g., C5H8O7S and C7H6O4S). We highlight that the nighttime oxidation of thiophenes can directly produce gaseous oxygenated organosulfur compounds without external sulfur (e.g., sulfate), which is a previously unrecognized pathway that could contribute to the OSs formation in urban atmospheric aerosols."

But, emissions from urban areas are poorly characterized except in the few cities with robust measurement infrastructure. Satellite measurements offer a means for monitoring urban emissions. We use colocated measurements of methane (CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$) and carbon monoxide (CO) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO‐2/3) to calculate CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$:CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$, CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$:CO, and CO:CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ enhancement ratios over 103 cities. We compare our enhancement ratios to those derived from ground‐based instruments in Los Angeles and find good agreement. Then, we combine our enhancement ratios with CO and CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ inventories to calculate CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ emissions and find good agreement with estimates from past studies. Finally, we compare our satellite‐based enhancement ratios to those computed from the bottom‐up globally gridded emission inventories, and we find significant differences between them. Combining results from the three enhancement ratios, we find EDGARv8 to best represent CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ emissions in urban areas with mean errors of 34% compared to CAMS‐GLOB‐ANTv6.2 (based on EDGARv6.1), and CEDSv2021 with mean errors of 43% and 49%, respectively. These differences are largely driven by EDGARv8 changes in South‐Central and East Asia. We also find that EDGARv8 and HTAPv3 underestimate CO emissions by a factor of 2–5 for cities in Iran, Turkmenistan, and Argentina. Finally, we find that CO emissions are overestimated in some cities in Europe by a factor of ∼ ${\sim} $2."

However, previous studies usually attributed this effect to human activities, and ignored the effect of climate changes, namely chain transmission effects via catchment characteristic alterations. This study proposes a novel assessment approach of runoff change to disentangle both direct and chain transmission effects by adopting nonlinear relationships between catchment characteristic parameters and multiple impact factors into the Budyko framework. Eight catchments in the arid and semi‐arid, semi‐humid, and humid climatic zones are selected as our study area. Results show that runoff in most catchments decreases, while catchment characteristic parameters increase, with slopes of −2.44 to 3.79 mm/year and −0.003 to 0.017/year, respectively. It indicates that more precipitation evaporates than that contributing to runoff due to the catchment characteristic alterations. These changes are the most significant in the semi‐humid zone, followed by those in the arid and semi‐arid zone. Annual temperature and precipitation, gross domestic product, industrial water use, and population are the main impact factors. The contributions of human activities to runoff changes are usually the largest (i.e., −62.9% to 72.0%), followed by the direct effects of climate change (i.e., −32.6% to 88.0%). The chain transmission effects of climate change are also nonnegligible, with the contributions of −38.3% to 8.2%, particularly in the semi‐humid zone. Our study improves the traditional Budyko‐based framework for attributing runoff changes and provides scientific support for understanding hydrological cycle change mechanisms in climate‐sensitive areas."

Ejecta accumulation facilitated glass formation, while small impacts induced quartz metamorphism, mixing mature basaltic soil with fresh ejecta, and leading to the fine-grained CE-6 soil. These findings provide new insights into the origin of SPA mafic anomalies and farside mare soil evolution.

 Urban street trees account for a significant fraction of trees in urban areas, yet the amount and changes of their carbon stocks remain largely unexamined. This study introduces a framework utilizing a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-camera fusion-based Mobile Mapping System (MMS) to estimate carbon stocks in individual street trees regularly. This system allows repetitive and simultaneous collection of species information and structural parameters on a city-wide scale, enabling the estimation of carbon stock and its change. The framework comprises two principal components: the detection of individual street trees and the estimation of their respective carbon stocks. To detect individual street trees, we initially employed image-based deep learning model to diminish the effort needed in constructing point cloud training data and designing a universal rule applicable to complex and diverse urban streetscapes. In the carbon stock estimation phase, we used species-specific allometric equations based on species information derived from YOLOv3 and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurements from trunk point cloud circle fitting. The proposed individual street tree detection method achieved an F1-score of 81.9 %, precision of 86.3 %, and recall of 78.5 % in city-scale experiments. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error for the estimates of DBH and tree height (H) was 3.2 cm (11.4 %) and 1.8 m (18.3 %), respectively. Repeated acquisitions between two years revealed the median change of H, DBH, and carbon stock as 0.4 m yr−1, 1.4 cm yr−1, and 27.1 kgC yr−1, respectively. Applying our method in most vehicle accessible streets in Suwon, Republic of Korea, we mapped 34,124 street trees, revealing a total carbon stock of 6.18 GgC. These results underscore the accuracy and scalability of the framework, highlighting its potential to facilitate efficient urban carbon management."

 Isoprene, primarily emitted by terrestrial plants, is the most abundant non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) in the atmosphere, playing a critical role in regulating tropospheric ozone levels and contributing to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. However, ground-based observations that capture large-scale spatial patterns of forest isoprene emissions across extensive regions remain limited. Here using the Vocus mobile laboratory, we conducted mobile measurements of isoprene along a east-west transect (∼2000 km) across the subtropical forest region of China. The results show significant spatial heterogeneity in isoprene concentrations, with an average concentration of 209.4 ± 66.7 pptv. In particular, the isoprene concentration in the Guizhou forests (primarily coniferous) was 155.6 ± 51.0 pptv, approximately 24.7 % lower than the 206.7 ± 37.7 pptv observed in the Jiangnan forests (dominated by subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests with widespread bamboo). This suggests that vegetation type significantly influences the intensity of forest isoprene emissions. Interestingly, in the highly industrialized Zhejiang region, the isoprene concentration (289.7 ± 51.0 pptv) was 46.3 % and 28.7 % higher than those in the Guizhou and Jiangnan forests, respectively. This indicates that anthropogenic emissions are likely a significant contributor to the elevated isoprene concentrations in the region. Therefore, in regions with significant human activities, it is essential to consider the influence of anthropogenic emissions on isoprene in addition to natural sources."

 Future climate projections of global climate models (GCMs) are widely used for climate change impact assessments. However, increasing available GCMs and computational constraints necessitate using a selected subset for such applications. The selection of the GCM subset is a critical step in climate change impact assessment, given the computational constraints and inherent uncertainties associated with climate projections. This review comprehensively evaluates existing GCM evaluation and selection methods, focusing on past performance, future projections, and hybrid approaches. It highlights the challenges in selecting GCMs due to varying resolutions, interpolation techniques, reference datasets, and the sensitivity of evaluation metrics. Traditional performance-based methods emphasize replicating historical climate, while envelope and advanced hybrid approaches integrate future projection consistency and past performance to address uncertainties. The review underscores the growing importance of multi-model ensembles (MMEs) in reducing projection uncertainties and enhancing the reliability of climate simulations. Advanced statistical techniques, including hierarchical clustering and divergence analysis, offer promising tools for addressing structural uncertainties and improving model evaluation. The study identifies key gaps, such as the need for standardized metrics, the integration of extreme event simulations, and the development of region-specific selection frameworks. Future research directions include leveraging machine learning techniques, expanding reference datasets, and incorporating stakeholder-driven criteria to refine GCM selection processes. By addressing these challenges, the study aims to enhance the robustness and applicability of GCM selection methodologies, contributing to more reliable climate projections and informed decision-making in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies."
