 The continuous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean leads to ocean acidification, which is an ongoing threat to marine ecosystem. The ocean acidification rate has been globally documented in the surface ocean, but this information is limited below the surface. Here, we present a monthly 4D 1°×1° gridded product of global seawater pH on the total scale and at in situ temperature (without standardization to 25 °C), derived from a machine learning algorithm trained on pH observations from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP). The proposed pH product covers the years from 1992 to 2020 and depths from the surface to 2 km on 41 levels. A three-step machine-learning-based algorithm was used to construct the pH product, incorporating region division via a self-organizing map neural network, predictor selection via the stepwise regression algorithm that adds and removes variables from network inputs based on their contribution to reducing reconstruction errors, and nonlinear relationship regression by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). The performance of the machine learning algorithm was validated using real observations with a cross-validation method, in which four repeating iterations were carried out with each iteration utilizing a different 25 % subset of observations for validation and the complementary 75 % subset for training. The proposed pH product is evaluated using comparisons to time-series observations and the GLODAP pH climatology. The overall root-mean-square error between the FFNN-reconstructed pH and the GLODAP measurements is 0.028, ranging from 0.044 at the surface to 0.013 at 2000 m.

Our dataset shows that trade-related emissions account for 31 % of global deforestation emissions, with high-income countries driving most of the emissions. This research highlights the importance of addressing consumption patterns in climate change strategies and offers valuable data to inform global policy and emission reduction efforts. 
 The consumption-based carbon emissions dataset for deforestation is essential for developing effective emission reduction policies by offering an alternative perspective. Although previous studies have provided national-scale data on deforestation emission footprints, the global scale data with detailed and continuous spatial information is still lacking. Here, we created a global consumption-based carbon emissions gridded dataset for deforestation at a 1 km resolution for 2001–2015, integrating spatial data on road networks, deforestation, and forest carbon fluxes with country-level statistics on global trade. Our dataset reveals that trade-related carbon emissions induced by deforestation were 25.3 Gt CO2e, constituting 31.0 % of global carbon emissions due to deforestation. Additionally, the top 20 countries are responsible for most of the consumption-based carbon emissions which contribute to over 80 % of the global total. While high-income countries are responsible for 68.8 % of hidden deforestation emissions in trade, the ones in lower-income counties are rising due to the notable consumption in higher-income areas. This new dataset help addresses the previous data gap in consumption-based global deforestation emissions, aiding the formulation of consumer-side emission reduction strategies and expanding the approaches for mitigating carbon emissions due to anthropogenic activities.

This tool is crucial for farmers, environmental managers, and policymakers to monitor and protect plant life, ensuring better management of natural resources and agricultural productivity. 
 Systematic monitoring and assessment of vegetation dynamics and changes are essential for informing environmental management and conservation strategies. Addressing this need, our study introduces a pioneering procedure to generate a database of vegetation indices that provides semi-monthly updates from 1981 to the present at a 1.1 km spatial resolution, focusing on the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. This database enables near-real-time monitoring and analysis of vegetation anomalies. The methodology developed combines harmonized historical satellite imagery from AVHRR, MODIS, and VIIRS sensors. The database's performance was assessed, demonstrating highly accurate and consistent harmonization of NDVI data over time. Notably, the database is adept at identifying temporal variability and trends in vegetation activity and detecting disturbances caused by fire and other phenomena. This work not only advances our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the region but also serves as a crucial tool for policymakers, environmental managers, and agricultural stakeholders. By providing near-real-time updates and using indices to monitor vegetation anomalies, the data allows for comparisons across seasons and vegetation types.

The database provides empirical evidence for oligotrophication responses with a spatial and temporal coverage exceeding previous efforts. 
 Reversed eutrophication, called oligotrophication, has widely been documented globally over the last 30 years in rivers, lakes, and estuaries. However, the absence of a comprehensive and harmonized dataset has hindered a deeper understanding of its ecological consequences. To address this data gap, we developed the OLIGOTREND database, which contains multi-decadal timeseries of chlorophyll-a, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and related physicochemical parameters, totalling 4.3 million observations. These data originate from 1,894 unique monitoring sites, mainly located in high-income countries, and across estuaries (n = 238), lakes (687), and rivers (969). Each location is associated to catchment and hydroclimatic attributes. Trend and breakpoint analyses were applied to all timeseries. Chlorophyll-a showed temporally variable and ecosystem-specific responses to nutrient declines with an overall declining trend for 18 % of the time series, contrasting greatly with a majority of declining trends for nutrient concentrations. We harmonized the database to ensure reproducibility, ease of access, and support future updates and contributions.

Our study presents an eight-year inventory (2016–2023) of 2918 lakes, mapping their size, abundance, and surface water temperature. This openly available dataset supports future research on sea level projections, lake-driven glacier melting, and sustainable resource planning, including hydropower development under Greenland's climate commitments. 
 The Greenland Ice Sheet and its surrounding peripheral glaciers and ice caps are projected to be the largest cryospheric contributor to sea level rise in the next century. While glacial meltwater is typically assumed to flow directly into the ocean, ice-marginal lakes temporarily store a portion of this runoff, influencing glacier dynamics, lacustrine-driven ablation, ecosystems, and downstream hydrology. The size, abundance and dynamics of ice-marginal lakes are expected to change in the future. However, they remain under-represented in projections of sea level change and glacier mass loss. Here, we provide eight annual records across Greenland of lake abundance, lake surface extents, and surface water temperature estimates from 2016 to 2023. The dataset catalogs 2918 automatically classified ice-marginal lakes and reveals their evolving conditions over time. Our dataset fills critical gaps in understanding Greenland’s terrestrial water storage and its implications for sea level change projections, providing a first step toward quantifying meltwater storage at ice margins. Equally important, it supports assessments of ice sheet and glacier dynamics, such as lacustrine-driven ablation, and Arctic ecological studies of lake changes impacting ecosystems. The inventory series will also aid environmental management and hydropower planning aligned with Greenland’s proposed commitments under the Paris Agreement.

As primary objective, we adopt a method to explain the AI used and investigate the plausibility of learned patterns. We find that plausible patterns are learned for both TCs and ARs. Hence, the chosen method is very useful for gaining confidence in the AI-based detection of atmospheric features. 
 Detection of atmospheric features in gridded datasets from numerical simulation models is typically done by means of rule-based algorithms. Recently, the feasibility of learning feature detection tasks using supervised learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been demonstrated. This approach corresponds to semantic segmentation tasks widely investigated in computer vision. However, while in recent studies the performance of CNNs was shown to be comparable to human experts, CNNs are largely treated as a “black box”, and it remains unclear whether they learn the features for physically plausible reasons. Here we build on the recently published “ClimateNet” dataset that contains features of tropical cyclones (TCs) and atmospheric rivers (ARs) as detected by human experts. We adapt the explainable artificial intelligence technique “Layer-wise Relevance Propagation” (LRP) to the semantic segmentation task and investigate which input information CNNs with the Context-Guided Network (CGNet) and U-Net architectures use for feature detection. We find that both CNNs indeed consider plausible patterns in the input fields of atmospheric variables. For instance, relevant patterns include point-shaped extrema in vertically integrated precipitable water (TMQ) and circular wind motion for TCs. For ARs, relevant patterns include elongated bands of high TMQ and eastward winds. Such results help to build trust in the CNN approach. We also demonstrate application of the approach for finding the most relevant input variables (TMQ is found to be most relevant, while surface pressure is rather irrelevant) and evaluating detection robustness when changing the input domain (a CNN trained on global data can also be used for a regional domain, but only partially contained features will likely not be detected). However, LRP in its current form cannot explain shape information used by the CNNs, although our findings suggest that the CNNs make use of both input values and the shape of patterns in the input fields. Also, care needs to be taken regarding the normalization of input values, as LRP cannot explain the contribution of bias neurons, accounting for inputs close to zero. These shortcomings need to be addressed by future work to obtain a more complete explanation of CNNs for geoscientific feature detection."

It provides a GUI and a wide range of options, including a spatial downscaling of climate data. We apply CropSuite to 48 staple and opportunity crops at a 1 km spatial resolution in Africa. We find that climate variability significantly impacts suitable areas but also affects optimal sowing dates and multiple cropping potential. The results provide valuable information for climate impact assessments, adaptation, and land-use planning. 
 Increasing demand for agricultural land resources and changing climate conditions require strategic land-use planning and the development of adaptation strategies. Therefore, information about the suitability of agricultural land is a prerequisite. Current suitability approaches often focus on single crops, can only be applied regionally, and usually neglect the impact of climate variability on crop suitability. Here, we introduce CropSuite, a new, comprehensive, and easy-to-use crop suitability model that allows us to overcome these shortcomings. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and a wide range of pre- and postprocessing options, including a tool for data analysis, which allows users to easily apply the model and analyze the results. Further, it includes a spatial downscaling approach to climate data, which enables crop suitability analysis at very high spatial resolution. CropSuite uses a fuzzy-logic approach and is based on the assumption of Liebig's law of the minimum. An expandable number of environmental and socioeconomic factors that affect crop suitability can be flexibly integrated into CropSuite by determining membership functions. CropSuite allows for the consideration of irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems, vernalization requirements for winter crops, lethal temperature thresholds, photoperiodic sensitivity, and several other limitations for crop growth. The model endogenously calculates and outputs climate, soil, and crop suitability, the optimal sowing and harvest dates, the potential for multiple cropping, the (most-)limiting factor(s), and the recurrence rate of potential crop failure according to the inter-annual climate variability.In this study, we apply CropSuite to 48 crops at a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec (1 km at the Equator) for Africa. Thereby, we consider regionally important staple and cash crops that are usually understudied, such as coffee, cassava, banana, oil palm, cocoa, cowpea, groundnuts, mango, millet, papaya, rubber, sesame, sorghum, sugar cane, tobacco, and yam. We find that the consideration of climate variability when calculating crop suitability makes a significant difference to suitable areas but also affects optimal sowing dates and multiple cropping potentials. The most vulnerable regions for climate variability are identified in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa, and the Maghreb countries. The results provide valuable crop-specific information that can be further used for climate impact assessments, adaptation, and land-use planning at the global, regional, or local scale. CropSuite is provided as open-source code and could be of interest for model developers, scientists, and a wide range of potential users and stakeholders, such as farmers, companies, governmental organizations (GOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)."

In order to understand the impacts and consequences of climate interventions such as stratospheric aerosol injection, complex models are often necessary. We use a case study to illustrate how we can understand the inner workings of a complex model. We present this technique as an exploratory tool that can be used to quickly discover and assess relationships in complex climate data. 
 Machine learning (ML) models are commonly used to generate predictions, but these models can also support the discovery of new science. Generating accurate predictions necessitates that a model captures the structure of the underlying data. If the structure is properly extracted, ML could be a useful exploratory and evidential tool. In this paper, we present a case study that demonstrates the use of ML for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the climate space. We apply the ML explainability method of spatiotemporal zeroed feature importance (stZFI) to understand how climate-variable associations evolve over space and time. Our analyses focus on data from ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) which provide data on different climate states and conditions. We elect to work with ESM ensembles since they allow us to compare feature importance across alternative scenarios not available with observed data. The ensembles also account for natural variability so that we can distinguish between signal and noise due to natural climate variability when computing feature importance. The use of perturbed initial condition ensembles introduces variability mimicking the natural variability in the atmosphere; thus the signals emerging using feature importance (FI) can be evaluated against the natural variability in the climate system. For our analyses, we consider the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which was a large stratospheric aerosol injection. We explore the climate pathway associated with the eruption from aerosols to radiation to temperature at both the near-surface and stratospheric levels. In addition to applying the method to data generated from two different ESMs, we apply stZFI to reanalysis data to compare the associations identified by stZFI. We show how stZFI tracks the importance of aerosol optical depth over time on forecasting temperatures. This case study illustrates usefulness of an ML tool (stZFI) for EDA on a well-studied climate exemplar."

In Indianapolis, Indiana, precipitation events of ≥6 mm result in up to 90 sewage overflow events annually. As blow flies visit organic wastes that include fecal material, we hypothesized that flies act as vectors of enteric pathogens present in wastewater from overflow events. Blow flies were collected over a 2 year period at six urban parks in Indianapolis, located varying distances from the nearest overflow location. Fly gut DNA was extracted from 997 flies, followed by human fecal source tracking via mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Sixty-eight blow flies collected near an overflow point underwent qPCR screening for 23 enteric pathogen gene markers. Compared to flies caught within 1 km of the nearest combined sewer overflow, flies caught further away were associated with a 68% reduction (RR = 0.32) in the risk of detecting human mitochondrial DNA. A majority of flies (53%, 36/68) tested positive for ≥1 enteric pathogen-associated gene.

Specifically, we identify eight fault slip events from radar interferometry, none of which are reported in seismic catalogs. Except for four typical aseismic creep events, two events represent earthquakes whose waveforms were obscured within the coda waves of the mainshocks. Notably, we find two silent events that did not radiate discernible high‐frequency seismic energy nor produce local aftershocks but did exhibit high stress drops of 4–6 MPa, similar to regular earthquakes. These two “silent” events likely represent a new fault slip mode positioned between regular earthquakes and SSEs. The identification of these diverse shallow slip events, which are missed in seismic catalogs, calls for reevaluation of faulting mechanisms, the nature of static/dynamic triggering effects, and seismic hazard assessments."

The increasing trends in extreme precipitation in China in warm season related to changes in aerosols and greenhouse gases (GHGs) are investigated using observations, reanalysis data and model simulations. A significant accelerating increase in extreme precipitation occurred around 2010, with the trend in accumulated extreme rainfall amount (R95pTOT) increasing from 2.88 mm per decade during 2000–2010 to 22.88 mm per decade during 2010–2023. The sudden acceleration of the increasing extreme precipitation is largely attributed to the reverse in aerosol trends associated with China’s clean air actions, which affects extreme precipitation through perturbing cloud microphysics and atmospheric dynamics, accounting for half of the change in R95pTOT trends. Future aerosol reduction to achieve carbon neutrality is shown to continue to intensify the extreme precipitation, which overweighs the effect induced by GHGs, highlighting the importance of aerosol changes in modulating future climate and weather extremes."

The parameter used to describe their resistance to propagation, fracture energy, remains controversial. Here, we show how different stress biaxiality levels experienced by dikes can directly affect the micromechanisms of crack propagation in rocks, consequently impacting fracture energy. We performed controlled tensile crack propagation experiments under opposite stress biaxialities. We connect fracture energy variations monitored through a compliance‐based method to crack microstructures observed on post‐mortem specimens. Microscopy techniques showed that biaxial tension generates intricate microstructures driven by topological instabilities, such as deflections and branches, to circumnavigate tougher grains. This yields a higher fracture energy, that we attribute to front roughening and bridging mechanisms due to front fragmentation. Bridging toughening is gradual and increase with crack size. This hints at the existence of a scale dependency of fracture energy of dikes also experiencing biaxial tension."
10.1029/2024GL112480,True,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了过去五十年中国沿海地区海陆风频率增加的现象。论文使用统一的方法，基于格点再分析数据集识别海陆风日，并分析了其趋势、影响因素以及对空气污染物再循环的影响。研究发现，中国沿海地区的海陆风日有所增加，主要驱动因素包括海陆温差增大、太阳辐射增加和背景风减弱。研究还指出，海陆风频率的增加会加剧空气污染物的累积，对沿海地区的空气质量管理构成挑战。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究结果与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感数据可以用于监测海陆温差、太阳辐射、风场以及空气污染物的浓度和分布，从而验证和补充该研究的结论。,"['air quality', 'air pollutant recirculation', 'sea-land breeze', 'coastal meteorology', 'temperature contrast', 'solar radiation', 'background winds']",Yuxuan Huang;Shuai Li;Yuqi Zhu;Yiming Liu;Yingying Hong;Xiaoyang Chen;Wenjing Deng;Xinyu Xi;Xiao Lu;Qi Fan,Increasing Sea‐Land Breeze Frequencies Over Coastal Areas of China in the Past Five Decades,"Sea‐land breeze (SLB) is particularly important in coastal regions and can affect weather conditions and air quality. However, previous research on SLB has predominantly focused on specific locations, with varying methodologies used to identify SLB days (SLBDs), leading to a limited understanding of long‐term SLB trends across extensive coastal areas. Here, a unified method for gridded reanalysis dataset to identify SLBDs is proposed for the first time, and the trend, influencing factors, and effects on air pollutant recirculation over coastal China are explored. The results demonstrate that SLBDs have increased in 70% of China's coastal areas in the past five decades. Key driving factors include the growing temperature contrast between land and sea, increasing solar radiation, and the weakening background winds. The study suggests that the increasing SLB frequency will enhance air pollutant accumulations, making it challenging to manage air quality effectively in these coastal areas."

 As next-generation display technologies, eco-friendly colloidal quantum dot light-emitting diodes have drawn great attention due to their excellent luminescence properties, along with their rapid development. However, practical applications of eco-friendly quantum dot light-emitting device remain challenging, primarily due to the inferior performance of green device, which still lag behind their red and blue counterparts. Herein, we present efficient green device based on interfacial potential-graded ZnSeTe quantum dots. Our findings show that this potential-graded structure alleviates interfacial lattice mismatch and strain, reducing structural deformation and misfit defects. The smoothed interfacial potential suppresses the nonradiative recombination processes, particularly Auger recombination revealed by excitation-intensity dependent ultrafast transient absorption kinetics. Consequently, the interfacial potential-graded quantum dots demonstrate highly efficient green quantum dot light-emitting diodes, with a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.7% at 520 nm and a corresponding current efficiency of 75.7 cd A−1.

Here, authors show the long-lasting impact of drinking on dopamine transmission and that altered function is not explained by upstream gene transcription. 
 Alcohol use disorder is marked by disrupted behavioral and emotional states which persist into abstinence. The enduring synaptic alterations that remain despite the absence of alcohol are of interest for interventions to prevent relapse. Here, 28 male rhesus macaques underwent over 20 months of alcohol drinking interspersed with three 30-day forced abstinence periods. After the last abstinence period, we paired direct sub-second dopamine monitoring via ex vivo voltammetry in nucleus accumbens core with RNA-sequencing of the ventral tegmental area. We found persistent augmentation of dopamine transporter function, kappa opioid receptor sensitivity, and putative dynorphin release – all inhibitory regulators which act to decrease extracellular dopamine. Surprisingly, though transcript expression was not altered, the relationship between gene expression and functional readouts of these encoded proteins was highly dynamic and altered by drinking history. These results outline the long-lasting synaptic impact of alcohol use and suggest that assessment of transcript-function relationships is critical for the rational design of precision therapeutics.

 The post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a highly debilitating and persistent postinfectious syndrome that affects millions of people worldwide and has no effective treatment. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has the potential to improve the PCC by clearing the peripheral soluble pro-inflammatory immune milieu derived from acute or persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 El Niño induced equatorial precipitation centers shift to different longitudinal positions during Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP) El Niño events, resulting in distinct global climate responses. However, it remains unexplored how EP and CP El Niño forced precipitation changes may differ under global warming. Here, we find that the longitudinal separation of precipitation centers in EP and CP El Niño events is projected to increase under global warming. Specifically, the precipitation anomalies during EP El Niño events will shift further eastward, while those during CP El Niño will intensify in their original positions. This change is attributed to the amplified equatorial thermocline feedback as the mean thermocline shoals. A more meridionally confined El Niño structure under global warming generates extra boundary layer moisture convergence in situ. This intensifies the precipitation anomalies in CP El Niño but shifts the precipitation center eastward towards the maximum sea surface temperature anomaly center in EP El Niño. The projected increased longitudinal separation of precipitation centers suggests that the differences in global climate impacts between EP and CP El Niño events will intensify under global warming."

 We examine mesoscale convective organisation in the tropical western Pacific using a multivariate analysis of column humidity, precipitation and sea surface temperature (SST) observations. We demonstrate that in boreal summer and autumn, convection remains spatially random despite radiative-feedbacks acting to aggregate convection, which we attribute to the high density of convective moisture sources and the role of wind shear. Instead, in winter and spring, a weak meridional SST gradient exists and convection is usually clustered over the regions of warmer SSTs, with significant meridional humidity gradients. However, this is sporadically interrupted by episodes of convection migration to the coldest SSTs and limited spatial humidity variance.

 Understanding the relationship between tropical heavy rainfall and large-scale circulation provides valuable insights for improving the climate models. Here we use Gaussian Mixture Model to identify two distinct types of heavy rainfall over the tropical Pacific, “strong deep convection” and “moderately strong deep convection,” using satellite-borne precipitation radar measurements. They differ in two typical climatological deep convection-related rainfall modes between the western and eastern Pacific regions. The occurrence frequency of moderately strong deep convection is significantly different between the western and eastern Pacific, potentially linked to the Walker circulation. The enhanced Walker circulation appears to weaken the local Hadley circulation, thereby reducing strong deep convective activity in the eastern Pacific. This increases moderately heavy rainfall and decreases diabatic heating, which can affect global climate. We propose incorporating the close link between large-scale Walker circulation and mesoscale heavy convective rainfall into the current climate models. Tropical Pacific experiences two types of heavy rainfall including strong deep convection and moderately strong deep convection, which vary by region and are linked to the Walker circulation, according to satellite-borne precipitation radar measurements."

 The impact of intensified climate change driven by global warming on the stocks and dynamics of soil organic carbon in Antarctica is currently uncertain. Our objective with this was evaluate the potential repercussions of global warming on soil organic carbon under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Employing a methodology that integrates soil field data, machine learning, and projections of future climate change scenarios for the Maritime and Peninsular Antarctic ice-free areas, we focus on predicting the soil organic carbon within the 0–30 cm soil layer. To achieve this, we utilized one of the largest soil databases of Antarctica, which contains data from 2800 observation sites. In our predictive modeling of SOC stocks, we used relief data and, bioclimatic variables (from Chelsa database) as predictor variables, primarily focusing on temperature, precipitation, and net primary production. The prediction performance of the soil organic carbon stocks model, as measured by concordance correlation coefficient, was 0.52 for the 0-5 cm soil depth, 0.56 for the 5-15 cm depth, and 0.46 for the 15-30 cm depth. Our model reveal that the effects of climate change, primarily changes in temperature and precipitation, are going to increase in soil organic carbon stock (359 ± 146 Mg to 686 ± 197 Mg), indicating that ice-free regions of Maritime and Peninsular Antarctica will tend to function as a carbon sink. However, the magnitude of the soil carbon sink is contingent upon the existing soil organic carbon content and soil depth. The estimated soil organic carbon stocks are controlled mainly by temperature and precipitation, which are interconnected with net primary productivity. Soil carbon storage in the upper layers of ice-free areas of Antarctica may increase significantly under higher global temperatures, according to analyses of soil samples combined with predictive modelling."

 To project damages from climate change, researchers often pair empirical weather-damage relationships with high-resolution projections of future weather. Weather projections vary across scenarios, climate models, and how climate model output is downscaled to impact-relevant resolutions. Due to the nonlinear and cumulative nature of the relationship between weather and economic output, even small differences among downscaled climate projections could lead to large differences in projected damages. However, damage projections typically employ weather projections derived from a single downscaling approach. Here we examine how the choice of downscaling approach affects future damage projections across the globe, leveraging the historical relationship between mean annual temperature and subnational output. Different downscaling approaches can cause location-specific damage projections to vary by as much as 9.8% of gross regional product, in some locations surpassing uncertainty stemming from climate models and emissions scenarios. These results suggest applied researchers should employ multiple downscaled datasets when projecting climate impacts.

 State of the art for weather and climate hazard prediction requires expensive km-scale numerical simulations. Here, a generative diffusion model is explored for downscaling global inputs to km-scale, as a cost-effective alternative. The model is trained to predict 2 km data from an operational regional weather model over Taiwan, conditioned on a 25 km reanalysis. To address the large resolution ratio, different physics and synthesize new channels, we employ a two-step approach. A deterministic model first predicts the mean, followed by a generative diffusion model that predicts the residual. The model exhibits encouraging deterministic and probabilistic skills, spectra and distributions that recover power law relationships in the target data. In case studies of coherent weather phenomena, it sharpens gradients in cold fronts and intensifies typhoons while synthesizing rainbands. Calibration of model uncertainty remains challenging. The prospect of unifying such methods with coarser global models implies a potential for global-to-regional machine learning simulation.

 Socio-economic progress relies on critical soil ecosystem services, yet Latin American and Caribbean soils face considerable pressures. Here we assess soil health across the region using remote sensing data processed with cloud-based machine learning to create high-resolution maps (90 m) of a soil health index. This index integrates weighted physical, chemical, and biological indicators, such as total porosity, plant-available water, and carbon stock. Based on five soil functions, which involve water and nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and supporting plant growth, we found that 38% of soils are classified as unhealthy, 28% as moderate, and 34% as healthy. Unhealthy soils dominate drylands and savannas with frequent surface exposure, while humid equatorial zones exhibit healthier conditions. Notably, the Amazon basin registers medium-low soil health, underscoring the urgent need for conservation.

 Eutrophication and proliferation of nuisance and harmful algal blooms are a major cause of water-quality impairment globally. Here, we analyze the world’s longest continuous (150-year) river water-quality dataset for the River Thames, U.K. (including biological oxygen demand, chloride, phosphorus and silica), to explore the impacts of urbanization, wastewater discharges and agricultural intensification. Over the last 40 years, improvements in wastewater treatment and agricultural management have reduced phosphorus loads by ~80%. However, this has been insufficient to curtail river algal blooms because nutrient concentrations remain above limiting levels. Over the last 50–60 years, rising water temperatures have increased the number of days with water temperatures favourable for diatom blooms in March-April and for cyanobacterial growth in July-August. These results highlight the challenges of eutrophication management in a warming climate and a strategic need to redouble efforts in further reducing nutrient emissions to control nuisance and increasingly harmful algal blooms.

 Seismological studies have previously detected abundant scatterers in the lower mantle, potentially linked to long-term slab subduction, and petrology studies suggest carbonates can be sequestrated within the oceanic crust and transported into the lower mantle via subduction. Here, we report ab initio calculations of elastic properties of calcium carbonate within various structures at lower-mantle conditions, as well as phase boundary between different calcium carbonate phases. Combining our results with previous data, we derived the density and wave velocities of carbonated oceanic crust, considering the possible reactions between carbonates and silicates. Our results suggest calcium carbonate high-pressure phases exhibit much lower density and wave velocities than other lower-mantle minerals. However, the moderately carbonated oceanic crust still displays positive wave velocity anomalies in the lower mantle, except at mid-mantle depths. Besides, the carbonated oceanic crust reaches similar shear wave velocity to the surrounding mantle at ~1100 km depth, which could explain the scarcity of seismic scatterers at this depth.

 The diversity of building functions is vital for urban planning and optimizing infrastructure and services. Street-view images offer rich exterior details, aiding in function recognition. However, street-view building function annotations are limited and challenging to obtain. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware semi-supervised method for fine-grained building function recognition, which effectively uses multi-source geoinformation data to achieve accurate function recognition in both single-city and cross-city scenarios. We restructured the semi-supervised method based on the Teacher–Student architecture into three stages, which involve pre-training for building facade recognition, building function annotation generation, and building function recognition. In the first stage, to enable semi-supervised training with limited annotations, we employ a semi-supervised object detection model, which trains on both labeled samples and a large amount of unlabeled data simultaneously, achieving building facade detection. In the second stage, to further optimize the pseudo-labels, we effectively utilize the geometric spatial relationships between GIS map data and panoramic street-view images, integrating the building function information with facade detection results. We ultimately achieve fine-grained building function recognition in both single-city and cross-city scenarios by combining the coarse annotations and labeled data in the final stage. We conduct extensive comparative experiments on four datasets, which include OmniCity, Madrid, Los Angeles, and Boston, to evaluate the performance of our method in both single-city (OmniCity & Madrid) and cross-city (OmniCity - Los Angeles & OmniCity - Boston) scenarios. The experimental results show that, compared to advanced recognition methods, our method improves mAP by at least 4.8% and 4.3% for OmniCity and Madrid, respectively, while also effectively handling class imbalance. Furthermore, our method performs well in the cross-categorization system experiments for Los Angeles and Boston, highlighting its strong potential for cross-city tasks.

 The limited number of PM2.5 monitoring stations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) restricts PM2.5 monitoring and associated policymaking efforts. Low-cost PM2.5 stations, such as those from the PurpleAir network, offer a vital alternative to expand coverage in regions not monitored by the EPA. However, the accuracy of PurpleAir measurements has been questioned. This study introduces a deep learning (DL) approach, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (DeepCNN), to align hourly PM2.5 data from PurpleAir with EPA PM2.5 observations across the CONUS for the year 2021. Utilizing over nine million samples from 1595 PurpleAir stations located within 5 km of EPA stations, the DeepCNN demonstrates significant improvements in the agreement between PurpleAir and EPA observations. It increases the correlation coefficient (R) with EPA observations from 0.58 to 0.85 and reduces the mean absolute bias (MAB) from 4.99 to 2.98 μg/m3, achieving a 40% reduction in bias. The state-wise cross-validation also underscores the model's generalizability, with an average 11% improvement in R values and a 13% reduction in bias between PurpleAir and EPA PM2.5 measurements in various states. Comparative analysis reveals that the accuracy of our DL-enhanced PurpleAir PM2.5 (PM-DL) data significantly surpasses that of five previously established PurpleAir correction models, which show low R values of 0.55–0.58 and MABs ranging from 4.21 to 6.43 μg/m3 when validated against EPA data. This study underscores the need for more sophisticated models to better align PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements to EPA standards. The PM-DL data can substantially mitigate the scarcity of reliable institutional PM2.5 observations across the CONUS.

 Coastal heatwaves, which often coincide with typhoons, extreme sea levels, and other compound extreme events under global warming, are more complex and less studied compared to inland and marine heatwaves. In this study, a three-dimensional connected algorithm was used to detect spatiotemporal heatwave events during the summer seasons from 1959 to 2023 on a global scale. A novel method was developed to distinguish between land and coastal heatwaves by considering the movement of heatwaves during their lifecycle. Both land and coastal heatwaves increase in frequency and projection area but decrease in maximum intensity, with coastal heatwaves exhibiting a higher growth rate than land heatwaves. Across the Northern Hemisphere, metrics for both heatwave types demonstrate consistent upward trends. However, the Southern Hemisphere presents divergent patterns, with land heatwaves exhibiting a decreasing trend while coastal heatwaves continue to intensify. To assess the impacts of heatwave on human health, the heat stress index was analyzed during heatwave periods. The results indicate that heat stress conditions, currently classified under caution categories, are likely to escalate into more dangerous levels under global warming.
