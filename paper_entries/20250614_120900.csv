10.1088/1748-9326/add9b0,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是农业土地的撂荒和复垦对环境的影响，特别是对碳封存、栖息地和景观连通性的影响。它探讨了在不同的未来发展情景下，美国东南部农业土地撂荒和转化的程度和空间分布，以及复垦撂荒土地如何抵消农业用地转化，并影响栖息地破碎化和物种连通性。虽然该研究涉及环境影响，但它侧重于土地利用变化和生态后果，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Alyssa N Jain;Lauren Harris;Noah Moyer;Cameryn Brock;Patrick R Roehrdanz;Ashley Larsen,Assessing future environmental benefits of agricultural abandonment and recultivation,"Agricultural land abandonment presents potential environmental benefits through either revegetation, and associated carbon sequestration, habitat and landscape connectivity benefits, or recultivation, which offsets the need for agricultural conversion of natural areas. Yet, the extent and pace of land abandonment depends on future demand for food, energy, and other anthropogenic drivers. Here we quantify the extent and spatial distribution of agricultural abandonment and conversion in the southeastern US under a range of future development scenarios, addressing (1) what is the extent of future agricultural abandonment and conversion, (2) how much forecast agricultural conversion could be offset by recultivation of abandoned land, and (3) within a given development scenario, how do different strategies for recultivation of abandoned lands influence (a) habitat fragmentation and (b) connectivity for the umbrella species Ursus americanus. Future abandonment ranged from 1.63 Mha (local economic scenario) to 7.95 Mha (local environmental scenario). Future conversion ranged from 1.24 Mha (global environmental scenario) to 5.65 Mha (global economic scenario). While environmental scenarios predicted surplus abandonment available to offset all conversion, economic scenarios predicted enough abandonment to offset a third of conversion at most. Within a given development scenario, strategic recultivation targeting carbon or biodiversity conservation can reduce fragmentation by up to 17% compared to land-use decisions that do not consider those characteristics. However, strategic recultivation did not significantly affect connectivity, which was instead driven by development scenarios: cost-weighted distance to least-cost path ratio was highest in the economic development scenarios and lowest in the environmental concern scenarios. Our results suggest that while socio-economic development scenarios are the primary drivers of land-use change patterns and the attendant ecological consequences, strategic recultivation decisions targeting carbon sequestration or biodiversity potential can reduce habitat fragmentation within development scenarios."

We developed an emission inversion system to assimilate satellite NO2 data to obtain daily kilometer-scale NOx emission inventories. Our results enhance inventory accuracy, allowing us to capture the effects of pollution control policies on daily emissions (e.g., during COVID-19 lockdowns) and improve fine-scale air quality modeling. 
 Accurate, timely, and high-resolution NOx emissions are essential for formulating pollution control strategies and improving the accuracy of air quality modeling at fine scales. Since late 2018, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite has been providing daily monitoring of NO2 column concentrations with global coverage and a small footprint of 5.5 km × 3.5 km, offering great potential for tracking daily high-resolution NOx emissions. In this study, we develop a data assimilation and emission inversion framework that couples an ensemble Kalman filter with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate daily NOx emissions at 3 km scales in Beijing and surrounding areas in 2020. By assimilating the TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs) and taking the bottom-up inventory as prior emissions, we produce a posterior NOx emission dataset with a reasonable spatial distribution and daily variations at the 3 km scale. The proxy-based bottom-up emission mapping method at fine scales overestimates NOx emissions in densely populated urban areas, whereas our posterior emissions improve this mapping by reducing the overestimation of urban emissions and increasing emissions in rural areas. The posterior NOx emissions show considerable seasonal variations and provide a more timely insight into NOx emission fluctuations, such as those caused by the COVID-19 lockdown measures. Evaluations using the TROPOMI NO2 column retrievals and ground-based observations demonstrate that the posterior emissions substantially improve the accuracy of 3 km CMAQ simulations of the NO2 TVCDs as well as the daily surface NO2 and O3 concentrations in 2020. However, during summer, despite notable improvements in surface NO2 and O3 simulations, positive biases in the posterior model simulations persist, indicating weaker constraints on surface emissions from satellite NO2 column retrievals in summer. The posterior daily emissions on the 3 km scale estimated by our inversion system not only provide insights into the fine-scale emission dynamic patterns but also improve air quality modeling on the kilometer scale."

PM10 (particulate matter) collected above a scaled-down activated sludge tank treating domestic sewage in the UK was analysed for a range of short-, medium-, and long-chain PFAS. Eight PFAS were detected in the PM10. Our results suggest that wastewater treatment processes, i.e. activated sludge aeration, could aerosolise PFAS into airborne PM. 
 Environmental pollution with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly referred to as “forever chemicals”, received significant attention due to their environmental persistence and bioaccumulation tendencies. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been reported to contain significant levels of PFAS. Wastewater treatment processes such as aeration have the potential to transfer PFAS into the atmosphere. However, understanding their fate during sewage treatment remains challenging. This study aims to assess aerosolisation of PFAS during a WWTP process. Special emphasis is given to new-generation and legacy PFAS (e.g. perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) as they are still observed in sewage after years of restrictions. Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 µm (PM10) collected above a scaled-down activated sludge tank treating domestic sewage for a population of >10 000 people in the UK was analysed for a range of short-, medium-, and long-chain PFAS. Eight PFAS including perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), PFOS, and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were detected in the PM10. The presence of legacy PFOA and PFOS in the PM10 samples, despite being restricted for over a decade, raises concerns about their movement through domestic and industrial sewage cycles. The total PFAS concentrations in PM10 were 15.49 and 4.25 pg m−3 during autumn and spring campaigns, respectively. PFBA was the most abundant of the PFAS, suggesting a shift towards short-chain PFAS use. Our results suggest that wastewater treatment (WWT) processes such as activated sludge aeration could aerosolise PFAS into airborne PM."

Compared to GEOS-Chem's complex (dry) scheme, we show that the BAT-VBS model can predict substantial enhancements in organic aerosol mass concentration at moderate-to-high relative humidity. 
 Atmospheric organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations can be affected by water uptake through its impact on the gas–particle partitioning of semi-volatile compounds. Current chemical transport models (CTMs) neglect this process. We have implemented the Binary Activity Thermodynamics model coupled to a volatility basis set partitioning scheme in the GEOS-Chem CTM, providing an efficient reduced-complexity OA model that predicts relative-humidity-dependent mixing and partitioning thermodynamics, while limiting the impact on computational efficiency. We provide a quantitative assessment of this water-sensitive OA treatment, focusing on a subdomain over North America. The updated OA scheme predicts a spatiotemporal mean enhancement in surface-level OA mass concentration of 145 % for January 2019 and 76 % for July 2019 compared to GEOS-Chem's most advanced OA scheme. The temporal mean surface-level OA organic mass concentration can increase by up to ∼590 % for January 2019 and ∼280 % for July 2019, with the greatest enhancements occurring over the ocean. The updated OA scheme also quantifies the OA-associated water content. The simulations show how different OA precursors and related OA surrogates contribute and respond to water uptake, including that due to changes in temperature and relative humidity over the diurnal cycle in selected winter and summer months. These results are independent of future CTM improvements involving updates to chemical reaction schemes and emission inventories. Our water-sensitive OA scheme allows for a better representation of the seasonal and regional variations in OA mass concentration in CTMs."

Crowley,Short-lived organic nitrates in a suburban temperate forest: an indication of efficient assimilation of reactive nitrogen by the biosphere?,"Measurements and modelling of reactive nitrogen gases observed in a suburban temperate forest in Rambouillet, France, circa 50 km southwest of Paris in 2022 indicate that the biosphere rapidly scavenges organic nitrates of mixed biogenic and anthropogenic origin, resulting in short lifetimes for, for example, alkyl nitrates and peroxy nitrates. 
 Alkyl nitrates (ANs) and peroxycarboxylic nitric anhydrides (PANs) are important reservoirs of reactive nitrogen that contribute significantly to the rate of formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols and support the transport of reactive nitrogen from polluted areas to remote areas. It is therefore critical to understand their sources and sinks in different environments. In this study we use measurements of OH, O3, NO3 reactivity, volatile organic compounds, ∑ANs  and ∑PANs during the ACROSS (Atmospheric ChemistRy Of the Suburban foreSt) campaign to investigate different production and loss processes of ANs and PANs in a temperate forest. During the daytime OH-initiated processes were the dominant source of ANs (69 %–72 %), followed by NO3 (18 %–20 %) and O3 (8 %–12 %). During the nighttime the contribution from OH decreased to 43 %–53 %, and NO3 increased to 26 %–40 % with that of O3 largely unchanged. Of the measured ∑PANs, 48 %–78 % were modelled to be peroxyacetic nitric anhydride (PAN, commonly known as peroxyacetyl nitrate). Physical loss (e.g. deposition) was an important sink for both ANs and PANs and contributed significantly to the very short lifetimes of 1–4 h for ANs and 0.08–1.5 h for PANs observed during the campaign."

A shock wave near the lightning channel causes extensive shattering of cloud particles. At a distance, the audio wave will cause agglomeration of particles. So, thunder may influence the rain generation process and the radiative properties of clouds. As global warming may influence the occurrence rate of lightning, a climate feedback may be induced by these mechanisms. 
 Calculations are presented on the impact of thunder on cloud particles. The results show that the creation of a shock wave front near a lightning channel results in shattering of ice crystals, droplets, and dust aerosols, this being a yet unidentified mechanism for secondary ice production in clouds. At low altitudes shattering is more efficient. At the distance where the shock wave front decays to audio wave, another mechanism can cause agglomeration of particles. The cloud particles' characteristics appear to be not very suitable for extensive acoustic agglomeration if the sound pressure level (SPL) is below 120 dB. Nevertheless, even for SPL<120 dB, some agglomeration will occur. Agglomeration will occur readily if SPL > 135 dB at sound frequencies of 10 to 200 Hz. Agglomeration efficiency increases with height. More agglomeration will occur in pyroclouds, due to their large particle number densities. These results show that the electrical environment in clouds has, through thunder, effects on the size distribution and number density of ice particles and droplets, will hence influence thundercloud radiative properties, and may be a significant driver of secondary ice production. As global warming may influence the occurrence rate of lightning, a climate feedback may be induced by the mechanisms discussed here."

The present study demonstrates that lidars, which measure the backscattering behavior of aerosols over the entire visible wavelength range, can increase our knowledge of the spatial and temporal occurrence of aerosol layers, the type of aerosol, and their interaction with clouds. The focus of the publication is on wildfire aerosol and Saharan dust. 
 This study summarizes the results of the aerosol fluorescence measurements with the spectrometric fluorescence and Raman lidar RAMSES at the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory, Germany, from 2020 to 2023. The focus is on findings that can only be obtained by spectrometric measurements and not with a single discrete fluorescence receiver channel. The measurement parameters that are useful in the spectral analysis are introduced. In particular, this includes the spectrum of the fluorescence capacity, which has proven to be instructive. A new method is described that has been employed to determine the aerosol source regions. It is based on the combination of ensemble back-trajectory calculations with satellite measurements of fires and aerosol plumes. A total of 14 RAMSES measurements are discussed, representing a selection of the most interesting measurement nights over the 4-year period. The emphasis is on biomass burning aerosol (BBA) in the free troposphere, but measurements of Saharan dust or boundary layer aerosol are also provided. Excited at a wavelength of 355 nm, the BBA fluorescence spectrum has a rounded shape with a maximum between about 500 and 550 nm. With height, it becomes increasingly Gaussian, and a shift towards longer wavelengths is generally observed (red shift). However, BBA layers which exhibit an opposite dependence (blue shift) can be found in specific cases as well. Overall, the spectral fluorescence capacity is high with values up to over 9×10-6 nm−1. Fluorescence spectra of Saharan dust, on the other hand, are skewed to short wavelengths. The fluorescence maxima are below 500 nm, and a linear decrease in the spectral backscatter coefficient can be seen at longer wavelengths; the spectral fluorescence capacity is low (<1×10-6 nm−1). Our statistical analyses show that the correlations between the characteristics of the fluorescence spectra and other parameters are relatively weak. Of the atmospheric state variables, the ambient temperature correlates best, and of the elastic-optical particle properties it is the particle depolarization ratio. In addition, indications are found for both BBA and Saharan dust that the spectral shape is influenced not only by the type but also by the source region of the aerosols, which would allow a more accurate aerosol typing if further substantiated. The importance of spectral fluorescence measurements for investigations of aerosol–cloud interaction is also highlighted. Measurement examples reveal cirrus nucleation at low supersaturation on contact with an optically extremely thin BBA filament at the tropopause and provide the clearest indication to date of interaction, rather than coexistence, between clouds with supercooled water droplets and BBA using lidar. This ground-breaking study opens up a new field in atmospheric and aerosol research with exciting prospects for future studies, some of which will be presented."

We developed a machine learning method to characterize aerosols using OMPS LP measurements about 60 times faster than the current approach. 
 Among aerosol characterization methods, limb scattering measurements provide both near-global coverage and information about how aerosol is vertically distributed through the atmosphere. Near-real-time retrievals of aerosols produced by volcanic eruptions are particularly important for aviation safety, but the radiative transfer modeling of scattering processes performed by traditional retrieval methods can be too computationally expensive for near-real-time applications without simplifying assumptions, depending on the instrument and available computational resources. Here we present a near-real-time approach based on neural networks (NNs) for aerosol retrievals from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite's Limb Profiler (OMPS LP) instrument aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. We find it is at least 60 times faster than the current operational code and on average achieves agreement within 20 % at most altitudes and latitudes with sensitivity and non-negligible aerosol abundances. We also apply our trained NNs to measurements of the recent Shiveluch and Ruang eruptions from NOAA-21's OMPS LP and find results consistent with the operational retrieval algorithm, indicating our methodology generalizes to future iterations of the same instrument without retraining the NNs."

Specific humidity and integrated water vapor from the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC) and the Wegener Center (WEGC) are compared with the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), showing that GNSS-RO adds vertically resolved data. Despite a slight low bias, combining GNSS-RO and SSMIS improves AR analysis. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are comparatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor in the extratropics, which are responsible for many extreme precipitation events and flooding at midlatitudes, including Europe and the US. The critical role of ARs in global moisture transport and precipitation dynamics necessitates accurate water vapor measurements for both understanding and forecasting these phenomena. While the integrated water vapor content (IWV) of ARs can be measured well with microwave and infrared sounders, the vertical structure is less well known. In this study, we analyzed whether specific humidity profiles and IWV values from Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements provide additional information for the study of ARs, in particular regarding their vertical structure. The retrieval of water vapor from GNSS-RO data requires background information, which is usually incorporated by the one-dimensional variational method (1D-Var) that combines observations and background in an optimal manner. We compared data from the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC), operated by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, with data from the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WEGC) at the University of Graz, Austria. We found that retrievals from both centers agree very well in the altitude range, where the 1D-Var weights the observations strongly, even if the employed background profiles are very different. This demonstrates that GNSS-RO data indeed provide additional vertically resolved information, which was not already contained in the background or in operational analyses. IWV values from CDAAC and WEGC generally agree very well; however, both tend to underestimate the values obtained by Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S) data, since GNSS-RO profiles do not always reach the lowermost part of the atmosphere, leading to a systematic bias in the IWV data, which decreases with better penetration characteristics of the GNSS-RO data. The results suggest that it is promising to combine the GNSS-RO data – with very high vertical resolution with SSMI/S data – with high horizontal resolution to get a more compete view of the 3D structure of ARs."

TWSAs are reconstructed (BNML_TWSA) with grid-specific leader models (among four machine learning models) from January 1960 to December 2022 to generate a continuous global gridded dataset. The uncertainty in the reconstructed BNML_TWSA product is also assessed in terms of standard error. 
 Understanding long-term terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations is vital for investigating hydrological extreme events, managing water resources and assessing climate change impacts. However, the limited data duration from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO) poses challenges for comprehensive long-term analysis. In this study, we reconstruct TWS anomalies (TWSAs) for the period from January 1960 to December 2022, thereby filling data gaps between the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions and generating a complete dataset for the pre-GRACE era. The workflow involves identifying optimal predictors from land surface model (LSM) outputs, meteorological variables and climatic indices using a novel Bayesian network (BN) technique for raster-based TWSA simulations. Climate indices, like the Oceanic Niño Index and Dipole Mode Index, are selected as optimal predictors for a large number of grid cells globally, along with TWSAs from LSM outputs. The most effective machine learning (ML) algorithms among convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector regression (SVR), extra trees regressor (ETR) and stacking ensemble regression (SER) models are evaluated at each grid cell to achieve optimal reproducibility. Globally, ETR performs best for most of the grid cells; this is also noticed at the river basin scale, particularly for the Ganga–Brahmaputra–Meghna, Godavari, Krishna, Limpopo and Nile river basins. The simulated TWSAs (BNML_TWSA) outperformed the TWSAs from LSM outputs when evaluated against GRACE datasets. Improvements are particularly noted in river basins such as the Godavari, Krishna, Danube and Amazon, with median correlation coefficient, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, and RMSE values for all grid cells in the Godavari Basin, India, being 0.927, 0.839 and 63.7 mm, respectively. A comparison with TWSAs reconstructed in recent studies indicates that the proposed BNML_TWSA outperforms them globally as well as for all of the 11 major river basins examined. Furthermore, the uncertainty of BNML_TWSA is assessed for each grid cell in terms of the standard error. Results show smaller standard error magnitudes in grid cells in arid regions compared to other regions.

 Our understanding of how rapid Arctic warming and permafrost thaw affect global climate dynamics is restricted by limited spatiotemporal data coverage due to logistical challenges and the complex landscape of Arctic regions.

 In winter, snow- and ice-covered artificial surfaces are important aspects of the urban climate and trigger road maintenance operations. Urban climate and road weather models have specialized in simulating these conditions in cities or in the countryside, respectively. In this study, we intend to bridge the gap between road weather models and urban climate models in terms of cold region urban modelling and artificial surface condition predictions in any environment. We have refined the modelling of road surface processes related to winter conditions in the Town Energy Balance (TEB), an urban climate model designed for complex environments. We have developed an ice content prediction to account for the freezing and melting of the water content on the surface. Additionally, we have enhanced the TEB representation of snow on road, moving from a single-layer snow model (1-L), to a more precise multi-layer snow model known as Explicit Snow (ES). We have isolated the winter surface processes from other physical interactions by limiting the evaluation of the experiments to open environments. The experiments are carried out at two locations: the Col de Porte in the Alps and a road weather station in southern Finland. Our findings show that the enhanced TEB model (named TEB-ES) outperforms TEB, as well as a benchmark model, ISBA-Route/CROCUS, but with mixed results against a multiple linear regression in-sample algorithm. For roads with high traffic and/or winter maintenance operations, future modelling work should focus on the representation of anthropic effects."

It leverages acoustic signals generated by tsunamis, which propagate faster than the tsunami itself, enabling real-time detection and assessment. Integrating various models, the software provides reliable and rapid assessment, maps risk areas, and estimates tsunami amplitude. This advancement reduces false alarms and enhances global tsunami warning systems' accuracy and efficiency. 
 We introduce a tsunami warning technology towards a global real-time analysis. The technology is based on the analysis of acoustic signals generated together with the tsunami, due to the compression of the water layer. The acoustic signals propagate much faster than the tsunami and thus can be recorded at hydrophone stations, which in turn enables the analysis in real time. The presented technology comprises a collection of models that have been integrated into a software with the goal to make it operational and to complement efforts by warning centres and provide a more reliable assessment, globally. The main models that were integrated into the software are presented and briefly discussed. Test cases performed by the software are compared with DART buoy observations, showing satisfactory agreement, though discrepancies arise in particular at far distances and locations separated by land. The calculation time of a full global-scale analysis is in the order of tens of seconds on a standard multi-core machine, without reliance on pre-computations, making it an appropriate real-time forecast."

It offers fast and precise forecasts with predictions achieved in just 2.1 s on a standard computer. This innovative approach outperforms traditional models, which take hours to produce a forecast and use high-energy supercomputers. By making high-quality dust monitoring accessible and efficient, DustNet can improve weather, climate, and air quality forecasts. 
 Suspended in the atmosphere are millions of tonnes of mineral dust that interact with weather and climate. Accurate representation of mineral dust in weather models is vital, yet it remains challenging. Large-scale weather models use supercomputers and take hours to complete forecasts. Such computational burdens allow them to include only monthly climatological means of mineral dust as input states, inhibiting their forecasting accuracy. Here, we introduce DustNet, a simple, accurate, and fast forecasting model for predictions 24 h in advance of aerosol optical depth (AOD). DustNet is a custom-built 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) equipped with transposed convolution layers. The model is trained on selected ERA5 meteorology and past MODIS AOD observational data as inputs. Our design of DustNet ensures that the model trains in less than 8 min and creates predictions in 2.1 s on a desktop computer, without the need to utilise any graphics processing units (GPUs). Predictions created by DustNet outperform the state-of-the-art physics-based model at coarse 1°×1° resolution at 95 % of grid locations when compared to ground truth satellite data. The test results show that the daily mean AOD over the entire Saharan desert area is highly correlated with MODIS observational data, with Pearson's r2=0.91. Our results demonstrate DustNet's potential for fast and accurate AOD forecasting, which can easily be utilised by researchers without access to supercomputers or GPUs."

Properly calibrating model parameters is essential, and although automated tools can speed up this process, they may occasionally produce incorrect values due to inconsistencies in the model. We demonstrate that by carefully applying automated tools, we were able to identify and correct a flaw in a widely used model for lake environments. 
 Models are simplified descriptions of reality and are intrinsically limited by the assumptions that have been introduced in their formulation. With the development of automatic calibration toolboxes, finding optimal parameters that suit the environmental system has become more convenient. Here, we explore how optimization toolboxes can be applied innovatively to uncover flaws in the physical formulations of models. We illustrate this approach by evaluating the effect of simplifications embedded in the formulation of a widely used hydro-thermodynamic model. We calibrate a Delft3D model based on temperature profiles for a case study, Lake Morat (Switzerland), through the DYNO-PODS optimization tool. The results show that higher values of the light extinction coefficient can compensate for neglecting the fraction β of short-wave radiation absorbed at the surface of the water. This leads to unrealistic values of the light extinction coefficient, as the optimization pushes its value toward the limit of no transparency, consistent with the need to reproduce a significant absorption at the surface. Although it is well known that β is significantly larger than zero, its absence from the model was never noticed as critical. Automatic calibration tools provide valuable diagnostic insights into the physical robustness of models, enabling more precise evaluation of their structural integrity and performance."

Bell;Richard Renshaw,Improvements to the Met Office's global ocean–sea ice forecasting system including model and data assimilation changes,"We describe major improvements of the Met Office's global ocean–sea ice forecasting system. The models and the way observations are used to improve the forecasts were changed, which led to a significant error reduction of 1 d forecasts. The new system performance in past conditions, where subsurface observations are scarce, was improved with more consistent ocean heat content estimates. The new system will be of better use for climate studies and will provide improved forecasts for end users. 
 The Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) is the Met Office's operational, coupled ocean–sea ice system, which produces analyses and short-range forecasts at global and regional scales each day for various stakeholders, including defence, marine navigation and science users. This paper describes and evaluates the impacts of recent model and data assimilation (DA) updates on global FOAM when compared to its current operational version. The model updates include the use of the TEOS10 formulation for the seawater equation of state, with improved ocean model settings in the Southern Ocean and the implementation of a new sea ice model. Updates to the DA include an increase in the number of DA minimisation iterations, an improved specification of observation errors for sea surface temperature and sea level anomaly (SLA), and optimisations of the DA computational efficiency. Large-scale DA corrections for temperature have also been removed to prevent an inconsistent projection of the SLA DA signal onto large-scale temperature at depth. For 1-year runs at 1/12° resolution, the new FOAM system shows a 40 % improvement in observation-minus-background (OmB) statistics for SLA and subsurface temperatures relative to the current system in eddy-rich regions, which result in a similar level of improvement for ocean currents. To evaluate potential impacts on the pre-Argo period, 1-year experiments at 1/4° resolution are run withholding profiles of temperature and salinity observations in both new and current FOAM systems. Limited to the assimilation of only surface data, OmB statistics for SLA, temperature and salinity in the new FOAM system can reach improvements up to 90 % in the Southern Hemisphere relative to the current system, resulting in more temporally consistent ocean transport and heat content results. Therefore, it is expected that the model and DA updates will lead to more potential for use of FOAM reanalyses in climate studies, particularly in the pre-Argo period, and will provide improved ocean–sea ice initial conditions to FOAM as well as to the Met Office short-range and seasonal coupled ocean–atmosphere–land–sea ice forecasting systems."

Monsalve;Samuel R. Anderson;Nicole M. Gasparini;Elowyn M. Yager,RiverBedDynamics v1.0: a Landlab component for computing two-dimensional sediment transport and river bed evolution,"Rivers shape landscapes by moving sediments and changing their beds, but existing computer models oversimplify these processes by only considering erosion. We developed new software that simulates how rivers transport sediments and change over time through both erosion and deposition. This helps scientists and engineers better predict river behavior for water management, flood prevention, and ecosystem protection. 
 Computational landscape evolution models (LEMs) typically comprise at least two interacting components: a flow hydraulic solver that routes water across a landscape and a fluvial geomorphological model that modifies terrain properties, primarily bed surface elevation. LEMs used in long-term simulations over large watersheds, including some available in the Landlab library, often assume that only erosive processes occur in rivers and that terrain elevation increases solely due to tectonic uplift. Consequently, these models cannot capture the dynamics of gravel-bedded rivers, lacking the capacity to include sediment mixtures, simulate sediment deposition, and track textural changes in substrate stratigraphy that result from varying flow characteristics. To address this limitation, we developed, implemented, and tested RiverBedDynamics, a new Landlab component that simulates the evolution of bed surface elevation and grain size distribution in 2D grids based on the Exner equation for sediment mass balance. By dynamically coupling RiverBedDynamics with Landlab's hydrodynamic flow solver, OverlandFlow, we created a new LEM capable of simulating the dynamics of local shear stresses, bed load transport rates, and grain size distributions. Comparisons of our LEM results with analytical and previously reported solutions demonstrate its ability to accurately predict time-varying local changes in bed surface elevation, including erosion and deposition, as well as grain size distribution. Furthermore, application of our LEM to a synthetic watershed illustrates how spatially variable rainfall intensity leads to varying discharge patterns, which in turn drive changes in bed elevation and grain size distribution across the domain. This approach provides a more comprehensive representation of the complex interactions between flow dynamics and sediment transport in gravel-bedded rivers at timescales ranging from individual flood events to yearly morphological changes, enhancing our ability to model landscape evolution across diverse geomorphic settings."

However, the impact of the extreme heat events (EHs) on the O3-induced BVOC emissions remains unclear. Here, Quercus nuttallii(an isoprene emitter) and Q. acutissima (a monoterpene emitter) were exposed to five O3 treatments for three months and subjected to a two-week EH. The emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes, their synthesis capacities, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined to investigate how heat stress modulates O3 effects. Both BVOC types showed a hormetic response to O3, with low doses of O3 stimulating emissions and high doses suppressing them. Isoprene (Hedges’g = 2.91) and monoterpene (Hedges’g = 2.52) emission rates were inhibited by short-term EH across the five O3 treatments. However, isoprene emission rates generally recovered during the post-EH period, except under the highest O3 exposure (NF80). EH also shifted isoprene’s response to O3 from being synthesis-driven to ROS-driven. Although the monoterpene emission rate response to O3 was driven by synthesis capacity in the pre-EH period, this response became less explainable by either factor post-EH. These findings emphasize the profound effects of EH on the BVOC response to O3, providing crucial insights for predicting regional BVOC emissions under future climate scenarios."

However, emerging evidence suggests that the oxidative dissolution of MSNPs can lead to the release of toxic metal ions. Here, we investigated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdSNPs) in zebrafish under environmentally relevant oxidative conditions induced by hypochlorite, a common disinfectant used in wastewater treatment. We observed that the dissolution of CdSNPs in hypochlorite solutions followed an inverted U-shaped pattern with respect to hypochlorite concentration and reaction time over 24 h. Compared with CdSNP exposure alone, hypochlorite-mediated oxidative dissolution markedly potentiated neurodevelopmental toxicity, evidenced by abnormal light–dark behavioral responses in transgenic hb9:EGFP zebrafish. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the toxicity was primarily driven by dissolved cadmium ions released both in vitro and in vivo, which disrupted serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. Metabolomic profiling and protein expression analyses revealed that cadmium disrupts the synthesis, metabolism, and receptor interactions of monoamine neurotransmitters. This study shows a previously underappreciated mechanism by which oxidative transformation under disinfection-relevant conditions enhances MSNP toxicity, offering critical insights into the ecological and health risks associated with metal sulfide nanoparticles in aquatic systems."

Modeling results indicated that increases in wildland fire smoke have offset approximately one-third of the improvements in background air quality. In recent years, wildland fire smoke has become more frequent and carbonaceous PM2.5 concentrations have intensified, especially in the Western CONUS and Southwestern Canada. Wildfire season is also starting earlier and lengthens throughout the year, leading to more population being exposed. We estimated that long-term exposure to fire smoke carbonaceous PM2.5 is responsible for approximately 7455 and 259 non-accidental deaths annually in the CONUS and SC, respectively, with associated annual monetized damage of 68.3 billion USD for the CONUS and 1.9 billion CAD for SC.

Herein, we propose a green mechanochemical strategy that utilizes the electrons and reactive oxygen species generated by ball milling to achieve ultrahighly efficient metal recovery and removal of residual organic pollutants. The recovery efficiencies from lithium manganese oxide (LMO) batteries reached ∼100% for lithium and 94.3% for manganese within 60 min, and the representative residual organic pollutants were effectively removed, ranging from 73.1 to 99.1%. Similar efficiencies were achieved for lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt batteries. The generation of abundant electrons and reactive oxygen species during the ball milling process is proposed as the main mechanism underlying the efficient metal recovery and pollutant degradation. The effective reduction in the valence state of manganese in the LMO powders was verified by X-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy. The excellent performance of our strategy in Li recovery and mitigating environmental hazards has far surpassed those of existing techniques and demonstrates the exceptional potential of mechanochemical ball milling as a green technique for LIB recycling."

The total concentrations of PET-NPs in fresh lake water (average: 7.02 μg/L) are much higher than those in seawater (average: 1.71 μg/L). The lower critical coagulation concentration of PET-NPs indicates that they are more prone to aggregation than other nanoparticles. PET-NPs aggregate faster in seawater than in freshwater, and Na+ and Ca2+ significantly promote aggregation. Conversely, the higher dissolved organic matter in lake water inhibits the formation of large PET-NP aggregates.

Upwelling methane could contribute to the unusual coupling of ammonia oxidation by Nitrosopumilaceae with simultaneous nitrite-dependent methane oxidation by Methylomirabilaceae. Taken together, we illuminate the relationship among hydrochemistry, hydraulic connectivity, and alluvial aquifer microbiomes."

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a promising technique, but conventional solid SERS substrate-based detection faces difficulties such as ensuring NPs make contact with hotspots, dealing with uneven particle distribution, and poor detection repeatability. Herein, we propose a simple and sensitive SERS detection strategy by co-self-assembling silver (Ag) nanoparticles and NPs in a monolayer. 90% of NPs in solution spontaneously transfer to the monolayer within 30 s. More importantly, a single NP can be uniformly entrapped in Ag nanoparticle SERS “hotspots”, resulting in a significant enhancement of the intrinsic Raman signal. This enhancement enables quantitative detection in the range of 10–2–2 mg/L for 80, 300, and 800 nm polystyrene (PS) NPs, with a low detection limit of 10–2 mg/L. The method allows for the identification of various plastic types, including PS, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyformaldehyde (POM). This method was used to determine the efficacy of NP generation from bulk PS foam through physical (sand friction) and biological (mealworm ingestion) routes. Moreover, NPs in real seawater collected from a rocky beach were quantitatively analyzed. The coassembly monolayer-based SERS detection provides a straightforward and sensitive technique for identification and quantitative analysis of NPs."

The underlying mechanisms of the proton-induced suppression remain elusive. This study demonstrates that NH4+ hydration significantly impacts reactive halogen species (RHS)-initiated oxidation. Our experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the unique solvation shell of NH4+ features strong hydrogen bonding, which creates a protective barrier that limits oxidant access particularly at acidic pH values. HClO/ClO– was less effective in interacting NH4+ due to the strong solvation shell surrounding NH4+. In contrast, HBrO/BrO– with a larger ion radius and lower charge density can disrupt the solvation layer, resulting in superior oxidation efficiency. The addition of methanol effectively alleviated NH4+ solvation and lowered the energy barrier associated with the rate-determining desolvation step, and thus markedly enhancing its reactivity. Electrochemical experiments involving in situ RHS generation validated superior NH4+-N removal performance in NaBr-based systems compared to NaCl. Moreover, the NaBr-involved electrochemical approach enabled simultaneous NH4+ oxidation and Cu recovery from [Cu(NH3)4]2+-containing synthetic wastewater. This study highlights the important role of solvation effects on NH4+ oxidation and offers valuable insights for developing efficient strategies for NH4+-N removal in water treatment."

To address this gap, a ship-based microcosm experiment was conducted, where OA and MP pollution were simulated under in situ conditions to explore their effects on the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS), bromoform (CHBr3), and dibromomethane (CH2Br2). The results indicated that both MP and OA inhibited phytoplankton growth and DMS concentration, with OA inducing further reductions in the production rate and yield of DMS. MP addition led to extra dissolved organic matter, and the acidified condition enhanced bromoperoxidase activity, both of which promoted the production of CHBr3 and CH2Br2. When OA and MP addition were combined, DMS concentrations decreased by 61%, whereas CHBr3 and CH2Br2 concentrations increased by 132% and 45%, respectively. Based on the results, MP pollution under OA conditions might directly reduce DMS accumulation or decrease the formation of DMS-derived sulfate aerosols by increasing CHBr3 and CH2Br2 levels, which finally weaken DMS’s climate-cooling capabilities. This study underscores the potential for MP pollution in future acidified oceans to exacerbate global warming by disrupting the cycle of marine biogenic climate-active gases."

Their removal from (waste)water typically involves advanced water treatment technologies that are resource- and cost-intensive. This raises the question whether there are specific emission hotspots that would enable more targeted PhaC removal. In this study, we identify patient urine in hospitals as one such hotspot. PhaC concentrations in urine ranged from hundreds of μg/L up to tens of mg/L with some PhaC detected at concentrations above 20,000 μg/L. This concentration range is 3–4 orders of magnitude above what is found in wastewater. Intensive care unit patient urine, collected in urine drainage bags, is a promising point of intervention, as it can be easily separated from other waste streams and treated on-site. To screen for potential on-site treatment options, we tested the PhaC removal potential of a commercial activated carbon, a steam-activated biochar, and ion exchange resins in both batch and column experiments. These experiments showed that pore size distribution of activated carbon was a crucial factor for PhaC removal. Ion exchange resins were generally worse sorbents, including for charged PhaCs. Our results indicate that on-site PhaC removal from patient urine using carbon based sorbents is a promising approach to reduce PhaC emissions that warrants further investigation, but removal efficiencies need to be further improved by tailoring the sorbents and potentially pretreating the urine."

Although prior research on GGE in the aluminum electrolysis industry (AEI) focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) and perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions, we have discovered significant nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from this sector, which has been overlooked until now. In this work, we found that N2O had a CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emission factor twice that of CO2 or PFCs. We also identified a significant linear relationship between the N2O emission factor and the product of the electrolysis cell number, the anode effect coefficient, and the duration. Based on the above results, we estimated that global N2O emissions from the AEI reached 65.1 ± 6.4 Mt of CO2eq/year in 2018. The newly discovered N2O emissions constituted 27.4–52.2% of total GGE in the AEI and 15.7–65.1% of existing industrial N2O emissions. These findings highlighted that the AEI was a long-neglected source of N2O emissions. The N element content control in carbon anodes may be an effective measure to reduce N2O emissions during the processing of the anode effect. Additionally, the molten salt electrolysis process for production of metals such as sodium, magnesium, and lithium may also be a potential source of N2O emissions and is necessary to further investigate N2O reduction technologies."

Specifically, the CHIMERE CTM is combined with  a Neural Network, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), or Random Forest AI methods. The results show that the educated machine models significantly improved predictions of air pollution levels compared to the standalone CTM.

While many studies have assessed the potential irrigation impact on regional climate, most have focused solely on water addition, neglecting the indirect effects of vegetation changes. This study evaluates how vegetation dynamics influence irrigation impacts. Three experimental scenarios—dynamic vegetation (DYNM), static bare vegetation (BARE), and static lush vegetation (LUSH)—demonstrate consistent precipitation increases in April‐May‐June, but significant inconsistencies arise in July‐August‐September. Two static vegetation scenarios deviate in opposite directions from DYNM in irrigation‐induced precipitation responses: DYNM indicates a slight decrease, LUSH shows a more pronounced decrease, while BARE presents a significant increase. These discrepancies stem from different magnitudes of irrigation‐induced evapotranspiration and cooling stabilization. Furthermore, deviations in the water and energy budget may introduce uncertainties in assessing broader irrigation impacts, such as groundwater depletion, which is often studied using static vegetation assumptions."

Focusing on PM2.5‐O3 composite pollution in the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei region, 10 planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes were evaluated for their simulation performance. The 2‐m temperature (T2) demonstrates daytime dependence on temperature gradient and transport coefficient, shifting to surface temperature dominance at night. Saturated mixing ratio predominantly governs 2‐m relative humidity (RH2) variations, while 10‐m wind speed (WS10) derives from the first‐level wind speed. Vertical profile comparisons reveal degraded simulation accuracy at lower levels, attributed to human activities’ influences within the PBL. The total energy‐mass flux scheme exhibited distinct deviations due to failure to recognize the existence of shallow cumulus, consequently suppressing vertical mixing. Turbulent diffusion coefficient (K) discrepancies in nonlocal closure schemes primarily stem from PBL height (PBLH) variations, whereas local closure schemes show mixing length dominance (∼63%). Dissipation rate considerations exert stronger impacts at lower levels. For hybrid schemes, K calculated by Monin‐Obukhov similarity theory shows enhanced magnitudes during daytime.

To improve the accuracy of ozone predictions, this study assimilated ground‐based monitoring and satellite data to improve initial and boundary conditions during a typical ozone pollution episode in YRD region. As a result, compared with station observations, the R and RMSE of model simulation are greatly improved. Additionally, the emission inventory during this event was inverted and then used to drive the model to re‐simulate this event, and the simulation results are improved. Furthermore, based on the new emissions, we conducted three emission reduction scenario simulations to distinguish ozone sensitivity region. Ozone formation was in a VOC‐limited regime in south Jiangsu during the study period. For north Zhejiang, transitional and NOx‐limited regimes occurred alternately. It is worth noting that the ozone sensitivity regimes derived from the original emission inventory were not consistent with those obtained from the improved emission inventory.

Furthermore, the TB core record shows 50‐ to 70‐year multidecadal variability, positively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Based on correlation and composite analyses using ERA5 reanalysis data, AMO phases have been linked with surface wetness/dryness in dust source regions in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, likely contributing to variations in dust loading at the TB core site."

Applied to Seoul, South Korea, the framework utilized the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with an Urban Canopy Model (WRF‐UCM) to generate objective indices for heat stress, flash floods, and wind circulation projected to the end of this century under four roof schemes: business‐as‐usual, 25% and 100% cool roofs (CR25 and CR100), and 100% green roofs (GR100). These indices were used to test four deep learning algorithms: UNet, UNet++, UNet3+, and Multi‐ResUNet. Multi‐ResUNet demonstrated superior performance, thus it was employed to develop the surrogate model, which was applied to 262,144 multi‐type roofing scenarios. Two optimal roofing scenarios were identified using the Pareto method, balancing the three climate objectives and economic costs: the first with CR100 covering 95.9% of urban areas, reducing heat stress by over 50% in 34.3% of regions and wind circulation by 10% in 27.7% of regions, and the second with CR100 covering 60.2% of urban areas, achieving a similar heat stress reduction in 21.6% of regions but a stronger reduction in wind circulation. Both scenarios had minimal impact on flash flood mitigation. This study highlights the importance of spatial configuration in maximizing the benefits of urban roofing strategies due to the heterogeneous effects across urban areas. Furthermore, the considerably lower computational time increases the practical utility of the proposed surrogate modeling framework for use in a diverse range of urban contexts, advancing global efforts to mitigate urban climate risks."

Thus, accurately delineating the extent of AP is critical for effective policy‐making in aquaculture. However, existing methods for large‐scale extraction of AP face challenges, such as difficulty in transferring segmentation thresholds and confusion with similar land features, which limits the accurate determination of their spatial distribution. This study focuses on AP in China, developing a tailored spectral index for AP extraction and creating an optimized classification method for large‐scale, automated AP extraction by integrating the WVndapi index with machine learning techniques. Using high‐resolution Sentinel‐2 data from 2023 and leveraging the Google Earth Engine, a nationwide AP distribution map was generated. The results indicate that: (a) The optimized WVndapi index extraction results indicate that the overall accuracy (OA) of AP identification across the nation reached 91%, with Cohen's Kappa of 0.88. (b) At the national scale, the spatial distribution of AP shows a pattern of higher density in the north and lower density in the south, with more AP in the east than in the west. Notably, inland AP account for 15% of the national total. (c) The contours and shapes of AP extracted used WVndapi index closely match the high‐precision results obtained through manual digitization (0.43 m), effectively distinguishing AP from confounding features such as gully, lake, river, and shadow. In summary, the establishment of the WVndapi index overcomes the limitations of confusion and misclassification among similar land covers, achieving the goal of adaptive threshold at a large scale."

Large‐scale and rapid invasion of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has imposed significant impacts on coastal wetland ecosystems and biodiversity globally. Tracking dynamic trajectories of S. alterniflora and the rhythmic changes of its vegetation functional traits is important to understand the invasion mechanism. This study proposed a novel time series adaptive threshold segmentation method (NSATS) to extract S. alterniflora. Specifically, for the San Francisco Bay (SFB) of the U.S., the extraction was carried out from 1995 to 2004, while for three representative bays along the coastal zone of China, the extraction was conducted from 2011 to 2020, respectively, and to explore their spatio‐temporal distribution patterns. We developed an innovative CCD‐HCM method to track the historical growth trajectories of S. alterniflora, and evaluated their growth dynamics. Finally, we explored the phenological rhythm of S. alterniflora functional traits, and clarified the response mechanisms of its vegetation functional traits to hydro‐meteorological factors. NSATS showed high accuracy (0.82–0.96) in identifying S. alterniflora. Its invasion was faster in China's bays, with rapid expansion in 2011–2020, especially in YRD. SFB remained stable, with minor changes. Functional traits showed earlier SOS and longer LOS with latitude decrease. Air and water temperatures influence S. alterniflora traits differently across bays. These findings aid in monitoring and controlling its invasion."

 Lipids are essential components of cancer cells due to their structural and signalling roles1. To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2–5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.

 Natural killer (NK) cells use inhibitory and activating immune receptors to differentiate between human cells and pathogens. Signalling by these receptors determines whether an NK cell becomes activated and destroys a target cell. In some cases, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, immune receptors are found in pairs, with inhibitory and activating receptors containing nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains coupled to different intracellular signalling domains1. Previous studies showed that repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, displayed on the surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, can bind to inhibitory immune receptors and dampen NK cell activation2,3, reducing parasite killing. However, no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for any human activating receptor. Here we identified a clade of RIFINs that bind to inhibitory immune receptor KIR2DL1 more strongly than KIR2DL1 binds to the human ligand (MHC class I). This interaction mediates inhibitory signalling and suppresses the activation of KIR2DL1-expressing NK cells. We show that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs are abundant in field-isolated strains from both Africa and Asia and reveal how the two RIFINs bind to KIR2DL1. The RIFIN binding surface of KIR2DL1 is conserved in the cognate activating immune receptor KIR2DS1. We find that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs can also bind to KIR2DS1, resulting in the activation of KIR2DS1-expressing NK cells. This study demonstrates that activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors can recruit NK cells to target a pathogen and reveals a potential role for activating immune receptors in controlling malaria infection.

 Mapping the spatial organization of DNA-level somatic copy number changes in tumors can provide insight to understanding higher-level molecular and cellular processes that drive pathogenesis. We describe an integrated framework of spatial transcriptomics, tumor/normal DNA sequencing, and bulk RNA sequencing to identify shared and distinct characteristics of an initial cohort of eleven gliomas of varied pathology and a replication cohort of six high-grade glioblastomas. We identify focally amplified extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in four of the eleven initial gliomas, with subclonal tumor heterogeneity in two EGFR-amplified grade IV glioblastomas. In a TP53-mutated glioblastoma, we detect a subclone with EGFR amplification on ecDNA coupled to chromosome 17 loss of heterozygosity. To validate subclonal somatic aneuploidy and copy number alterations associated with ecDNA double minutes, we examine the replication cohort, identifying MDM2/MDM4 ecDNA subclones in two glioblastomas. The spatial heterogeneity of EGFR and p53 inactivation underscores the role of ecDNA in enabling rapid oncogene amplification and enhancing tumor adaptability under selective pressure.

 Cultural systems play an important role in shaping the interactions between humans and the environment, and are in turn shaped by these interactions. However, at present, cultural systems are poorly integrated into the models used by climate scientists to study the interaction of natural and anthropogenic processes (i.e. Earth systems models) due to pragmatic and conceptual barriers. In this Perspective, we demonstrate how the archaeology of climate change, an interdisciplinary field that uses the archaeological record to explore human-environment interactions, is uniquely placed to overcome these barriers. We use concepts drawn from climate science and evolutionary anthropology to show how complex systems modeling that focuses on the spatial structure of the environment and its impact on demographic variables, social networks and cultural evolution, can bridge the gap between large-scale climate processes and local-scale social processes. The result is a blueprint for the design of integrative models that produce testable hypotheses about the impact of climate change on human systems.

Here the authors estimate that climate-change-driven changes in fire emissions could increase iron deposition in ocean ecosystems, enhancing productivity particularly in the North Atlantic. 
 Rapid shifts in fire regimes affect the carbon cycle by releasing carbon and nutrients such as iron (Fe), potentially enhancing marine productivity and carbon export. Here we use fire emission projections and Earth system models to examine how climate-driven changes in fire emissions may alter soluble Fe (SFe) deposition and productivity. By century’s end, climate change could increase Fe emissions from fires by 1.7–1.8 times beyond projections considering only direct human influences. Model projections show rising SFe deposition in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes under increasing socio-economic activity, potentially boosting the impact of SFe deposition on productivity in the Fe-limited North Atlantic by up to 20% annually (40% in summer), assuming stable macronutrient levels. However, declining macronutrient availability may shrink Fe-limited areas, where climate-driven fires could offset productivity losses by 7–8%. In the Southern Ocean, fossil fuel emissions primarily control SFe deposition, as reductions in anthropogenic fires counterbalance climate-driven increases.

 Climate advertising on social media can shape attitudes towards climate change. Delivery algorithms, as key actors in the climate communication ecosystem, determine ad audience selection and might introduce demographic bias. Here, we present a two-part study—an observational analysis (n = 253,125) and a field experiment (M = 650)—to investigate algorithmic bias in Facebook’s climate ad dissemination. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the algorithm’s selection of ad audiences can be explained by factors such as ad content, audience location (US states), gender and age group. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of contrarian ads is linked with the conservative political alignment of a state, while the cost-effectiveness of advocacy ads correlates with liberal political alignment, higher population and per-capita gross domestic product; ad targeting strategies further modulate these effects. The skew in the distribution of climate ads across US states, age groups and genders reinforces existing climate attitudes.

 Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are the dominant tools for projecting mitigation scenarios.

Here we develop a deep learning framework to generate key variables through synthetic mitigation scenarios aligned with the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Scenarios Database. By analysing 1,202 scenarios from a diverse set of IAMs, we select key drivers that enable a more detailed sectoral representation. Next, we trained three generative deep learning models to produce 30,000 synthetic scenarios at low computational cost across various IPCC AR6 climate categories, replicating variable distributions and correlations while also demonstrating physical consistency in power sector variables through internal validation checks. We found that the variational autoencoder achieved the highest label transferring accuracy among three frameworks.

 In March 2024, the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex (ASPV) collapsed dramatically. The following April, extreme precipitation in South China (SCP) caused severe floods and economic damage. Whether and how they are connected is crucial yet unclear. Through observations and model simulations, we demonstrate that the ASPV collapse in March amplified extreme SCP in April 2024. As stratospheric anomalies persistently propagated downward, March ASPV had a pronounced impact on the North Atlantic tropospheric circulation in April, exciting eastward-propagating Rossby waves. The resulting lower-tropospheric cyclonic anomaly over South China enhanced vertical motion and moisture transport, with vertical ascent dominating the extreme precipitation. The ASPV’s influence on SCP ranked just behind that of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and together they improved SCP predictability to 52%. A weakened March ASPV increased extreme April SCP occurrence by 45%. This finding reveals a robust polar−low-latitude teleconnection, highlighting the Arctic stratospheric signal as a crucial predictor in SCP and even low-latitude climate, further aiding in impact mitigation."

 Pesticides assured food security for decades, but have left humanity with degraded soils, polluted water, and biodiversity losses1. Enhanced crop diversity contributes to the regulation of insect pests, weeds, and diseases2–4, and is therefore assumed to allow pesticide reduction. At the cropping system scale, pesticide use is affected more by crop species than by the number of crops5, because crops have contrasting sensitivities to pests and contrasting pesticide requirements.

A composite diversity metric, combining indicators with the greatest explanatory power, accounted for 8% of the pesticide use variance, much less than the variance due to crop species. The results suggest that reducing agricultural reliance on pesticides through diversification is feasible when different components of diversity—namely, crop species and diversity features—are combined. Crop diversity enhancement can be a more efficient strategy for pesticide reduction if various components of functional diversity are considered, according to an analysis of 1285 cropping systems in French arable farms."

 :High spatial resolution Ice/snow Surface Temperature (IST) data provides prominent advantages for polar research, such as identification of sea ice lead, monitoring of surface melting on ice shelves and variations of polynyas. As the first satellite dedicated to sustainable development goals, SDGSAT-1 is equipped with 30 m thermal infrared bands, making it highly promising for monitoring fine scale process in polar regions. In this study, an optimal IST retrieval algorithm for SDGSAT-1 was selected from ten widely used Split-Window Algorithms (SWAs), with emphasis on two key criteria: low sensitivity to emissivity and high absolute retrieval accuracy. Sensitivity analysis identified four SWAs (PR1984, VI1991, UL1994, and Enter2019) exhibited low sensitivity to emissivity and sensor equivalent noise, and thereby for subsequent validation. Evaluation using simulated data showed that the overall uncertainty of four SWAs was less than 0.2 K, with PR1984 exhibiting a slight cold Bias of −0.16 K compared to the other three SWAs. Validation using in-situ IST data indicated that the overall uncertainty for four SWAs was less than 1.7 K, with a Bias of approximately −1 K, and PR1984 showed larger Bias and RMSE. Intercomparisons among the four SWAs and cross-validation with MODIS IST also demonstrated that PR1984 had a cold Bias compared to the other three algorithms, while VI1991, UL1994, and Enter2019 showed similar accuracy. Considering that Enter2019 has stability and low sensitivity to surface emissivity, high IST retrieval accuracy, and is widely applied and well recognized as the official land surface temperature retrieval algorithm for the VIIRS sensor, this study recommends Enter2019 as the optimal IST retrieval algorithm for SDGSAT-1. Additionally, three representative application cases—identification of sea ice leads, polynya monitoring, and extraction of geothermal springs, demonstrated the application capacity of SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared data in refined monitoring of polar ice/snow surface."

 Hyperspectral remote sensing has great potential for monitoring chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in optically complex waters. However, various hyperspectral indices currently used for retrieving Chla in productive waters exhibit drawbacks due to interference from other water parameters, imperfect atmospheric correction, and the constraints imposed by discrete spectral bands. To address these issues, we proposed a novel spectral index called the Red-Edge reflectance Peak Width Index (REPWI) for productive waters, which is defined as the horizontal wavelength distance from the fixed wavelength of red reflectance valley (678 nm) to the intersection of the right side of the red-edge reflectance peak curve. Firstly, the bio-optical model was used to clarify the theoretical basis and relationship between REPWI and Chla. Then, in situ remote sensing reflectance and Chla data from 57 water bodies worldwide were used to calibrate and validate the REPWI-based Chla retrieval model. The REPWI-based model achieved high accuracy (coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.92, mean relative error of 26.5 %, and root mean square error of 13.7 mg/m3), significantly outperforming other spectral indices. Furthermore, REPWI maintained a strong correlation with Chla (R2 = 0.87–0.90) when applied to major on-orbit hyperspectral satellites equivalent spectra. Finally, the REPWI-based Chla retrieval model was applied to ZY1-02D hyperspectral imagery, which obtained high accuracy and demonstrated resistance to imperfect atmospheric correction. In summary, this novel hyperspectral index, REPWI, has demonstrated a solid theoretical foundation and significant advantages in monitoring Chla in productive waters."

 Long-tailed class distributions pose a significant challenge in remote sensing scene recognition, where certain scene categories appear far less frequently than others. However, existing long-tailed learning approaches often overlook the unique spatial hierarchies and contextual semantic relationships inherent in remote sensing imagery, limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To address this, we propose Diversity-Mix Remote Sensing (DMRS), a foundation model-based framework designed for long-tailed remote sensing scene recognition. DMRS introduces two key innovations: (1) multi-low-rank adaptation diversity experts, which achieves balanced classification by specializing different experts for different regions of the class distribution, and (2) a semantic-aware mixing strategy, which incorporates textual semantic information typically unused in traditional classification to enhance perception across diverse remote sensing scenes. Extensive experiments on NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRS, achieving 6.7% and 2.0% improvements in overall accuracy, respectively, while significantly enhancing the recognition of tail classes. These results highlight the potential of DMRS in tackling long-tail challenges in remote sensing scene classification.

 The significant advances of cloud-based remote sensing frameworks have allowed researchers to develop large-scale analytics for better understanding, monitoring of, and decision-making around sensitive and valuable coastal ecosystems like seagrass meadows. However, an information gap related with the spatially-explicit accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) products has been identified. The goal of this study is to estimate the per pixel uncertainty of a Random Forest classification of four benthic habitats and exploit it to retrain the model through training data selection by bootstrapping and producing an ensemble model. The calculation of the spatially-explicit uncertainty is based on the Shannon Entropy equation and the probability values of a successful prediction according to the ML model. The remote sensing data for this study are sourced from the European Union Copernicus Sentinel-2 twin satellite system and Planet’s cubesat satellite constellation respectively, and have been processed and analyzed through the Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform. The national extent of The Bahamas and the regional extent of the Wakatobi archipelago in Indonesia comprise our study sites. Our results indicate the potential of the presented uncertainty workflow for optimizing the classification and the usefulness of the produced uncertainty map to aid policy-makers through our provided spatially-explicit accuracy metrics. More precisely in the case of the Bahamas, the percentile differences for seagrass user and producer accuracies are improved in the ranges of 1.16–4.77 % and 4.36–8.54 %, respectively, in comparison with a standard supervised classification. In conclusion, spatially-explicit uncertainty information can and should be used as unique and vital geospatial information suitable for ML classification optimization and as a tool for better decision-making and field expedition planning, and understanding of benthic ecosystems."

 Land use/land cover (LULC) classification based on deep learning techniques is a significant research area for analyzing high-resolution remote sensing(HRRS) images. However, due to the limitation of available samples and model feature extraction capability, the current deep learning methods suffer from weak generalization ability for widespread and effective application across diverse HRRS scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an innovative network model named multi-level feature adaptation-segment anything Model (MLFA-SAM). The model employs a three-level fine-tuning strategy to adapt the SAM foundation model for remote sensing LULC classification. The proposed MLFA-SAM significantly enhances high-precision classification performance across diverse HRRS scenarios. Specifically, the domain distribution shift adaptation (DDSA) level is designed to adjust the input image modality for SAM and initially extract features and overcome the domain distribution shift between remote sensing images and the natural images used by the SAM. Then, we designed depthwise low-rank adaptation (DLRA) strategy to optimally fine-tune the frozen SAM parameters. Finally, we improved SAM’s mask decoder to generate high-quality multi-class masks required for LULC classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the MLFA-SAM model surpasses several existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods on the HRLC dataset and the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MLFA-SAM, with its concise yet efficient architecture, achieves 66.77% mIoU and 86.02% OA on the HRLC dataset. Notably, the integration of near-infrared (Nir) bands further enhances its performance to 68.43% mIoU and 87.91% OA. The generalization test on the LoveDA dataset, along with four test HRRS images exhibiting spatiotemporal and semantic scene differences, further demonstrate that MLFA-SAM possesses a stronger generalization ability compared to existing methods and shows greater potential for practical applications."

 Size-dependent airborne metal solubility in air and living organisms has been identified as a key parameter to understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, global biogeochemical cycles, indoor air quality, and aerosol toxicity. Emission sources play a dominant role in size-dependent airborne metal solubility, which could be enhanced by atmospheric aging. Studies show that toxic metals (e.g., heavy metals) concentrated in submicron particles tend to have a higher solubility compared to crustal metals and possess even higher solubility levels in biological fluids than those in water, which may trigger more adverse health effects. Factors related to metal solubility and particle size, such as liquid water concentrations and acidity levels, mixing states, and particle parameters of particles, were discussed. Analytical techniques on various scales play an essential role in accurately measuring size-dependent metal solubility, particularly for soluble fractions.

 Anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 emissions play a crucial role in the distribution of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, making the quantification of these emissions essential for global and regional carbon cycle research. In this study, we simulated global atmospheric CO2 concentrations by substituting anthropogenic emission inventories based on a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to assess the impact of two widely used global CO2 emission inventories (ODIAC and EDGAR) on the simulations. The findings indicated that while the two emission inventories exhibited similar spatiotemporal distributions, discrepancies of up to 10 gC/m2/d were observed. The simulation results using the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory were more closely aligned with ground-based station observations, with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and an average bias of 0.09 ppm. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions contributed to an average global column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) increase of 7.01 ppm from 2018 to 2020. High-emission regions correspond to areas of significant XCO2 growth, particularly in the industrialized northern extratropics, with XCO2 increases reaching up to 11.59 ppm. The sensitivity of simulated XCO2 to uncertainties in anthropogenic CO2 emission inventories was highest in western Europe and lower in Oceania and South America.

 Changes in rainfall seasonality can have far-reaching impacts on the livelihood of population, agricultural production, and ecosystem sustainability. However, the changes in rainfall seasonality and associated climatic causes are largely unclear, especially in global land monsoon regions. Here, we analyzed the variations of rainfall seasonality during 1960–2022, and explored the possible effects of global climate teleconnections (CTs) on rainfall seasonality changes in global land monsoon regions using interpretable machine learning and multivariate wavelet coherency method. The results show that rainfall seasonality weakens significantly in northeastern South Asian, northeastern South American, and most parts of southern North African and South African monsoon regions, but enhances significantly in southern South Asian, northern North African, and southwestern South American monsoon regions. Rainfall seasonality also experiences an abrupt change in all hotspots during 1960–2022. We also find that many CTs are nonmonotonically related to rainfall seasonality in these hotspots, and the key CTs that explain the variations in rainfall seasonality differ across different hotspots using interpretable machine learning. The coupled influences of the key CTs on rainfall seasonality are also significant at certain scales during different periods in these hotspots. However, the key CTs have undergone changes, with stronger impacts on rainfall seasonality in almost all hotspots since 1990s.

This study investigates the response characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation to clean, coarse aerosol-polluted, and fine aerosol-polluted conditions using summer data from 2014 to 2023 from GPM DPR, MERRA-2, Himawari-8/9 AHI, and ERA-5 over the YRD, and further explores the sensitivity of aerosols to thermodynamic (RH) and dynamic (CAPE) meteorological conditions. Key findings include: (1) In convective precipitation, the suppression of precipitation and lowering of cloud-top height under coarse aerosol-polluted conditions result from moisture competition, whereas the enhancement of precipitation under fine aerosol-polluted conditions is attributed to the condensation nuclei enhancement and coalescence growth effect. (2) Stratiform precipitation exhibits a “lower-layer promotion-upper-layer inhibition” boomerang variation effect under polluted conditions. (3) Aerosol pollution enhances the coalescence process and weakens the breakup process (which was more significant under coarse aerosol-polluted conditions). (4) Under polluted conditions, the increase in RH leads to enhanced coalescence and suppressed breakup, whereas the elevation of CAPE results in the opposite effect on these processes. These findings highlight the critical role of aerosol type in modulating precipitation mechanisms, providing a foundation for refining parameterizations in weather and climate models."

 To study the distribution characteristics of aerosols and clouds in South China under the influence of typical weather systems such as the southern trough, this paper analyzed the distribution and sources of aerosols and cloud droplets based on six flight observations conducted in Guangdong during the spring of 2024. The results indicated that aerosol number concentrations often peak above cloud tops or in the regions between two cloud layers. The average aerosol number concentration outside the clouds at high altitudes (2000–4100 m) ranged from 501 to 1617 cm−3, while in the near-surface layer it was 970 to 2168 cm−3, with an effective diameter averaging 0.27 to 0.5 μm. The concentration inside the clouds significantly decreased, and the diameter increased. The aerosol particle spectrum displayed a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 0.15 μm and 0.29 μm. The number concentration of particles smaller than 0.3 μm within the clouds declined, while the proportion of particles larger than 0.5 μm increased. The cloud droplet spectrum displayed a multimodal distribution, with the main peak occurring at a diameter of around 5 μm and secondary peaks found at diameters in the range of 10 to 16 μm. As the cloud layer thickened, the droplet spectrum broadened, large droplet concentrations increased, and small droplet concentrations decreased. Under the influence of non-precipitating stratus clouds in South China, the average aerosol scavenging efficiency was 0.47. The mean cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water content, and effective diameter were 67.3 cm−3, 0.02 g·m−3, and 9.4 μm, respectively. Long-range transport originating from South Asia and Southeast Asia is suggested as a potential contributing factor to the elevated high-altitude aerosol concentrations.

Diminished neural selectivity—reduced differential responses to preferred versus nonpreferred stimuli—may contribute to memory decline, but its drivers remain unclear. We investigated the effects of top-down attention and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology on neural selectivity in 166 cognitively unimpaired older participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a word-face/word-place associative memory task. During learning, neural selectivity in place- and, to a lesser extent, face-selective regions was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten events; positively scaled with variability in dorsal attention network activity, within and across individuals; and negatively related to AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma phosphorylated Tau181(pTau181). Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity mediated the effects of age, attention, and pTau181on memory.

A critical yet poorly constrained parameter is whether crustal carbon can “survive” devolatilization processes that accompany slab subduction and therefore influence deep carbon budgets. Carbonatites provide a key record to address this important topic. Here, we present high-precision potassium isotope data for a large set of carbonatite samples from both continental and oceanic settings, spanning from 2 billion years ago to the present. Modeling suggests that the heavy potassium isotopic compositions of carbonatites are inherited from their mantle sources, rather than resulting from magmatic and postmagmatic processes. Our results demonstrate a strong link between the subduction of oceanic crust and the recycling of carbonates into the mantle sources of carbonatites.

These kinases interact with clathrin light chain 2 (CLC2), facilitating its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in response to Zeocin and ABA treatment.

Here, we reported a straightforward strategy to achieving visible-to-infrared photoabsorption covering 630 to 2000 nanometers in inorganic perovskites by incorporating supramolecular crown ethers. Crown ethers enable supramolecular host-guest complexation and the formation of self-organizing Turing structures composed of original perovskites and supramolecular hybrid crystals.

We attribute the evidence of episodic reef growth and ephemeral sea-level fall to the competing influence of Northern Hemisphere ice melt and Antarctic ice regrowth.

To choose between these options, we tested whether extracellular mobility of Chordin, a hallmark of shuttling but dispensable for local inhibition, is required for patterning inNematostella. By generating localized Chordin sources in the Chordin morphant background, we showed that mobile Chordin is necessary and sufficient to establish a peak of BMP signaling opposite to Chordin source.

Although the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ROS production and scavenging genes have been studied, the regulation of these TFs to control ROS accumulation remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that during N nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–mediated immunity, Alfin-like 7 (AL7) is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 7 (UBR7). UBR7 interacts with AL7 and acts as a molecular brake to mediate the ubiquitination of AL7 at lysine-20, leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation. UBR7 functions upstream of AL7 to reduce AL7-induced ROS accumulation duringN-mediated defense. The phosphorylation of AL7 at serine-174 enhances its interaction with UBR7, thereby increasing AL7 ubiquitination and reducing AL7 stability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which ROS accumulation is regulated through the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of a TF during the immune response.

The ability to create one-dimensional electron waveguides with this specificity creates opportunities to test, via analog quantum simulation, theories about chirality and spin-polarized electron transport in one-dimensional geometries."

Levings,Armored human CAR Treg cells with PD1 promoter-driven IL-10 have enhanced suppressive function,"Regulatory T cell (Tregcell) therapy has been transformed through the use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). We previously found that human Tregcells minimally produce IL-10 and have a limited capacity to control innate immunity compared to type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells). To create “hybrid” CAR Tregcells with Tr1 cell-like properties, we examined whether thePDCD1locus could be exploited to endow Tregcells with CAR-regulated IL-10 expression. CRISPR-mediated PD1 deletion increased CAR Tregcell activation, and knock-in ofIL10under control of the PD1 promoter resulted in CAR-induced IL-10 secretion.IL10knock-in improved CAR Tregcell function, as determined by increased suppression of dendritic cells and alloantigen- and islet autoantigen–specific T cells. In vivo,IL10knock-in CAR Tregcells were stable, safe, and suppressed dendritic cells and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. CRISPR-mediated engineering to simultaneously remove an inhibitory signal and enhance a suppressive mechanism is a previously unexplored approach to improve CAR Tregcell potency."

Here, we demonstrate that information from negative chemical reactions can be leveraged to improve reactivity-prediction models, offering advantages in scenarios with a limited volume of successful data. We extend the tuning of language models with reinforcement learning to the chemistry domain, training a transformer model for chemical reaction prediction. Our approach is evaluated using both a rigorously controlled dataset and a realistic high-throughput dataset comprising extensive reaction screenings across diverse catalysts sets and experimental conditions. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging information from as few as 20 positive data points in the controlled dataset, supported by a negative dataset at least 40 times larger. Consistent results on both datasets demonstrate that, with an appropriate optimization strategy and the inclusion of unsuccessful experimental data, models can be effectively trained even when successful reactions are underrepresented."

Kalli,Regulation of PIEZO1 channel force sensitivity by interblade handshaking,"PIEZOs form trimeric calcium-permeable nonselective cationic channels that serve mechanical sensing needs across eukaryotic biology. Forces act on the channels by causing their curved blades to flatten and decompact, leading to an activated state, but it is unclear how this is regulated to enable the channels to adapt to different contexts. To identify potential mechanisms, we performed coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on human PIEZO1. We observed an interblade handshake interaction mediated by basic amino acid residues in two flexible helices coordinated with regulated anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The interaction determined the resting configuration of the channel, blade curvature, compactness, and ion pore structure. In experiments, disruption of the handshake by neutralization of helix amino acids or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion increased the channel’s sensitivity to membrane tension. Structural and amino acid sequence analysis for multiple PIEZOs predicted helix amino acid arrangements for varied handshaking intensity. We suggest a dynamic interaction in PIEZO channels that regulates force sensitivity."

The mechanism underlying this coordination is not well understood. Here, we show that a conserved molecular chaperone, chloroplast signal recognition particle 43-kDa protein (cpSRP43), provides a molecular thermostat that helps maintain this coordination. cpSRP43 undergoes a conformational rearrangement between a well-folded closed state and a partially disordered open state. Closed cpSRP43 is dedicated to the biogenesis of LHCPs, whereas open cpSRP43 protects multiple Chl biosynthesis enzymes from heat-induced destabilization. Rising temperature shifts cpSRP43 to the open state, enabling it to protect heat-destabilized Chl biosynthesis enzymes. Our results reveal the molecular basis of a posttranslational mechanism for the thermoadaptation of LHC biogenesis. They also demonstrate how an adenosine triphosphate–independent chaperone uses conformational dynamics to switch its activity and client selectivity, thereby adapting to different proteostatic demands under shifting environmental conditions."

The study reveals that the autophagy-regulating gene PLAC8 (placenta-specific 8) is significantly involved in Cd-induced prostate carcinogenesis, and NF-κB acts as the upstream transcriptional activator of PLAC8, which then selectively up-regulates BCL-xL, providing a survival advantage to Cd-transformed cells. NF-κB activation stabilizes PLAC8 in the cytosol, disrupting autophagy by allowing PLAC8 to colocalize with LC3B instead of LAMP1. Silencing NF-κB down-regulates PLAC8 and its survival function while inhibiting NF-κB or PLAC8, which restores autophagy and decreases tumor growth in xenograft models. In addition, targeting BCL-xL confirmed this signaling pathway. The findings suggest that sustained NF-κB activation regulates PLAC8 and highlights the NF-κB–PLAC8–BCL-xL axis as a potential target for early detection and therapies in metal-induced prostate cancer."

In topological insulator (TI)–based JJs, measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) can reveal unconventional effects such as Majorana bound states (MBS) and nonreciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field has not been attempted. Here, we present a platform for field-dependent CPR measurements in planar JJs made of NbSe2and few-layer Bi2Se3. When a flux quantumΦ0threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip CPR structure and nonreciprocal supercurrent flow. We show that these arise from a nonuniform supercurrent distribution that also leads to a robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. Furthermore, despite numerous previous studies, we find no evidence of MBS. Our results establish magnetic field–dependent CPR as a powerful probe of TI-based superconducting devices and offer design strategies for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics."

Key to success is the precise recognition between electron-deficient alkenes and electron-rich alkenes and streamlined alkyl-alkyl bond forming with the control of chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity. This strategy requires alkenes as sole precursors for asymmetric alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling, circumventing the use of stoichiometric amounts of alkyl electrophiles or alkyl nucleophiles as coupling partners.

It has been hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) in contrast to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can reduce tree species diversity in local communities, which remains to be tested at the global scale. To address this gap, we analyzed global forest inventory data and revealed that the relationship between tree species richness and EcM tree proportion varied along environmental gradients. Specifically, the relationship is more negative at low latitudes and in moist conditions but is unimodal at high latitudes and in arid conditions. The negative association of EcM tree proportion on species diversity at low latitudes and in humid conditions is likely due to more negative plant-soil microbial interactions in these regions. These findings extend our knowledge on the mechanisms shaping global patterns in plant species diversity from a belowground view."

Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a sixfold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice’s field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal’s topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a twofold anisotropic response indicative of the emergence of a symmetry-broken many-body state.

Spatially dispersed delocalized singlet excitons (DSEs) in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) provide an alternative channel to promote charge generation without interfacial CT state. Here, we manipulate intermolecular interactions, carrier dynamics, and photovoltaic properties through selective asymmetric fluorination. Two asymmetric molecules, Z12 and Z13, were synthesized by substituting the terminal group with different fluorine atoms compared with the symmetrical molecule, Z11. Z12 showed enhanced molecular interactions, promoting to more compact and ordered stacking, which in turn promotes the DSE formation, benefiting the synergistic enhancement ofVOCandJSC. The D18:Z12-based device achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, notably outperforming the other two devices.
