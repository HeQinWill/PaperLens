The range of mitigation potential estimates from integrated assessment models raises concerns about the capacity of land systems to provide realistic, cost-effective and permanent land-based mitigation. We use the Global Change Analysis Model to quantify the economic mitigation potential of forests-based measures by simulating a climate policy including a tax on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. In addition, we assess how constraining unused arable land (UAL) availability, forestland expansion rates, and global bioenergy demand may influence the forests-based mitigation potential by simulating scenarios with alternative combinations of constraints. Results show that the average forests-based mitigation potential in 2020–2050 increases from 738 MtCO2.yr−1 through a forestland increase of 86 Mha in the fully constrained scenario to 1394 MtCO2.yr−1 through a forestland increase of 146 Mha when all constraints are relaxed. Regional potentials in terms of A/R and RDF differ strongly between scenarios: unconstrained forest expansion rates mostly increase A/R potentials in northern regions (e.g., +120 MtCO2.yr−1 in North America); while unconstrained UAL conversion and low bioenergy demand mostly increase RDF potentials in tropical regions (e.g., +76 and +68 MtCO2.yr−1 in Southeast Asia, respectively). This study shows that forests-based mitigation is limited by many factors that constrain the rates of land use change across regions. These factors, often overlooked in modelling exercises, should be carefully addressed for understanding the role of forests in global climate mitigation and defining pledges towards the Paris Agreement."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad78ec,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是秘鲁-智利上升流系统中浮游生物群落能量传递的季节性和年际变化机制。研究利用了区域物理-生物地球化学海洋模型模拟（CROCO-BioEBUS）从1990年到2010年的数据，并发现年际尺度上，浮游生物的跨岸分布受离岸表层流的影响，而季节尺度上，混合层深度是影响浮游生物动力学（包括营养级传递）的主要因素。论文强调了控制浮游生物营养级传递的机制在不同时间尺度上的差异，并指出仅仅从季节性发现推断气候变化背景下长期营养级传递变化可能是不够的。 这篇论文主要关注海洋生态系统，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Tianfei Xue;Ivy Frenger;Jaard Hauschildt;Andreas Oschlies,Mechanisms regulating trophic transfer in the Humboldt Upwelling System differ across time scales,"The Humboldt Upwelling System hosts a highly productive ecosystem with central importance for global fisheries, yet with strong seasonal and interannual variability in the planktonic base of the food chain ultimately affecting fish yield. Understanding the variability in energy transfer within the plankton community in the contemporary climate can provide valuable insights for future projections of planktonic dynamics. Therefore, we use a regional physical-biogeochemical ocean model simulation (CROCO-BioEBUS) from 1990 to 2010 to investigate the underlying mechanisms of seasonal and interannual variability of the trophic transfer. Our model simulations suggest that, on an interannual scale, variations in trophic transfer are governed by variations in the offshore surface flow that modulate the plankton cross-shore distribution. Weak offshore surface flow, as simulated during the El Niño period, allows the zooplankton to stay relatively close to the shore, leading to more efficient grazing and trophic transfer compared to years with strong offshore flow. This mechanism differs from the seasonal one, where the mixed layer depth is the primary driver of variations in plankton dynamics, including trophic transfer. Our results highlight that mechanisms controlling plankton trophic transfer differ across time scales, and thus stress that extrapolating solely from seasonal findings to understand long-term trophic transfer changes in the context of climate change may be insufficient."

This poses a major challenge as nearly 40% of the global population lives under water scarcity, including areas such as Bangladesh, which is one of the largest, most populous and climate-vulnerable deltas (Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna: GBM) in the world. Here, we aim (first attempt) to analyse the historical dynamics (spatial and temporal) of river flows in 10 major rivers and provide policy implications using a safe operating space (SOS) concept for the Bangladesh delta. In general, the space just before the unsustainable state is defined as an SOS, within which humanity can safely thrive and beyond which is dangerous to humanity. Time series analysis highlights that all seasonal river flow shows a decreasing trend in the last three decades except in the winter season. The hydrological alteration using range of variability approach confirms that the majority of the river flow has been altered high to severely including three major rivers (Ganges, Jamuna, and Old Brahmaputra) in the Bangladesh delta. Our findings show that four out of ten rivers (Ganges (dry season), Gorai, Halda and Old Brahmaputra) exceeded the SOS, with the rest of the six rivers given cautious status considering the hydrological alteration (moderate to severe) in the Bangladesh delta. Our assessment provides scientific evidence to inform science and policy related to transboundary water disputes and achieving SDGs in Bangladesh and South Asia."

SCG helps relay the preferences of international consumers to producers and fills environmental policy gaps. Brazil’s Zero-Deforestation Cattle Agreements (CA) are one of the longest-standing examples of SCG but shortcomings in implementation have reduced their conservation impacts. Chief among the reasons for their limited effect is that slaughterhouses monitor only the suppliers they buy from directly. This does not account for the complex supply network upstream of the direct sale, whose dynamics are also poorly understood. We provide the first comprehensive characterization of the strength and duration of cattle supply chain relationships based on animal transaction records from across the Brazilian Amazon. Whereas direct supply relationships (from ranchers to slaughterhouses) are relatively few and long-lasting, upstream relationships between ranchers are numerous and short-lived. Expanding monitoring to include these upstream sup- pliers increases the number of monitored transactions by an order of magnitude. However, 1% of the largest direct suppliers sell nearly half of cattle to CA slaughterhouses. More comprehensive upstream monitoring of only these prolific suppliers could greatly increase coverage at a fraction of the cost. While it may be challenging to monitor the entire supply network, significant advancements are within reach."

With AMI, utilities have also gained the opportunity to provide real-time high-resolution water consumption information to their customers to induce conservation. Using a randomized controlled trial we find that on average homes that install AMI and receive conservation based messaging significantly reduce water consumption by 5.24 gallons per household per day beyond savings already obtained from home water reports. Of the estimated water savings we attribute 92.8% to leak reduction. While the payback period from the deployment of AMI meters and treatment in all homes is over 41 years, homes that experience leaks realize financial savings of $60/year and a treatment payback period of four years. This is because treatment did not induce water or financial savings in homes without leaks. These findings indicate that even on top of existing conservation programs, AMI messaging that targets end-user leaks could result in significant water savings, economic benefits to end-users, and advance conservation goals."

NPF features differ between site categories, implying the crucial role of local environmental factors such as the degree of emissions and meteorological conditions. The results also underscore the importance of local environments when assessing the impact of NPF on climate in models. 
 As an important source of sub-micrometer particles, atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) has been observed in various environments. However, most studies provide little more than snapshots of the NPF process due to their underlying observations being limited in space and time. To obtain statistically relevant evidence on NPF across various environments, we investigated the characteristics of NPF based on a 5-year dataset of the German Ultrafine Aerosol Network (GUAN). The results were also compared with observations in previous studies, with the aim to depict a relatively complete picture of NPF in central Europe. The highest NPF occurrence frequency was observed in regional background sites, with an average of about 19 %, followed by urban background (15 %), low-mountain-range (7 %), and high Alpine (3 %) sites. The annual mean growth rate between 10 and 25 nm varied from 3.7–4.7 nm h−1, while the formation rate with same size range 10–25 nm from 0.4 to 2.9 cm−3 s−1. The contribution of NPF to ultrafine particles (UFPs) was about 13 %, 21 %, and 7 % for the urban background, regional background, and low mountain range, respectively. The influence of NPF on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentration and the aerosol extinction coefficient for NPF days was the highest in mountainous areas. These findings underscore the importance of local environments when assessing the potential impact of NPF on regional climate in models, and they also emphasize the usefulness of a long-term aerosol measurement network for understanding the variation in NPF features and their influencing factors over a regional scale."

 The advancement of analytical techniques, such as comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC×GC–MS), enables the efficient separation of complex organics. Developing innovative methods for data processing and analysis is crucial to unlock the full potential of GC×GC–MS in understanding intricate chemical mixtures. In this study, we proposed an innovative method for the semi-automated identification and quantification of complex organic mixtures using GC×GC–MS. The method was formulated based on self-constructed mass spectrum patterns and the traversal algorithms and was applied to organic vapor and aerosol samples collected from the tailpipe emissions of heavy-duty diesel vehicles and the ambient atmosphere. Thousands of compounds were filtered, speciated, and clustered into 26 categories, including aliphatic and cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic oxygenated species, phenols and alkylphenols, and heteroatom-containing species. The identified species accounted for over 80 % of all the eluted chromatographic peaks at the molecular level. A comprehensive analysis of quantification uncertainty was undertaken. Using representative compounds, quantification uncertainties were found to be less than 37.67 %, 22.54 %, and 12.74 % for alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and alkyl-substituted benzenes, respectively, across the GC×GC space, excluding the first and the last time intervals. From a source apportionment perspective, adamantane was clearly isolated as a potential tracer for heavy-duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) emissions. The systematic distribution of nitrogen-containing compounds in oxidized and reduced valences was discussed, and many of them served as critical tracers for secondary nitrate formation processes. The results highlighted the benefits of developing self-constructed models for the enhanced peak identification, automated cluster analysis, robust uncertainty estimation, and source apportionment and achieving the full potential of GC×GC–MS in atmospheric chemistry."

The UAS can reach hazardous environments to sample volcanic particles, and measure in-situ key parameters such as the atmospheric concentration of volcanic aerosols and gases. Acquired data bridge the gap between the existing approaches of ground sampling and remote sensing, hence contributing to the understanding of volcanic cloud dispersion and impact. 
 Volcanic degassing and explosive eruptions inject significant amounts of gas and ash into the atmosphere, impacting the local environment and atmospheric dynamics from local to global scales. While ground- and satellite-based remote sensing systems are key to describing explosive volcanism and assessing associated hazards, direct in situ measurements inside volcanic clouds are not possible with these methods. This study presents an innovative approach using an Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) for (i) airborne ash sampling and (ii) measurements of aerosol and gas concentrations (AeroVolc system). Commercial instruments (DJITM Matrice 30 Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV), AlphasenseTM N3 Optical Particle Counter OPC, SoarabilityTM Sniffer4D Mini2 multigas hardware) were combined with custom-built ash collectors and particle counters to enable a more detailed analysis of volcanic clouds. Here we showcase the deployment of our UAS on Sakurajima (Japan) and Etna (Italy), two volcanoes known for their frequent explosive eruptions and persistent degassing activity, to demonstrate how this approach enables in situ, high-resolution sample and data collection within challenging environments. Results provide grain size distributions (GSDs), information on the occurrence of particle aggregation, as well as solid aerosol (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and gas (SO2 and CO2) concentrations. Depending on whether the UAS was operated within or below ash- and/or gas-rich clouds, different insights were gained that open up new perspectives for volcanological research. These insights include the composition, concentration, generation, dispersion and sedimentation patterns of volcanic clouds."

It is used worldwide to help assess the trace gas exchange, critical to understanding climate change. However, their physical framework interferes with the flow they measure. We present a new way to correct measurements from sonic anemometers of several types. The method uses measurements of vertical wind velocity and other turbulent velocities, compares their ratios, and from this yields correction factors for sonic anemometers. 
 Non-orthogonal sonic anemometers are used extensively in flux networks and biomicrometeorological research. Previous studies have hypothesized potential underestimation of the vertical velocity turbulent perturbations, necessitating correction to increase flux measurements by approximately 10 %, while some studies have refuted that any correction is needed. Those studies have used cross comparisons between sonic anemometers and numerical simulations. Here we propose a method that yields a correction factor for vertical velocity that requires only a single sonic anemometer in situ but requires some assumptions and adequate fetch at a sufficient distance above roughness elements where surface similarity is valid. Correction factors could be important in adjusting flux network and other flux data, as well as assessing the energy budget closure that is used as one of the flux data quality measures. The correction factor is confirmed in one field experiment and comparison between a CSAT3 and RMY 81000VRE, but it does not work well for the more complex form factors shown in a field comparison of an IRGAson and a CSAT3a."

 Ozone profile measurements at high temporal and vertical resolution are needed to better understand physical processes driving tropospheric ozone variability and to validate the tropospheric ozone measurements from spaceborne missions such as TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution). As part of the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) efforts allocated to provide such measurements, and leveraging on the experience of more than 20 years of ozone lidar measurements at Table Mountain Facility, the JPL lidar group developed the SMOL (Small Mobile Ozone Lidar), an affordable differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system covering all altitudes from 200 m to 10 km. a.g.l. The transmitter is based on a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser which is further converted into a 289/299 nm wavelength pair using Raman shifting cells, and the receiver consists of three ozone DIAL pairs of 266/289 and 289/299 nm. Two units were deployed in the Los Angeles basin area during the Synergistic TEMPO Air Quality Science (STAQS) and Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) campaigns in summer 2023.

The dataset aims to serve as a powerful tool for better understanding climate change over the European Alpine region. 
 The Extended European Alpine Region (EEAR) exhibits a well-established and very high-density network of in-situ weather stations, hardly attainable in other mountainous regions of the world. However, the strong fragmentation into national and regional administrations and the diversity of data sources have so far hampered full exploitation of the available data for climate research. Here, we present EEAR-Clim, a new observational dataset gathering in-situ daily measurements of air temperature and precipitation from a variety of meteorological and hydrological services covering the whole EEAR. Data collected include time series from recordings up to 2020, the longest ones spanning up to 200 years. The overall observational network encompasses about 9000 in-situ weather stations, significantly enhancing data coverage at high elevations and achieving an average spatial density of one station per 6.8 8 km2 over the period 1991–2020. Data collected from many sources were tested for quality to ensure internal, temporal, and spatial consistency of time series, including outliers removal. Data homogeneity was assessed through a cross-comparison of the outcomes using three methods well established in the literature, namely Climatol, ACMANT, and RH Test. Quantile matching was applied to adjust inhomogeneous periods in time series. Overall, about 4 % of data were flagged as non-reliable and about 20 % of air temperature time series were corrected for one or more inhomogeneous periods. In the case of precipitation time series, fewer breakpoints were detected, confirming the well-known challenge of properly identifying inhomogeneities in noisy data. The dataset aims to serve as a powerful tool for better understanding climate change over the European Alps."

 The Marine Ice Sheet–Ocean Model Intercomparison Project – phase 2 (MISOMIP2) is a natural progression of previous and ongoing model intercomparison exercises that have focused on the simulation of ice-sheet and ocean processes in Antarctica. The previous exercises motivate the move towards realistic configurations, as well as more diverse model parameters and resolutions. The main objective of MISOMIP2 is to investigate the performance of existing ocean and coupled ice-sheet–ocean models in a range of Antarctic environments through comparisons to observational data. We will assess the status of ice-sheet–ocean modelling as a community and identify common characteristics of models that are best able to capture observed features. As models are highly tuned based on present-day data, we will also compare their sensitivity to prescribed abrupt atmospheric perturbations leading to either very warm or slightly warmer ocean conditions compared to the present day. The approach of MISOMIP2 is to welcome contributions of models as they are, including global and regional configurations, but we request standardized variables and common grids for the outputs. We target the analysis at two specific regions, the Amundsen Sea and the Weddell Sea, since they describe two different ocean environments and have been relatively well observed compared to other areas of Antarctica. An observational “MIPkit” synthesizing existing ocean and ice-sheet observations for a common period is provided to evaluate ocean and ice-sheet models in these two regions."

PyEt, a tested and open-source Python package, simplifies the application of 20 PET methods for both time series and gridded data, ensuring accurate and consistent PET estimations suitable for a wide range of environmental applications. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial flux of the hydrological water balance, commonly estimated using (semi-)empirical formulas. The estimated flux may strongly depend on the formula used, adding uncertainty to the outcomes of environmental studies using ET. Climate change may cause additional uncertainty, as the ET estimated by each formula may respond differently to changes in meteorological input data. To include the effects of model uncertainty and climate change and facilitate the use of these formulas in a consistent, tested, and reproducible workflow, we present PyEt. PyEt is an open-source Python package for the estimation of daily potential evapotranspiration (PET) using available meteorological data. It allows the application of 20 different PET methods on both time series and gridded datasets. The majority of the implemented methods are benchmarked against literature values and tested with continuous integration to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

In order to understand the impacts and consequences of climate interventions such as stratospheric aerosol injection, complex models are often necessary. We use a case study to illustrate how we can understand the inner workings of a complex model. We present this technique as an exploratory tool that can be used to quickly discover and assess relationships in complex climate data. 
 Machine learning (ML) models are commonly used to generate predictions, but these models can also support the discovery of new science. Generating accurate predictions necessitates that a model captures the structure of the underlying data. If the structure is properly extracted, ML could be a useful exploratory and evidential tool. In this paper, we present a case study that demonstrates the use of ML for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the climate space. We apply the ML explainability method of spatio-temporal zeroed feature importance (stZFI) to understand how climate variable associations evolve over space and time. Our analyses focus on data from ensembles of earth systems models (ESMs), which provide data on different climate states and conditions. We elect to work with ESM ensembles since they allow us to compare feature importance across alternative scenarios not available with observed data. The ensembles also account for natural variability, so we can distinguish between signal and noise due to natural climate variability when computing feature importance. For our analyses, we consider the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo: a large stratospheric aerosol injection. We explore the climate pathway associated with the eruption from aerosols to radiation to temperature at both the near-surface and stratospheric levels. In addition to applying the method to data generated from two different ESMs, we apply stZFI to reanalysis data to compare the associations identified by stZFI. We show how stZFI tracks the importance of aerosol optical depth over time on forecasting temperatures. This case study illustrates usefulness of an ML tool (stZFI) for EDA on a well studied climate exemplar."

The GDM group suffered distinctly higher serum concentrations of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tri(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tri-iso-propyl phosphate (TIPP), and tri(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) than the healthy control group (p < 0.001). Traditional analysis methods employed for either individual or mixture effects found positive correlations (p < 0.05) between the concentrations of five OPEs (i.e., TNBP, TBOEP, TPHP, TIPP, and TCIPP) and the incidence of GDM, while 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate, tri(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate exhibited opposite effects. Three machine learning methods considering the concurrence of OPE mixture exposure and population characteristics were applied to clarify their relative importance to GDM risk, among which random forest performed the best. Several OPEs, particularly TNBP and TBOEP ranking at the top, made greater contributions than some demographical characteristics, such as prepregnancy body mass index and family history of diabetes, to the occurrence of GDM.

This study comprehensively examines OPEs in surface seawater of the central Arctic Ocean during the summer of 2020, integrating surface ocean current and sea ice concentration data. The results confirm significant spatiotemporal variations of the OPEs, with the total concentration of seven major OPEs averaging 780 ± 970 pg/L. Chlorinated OPEs, particularly tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), were dominant. The significant impact of hydrodynamics on the OPE transport is demonstrated by higher OPE concentrations in regions with strong surface currents, especially at the edge of the Beaufort Gyre and the confluence of the Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar Drift. Furthermore, OPE levels were generally higher in drifting-ice-covered regions compared to ice-free regions, attributed to the volatilization of dissolved OPEs formerly trapped below the sea ice or newly released from melting snow and sea ice. Notably, TCPP decreased by only 19% in the ice-free area, while the more volatile triphenyl phosphate decreased by 63% compared with the partial ice region."

However, how As impacts CH4 production, oxidation, and emission dynamics is unknown. Here, we investigated the abundances and activities of CH4-cycling microbes from 132 paddy soils with different As concentrations across continental China using metagenomics and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Our results revealed that As was a crucial factor affecting the abundance and distribution patterns of the mcrA gene, which is responsible for CH4 production and anaerobic CH4 oxidation. Laboratory incubation experiments showed that adding 30 mg kg–1 arsenate increased 13CO2 production by 10-fold, ultimately decreasing CH4 emissions by 68.5%. The inhibition of CH4 emissions by As was induced through three aspects: (1) the toxicity of As decreased the abundance and activity of the methanogens; (2) the adaptability and response of methanotrophs to As is beneficial for CH4 oxidation under As stress; and (3) the more robust arsenate reduction would anaerobically consume more CH4 in paddies. Additionally, significant positive correlations were observed between arsC and pmoA gene abundance in both the observational study and incubation experiment.

In 2020, China’s N fertilizer system emitted 496.04 Tg of CO2eq and 3.74 Tg of NH3, with ammonia production and N fertilizer application processes contributing 36 and 85% of the life-cycle CO2eq and NH3 emissions, respectively.

For every ton of N fertilizer produced and used in China, 16 t of CO2eq and 0.18 t of NH3 were emitted, compared to 9.7 t of CO2eq and 0.13 t of NH3 in Europe. By adopting currently available technologies, improving N fertilizer utilization efficiency and employing nitrification inhibitors could synergistically reduce CO2eq emissions by 20% and NH3 emissions by 75%, while energy transformation efforts would primarily reduce CO2eq emissions by 59%.

However, owing to the significant spatiotemporal variations in water cycling driven by fluctuations in surface water, submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), and seawater, our understanding of P cycling remains inadequate. Therefore, we applied a passive sampling method using a Zr-loaded resin (Pas-Zir method) to analyze the phosphate oxygen isotope ratio (δ18OPO4) at a tidal flat dominated by SGD on Ikuchijima Island in western Japan. A Zr-loaded resin that selectively adsorbed phosphate ions was installed, and the δ18OPO4 values were monitored at the tidal flat bottom, at 5 cm above the bottom, in SGD, and in seawater for a month. The range of δ18OPO4 values at the tidal flat bottom and above the bottom (17.0‰–18.8‰) exceeded the analytical precision of the δ18OPO4 analysis (±0.4‰) and deviate from the expected isotopic equilibrium by pyrophosphatase. The results indicate that the time-integrated δ18OPO4 data can provide information on the P cycling during tidal cycles.

We integrated our NCA measurements with a comprehensive material balance model to analyze sVCP-nucleated indoor  NCA dynamics. Our results reveal that sVCPs significantly increase indoor terpene mixing ratios (10–1,000 ppb), exceeding those in outdoor forested environments. The emitted terpenes react with indoor atmospheric O3 and initiate indoor NPF, resulting in nucleation rates as high as ∼105 cm–3 s–1 and condensational growth rates up to 300 nm h–1; these are orders of magnitude higher than those reported during outdoor NPF events. Notably, high particle nucleation rates significantly increase indoor atmospheric NCA concentrations (105–108 cm–3), and high growth rates drive their survival and growth to sizes that efficiently reach the deepest regions of the human respiratory system.

Detailed examination revealed that the maximum downwind deflection angle of the wavenumber‐1 rain maximum relative to the shear direction is smaller for tropical storms than hurricanes, but insensitive to hurricane intensity. It is proposed that the spirality is produced by a continuous decline in angular advection of air parcels with radius.

We found that the most heat‐exposed facilities and states were mostly in the Southwestern United States, while the prisons with the highest temperature anomalies from the historical record were in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, Texas, and parts of the Midwest. Prisons in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, and upper Midwest had the highest occurrences of days associated with an increased risk of heat‐related mortality. We also estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and individual‐level characteristics. We found higher proportions of non‐white and Hispanic populations in the prisons with higher heat exposure. Lastly, we found that heat exposure was higher in prisons with any of nine facility‐level characteristics that may modify risk to heat.

 Influenza A viruses (IAV) have caused more documented global pandemics in human history than any other pathogen1,2. High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses belonging to the H5N1 subtype are a leading pandemic risk. Two decades after H5N1 “bird flu” became established in poultry in Southeast Asia, its descendants have resurged3, setting off an H5N1 panzootic in wild birds that is fueled by (a) rapid intercontinental spread, reaching South America and Antarctica for the first time4,5; (b) fast evolution via genomic reassortment6; and (c) frequent spillover into terrestrial7,8 and marine mammals9. The virus has sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission in multiple settings, including European fur farms10,11, South American marine mammals12–15, and US dairy cattle16–19, raising questions about whether humans are next. Historically, swine are considered optimal intermediary hosts that help avian influenza viruses (AIV) adapt to mammals before jumping to humans20. However, the altered ecology of H5N1 has opened the door to new evolutionary pathways. Could dairy cattle, farmed mink, or South American sea lions serve as new mammalian gateways to humans? Here we explore the molecular and ecological factors driving H5N1’s sudden expansion in host range and assess the likelihood of different zoonotic pathways leading to an H5N1 pandemic."

 An industrial-era decline in Greenland ice-core methanesulfonic acid is thought to herald a collapse in North Atlantic marine phytoplankton stocks related to a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. By contrast, stable levels of total marine biogenic sulfur contradict this interpretation and point to changes in atmospheric oxidation as a potential cause of the methanesulfonic acid decline. However, the impact of oxidation on methanesulfonic acid production has not been quantified, nor has this hypothesis been rigorously tested. Here we present a multi-century methanesulfonic acid record from the Denali, Alaska, ice core, which shows a methanesulfonic acid decline similar in magnitude but delayed by 93 years relative to the Greenland record. Box-model results using updated dimethyl sulfide oxidation pathways indicate that oxidation by pollution-driven nitrate radicals has suppressed atmospheric methanesulfonic acid production, explaining most, if not all, of Denali’s and Greenland’s methanesulfonic acid declines without requiring a change in phytoplankton production. The delayed timing of the North Pacific methanesulfonic acid decline, relative to the North Atlantic, reflects the distinct history of industrialization in upwind regions and is consistent with the Denali and Greenland ice-core nitrate records. These results demonstrate that multidecadal trends in industrial-era Arctic ice-core methanesulfonic acid reflect rising anthropogenic pollution rather than declining marine primary production.

 Unabated 21st-century climate change will accelerate Arctic-Subarctic permafrost thaw which can intensify microbial degradation of carbon-rich soils, methane emissions, and global warming. The impact of permafrost thaw on future Arctic-Subarctic wildfires and the associated release of greenhouse gases and aerosols is less well understood. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the effect of future permafrost thaw on land surface processes in the Arctic-Subarctic region using the CESM2 large ensemble forced by the SSP3-7.0 greenhouse gas emission scenario. Analyzing 50 greenhouse warming simulations, which capture the coupling between permafrost, hydrology, and atmosphere, we find that projected rapid permafrost thaw leads to massive soil drying, surface warming, and reduction of relative humidity over the Arctic-Subarctic region. These combined processes lead to nonlinear late-21st-century regime shifts in the coupled soil-hydrology system and rapid intensification of wildfires in western Siberia and Canada.

 Modification of guanosine to N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in the variable loop region of tRNA is catalyzed by the METTL1/WDR4 heterodimer and stabilizes target tRNA. Here, we reveal essential functions of Mettl1 in Drosophila fertility. Knockout of Mettl1 (Mettl1-KO) causes no major effect on the development of non-gonadal tissues, but abolishes the production of elongated spermatids and mature sperm, which is fully rescued by expression of a Mettl1-transgene, but not a catalytic-dead Mettl1 transgene. This demonstrates that Mettl1-dependent m7G is required for spermatogenesis. Mettl1-KO results in a loss of m7G modification on a subset of tRNAs and decreased tRNA abundance. Ribosome profiling shows that Mettl1-KO led to ribosomes stalling at codons decoded by tRNAs that were reduced in abundance. Mettl1-KO also significantly reduces the translation efficiency of genes involved in elongated spermatid formation and sperm stability. Germ cell-specific expression of Mettl1 rescues disrupted m7G tRNA modification and tRNA abundance in Mettl1-KO testes but not in non-gonadal tissues. Ribosome stalling is much less detectable in non-gonadal tissues than in Mettl1-KO testes. These findings reveal a developmental role for m7G tRNA modification and indicate that m7G modification-dependent tRNA abundance differs among tissues. Here the authors reveal essential functions of Mettl1, catalyzing N7-guanosine methylation (m7G) of tRNAs, in Drosophila male fertility through a regulation of the steady-state level of tRNAs and the translational efficiency of genes essential for spermatogenesis."

 Reef-building coral populations face unprecedented threats from climate warming. Standing variation in heat tolerance is crucial for evolutionary processes necessary for corals to persist. Yet, the spatial distribution of heat-tolerant corals and the underlying factors that determine heat tolerance are poorly understood from individual to ecosystem scales. Here, we show extensive variation in the heat tolerance of a foundational coral species complex across the Great Barrier Reef. Thermal thresholds of 569 individuals differed by up to 7.3 °C across scales from meters to >1250 km. Variation in thresholds among reefs was consistent with local adaptation and acclimatization to historical and recent thermal history. However, variation within reefs was sometimes greater than among reefs and largely unexplained by environmental predictors, putative host species, or symbiont communities. This indicates that within-reef heat tolerance differences may be informed primarily by other factors, such as adaptive genomic variation. We anticipate our findings will inform conservation and restoration actions, including targeting individuals for selective breeding of enhanced heat tolerance. Adaptation to thermal histories governs differences in coral heat tolerance between reefs, whereas within reefs, variations in heat tolerance cannot be explained by environmental predictors and may instead be a result of genomic variations, suggesting analyses of coral samples from the Great Barrier Reef."

 Landsat imagery offers remarkable potential for various applications, including land monitoring and environmental assessment, thanks to its high spatial resolution and over 50 years of data records. However, the presence of atmospheric aerosols greatly hinders the precision of land classification and the quantitative retrieval of surface parameters. There is a pressing need for reliable and accurate global aerosol optical depth (AOD) data derived from Landsat imagery, particularly for atmospheric correction purposes and various other applications. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative framework for retrieving AOD from Landsat imagery over land, which leverages the deep-learning Transformer model (named AeroTrans-Landsat) and operates on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. We gather Landsat 8 and 9 images starting from their launch dates (February 2013 and September 2021, respectively) until the end of 2022, which are used to construct a robust aerosol retrieval model. The global AOD retrievals are then rigorously validated across ∼560 monitoring stations on land using diverse spatiotemporally independent methods. Leveraging information from multiple spectral channels, which contributes to 80 % according to the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method, our retrieved AODs from 2013 to 2022 generally agree well with surface observations, with a sample-based cross-validation correlation coefficient of 0.905 and a root-mean-square error of 0.083. Around 86 % and 55 % of our AOD retrievals meet the criteria of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue expected errors [±(0.05 + 20 %)] and the Global Climate Observation System {[max(0.03, 10 %)]}, respectively. Additionally, our model is not as sensitive to fluctuations in both surface and atmospheric conditions, enabling the generation of spatially continuous AOD distributions with exceptionally fine-scale information over dark to bright surfaces. This capability extends to areas characterized by high pollution levels originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources."

 The harmful consequences of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a serious public health matter of universal concern, particularly for youngsters. Exposure to PM2.5 may interfere with vitamin D metabolism in humans. However, the influences of airborne acute PM2.5 exposure on the blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25-OH vitamin D] of young children remains unclear. In the current research, we investigated the links between PM2.5 acute exposure and plasma 25-OH vitamin D of youngsters who lived in Beijing, China, between April 2020 and September 2022. A total of 1916 children aged from 0.13 to 3.00 years old were enrolled. We collected daily airborne PM2.5 data and determined the plasma 25-OH vitamin D of children using LC-MS/MS assay. The association between acute PM2.5 exposure and plasma 25-OH vitamin D was investigated with the generalized linear mixed model and generalized additive model. Our results demonstrated that the acute exposure to airborne PM2.5 was a linear negative correlation with the plasma 25-OH vitamin D3 in infants, each 10 μg/m3 elevate in airborne PM2.5 on current (lag0), lag1, and lag01 (the moving average concentration) days were related to a 0.139 (95% CI: 0.274–0.004), 0.158 (95% CI: 0.305–0.011) and 0.178 (95% CI: 0.333–0.023) ng/mL decrease in plasma 25-OH vitamin D3, respectively. The declining tendency of plasma 25-OH vitamin D3 remained robust after adjusting the airborne PM10 and O3 in the sensitivity analyses. Our study lends credence that the airborne PM2.5 acute exposure imposed relatively mild but significant reductions in plasma vitamin 25-OH vitamin D3 in young children."

 High-quality precipitation data are essential for research in hydrology, meteorology and ecology. Nevertheless, in mountainous regions with intricate terrain, the reliability of gridded precipitation data derived from station data interpolation is low due to the limited number of stations caused by the difficulty of station setup. Current satellite precipitation products suffer from low spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for hydrological and meteorological research at small and medium scales. Their application in mountainous regions with significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity is even more challenging. To this end, downscaling satellite precipitation products has become an effective method for obtaining accurate spatial distribution information of precipitation in these regions. This study employs a method of first calibration followed by downscaling analysis of GPM daily precipitation product in the Chongqing area using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Ultimately, the spatial resolution of GPM product is improved from 0.1° to 0.01° (∼1 km). The findings demonstrate that: (1) the station-calibrated GPM precipitation product performed better than the original GPM product, and it is closer to the station measurements; (2) in practical applications, the LSTM downscaling algorithm can effectively enhance spatial resolution without compromising accuracy, whereas RF and XGBoost incur considerable accuracy loss when enhancing spatial resolution; (3) the downscaled results from all three algorithms were consistent with the calibrated GPM precipitation maps and significantly improved the spatial details of precipitation. Among them, the results of the LSTM method exhibited greater continuity in the spatial distribution of precipitation, aligning more closely with the characteristics of precipitation distribution. In summary, the LSTM algorithm demonstrates greater potential for the downscaling of GPM precipitation product in the study area. This research provides a promising high-quality precipitation data generation scheme for mountainous regions with sparse station coverage and complex terrain and landforms."
