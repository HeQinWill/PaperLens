10.5194/essd-17-5303-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,这篇论文介绍了在2016-2018年期间，NASA的ORACLES项目使用4STAR仪器在东南大西洋上空对生物质燃烧气溶胶的观测。论文重点介绍了如何对2017和2018年的数据进行质量控制，并发布了三年完整的数据集。该数据集可用于研究气溶胶的辐射特性、模拟气溶胶演变以及验证卫星反演的气溶胶产品，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是关于气溶胶的成分分析和卫星观测的验证。,"['aerosol radiative properties', 'biomass burning aerosols', 'single scattering albedo', 'satellite validation', 'columnar optical properties']",Logan T.

These aerosols then interact with stratocumulus clouds over the Southeast Atlantic, which is difficult for climate models to account for. Our instrument, 4STAR, determines aerosol radiative properties. A dataset was already created for 2016, but additional quality control was required to address instrument issues for 2017 and 2018. 
 The NASA ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) airborne field campaigns deployed a 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research) instrument onboard a P-3 aircraft to measure columnar optical properties of biomass burning aerosol smoke plumes over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean from 2016 to 2018. Although 4STAR's retrievals of aerosol optical properties from direct solar irradiances and diffuse sky radiances were performed, analyzed, and compared against other field campaigns via Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) campaign medians by Pistone et al. (2019) for ORACLES 2016, such an analysis was not extended to 2017 and 2018 due to previously unquantified instrument performance issues. As a result, only the 4STAR 2016 dataset was available to the public via https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2016_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021a). The instrument issues were diagnosed and mitigated through use of a four-wavelength set, instead of the previous five-wavelength set. Uniform Quality Control (QC) standards were established to ensure consistent data quality across all three campaigns. This resulted in research-quality, four-wavelength 4STAR datasets for 2017 and 2018 that have since been archived along with the original five-wavelength 4STAR 2016 dataset on the NASA Earth Science Project Office website, replacing the older versions at https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2017_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021b) and https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2018_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021c). The four-wavelength 4STAR 2016 dataset, although not on the archival site, is also publicly available via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16933793 (Mitchell, 2025). Potential improvements to these initial releases, such as broadening the spectral range, substituting for missing flight-level albedo, and removing unreliable scattering angles, are discussed. The complete 3-year ORACLES 4STAR 2016–2018 has many uses, including the determination of subseasonal changes in aerosol properties, modelling aerosol evolution, and the validation of satellite-retrieved aerosol products."

This study developed an improved GRACE-derived GWSA dataset (igGWSA) over global land with full consideration of diverse non-groundwater components. Validation against in situ observations and model simulations demonstrated the high reliability of the dataset. 
 Accurate quantification of global groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) is imperative for global water security and socio-economic sustainability. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite has emerged as a prevailing methodology for estimating GWSA. However, oversimplification of non-groundwater components potentially compromised its accuracy in most previous studies. Here we present an improved GRACE-derived GWSA dataset at the global scale, namely igGWSA, with full consideration of non-groundwater components including glaciers, snow, permafrost, lakes, reservoirs, surface runoff, profile soil moisture (PSM), and plant canopy water based on current new datasets. In particular, PSM was generated based on Catchment Land Surface Model and random forest algorithm. igGWSA demonstrated strong agreement with well-observed groundwater level and model-simulated GWSA in five globally recognized hotspots of groundwater depletion. Compared to igGWSA with full consideration, simplified estimation would lead to misinterpretations of groundwater storage variations in glacier-covered regions, giant lakes, and deep-soil areas, highlighting the necessity of comprehensively accounting for non-groundwater components in estimating GWSA, especially under a changing environment. igGWSA dataset is publicly available on Zenodo through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16871689 (Wang et al., 2025)."

Jessell;James L. McCallum,GraphFlow v1.0: approximating groundwater contaminant  transport with graph-based methods – an application to  fault scenario selection,"To facilitate the exploration of alternative hydrogeological scenarios, we propose approximating costly physical simulations of contaminant transport by means of more affordable shortest-distance computations. This enables us to accept or reject scenarios within a predefined confidence interval. In particular, this can allow us to estimate the probability of a fault acting as a preferential path or a barrier. 
 Groundwater contaminant transport problems remain challenging with respect to their computing requirements. This often limits the exploration of the conceptual uncertainty that is mainly related to large-scale geological features – such as faults, fractures, and stratigraphic variations – and limited characterization. Here, to facilitate geological conceptual uncertainty exploration, we develop further the use of graph representation for geological models to approximate groundwater flow and transport. We consider a faulted multi-heterogeneous-layer medium to test our approach. The existing rank correlation between the shortest path distribution from a contaminant source to the model domain outlet and the cumulative mass distribution at the outlet enables us to perform scenario selection. The scenario selection approach relies on a metric combining the Jaccard dissimilarity and the Wasserstein distance to compare binary images. Among a set combining eight alternative scenarios, where three faults can act as either a flow barrier or a preferential path, we show that the use of graph approximations allows us to retain or reject scenarios with confidence, as well as to estimate the individual probability of a fault to act as a barrier or a path. This methodology framework opens up possibilities to explore more thoroughly conceptual geological uncertainty for processes affected by flow and transport."
10.5194/gmd-18-7165-2025,False,Geoscientific Model Development,该论文主要关注地理信息系统（GIS）中的空间统计方法，特别是如何同时处理空间分层异质性（SSH）和空间位置依赖性（SPD）。它介绍了一个名为FZStats v1.0的Python工具箱，该工具箱集成了传统的焦点统计和区域统计，并引入了一种新的焦点-区域混合统计方法。论文通过地热异常检测案例研究验证了该方法的有效性。虽然该工具箱可以用于处理空间数据，但其重点不在于大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],Na Ren;Daojun Zhang;Qiuming Cheng,FZStats v1.0: a raster statistics toolbox for simultaneous management of spatial stratified heterogeneity and positional dependence in Python,"While focal statistics and zonal statistics deal with spatial position dependence (SPD) and spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) separately, the developed foca–zonal mixed statistics can handle both simultaneously. This new tool has the potential to become a general statistics tool. The integrated FZStats v1.0 toolbox in this study includes all three models mentioned above, providing new methodological support for understanding and addressing spatial statistical issues. 
 Focal and zonal statistics are fundamental tools in geographic information systems (GISs) for characterizing spatial patterns, yet they have traditionally addressed spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) and spatial positional dependence (SPD) in isolation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce FZStats v1.0, a Python 3/QT5–based toolbox that not only integrates conventional focal and zonal statistics, but also implements a novel focal–zonal mixed statistics approach capable of jointly capturing both SSH and SPD. First, we formally develop the focal–zonal mixed statistics model to address stratified heterogeneity, spatial dependence, and their interactions within a unified framework – filling a key methodological gap left by traditional approaches that cannot accommodate their co-occurrence in real-world spatial data. Second, FZStats v1.0 provides a user-friendly graphical interface for flexible configuration of neighborhood window shapes (e.g., rectangular, circular, elliptical), sizes, and statistical operations (e.g., mean, percentiles). It also supports multiprocessing and batch operations, enabling scalable computation across diverse spatial analysis tasks. Third, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the new method through a geothermal anomaly detection case study. Across multiple years, seasons, representative target sizes, and local window radii, the focal–zonal mixed statistics consistently outperforms both focal and zonal statistics, demonstrating its superior capability in enhancing anomaly signals under complex spatial conditions. In summary, FZStats v1.0 is not only a theoretically grounded and methodologically novel tool, but also a highly adaptable and practical solution for spatial data analysis in diverse application domains."

Its accuracy and low computational cost make it ideal for offline climate projections assessing urban impacts under various emission scenarios. Its features enable analysis of urban overheating, energy demand, thermal comfort, and evaluation of strategies like green/cool roofs and photovoltaic panels. 
 The MLUCM BEP + BEM model advances urban microclimate modelling by combining a multi-layer canopy approach with Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) and a Building Energy Model (BEM). It includes updated turbulent length scales and eddy diffusivity coefficients that account for atmospheric stability, along with explicit representation of urban vegetation, such as street trees and green spaces. The model runs offline with low computational demands, making it suitable for standalone use, integration with climate projections, and long-term simulations to evaluate emission scenarios and adaptation strategies. Validation against data from the Urban-PLUMBER project at a suburban site in Preston (Melbourne, Australia) demonstrates that MLUCM BEP + BEM reliably reproduces shortwave (SWup) and longwave (LWup) radiation, as well as latent (Qle), sensible (Qh), and momentum (Qtau) fluxes. Its overall performance is on par with, and in several cases surpasses, that of other established urban models with particularly notable improvements in the simulation of momentum flux (Qtau). Some refinements are still needed, particularly in modelling tree-soil moisture dynamics to reduce surface energy budget imbalances. Thanks to its flexibility and efficiency, MLUCM BEP + BEM is well-suited for assessing urban overheating, building energy demand, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as green roofs, cool materials, and photovoltaic systems under various future climate scenarios."

Using high‐resolution electron measurements from the Macao Science Satellite‐1, we report the first observation of novel extra stripes coexisting with conventional zebra stripes. Analysis demonstrates that these extra stripes originate concurrently with their conventional counterparts and evolve following the drift echo hypothesis. Both stripes are successfully reproduced by test particle simulations employing an empirical electric field model. We interpret the extra stripes as indication of non‐m=1 $m=1$ components in the electric field perturbations, in contrast to the traditional m=1 $m=1$ mode that drives the conventional stripes.

We analyze the event using a novel combination of observational data sets and physics‐based modeling. This includes multispectral auroral imaging, dosimeter data from the Global Positioning System constellation, auroral transport modeling, and global geospace modeling. Our analysis reveals the cause of both the radiation belt enhancement and purple emission to be direct, mesoscale injections of electrons reaching relativistic energies.

Hitherto unobserved nitrate replenishment (to 10–20 μM) occurs in October/November across the entire strait, with winter variability seemingly linked to across‐channel flow, implying a cross‐strait nitrate gradient in winter. Fall storms before ice‐formation only oxygenate the water column to ∼95% saturation. Data yield the first estimates of year‐round Pacific‐to‐Arctic nitrate flux (10.4 ± 1.6 kmol/s) based on in situ measurements (rather than inferred values); suggest that, due to flow increase, the nitrate flux has most likely increased over the last three decades; and indicate the nitrate‐salinity relationship used by others to predict Bering Strait nitrate breaks down in winter, making in situ measurements essential to constrain the changing Pacific nutrient inflow to the Arctic."

We address the generalization problem by enforcing physics constraints on a neural network parameterization of mesoscale eddy fluxes. We found that the local scaling of input and output features helps to generalize to unseen grid resolutions and depths offline in the global ocean. The scaling is based on dimensional analysis and incorporates grid spacing as a length scale. We formulate our findings as a general algorithm that can be used to enforce data‐driven parameterizations with dimensional scaling.

The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3’ extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3’ processing of nascent pre-mRNAs10-15. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT13,15, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery."

 The origin and composition of Earth’s silica-rich continental crust, particularly the lower crust, remain uncertain. Stable continental crust, including cratons and crust older than 200 million years, is marked by enrichment of radiogenic heat-producing elements (U, Th and K) in the upper crust and depletion in the lower crust. Because the lower crust probably consists of >50% aluminous metasedimentary and evolved metaigneous rocks—both initially enriched in U and Th—continental differentiation requires a mechanism to transfer these elements upwards. Here, in our analysis of partially melted metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks, we show that ultrahigh temperatures (>900 °C) are essential to stratify heat production and stabilize crust. Removal of small fractions of ultrahigh-temperature melt generated by fluid-absent melting can produce the observed lower-crustal depletions in U and Th. By contrast, lower-temperature melting fails to drive differentiation owing to the resilience of monazite to dissolution in granitic melts. Our findings establish ultrahigh-temperature melting as an important criterion for the formation of stable continents, providing a direct link between the formation of cratons and ultrahigh-temperature metamorphic terrains and the supercontinent cycle. This insight constrains the tectonic settings responsible for crustal differentiation. Stabilization of continental crust requires temperatures of over 900 °C, establishing a link between ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism and craton formation, according to a study of U and Th concentrations in metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks."

 The stratosphere is generally considered to be stable, with minimal vertical mixing. However, deep convection can transport low-altitude material above the tropopause. Here we use in situ single-particle measurements from the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere mission to show that carbonaceous-sulfate particles from the troposphere account for up to 90% of the stratospheric particles with physical diameter from 0.1 to 1.5 µm in a 4-km layer above the tropopause during an active fire season in 2022. We find that ~43% of the stratospheric carbonaceous-sulfate particles originate from biomass burning. These particles, which are chemically complex and organic-rich, do not remain unchanged once injected into the stratosphere, but form mixtures containing both tropospheric and stratospheric components, indicating perturbation of the stratospheric aerosol layer. We suggest that the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires combined with increasing deep convection as the climate warms may enhance the delivery of biomass burning products to the lower stratosphere, with implications for ozone chemistry and radiative forcing.

 There is increasing need for higher performance dielectric polymers for devices in power conversion systems for renewable energy generation and electric vehicles. In particular, materials with higher dielectric permittivity, lower loss and the ability to operate at higher temperatures. We have developed a counter intuitive method to achieve this, the melt blending of multiple immiscible polymers, in an approach that mimics high entropy materials design. We demonstrate that using this approach we can significantly exceed the rule-of-mixtures for the dielectric constant (>250%), whilst surprisingly retaining a low loss tangent. The materials show increased thermal stability up to 150 °C, which opens up the possibility of the wider application of dielectric polymers. We provide a consistent model to describe the behaviour based on the use of polymers with different glass transition temperatures to frustrate the de-blending of the immiscible polymers during melt processing. This produces highly amorphous and disordered polymer blends with increased inter-chain spacing (free volume) and increased rotational freedom of the polar groups in polar nano regions. This approach has wide applicability to other polar polymer blends and is scalable.

 Reprogramming gene expression at the translational level drives intestinal tumorigenesis. Codon decoding during translation elongation relies on tRNA modifications, while their pathological relevance in colorectal cancer remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that AlkB homolog 8 (ALKBH8), a uridine 34 (U34) tRNA methyltransferase, is a direct target of Wnt/β-catenin and is upregulated in colorectal cancer. Genetic ablation of ALKBH8 inhibits the development of intestinal tumors in Apcmin/+, azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS), and xenograft models. Loss of ALKBH8 induces ribosome pausing at adenine-ending codons, impairing the translation elongation of mRNAs enriched with these codons. Specifically, ALKBH8 regulates the translation of KRAS proto-oncogene in a codon-dependent manner. Rescue experiments demonstrate that the methyltransferase activity of ALKBH8 is required for its translation-promoting function. Together, our findings reveal ALKBH8-dependent mRNA translation as a critical mediator of intestinal tumorigenesis, underscoring its potential as a promising target for colorectal cancer therapy.

 In recent decades, Europe has warmed rapidly while a prominent ‘warming hole’ has muted changes in eastern North America. Paradoxically, the pattern coincides with cooling in the North Atlantic, even though ocean cooling is commonly expected to chill Europe, not North America. The regional departures from global trends and expectations may have informative precedents in millennial-scale climate anomalies during the Holocene. Here, circum-Atlantic records reveal that counter-intuitive European warming developed amid rapid cooling of the North Atlantic and North America from 5.8-4.8 ka and after 2.2 ka. The anomalies track rapid reductions in the flow of North Atlantic Deep Water southwest of Iceland and appear in independent but highly correlated records of mean sea-surface temperatures, continental temperatures, and hydroclimate changes from both sides of the Atlantic.

 Multilayer ceramic capacitors are pivotal components in pulse power systems due to their ultra-high power density. However, given the demanding service conditions in aerospace and oil drilling applications, the need to enhance high-temperature energy storage remains particularly urgent. In this work, we employ a strain modulation strategy by enhancing configuration entropy within bismuth sodium titanate-based ceramics. This approach enhances relaxor behavior, suppresses electron migration, and improves structural stability and breakdown strength at elevated temperatures. Notably, the resulting multilayer ceramic capacitors exhibit a substantial recoverable energy density of 19.0 J cm−3 and an impressive efficiency of 90% under an electric field of 1320 kV cm−1. Furthermore, these capacitors sustain a high energy density above 11.0 J cm−3 even at 200 °C.

Here, authors show that behavioral changes during Pavlovian learning explain DA activity regardless of reward prediction or valence, supporting an adaptive gain model of DA function. 
 The reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis posits that phasic dopamine (DA) activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encodes the difference between expected and actual rewards to drive reinforcement learning. However, emerging evidence suggests DA may instead regulate behavioral performance. Here, we used force sensors to measure subtle movements in head-fixed mice during a Pavlovian stimulus-reward task, while recording and manipulating VTA DA activity. We identified distinct DA neuron populations tuned to forward and backward force exertion. They are active during both spontaneous and conditioned behaviors, independent of learning or reward predictability. Variations in force and licking fully account for DA dynamics traditionally attributed to RPE, including variations in firing rates related to reward magnitude, probability, and omission. Optogenetic manipulations further confirmed that DA modulates force exertion and behavioral transitions in real time, without affecting learning. Our findings challenge the RPE hypothesis and instead suggest that VTA DA neurons dynamically adjust the gain of motivated behaviors, controlling their latency, direction, and intensity during performance.

Here, the authors report a chiral scandium(III)-catalyzed ring-expansion and kinetic resolution of racemic helical fluorenones with α-diazo esters. 
 The development of efficient synthetic methods to access optically pure helical chiral molecules is a central challenge in organic chemistry due to their unique photophysical properties and potential applications in chiral photonic devices. Conventional strategies often struggle to simultaneously install multiple chiral elements with high fidelity and are typically limited to synthesizing a single scaffold at a time. Here we show that a chiral Sc(III)-catalyzed ring-expansion of racemic helical fluorenones with α-diazo esters, enables the simultaneous synthesis of both optically enriched helical fluorenones and one-carbon-inserted helical phenanthrenones with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This process achieves simultaneous kinetic resolution and homologation, but also intriguing regioselectivity at the cases of un-symmetric ketones. Furthermore, the synthesized helical compounds exhibit significant chiroptical activity, with their circularly polarized absorption dissymmetry factors (gabs) showing a strong dependence on the position and steric nature of aryl substituents, and some derivatives also display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

 Climate scepticism remains an important barrier to public engagement with accurate climate information, because sceptics often actively avoid information that contains climate science facts.

 Climate change poses a rapidly growing threat to World Heritage sites, making effective adaptation strategies essential. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies have been integrated into heritage conservation frameworks remains underexplored. Applying text mining and large language models to analyse 535 World Heritage sites, we assess climate awareness (vulnerability, adaptation and resilience) and local actions (policy, process, planning and management) across 1,868 World Heritage documents. We observe spatial differences in climate awareness, influenced by regional contexts and document characteristics. Climate awareness does not align neatly with national political or economic features. Local heritage management and planning actions are negatively associated with vulnerability awareness, while policies show positive associations with overall climate awareness. Our findings demonstrate that large language models are effective tools for text classification in the interdisciplinary field of heritage and climate and offer practical perspectives into the gap between awareness and action in heritage conservation.

 El Niño significantly impacts the global Hadley circulation (HC), however, the modulation of different decay rates of El Niño on the HC is overlooked. Our research reveals that rapid decay (RD) events cause the global HC to exhibit an equatorially asymmetric configuration, in contrast to the quasi-symmetric structure seen during slow decay (SD) events. This is primarily driven by HC anomalies in the central-eastern Pacific, influenced by anomalous sea surface temperatures that impact the conversion of atmospheric perturbation potential energy to kinetic energy. The structure of regional HC anomalies in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) exhibits contrasting patterns within different events. During RD (SD) events, the intensified (weakened) regional HC over the IPWP results in increased (decreased) terrestrial precipitation over its coastal countries. Therefore, our findings have important implications for understanding and predicting regional climate impacts associated with different El Niño decay patterns."

 Exposure to concurrent heatwave and ozone pollution events poses a great threat to the health burden. Yet the impacts of future warming on such compound extremes and the associated health risks remain unclear. Here, using dynamic downscaling techniques and multi-model ensembles, we estimate excess deaths attributed to heatwave-ozone compound extremes from climate change under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We find that, driven by future climate change, ozone pollution events in China are projected to grow by 58% by the middle of the century under SSP3-7.0, half of which are also heatwave days. Consequently, the heatwave-ozone compound event exposure rises by a factor of two, causing an additional 61,600 deaths nationwide. In highly polluted regions, such compound events outweigh single events by dominating the additional mortality from climate-induced increases in heat and ozone extremes.

 Nitrogen (N) cycling has been reshaped during the Anthropocene epoch, yet the global change pattern of sedimentary N stable isotope (δ15N) remains unclear. Previous research has mainly focused on changes of sedimentary δ15N in remote areas or during the Holocene epoch, yet the differentiation of sedimentary δ15N between remote areas and disturbed regions and the onset of the differentiation time are neglected in the Anthropocene epoch. Here we synthesized published records of well-dated δ15N abundance in sedimentary sequences from 173 sites globally, including natural and disturbed areas, and proposed a conceptual diagram to descript the global change patterns of sedimentary δ15N in past 300 years. Sedimentary δ15N in disturbed sites enriched, with two breakpoints in 1910s and 1950s. The other one, δ15N trend in natural sites mostly depleted, with a breakpoint in 1920s. The timeline aligns with unprecedented anthropic perturbations to the global N cycle, such as the invention and application of the Haber-Bosch process. The divergence of δ15N change pattern between disturbed and natural areas can be attributed to either direct human activities or indirect consequences. Taken together, we propose that the 1910s − 1930s can be considered the precursor of the Anthropocene due to the application of artificial N fixation and its consequent biogeochemical effect. We emphasize that the Haber-Bosch process could be the important event before the impact of human activities on Earth history is reflected in global stratigraphy.

 Accurate cloud detection is essential for the quantitative applications of satellite imager observations, but nighttime cloud detection has challenges due to limited spectral bands, for example, physical methods using only infrared (IR) bands without using spatial textures as input for cloud detection often result in high uncertainties, especially in some situations such as cryosphere surface. Although numerous segmentation-style deep learning cloud detection algorithms have proposed in previous studies, they are inadequate for nighttime due to the difficulty in acquiring two-dimensional truth data for training and validation. To overcome these challenges, the Transformer based Nighttime Cloud Detection (TNCD) framework, which integrates spatial features and utilizes an advanced Transformer architecture with relative position encoding, layer scaling, and channel attention mechanisms, is proposed and investigated for nighttime cloud detection. The model was trained on labels derived from CALIOP data, utilizing a dataset comprising nearly one hundred million segments from MODIS. Independent validation indicates that TNCD achieves robust and consistent performance across various scenarios, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 93.26 % and over 90 % in cryosphere regions. The proposed algorithm avoids the pattern noise appeared in the traditional physical methodology due to the utilization of auxiliary data at coarser resolutions, it also mitigates the negative impact of stripes in IR images for cloud detection. Moreover, TNCD shows high transferable practicability across sensors, with over 90 % OA for MERSI. More importantly, our research underscores the importance of water vapor absorption bands for nighttime cloud detection over the cryosphere. TNCD's high accuracy and robustness provide unique methodology that could be used operationally for nighttime cloud detection."

The average concentrations and number of high concentration outliers extracted by the trend analyses for NOy, T.NO3, CO, and O3 were high in spring, whereas those in winter were high for CO and low for NOy, T.NO3, and O3.

 Urban air pollution in megacities like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad frequently exceeds World Health Organization guidelines, driven by vehicular and industrial emissions, posing significant health risks to vulnerable populations. From November 2022 to February 2023, the average concentration of major air pollutants including particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ground level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), volatile organic carbon (VOC), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), ammonia (NH3) in ambient air were recorded using a calibrated Aeroqual Series 500 sampler at high-traffic sites across these cities. This study tested the hypothesis that phyllospheric microbes inhabiting leaf surfaces of roadside plants adapts to high pollution levels and may serve as bio-indicators of urban air quality. A total of 287 bacterial isolates from 42 plant species were collected across eight sampling locations and genetically characterized based on conserved repetitive DNA sequences dispersed throughout the bacterial genome-using Rep-PCR (BOX, ERIC, REP primers) to assess microbial diversity and conserved repetitive DNA sequences. Results showed high genetic polymorphism (94.7–98.0 %) and distinct clustering (8–38 clusters per city) patterns, with REP-PCR showing the highest discriminatory power (Simpson's Index: 0.938–0.976). Certain plants species such as Ficus benjamina, Phoenix dactylifera, and Euphorbia milii hosted the most diverse microbial communities, particularly in heavily polluted areas such as Lahore, where strains exhibited up to 62 bands. Principal component analysis (PCA) further confirmed that genetic linkages were influenced by pollution stress, with REP and BOX primers accounting for the maximum variance. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a strong positive correlation (p < 0.05) between all air pollutants except O3 at all sites. These findings suggest a correlation between phyllosphere microbial diversity and the intensity of air pollution, with pollution-tolerant plants supporting stress-adapted microbes. This study highlighted the potential of phyllosphere microbes as bioindicators for monitoring urban air quality, offering a novel and cost-effective tool for environmental assessment. Furthermore, metagenomic profiling could further elucidate microbial functions for optimizing environmental management in polluted megacities."

 Accurate wind speed forecasting is crucial for optimizing the efficiency of wind energy generation. To improve the accuracy of wind speed forecasting at 100 m height in northwest China, hybrid approaches integrating machine learning techniques with multimodel ensemble methods (MME) were explored and evaluated against traditional MME methods. This study utilized data from 54 wind farms and five global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, covering the period from February 2021 to January 2022. The six forecasting methods were categorized into two groups: (1) traditional ensemble methods, including equally weighted mean (EWM), unequally weighted mean (UWM), and single farm-based UWM (SFUWM); and (2) machine learning-based ensemble methods, including linear regression (LR), Lasso regression, and random forest (RF). The results showed that machine learning-based MME methods outperformed traditional methods in accurately capturing both climatological patterns and diurnal variations of wind speed. Specifically, the RF and Lasso LR methods achieved notable performance enhancements, with mean RMSE reductions of 0.57 m s−1 (24.9 %) and 0.56 m s−1 (24.6 %), respectively, relative to the ECMWF-IFS baseline. In addition, traditional MME methods demonstrated limited effectiveness, primarily improving forecasts for weak wind speeds (0–6 m s−1) while adversely affecting strong wind speed predictions. In contrast, machine learning-based MME methods exhibited comprehensive improvements across all wind speed categories with substantially greater enhancement magnitudes. Further error decomposition analysis revealed that improvements achieved by MME methods were generally co-contributed by reductions in the bias component (BIAS) and sequence component (SEQU), while partially offset by distribution component (DIST). Specifically, BIAS reduction plays a more substantial role in total RMSE reduction for machine learning-based MME methods (75.9 % ∼ 85.9 %) than for traditional MME methods (3.3 % ∼ 22.5 %), leading to the superior100-m wind speed forecasting performance of machine learning-based MME methods. This study demonstrates the potential of MME forecasting in improving 100-m wind speed predictions, which provides a valuable reference for wind farm operations and wind energy applications."

 Convection initiation (CI) mechanisms of an extreme rainstorm (ER) event that occurred in June 2021 in Hotan, Xinjiang, Northwest China, are investigated using the observational data of automatic weather stations, Fengyun-4 A satellite data, reanalysis data, and simulation data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The results show that continuous CI sites occurred near a boundary layer convergence line (BLCL), which was generated due to the merger of a cold pool and a low-level easterly jet (LLEJ). Most of the initiated convective cells developed rapidly and gradually merged with other convective systems, resulting in a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that was responsible for the heavy precipitation in the ER event. Diagnostic analysis of vertical momentum budget along the Lagrangian backward trajectory of air parcels within a convective cell initiated near the BLCL indicates that the dynamic acceleration (ad) was responsible for the vertical acceleration of the air parcels during the rapid-ascending stage of the CI. Further decomposition of ad reveals that the Extension term played a decisive role, while the Twisting term provided negative contributions and the Curvature term was negligibly small. Further investigations revealed that the Extension term was attributed to the low-level convergence within the BLCL, resulting from the merger of the cold pool and LLEJ."

 When the Tropical Cyclone (TC) Amphan over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) moved northward on 15–21 May 2020, it caused a wide range of heavy precipitation in central and eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is mainly attributed to the water vapor transport from the BoB to the TP. Based on the COSMIC2 and FY3D GNOS radio occultation temperature and moisture profiles and ERA5 reanalysis data, this paper investigates the water vapor channel structure over the TP associated with Amphan using scatter composite and grid interpolation. The observation analysis reveals that under the influence of Amphan, the water vapor over the BoB is transported to the southeastern TP by the southerly jet and then transported eastward by the westerly jet, forming a turning water vapor transport channel over the southeastern TP, and there is an easterly backflow returning the TP in the lower and middle troposphere below the east-turning water vapor channel. The specific humidity near 600 hPa increased by about 3 g kg−1, and the average daily temperature at 300 hPa–200 hPa increased by 10 K over the southeastern TP compared to that before the water vapor channel was formed. The southerly warm and moist airflow from the BoB converges with the colder air over the TP and the cold-dry air behind the southern branch trough, forming a frontal zone on the north side of the water vapor channel. The moisture inversion and temperature inversion can be found in the water vapor channel over the TP.

 Recent studies suggest that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can influence Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) forecasts, though this relationship remains inadequately examined, especially in boreal summer. Here, we address this gap using multiple dynamical models to systematically evaluate MJO forecast skill across seasons, initial phases, and amplitudes. Results show distinct seasonal dependencies. In boreal winter, MJO forecasts are more skillful during La Niña. This is primarily attributed to improved prediction of phase-2 MJO, which is more intense during La Niña. The phase-2 MJO propagates too fast and encounters an exaggerated Maritime Continent barrier during El Niño, reducing forecast accuracy. The superior prediction of initially strong MJO events during La Niña further boosts forecasts skill. Conversely, during boreal summer, El Niño yields better MJO forecasts than La Niña, stemming from models' ability to accurately capture the eastward-propagating, wavenumber-1 structure of the MJO in phases 3–4 under El Niño. During La Niña, however, westward-propagating disturbances dominate in these phases, which models consistently fail to reproduce, thus lowering forecast skill. Furthermore, in La Niña summers, forecast skill declines with increasing MJO amplitude, especially when initialized from phases 1–3. While models adeptly predict the stationary pattern of low-amplitude MJO, they struggle with the continuous eastward propagation of high-amplitude MJO, partly due to the exaggerated representation of dry, westward-moving signals from the central-eastern Pacific. This work enhances understanding of MJO–ENSO interaction dynamics and has practical implications for subseasonal forecasting."

 This study investigates the lifecycle dynamics of a multicell hailstorm event that occurred over Konya, Türkiye on 8 June 2022, using high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The analysis integrates synoptic-scale diagnostics, mesoscale storm structure, cloud microphysics, radar-model comparisons, and wavelet-based spectral techniques to comprehensively characterize the storm's development, maturation, and dissipation. WRF simulations at multiple vertical and horizontal levels capture the atmospheric environment conducive to severe convection, including strong low-level warm advection, mid-level moisture surges, and upper-level divergence associated with a jet streak. Simulated convective evolution reveals a clear three-stage lifecycle: initiation at ∼13:10 UTC with the development of vertically compact but intense convective towers; a mature phase between 14:30 and 14:50 UTC characterized by organized multicell structures, overshooting tops, and deep convective updrafts; and a dissipation phase after 16:30 UTC marked by weakening updrafts, fragmented cloud fields, and diminished hydrometeor content. Validation against radar MAX and Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL) products shows strong agreement with WRF-simulated maximum reflectivity and Integrated Liquid Water Content (ILWC), especially during the mature phase. A continuous wavelet transform (CWT) applied to both model-derived reflectivity and ILWC time series reveals a dominant periodicity of approximately 75 min during the mature stage. This primary timescale is accompanied by shorter convective pulses of 20–30 min, likely linked to successive updraft regeneration and hydrometeor accumulation cycles. The strong coherence between dBZ and ILWC wavelet signals confirms the tight coupling between dynamic and thermodynamic storm processes. The integration of dynamical, thermodynamical, and spectral diagnostics provides a robust framework to quantify and classify the convective lifecycle of a multicellular hailstorm. Complementary spatiotemporal wavelet entropy diagnostics revealed the degree of temporal complexity, with moderate entropy during initiation, elevated values during the mature stage, and declining irregularity during dissipation, thereby providing a structural perspective on storm organization. These findings highlight the capacity of high-resolution models not only to simulate severe storm evolution, but also to uncover embedded temporal rhythms using wavelet-based methods, a.k.a. the heartbeat of multicell convection."
