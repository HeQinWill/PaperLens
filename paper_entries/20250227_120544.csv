10.5194/acp-25-2473-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了利用细海盐气溶胶进行太阳辐射管理的有效性，通过模拟在不同开放海域注入海盐气溶胶来研究其对短波辐射的影响。研究重点在于区分气溶胶的直接效应（直接散射太阳辐射）和间接效应（通过改变云的亮度和性质来影响辐射），并量化这两种效应对气候冷却的贡献。研究结果表明，在低注入量下，间接效应占主导地位，而随着注入量增加，直接效应变得更加重要。这项研究对于理解和优化海洋云增亮地球工程的实施策略具有重要意义，尤其是在选择合适的注入区域和调整注入量方面。,"['solar radiation management', 'sea salt aerosols', 'marine cloud brightening', 'radiative forcing', 'climate cooling', 'shortwave radiation', 'aerosol direct effect', 'aerosol indirect effect', 'cloud albedo', 'climate modeling']",Zhe Song;Shaocai Yu;Pengfei Li;Ningning Yao;Lang Chen;Yuhai Sun;Boqiong Jiang;Daniel Rosenfeld,The effectiveness of solar radiation management using fine sea spray across multiple climatic regions,"Our results with injected sea salt aerosols for five open oceans show that sea salt aerosols with low injection amounts dominate shortwave radiation, mainly through indirect effects. As indirect aerosol effects saturate with increasing injection rates, direct effects exceed indirect effects. This implies that marine cloud brightening is best implemented in areas with extensive cloud cover, while aerosol direct scattering effects remain dominant when clouds are scarce. 
 Marine cloud brightening (MCB) geoengineering aims to inject aerosols over oceans to brighten clouds and reflect more sunlight in order to offset the impacts of global warming or to achieve localized climate cooling. The relative contributions of direct and indirect effects in MCB implementations remain uncertain. Here, we quantify both effects by designing model simulations to simulate MCB for five open-ocean regions around the globe. Our results show that a uniform injection strategy that does not depend on wind speed captured the sensitive areas of the regions that produced the largest radiative perturbations during the implementation of MCB. When the injection amounts are low, the sea salt aerosol effect on shortwave radiation is dominated by the indirect effect via brightening clouds, showing obvious spatial heterogeneity. As the indirect effect of aerosols saturates with increasing injection rates, the direct effect increases linearly and exceeds the indirect effects, producing a consistent increase in the spatial distributions of top-of-atmosphere upward shortwave radiation. This study provides quantifiable radiation and cloud variability data for multiple regional MCB implementations and suggests that injection strategies can be optimized by adjusting injection amounts and selecting areas sensitive to injections."

Joseph Turk;Kuo-Nung Wang;Ramon Padullés,Cluster analysis of vertical polarimetric radio occultation profiles and corresponding liquid and ice water paths from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) microwave data,"Polarimetric radio occultations (PROs) use polarized radio signals from satellites to detect moisture and precipitation in Earth's atmosphere. By applying nonlinear regression and k-means cluster analysis to over 2 years of PRO and non-PRO data, this study shows how deviations from a refractivity model relate to vertical profiles of water vapor pressure (moisture) and that differences between components of PRO signals correlate directly with vertical profiles of water path (precipitation). 
 Polarimetric radio occultations (PROs) of the Global Navigation Satellite System are able to characterize precipitation structure and intensity. Prior studies have shown the relationship between precipitation and water vapor pressure columns, known as the “precipitation pickup.” Less is known about the relationship between the vertical distributions of temperature and moisture globally within precipitating scenes as measured from space. This work uses cluster analysis of PRO to explore how the vertical distributions of temperature and moisture – combined into PRO refractivity – relate to vertical distributions of precipitation and moisture variables. We evaluate the ability of k-means clustering to find relationships among PRO polarimetric phase difference, refractivity, liquid water path (LWP), ice water path (IWP), and water vapor pressure using over 2 years of data matched between the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission  and the radio occultations (ROs) and heavy precipitation (HP) demonstration mission on board the Spanish Paz spacecraft (ROHP-PAZ). A polytropic potential refractivity model for polytropic atmospheres is introduced to ascertain how different vertical thermodynamic profiles that can occur during different precipitation scenarios are related to changes in the polytropic index and thereby vertical heat transfer rates. The cluster analyses suggest a relationship between the amplitude and shape of deviations from the potential refractivity model and water vapor pressure. These analyses also confirm a positive correlation between vertical shapes of polarimetric phase difference and both LWP and IWP. For certain values, the coefficients of the polytropic potential refractivity model flag physical vs. nonphysical retrievals and indicate when a profile has little to no moisture. The study reveals a similar relationship between the clustering for these coefficients and different water vapor pressure profiles."

We found making accurate mixtures at very low levels challenging due to the gas sticking to cylinder walls. However, we successfully created stable mixtures at higher levels. These can be used as reliable standards for global air monitoring. More research is needed to develop methods for making accurate mixtures at lower levels. 
 Acetonitrile plays an important role in atmospheric processes and serves as a key tracer of biomass burning, the major emission source of primary carbonaceous particles and trace gases in the global atmosphere. Recognizing its significance, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme has designated acetonitrile as one of the target volatile organic compounds for global atmospheric monitoring, aiming for data quality better than 20 % accuracy and 15 % precision. Meeting the objectives of the WMO GAW Programme requires accurate and stable calibration standards with expanded uncertainties of less than 5 %. In this study, we explored the feasibility of gravimetry for developing primary standard gas mixtures (PSMs) in three different types of aluminium cylinders, each with distinct internal surface treatments, at nmol mol−1 and µmol mol−1 levels with a relative expanded uncertainty of less than 5 % and nitrogen as the matrix gas. We found that all three types of cylinders were inadequate without further passivation for developing acetonitrile PSMs below 10 nmol mol−1 due to significant adsorption losses (6 %–49 %) onto the cylinder's inner surface. To overcome this challenge, we prepared acetonitrile gas mixtures at 100 nmol mol−1 using a modified gravimetric method and at 10 µmol mol−1 using a conventional gravimetric method and then evaluated their long-term stability. Results showed that the effect of the adsorption loss at 100 nmol mol−1 and 10 µmol mol−1 was negated and negligible, respectively. Stability results show that we can disseminate acetonitrile calibration standards at both 100 nmol mol−1 and 10 µmol mol−1 with a relative expanded uncertainty of 3 % and 1 %, respectively (with an expiration period of 3 years), meeting the target uncertainty of the WMO GAW Programme. Further research is still needed to develop accurate and stable acetonitrile calibration standards below 10 nmol mol−1 that are closer to atmospheric levels."

Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in developing environmental models and maps. Tailored feature selection is crucial for its effective use in environmental modeling. It aims to support comprehensive environmental monitoring and analysis, helping researchers and policy-makers in managing environmental resources. 
 The production and evaluation of the analysis-ready and cloud-optimized (ARCO) data cube for continental Europe (including Ukraine, the UK, and Türkiye), derived from the Landsat analysis-ready dataset version 2 (ARD V2) produced by Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) team and covering the period from 2000 to 2022, is described. The data cube consists of 17 TB of data at a 30 m resolution and includes bimonthly, annual, and long-term spectral indices on various thematic topics, including surface reflectance bands, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), normalized difference snow index (NDSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), minimum normalized difference tillage index (minNDTI), bare soil fraction (BSF), number of seasons (NOS), and crop duration ratio (CDR). The data cube was developed with the intention to provide a comprehensive feature space for environmental modeling and mapping. The quality of the produced time series was assessed by (1) assessing the accuracy of gap-filled bimonthly Landsat data with artificially created gaps; (2) visual examination for artifacts and inconsistencies; (3) plausibility checks with ground survey data; and (4) predictive modeling tests, examples with soil organic carbon (SOC) and land cover (LC) classification. The time series reconstruction demonstrates high accuracy, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) smaller than 0.05, and R2 higher than 0.6, across all bands. The visual examination indicates that the product is complete and consistent, except for winter periods in northern latitudes and high-altitude areas, where high cloud and snow density introduce significant gaps and hence many artifacts remain. The plausibility check further shows that the indices  logically and statistically capture the processes. The BSF index showed a strong negative correlation (−0.73) with crop coverage data, while the minNDTI index had a moderate positive correlation (0.57) with the Eurostat tillage practice survey data. The detailed temporal resolution and long-term characteristics provided by different tiers of predictors in this data cube proved to be important for both soil organic carbon regression and LC classification experiments based on 60 723 LUCAS observations: long-term characteristics (tier 4) were particularly valuable for predictive mapping of SOC and LC, coming out on top of variable importance assessment. Crop-specific indices (NOS and CDR) provided limited value for the tested applications, possibly due to noise or insufficient quantification methods.

The evaluation results show that the CDR has long-term consistency and continuity, and is more accurate than other similar products in climate covariability, suggesting that the CDR is suitable for climate change research and for constraining climate model simulations. 
 We developed a climate data record (CDR) of atmospheric column water vapor (CWV) and sea surface temperature (SST) under oceanic rain-free conditions using over two decades of observational records from three satellite instruments: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2). The AMSR-E and AMSR2 satellites operated in near-stable orbits, while the MWRI experienced orbital drifts of nearly an hour during its operational period. The CWV and SST products were retrieved from well-recalibrated level-1 brightness temperatures observed by common channels with the same frequencies on these instruments, designed for measuring these properties. Adjustments for diurnal drifting errors caused by orbital drift were applied to MWRI data using a semi-physical model developed in previous studies. The combination of prior recalibration and diurnal drift adjustment ensured inter-satellite consistency in the CDRs. Compared to in-situ radiosonde and buoy observations, the biases and root mean square errors of the CDRs are within 0.1 mm and 4.4 mm for CWV, and 0.2 K and 1.6 K for SST, respectively. Long-term trends of the retrieved CWV and SST align with observations from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA) products. The global oceanic trends of CWV and SST were 0.39 mm decade-1 and 0.16 K decade-1, respectively, over the period 2002–2022. Inter-consistency between CWV and SST, as well as layer-mean temperatures derived from satellite microwave sounder observations, was examined and compared with climate model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). It was found that the trend ratio of the retrieved CWV to SST was 9.9 % K-1 in the tropics, which closely aligns with CMIP6 models. These validation results indicate that the presented CDR has high accuracy and is suitable for long-term climate change research.

The study emphasises the spatial variability of water properties, nutrient distribution and biological communities determined by oceanographic dynamics, in a region influenced by sea ice melting, Atlantic water inflow and climatic teleconnections during a record low summer sea ice extent. 
 In September 2021, as part of the Italian Arctic research programme, a multidisciplinary cruise along the 75th parallel north through the Greenland Sea Gyre was conducted aboard the Italian icebreaker Laura Bassi as part of the CASSANDRA project, which also contributed to the Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) 2020/22. The cruise took place during the period of the lowest summer sea ice extent ever measured. The data show strong horizontal gradients with temperatures between 1.5 °C and 9.0 °C and salinity between 30 and 35. Warm and salty Atlantic Water (AW, θ > 3.0 °C, S around 35) dominates on the eastern side of the transect in the upper 500 m with surface temperatures of 4.5–9.0 °C, while Polar Water (PW, θ < 0 °C, S < 33) occupies the surface layer (50–80 m) in the west. The intermediate layer (100–500 m) consists of mixed water, and below 500 m the deep water of the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea predominates. The oxygen enrichment is higher in the intermediate layers, while the values in deep layers and western regions are lower (< 300 µmol kg-1). A stratified upper layer (30–50 m deep) with low surface nutrients, especially nitrate, is observed, while an accumulation of silicate occurs in deep water masses. The surface water in the eastern part of the transect has high pHT and total alkalinity values due to photosynthesis and the presence of salty AW, while the fresh PW in the west has a lower alkalinity. Respiratory activity and organic matter concentrations (particulate/dissolved organic carbon) vary horizontally at the surface, decrease with depth, and increase slightly near the seafloor. A west-east gradient is also observed for δ¹⁸O and δD, with the ratios indicating the influence of freshwater at the surface near the Greenland coast. The abundance of prokaryotes decreases from the photic zone (< 100 m depth) to the sea floor. Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids are identified as well-utilised polymers at every station and in every layer. Overall, the microbial enzyme patterns show a decrease from the surface to deeper layers, with some hotspots of metabolic activity at 20–40 m and in the aphotic layer. The enzyme patterns vary spatially, with activity peaks at the ends and in the middle of the transect. Phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll-a, varies across the transect, with higher values at its extremities. Micro-phytoplankton fraction dominates in PW, replacing the nano-phytoplankton fraction, which is prevalent in AW, even at the interface between the two water masses. Data of phytoplankton communities show low abundances and dominance of nano-sized organisms, with diatoms being more abundant in the western part. Microzooplankton represents an important fraction of the planktonic community in this area, with tintinnids being the most important groups along the transect. Micrometazoans and aloricate ciliates are more abundant in the AW, resulting in higher biomass values at the eastern stations. Copepods are the most abundant mesozooplanktonic taxon both at the surface and in the upper 100 m water layer (97 % and 94 % of total mesozooplankton abundance, respectively), mainly represented by the genus Calanus."

Comparisons of the measured data for cloudless days with values from a radiation transfer model provide a basis for data homogenization. Averaged results from different versions of the recalculated data give the 1976−2004 trend of about 6 % per 10 years in annual RE for all biological effects. 
 A long-term series of exposures to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is required to assess the risks and benefits of radiation on different human biological processes. However, homogenisation of the amount of biologically effective solar energy reaching the Earth's surface over long periods (i.e. energy weighted according to the sensitivity of the selected biological process to solar radiation) is challenging due to changes in measurement methods and instruments. This paper presents the world's longest homogenised time series of biologically effective daily radiant exposures (DRE) from regular monitoring with different erythemal biometers (EB) operated at the Central Geophysical Laboratory of the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (IG PAS), Belsk (20.79° E, 51.84° N) from 1 January 1976 to 31 December 2023. The following biological effects were considered: the appearance of erythema, cutaneous synthesis of previtamin D3, and clearing of psoriatic lesions. The data for the latter two biological effects are estimated based on the proposed method of using EB measurements to calculate other non-erythemal DRE. The following broadband erythemal radiometers were used in the monitoring: Robertson-Berger (1975−1992), Solar Light model 501 (1993−1994 with #927, 1995−2013 with #2011) and Kipp-Zonen UV-AE-T #30616 from 5 August 2013 to the present. From 1976 to 2013, the homogenisation procedure consisted of comparing the measured erythemal DRE and UV index (erythemal irradiance at noon) with the corresponding synthetic values from simulations using a radiation transfer model. Between 2014 and 2023, the raw data were compared with data from a collocated reference instrument, the Brewer Mark II #64 spectrometer. Such comparisons resulted in a set of multipliers that were applied to the raw EB measurements. Two different versions of the homogenisation method were applied (for erythemal DRE and UV index with different selection of cloudless days), and three regression models were constructed for the erythemal data based on total column ozone, aerosol optical depth and global irradiance clearness index. Linear trends calculated from reevaluated and reconstructed time series (a total of seven time series were considered) showed a statistically significant increase in erythemal annual and summer (June to August) radiant exposures of about 6 % per decade over the period 1976−2005. Thereafter, no trend was observed. The same trend estimates were found for all biological effects considered.

A model for parametrized domestic emissions has also been included, for which an idealized model run is conducted for particulate matter (PM10). The results show that, in addition to individual sources and diurnal variations in energy consumption, vertical transport and urban topology play a role in concentration distribution. 
 This article presents an enhanced emission module for the PALM model system, which collects discrete emission sources from different emission sectors and assigns them dynamically to the prognostic equations for specific pollutant species as volumetric source terms. Bidirectional lookups between each source location and cell index are maintained by using a hash key approach, while allowing all emission source modules to be conceived, developed, and operated in a homogeneous and mutually independent manner. An additional generic emission mode has also been implemented to allow for the use of external emission data in simulation runs. Results from benchmark runs indicate a high level of performance and scalability. Subsequently, a module for modeling parametrized emissions from domestic heating is implemented under this framework, using the approach of building energy usage and temperature deficit as a generalized form of heating degree days. A model run has been executed under idealized conditions by solely considering dispersion of PM10 from domestic heating sources. The results demonstrate a strong overall dependence on the strength and clustering of individual sources, diurnal variation in domestic heat usage, and the temperature deficit between the ambient temperature and the user-defined target temperature. Vertical transport additionally contributes to a rapid attenuation of daytime PM10. Although urban topology plays a minor role on the pollutant concentrations at ground level, it has a relevant contribution to the vertical pollutant distribution."

Mayr;Tobias Hell,Identifying lightning processes in ERA5  soundings with deep learning,"As lightning is a brief and localized event, it is not explicitly resolved in atmospheric models. Instead, expert-based auxiliary descriptions are used to assess it. This study explores how AI can improve our understanding of lightning without relying on traditional expert knowledge. We reveal that AI independently identified the key factors known to experts as essential for lightning in the Alps region. This shows how knowledge discovery could be sped up in areas with limited expert knowledge. 
 Atmospheric environments favorable for lightning and convection are commonly represented by proxies or parameterizations based on expert knowledge such as convective available potential energy (CAPE), wind shear, charge separation, or combinations thereof. Recent developments in the field of high-resolution reanalyses, accurate lightning observations, machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) open possibilities for identifying tailored proxies without prior expert knowledge.This study utilizes a deep neural network trained to match temporally and vertically well-resolved ERA5 soundings of cloud physics, mass-field, and wind-field variables with lightning observations from the Austrian Lightning Information & Detection System (ALDIS). The ML model only receives the raw model atmosphere data as inputs, without incorporating any expert parameters or proxies derived from the model levels. Using and adapting appropriate XAI methods, it is then demonstrated how the inner workings of this well-performing deep learning model can be uncovered to identify physically meaningful patterns within the ERA5 soundings that describe lightning processes.The ERA5 parameters are taken on model levels beyond the tropopause, forming an input layer of approx. 670 features, and the lightning data are transformed to a binary target variable labeling the spatio-temporal ERA5 grid cells as cells with lightning activity and cells without lightning activity.Scaled Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values are introduced to highlight the atmospheric processes learned by the neural network and show that the model identifies cloud ice and snow content in the upper troposphere and mid-troposphere as very relevant features. As these patterns correspond to the separation of charge in thunderstorm clouds, the deep learning model can serve as a physically meaningful description of lightning. The scaled SHAP values also reveal that, depending on the location, the model additionally learns to correctly classify cells with lightning activity by exploiting mass-field or wind-field variables.This approach also showcases how XAI can be used to accelerate knowledge discovery in areas where expert knowledge is still scarce."

Using the organic-based parameterization, PMCAMx-UF predicted higher N10 (particle number above 10 nm) concentrations over Europe by 40 %–60 % on average during the simulated period, which is a relatively small difference, given the differences in the two assumed mechanisms. The low sensitivity of the particle number concentrations to the nucleation mechanisms used in this study may not exist in other regions outside Europe. Adjusting the nucleation rate by an order of magnitude for both mechanisms led to an average change of ±30 % in N10 for the ternary ammonia case and −30 % to 40 % for the biogenic vapor case. In the biogenic organic nucleation scenario, reducing the fresh nuclei diameter from 1.7 to 1 nm resulted in reductions in N10 and N100 by −13 % and −1 %, respectively. Incorporating extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) as the nucleating species resulted in a predicted increase in the N10 concentration by 10 %–40 % over continental Europe compared to the ammonia parameterization. Model predictions were evaluated against field measurements from 26 stations across Europe during the summer of 2012. For N10, the ternary ammonia and ELVOC-based parameterizations were in better agreement with the field data compared to the other tested mechanisms. In the case of N100, all used parameterizations resulted in predictions that were consistent with the available field measurements."

The method showed high accuracy and rapid response potential regardless of weather and illumination conditions. By overcoming the limits of optical satellite imagery, it offers a powerful tool for global landslide detection, benefiting disaster management and advancing methods for monitoring hazardous terrains. 
 Rapid response to multiple landslide events (MLEs) demands accurate, all-weather, day-and-night detection capabilities. Optical remote sensing has advanced landslide detection but remains limited under adverse weather and lighting conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), resilient to these constraints, remains underexplored for automated landslide detection due to challenges such as complex pre-processing and geometric distortions. This study integrates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with SAR backscatter data for co-seismic landslide detection, utilizing a data-centric approach. We inform the models using 11 earthquake-induced MLEs, covering ≈ 73000 landslides across diverse geologic and climatic settings. Inference on unseen MLEs in Haiti (2021) and Sumatra (2022) demonstrates robust transferability, achieving F1-scores up to 82 %. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we highlight the discriminative capability of change detection bands over backscatter alone. Our findings emphasize the potential of SAR-based DNN models for worldwide, generalized, and rapid landslide detection, addressing critical gaps in current methods that solely use optical data. This research lays a foundation for broader applications in automated SAR-based earth surface change detection, particularly in complex, hilly and mountainous terrains."

The defect-rich N-GS encapsulated on the Ti4O7 surface significantly enhances interfacial charge transfer. This enhancement results in the N-GS/CeO2@Ti4O7 heterojunction composite electrode exhibiting excellent efficiency in the electro-oxidation of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA or GenX). Furthermore, a flow-through N-GS/CeO2@Ti4O7 reactive electrochemical membrane system effectively mineralizes other 35 PFASs in a real fluorochemical wastewater sample, achieving a high defluorination rate of 70–90% and exhibiting better performance in PFAS destruction and energy efficiency compared to the UV/KI-SO32– process.

We first conducted a detailed study covering the period from 1979 to 2024, during which satellite observations were first became available. Then, using historical records and projected future climate-change scenarios, we simulated the dynamics of BVOCs over an extended timeframe (1790–2065). To track changes in BVOCs emissions, we accounted for constant emission factors and used remotely sensed proxies, summarized into five main factors: biomass, temperature, carbon dioxide, soil moisture, and wildfire. Our results show that the trend of BVOCs emissions declining reversed in 1978 ± 1, with increases now being observed. Since this year, the average BVOCs emissions in Germany increased by ∼54%.

Moreover, rate constants determined in AS experiments have shown the potential to be used as predictors for half-lives in other environmental compartments, such as soil. Therefore, biotransformation experiments with AS could serve as a valuable basis for developing standardized, high-throughput persistence tests used for screening purposes, e.g., in a benign-by-design framework, if reproducibility of experimental outcomes can be ensured. Here, we tested protocols for the preservation of AS microbial communities using lyophilization or cryopreservation. Their preservation performance was evaluated for 36 representative micropollutants (MPs) in 72 h, lab-scale batch experiments, with fresh AS as a reference. Cryopreservation, using either DMSO or glycerol as a protective agent, preserved the biotransformation potential for most of the MPs (∼65%), showing significant deviations in biotransformation kinetics almost exclusively for amine-containing substances. Lyophilization, however, performed worse with over ∼89% of MPs exhibiting significantly decreased or enhanced biotransformation compared to fresh AS. We further demonstrate nonsignificant impacts of storage time and the possibility of using artificial instead of preserved native supernatant. Major shifts in community composition based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing results aligned with biotransformation outcomes. Overall, the results suggest that our optimized cryopreservation protocol holds promise to preserve the biotransformation potential of AS and, upon further refinement and testing, might effectively support long-term reproducibility in persistence assessment."

However, the influence of TMP-derived oxidation intermediates on the target photochemical reactions has not been comprehensively examined. This study investigated TMP’s effect on the photolysis of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a common antibiotic found in natural waters, in the presence of different DOM sources or model photosensitizer. Contrary to expectation, TMP significantly accelerated SMX photolysis, with the extent of enhancement depending on TMP and DOM concentrations. Laser flash photolysis and kinetic modeling suggested the long-lived TMP-derived reactive species (TMP-RS), including phenoxyl radicals, semiquinone radicals, and quinones, as the key factors in this process. Unlike 3DOM*, TMP-RS may react with SMX with the formation of  non-SMX•+ intermediates. This process prevents the reduction of SMX•+ and the subsequent regeneration of SMX. The kinetic model successfully predicts the dynamic contributions of various factors to SMX oxidation during the reaction, highlighting the critical role of TMP-RS.

Here, Suwannee River NOM (SRNOM) adsorption onto Al2O3 was investigated under varied carbon concentrations, and properties of SRNOM-coated surfaces were characterized using spectroscopic and interfacial techniques. Heterogeneous (Fe, Cr)(OH)3 precipitation on SRNOM-coated surfaces was studied at acidic pH via metal analysis and phase/size characterization. With lower NOM concentrations, preferential adsorption of aromatic moieties occurred, rendering more hydrophobic surfaces, which promoted nucleation and resulted in precipitates with higher Cr/Fe ratios. With higher NOM concentrations, NOM-coated surfaces became more negatively charged, attributed to enrichment of acidic (i.e., carboxylate) structures. Therefore, the amount of heterogeneous precipitates increased as enriched carboxylates and negative charge promoted heterogeneous nucleation and deposition. The controlling mechanisms were further validated with model OMs: For humic acid and fulvic acid, similar phenomena were observed with SRNOM. For polyacrylic acid with high acidity and no aromaticity, its adsorption onto Al2O3 made the surface highly negatively charged and hydrophilic, resulting in promoted heterogeneous precipitation with low Cr incorporation. Preferential adsorption of OMs with higher molecular weights (MWs) onto Al2O3 also occurred, but the MW did not affect either the amount or composition of heterogeneous (Fe, Cr)(OH)3 precipitates.

MCSs exhibit strong regional and seasonal variations, peaking during the summer monsoon (June–September). Concentrated along a southeast‐northwest band of the monsoon trough, MCS contribute 40%–70% of total precipitation and predominantly move westward at an average speed of 6.3 m s−1. Long‐lived MCSs (>40 hr), although 10 times less frequent than short‐lived MCSs (5–20 hr), produce 2–3 times more rainfall. Longer MCS lifespans and higher rainfall are associated with stronger deep‐layer wind shear and enhanced lower free‐tropospheric moisture at initiation. Land and ocean MCSs exhibit distinct diurnal cycles. Most land‐based MCSs initiate around 16 LT and mature at 18 LT, whereas Bay of Bengal (BoB) MCSs initiate between 04 and 06 LT and peak by 14 LT. Convective precipitations from MCSs significantly surpasses that from non‐MCSs systems, emphasizing their critical role in intense monsoon rainfall. Short‐ and long‐lived MCSs showed distinct lifecycle evolution. Long‐lived MCSs over the BoB show 37% larger cold‐cloud shields, 44% larger precipitation feature areas, and 33% higher rain rates than their land counterparts, yielding 67% more total rainfall.

Deposition velocity of NO and NO2 varies among plant species and the existence of the compensation point, the concentration value when net exchange flux of NO or NO2 is zero, remains uncertain. Additionally, leaf‐level uptake of NO and NO2 in subtropical forests in China has received little attention despite this area suffering from heavy nitrogen pollution. To help address the knowledge gap, leaf‐level exchange of NO and NO2 between needles of mature Pinus massoniana and the atmosphere was monitored in situ in a subtropical forest in Southwest China. The results showed that the total uptake of NO and NO2 by the canopy reached 1.03 ± 0.31 kg N m−2 (Land) yr−1, of which 93.9% was contributed by NO2. The NO deposition velocity was below detection limit. For NO2 it ranged between 0.028 and 1.2 cm s−1. Distinct NO2 uptake was observed (0.035 cm s−1) during summer droughts when stomatal conductance was expected to be small. No consistent NO2 emissions or uptake were detected at low NO2 concentrations (<3 ppbv), indicating the need of controlled environments to conclusively determine the existence of a compensation point. Due to species‐specific NO and NO2 deposition velocities and potential prolonged drought in East Asia, more long‐term monitoring of leaf‐level NO and NO2 exchanges for other subtropical tree species, especially during droughts, is needed to precisely constrain the regional NOx budget."

 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a time-sensitive emergency that requires prompt identification and intervention: sudden, unwitnessed cardiac arrest is nearly unsurvivable1–3. A cardinal sign of cardiac arrest is sudden loss of pulse4. Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the significant prognostic role of time3,5, but only if the false positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized5–7. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography (PPG), we show that wearable PPG measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced via an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation (VF). Based on the similarity of the PPG signal (from VF or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Once developed, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval, 64.32%–70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model. These results suggest a new opportunity, deployable at scale, for wearable-based detection of sudden loss of pulse while minimizing societal costs of excess false detections7."

 Whilst holding great promise for low noise, ease of operation and networking [1], useful photonic quantum computing has been precluded by the need for beyond-state-of-the-art components, manufactured by the millions [2–6]. Here we introduce a manufacturable platform [7] for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically-integrated silicon photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network, and detect heralded photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with 99.98% ± 0.01% state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference between independent photon sources with 99.50% ± 0.25% visibility, two-qubit fusion with 99.22% ± 0.12% fidelity, and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with 99.72% ± 0.04% fidelity, conditional on photon detection and not accounting for loss. We preview a selection of next-generation technologies—low-loss silicon nitride waveguides and components to address loss, as well as fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors, low-loss chip-to-fiber coupling, and barium titanate electro-optic phase shifters for high-performance fast switching."

 Hofstadter’s butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature1. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter’s butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields1–3. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter’s butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants4–6, such as those with moiré superlattices7–10. Yet, so far, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to investigate the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the predicted second magic angle11,12, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter’s spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, showing phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter’s original model owing to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in TBG.

 Mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has evolved into a powerful tool for comprehensively analysing biological systems. Recent technological advances have markedly increased sensitivity, enabling single-cell proteomics and spatial profiling of tissues. Simultaneously, improvements in throughput and robustness are facilitating clinical applications. In this Review, we present the latest developments in proteomics technology, including novel sample-preparation methods, advanced instrumentation and innovative data-acquisition strategies. We explore how these advances drive progress in key areas such as protein–protein interactions, post-translational modifications and structural proteomics. Integrating artificial intelligence into the proteomics workflow accelerates data analysis and biological interpretation. We discuss the application of proteomics to single-cell analysis and spatial profiling, which can provide unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. Finally, we examine the transition of proteomics from basic research to clinical practice, including biomarker discovery in body fluids and the promise and challenges of implementing proteomics-based diagnostics.

 In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance1,2. Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging3–6. We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti75.25Al20Cr4.75, this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 103 kg m−3) and a high specific strength (185 × 103 Pa m3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases.

 Gliomas are incurable malignancies notable for having an immunosuppressive microenvironment with abundant myeloid cells, the immunomodulatory phenotypes of which remain poorly defined1. Here we systematically investigate these phenotypes by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, spatial transcriptomics and glioma organoid explant systems. We discovered four immunomodulatory expression programs: microglial inflammatory and scavenger immunosuppressive programs, which are both unique to primary brain tumours, and systemic inflammatory and complement immunosuppressive programs, which are also expressed by non-brain tumours. The programs are not contingent on myeloid cell type, developmental origin or tumour mutational state, but instead are driven by microenvironmental cues, including tumour hypoxia, interleukin-1β, TGFβ and standard-of-care dexamethasone treatment. Their relative expression can predict immunotherapy response and overall survival. By associating the respective programs with mediating genomic elements, transcription factors and signalling pathways, we uncover strategies for manipulating myeloid-cell phenotypes. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulation by myeloid cells in glioma and a foundation for the development of more-effective immunotherapies.

 Macrophages specialize in phagocytosis, a cellular process that eliminates extracellular matter, including microorganisms, through internalization and degradation1,2. Despite the critical role of phagocytosis during bacterial infection, the fate of phagocytosed microbial cargo and its impact on the host cell are poorly understood. In this study, we show that ingested bacteria constitute an alternative nutrient source that skews immunometabolic host responses. By tracing stable isotope-labelled bacteria, we found that phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria provides carbon atoms and amino acids that are recycled into various metabolic pathways, including glutathione and itaconate biosynthesis, and satisfies the bioenergetic needs of macrophages. Metabolic recycling of microbially derived nutrients is regulated by the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1 and is intricately tied to microbial viability. Dead bacteria, as opposed to live bacteria, are enriched in cyclic adenosine monophosphate, sustain the cellular adenosine monophosphate pool and subsequently activate adenosine monophosphate protein kinase to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1. Consequently, killed bacteria strongly fuel metabolic recycling and support macrophage survival but elicit decreased reactive oxygen species production and reduced interleukin-1β secretion compared to viable bacteria. These results provide a new insight into the fate of engulfed microorganisms and highlight a microbial viability-associated metabolite that triggers host metabolic and immune responses. Our findings hold promise for shaping immunometabolic intervention for various immune-related pathologies.

 Rates of lineage diversification vary considerably across the tree of life, often as a result of evolutionary innovations1–5. Although the ability to produce new traits can vary between clades and may drive ecological transitions6–9, the impact of differences in the pace at which innovations evolve at macroevolutionary scales has been overlooked. Complex teeth are one innovation that contributed to the evolutionary success of major vertebrate lineages10–12. Here we show that evolutionary lability of tooth complexity, but not complexity itself, spurs rapid diversification across ray-finned fishes. Speciation rates are five times higher when transitions between simple and complex teeth occur rapidly. We find that African cichlids are unique among all fishes; they are dominated by lineages that transition between simple and complex teeth at unparalleled rates. This innovation interacted with the ecological versatility of complex teeth to spur rapid adaptive radiations in lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo. The marked effect on diversification stems from the tight association of tooth complexity with microhabitat and diet. Our results show that phylogenetic variation in how innovations evolve can have a stronger effect on patterns of diversification than the innovation itself. Investigating the impact of innovations from this new perspective will probably implicate more traits in causing heterogeneous diversification rates across the tree of life.

 Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state.

 Social grouping increases survival in many species, including humans1,2. By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (‘loneliness’) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion3–5. The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social need, similar to physiological drives such as hunger, thirst or sleep3,6. In this study, we assessed social responses in several mouse strains, among which FVB/NJ mice emerged as highly, and C57BL/6J mice as moderately, sensitive to social isolation. Using both strains, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during either social isolation or social rebound and orchestrate the behaviour display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations and with brain areas associated with social behaviour, emotional state, reward and physiological needs and showed that mice require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfil their social need. These data show a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis and provide significant mechanistic insights into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context. New data on brain-wide circuits centred around two interconnected hypothalamic neuron populations provide significant mechanistic insights into the emergence of social need during social isolation and the satiation of social need during social reunion."

 The regulation of metabolism is vital to any organism and can be achieved by transcriptionally activating or repressing metabolic genes1–3. Although many examples of transcriptional metabolic rewiring have been reported4, a systems-level study of how metabolism is rewired in response to metabolic perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here we apply Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)—a high-throughput method combining whole-animal RNA-interference and RNA-sequencing5—to around 900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which 385 perturbations are connected to 9,414 genes by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 gene expression programs. The mGRN reveals different modes of transcriptional rewiring from simple reaction and pathway compensation to rerouting and more complex network coordination. Using metabolic network modelling, we identify a design principle of transcriptional rewiring that we name the compensation–repression (CR) model. The CR model explains most transcriptional responses in metabolic genes and reveals a high level of compensation and repression in five core metabolic functions related to energy and biomass. We provide preliminary evidence that the CR model may also explain transcriptional metabolic rewiring in human cells.

 The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is highly specialized to protect the brain from harmful circulating factors in the blood and maintain brain homeostasis1,2. The brain endothelial glycocalyx layer, a carbohydrate-rich meshwork composed primarily of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids that coats the BBB lumen, is a key structural component of the BBB3,4. This layer forms the first interface between the blood and brain vasculature, yet little is known about its composition and roles in supporting BBB function in homeostatic and diseased states. Here we find that the brain endothelial glycocalyx is highly dysregulated during ageing and neurodegenerative disease. We identify significant perturbation in an underexplored class of densely O-glycosylated proteins known as mucin-domain glycoproteins. We demonstrate that ageing- and disease-associated aberrations in brain endothelial mucin-domain glycoproteins lead to dysregulated BBB function and, in severe cases, brain haemorrhaging in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that we can improve BBB function and reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in aged mice by restoring core 1 mucin-type O-glycans to the brain endothelium using adeno-associated viruses. Cumulatively, our findings provide a detailed compositional and structural mapping of the ageing brain endothelial glycocalyx layer and reveal important consequences of ageing- and disease-associated glycocalyx dysregulation on BBB integrity and brain health. Disruption of mucin-domain glycoprotein expression and function in the endothelial glycocalyx are associated with ageing and Alzheimer’s disease, leading to dysregulated blood–brain barrier function."

Briggs,The conserved HIV-1 spacer peptide 2 triggers matrix lattice maturation,"A study reports that the structural maturation of the matrix domain of the Gag protein of HIV-1 is induced by the proteolytic release and binding of the spacer peptide SP2. 
 The virus particles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are released in an immature, non-infectious form. Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into a distinct, mature MA lattice1. The mechanism of MA lattice maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind lipid into a side pocket as previously thought1, but instead binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein–protein interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro. SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger of MA structural maturation and assign function to the SP2 peptide. A study reports that the structural maturation of the matrix domain of the Gag protein of HIV-1 is induced by the proteolytic release and binding of the spacer peptide SP2."

Wood,Continued Atlantic overturning circulation even under climate extremes,"Climate models suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is unlikely to collapse this century, owing to stabilization from wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean. 
 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), vital for northwards heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean, is projected to weaken owing to global warming1, with significant global climate impacts2. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse5. Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.

 Human accelerated regions (HARs) are conserved genomic loci that have experienced rapid nucleotide substitutions following the divergence from chimpanzees1,2. HARs are enriched in candidate regulatory regions near neurodevelopmental genes, suggesting their roles in gene regulation3. However, their target genes and functional contributions to human brain development remain largely uncharacterized. Here we elucidate the cis-regulatory functions of HARs in human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-induced excitatory neurons. Using genomic4 and chromatin looping information, we prioritized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for functional characterization via single-cell CRISPR interference, and demonstrated their species-specific gene regulatory functions. Our findings reveal diverse functional outcomes of HAR-mediated cis-regulation in human neurons, including attenuated NPAS3 expression by altering the binding affinities of multiple transcription factors in HAR202 and maintaining iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation capacities through the upregulation of PUM2 by 2xHAR.319. Finally, we used prime editing to demonstrate differential enhancer activity caused by several HAR26;2xHAR.178 variants. In particular, we link one variant in HAR26;2xHAR.178 to elevated SOCS2 expression and increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons. Thus, our study sheds new light on the endogenous gene regulatory functions of HARs and their potential contribution to human brain evolution.

 Antimicrobial resistance is a public health threat associated with increased morbidity, mortality and financial burden in nursing homes and other healthcare settings1. Residents of nursing homes are at increased risk of pathogen colonization and infection owing to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and fungi. Nursing homes act as reservoirs, amplifiers and disseminators of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare networks and across geographical regions2. Here we investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin colonization and clonal spread of C. auris on the skin of nursing home residents and throughout a metropolitan region. We also report that most Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Entobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens and other high-priority pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii) are shared in a nursing home. Integrating microbiome and clinical microbiology data, we detect carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes. We analyse publicly available shotgun metagenomic samples (stool and skin) collected from residents with varying medical conditions living in seven other nursing homes and provide additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing. Taken together, our data suggest that skin is a reservoir for colonization by C. auris and ESKAPE pathogens and their associated antimicrobial-resistance genes.

 Investigating glacial isostatic adjustment has been the standard method to decipher Earth’s interior viscosity structure1,2, but such an approach has been rarely applied to other planets because of a lack of observational data3,4. The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure5,6. Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models7, viscoelastic deformation calculations8 and radar observations6. We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate10. Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 1022 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars11,12.

 Quantum networks that distribute entanglement among remote nodes will unlock transformational technologies in quantum computing, communication and sensing1–4. However, state-of-the-art networks5–14 use only a single optically addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms15–24 provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking in which multiple spectrally distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities25–31. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate the bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs32,33. Second, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols34,35.

 A comprehensive, computable representation of the functional repertoire of all macromolecules encoded within the human genome is a foundational resource for biology and biomedical research. The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms1,2. Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available.

Furthermore, the multi-cell architecture ensures a sufficient elastocaloric mass for tight assembly while maintaining a low system fluid pressure. Our device achieves a cooling power of 1,284 W on the fluid side at zero temperature lift during the initial 500,000 cycles, demonstrating the potential of this green cooling technology for a decarbonized future5,6.

 Despite advancements in wearable technologies1,2, barriers remain in achieving distributed computation located persistently on the human body. Here a textile fibre computer that monolithically combines analogue sensing, digital memory, processing and communication in a mass of less than 5 g is presented. Enabled by a foldable interposer, the two-dimensional pad architectures of microdevices were mapped to three-dimensional cylindrical layouts conforming to fibre geometry. Through connection with helical copper microwires, eight microdevices were thermally drawn into a machine-washable elastic fibre capable of more than 60% stretch. This programmable fibre, which incorporates a 32-bit floating-point microcontroller, independently performs edge computing tasks even when braided, woven, knitted or seam-sewn into garments. The universality of the assembly process allows for the integration of additional functions with simple modifications, including a rechargeable fibre power source that operates the computer for nearly 6 h. Finally, we surmount the perennial limitation of rigid interconnects by implementing two wireless communication schemes involving woven optical links and seam-inserted radio-frequency communications. To demonstrate its utility, we show that garments equipped with four fibre computers, one per limb, operating individually trained neural networks achieve, on average, 67% accuracy in classifying physical activity. However, when networked, inference accuracy increases to 95% using simple weighted voting.

 Humans emerged across Africa shortly before 300 thousand years ago (ka)1–3. Although this pan-African evolutionary process implicates diverse environments in the human story, the role of tropical forests remains poorly understood. Here we report a clear association between late Middle Pleistocene material culture and a wet tropical forest in southern Côte d’Ivoire, a region of present-day rainforest. Twinned optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating methods constrain the onset of human occupations at Bété I to around 150 ka, linking them with Homo sapiens. Plant wax biomarker, stable isotope, phytolith and pollen analyses of associated sediments all point to a wet forest environment. The results represent the oldest yet known clear association between humans and this habitat type. The secure attribution of stone tool assemblages with the wet forest environment demonstrates that Africa’s forests were not a major ecological barrier for H. sapiens as early as around 150 ka. The identification of tools dated to the time of Homo sapiens associated with microfloral evidence of wet tropical forests indicates that West African forests were occupied by humans much earlier in human evolution than previously thought."

 Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities1–3. Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.

 Intra-atomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation are the two fundamental processes when real atoms are condensed to form matter1,2. Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement3–8. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating intra-atomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of interatomic bond formation have been extensively observed in various artificial atoms9–17. However, direct evidence of the intra-atomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive control of quantum states in diverse systems.

 Chirality is a ubiquitous and fundamental asymmetry in nature1,2. Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives3–5. Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode8–10. Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.

 Topological defects and disorder counteract each other1–5. Intuitively, disorder is considered detrimental, requiring efforts to mitigate its effects in conventional topological photonics6–9. We propose a counter-intuitive approach that exploits a real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase10,11, without disrupting the momentum-space singularity originating from bound states in the continuum12. This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications.

 The search for simple principles that underlie the spatial structure and dynamics of plant communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology1–6. In particular, the relationship between species coexistence and the spatial distribution of plants is challenging to resolve in species-rich communities7–9. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of 720 tree species in 21 large forest plots and their consequences for species coexistence. We show that species with low abundance tend to be more spatially aggregated than more abundant species. Moreover, there is a latitudinal gradient in the strength of this negative aggregation–abundance relationship that increases from tropical to temperate forests. We suggest, in line with recent work10, that latitudinal gradients in animal seed dispersal11 and mycorrhizal associations12–14 may jointly generate this pattern. By integrating the observed spatial patterns into population models8, we derive the conditions under which species can invade from low abundance in terms of spatial patterns, demography, niche overlap and immigration. Evaluation of the spatial-invasion condition for the 720 tree species analysed suggests that temperate and tropical forests both meet the invasion criterion to a similar extent but through contrasting strategies conditioned by their spatial patterns. Our approach opens up new avenues for the integration of observed spatial patterns into ecological theory and underscores the need to understand the interaction among spatial patterns at the neighbourhood scale and multiple ecological processes in greater detail. A unified framework is presented that integrates observed spatial patterns of individual trees in forests with ecological processes into a novel coexistence theory."

 Metabolic flux, or the rate of metabolic reactions, is one of the most fundamental metrics describing the status of metabolism in living organisms. However, measuring fluxes across the entire metabolic network remains nearly impossible, especially in multicellular organisms. Computational methods based on flux balance analysis have been used with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict network-level flux wiring1–6. However, such approaches have limited power because of the lack of experimental constraints. Here, we introduce a strategy that infers whole-animal metabolic flux wiring from transcriptional phenotypes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a large-scale Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS) dataset for roughly 900 metabolic genes7, we show that the transcriptional response to metabolic gene perturbations can be integrated with the metabolic network model to infer a highly constrained, semi-quantitative flux distribution. We discover several features of adult C. elegans metabolism, including cyclic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, lack of de novo purine synthesis flux and the primary use of amino acids and bacterial RNA as a tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon source, all of which we validate by stable isotope tracing. Our strategy for inferring metabolic wiring based on transcriptional phenotypes should be applicable to a variety of systems, including human cells.

 To solve problems of practical importance1,2, quantum computers probably need to incorporate quantum error correction, in which a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits3–5. The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6–18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20–24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation. Bosonic qubits can be engineered to feature intrinsic protection against certain kinds of errors, which makes quantum error correction across many bosonic qubits possible with less overhead."

 For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots1,2. Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots3. How they navigate these design challenges is unclear4. Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network5. Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection.

 Mammalian genomes are folded through the distinct actions of structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes, which include the chromatin loop-extruding cohesin (extrusive cohesin), the sister chromatid cohesive cohesin and the mitotic chromosome-associated condensins1–3. Although these complexes function at different stages of the cell cycle, they exist together on chromatin during the G2-to-M phase transition, when the genome structure undergoes substantial reorganization1,2. Yet, how the different SMC complexes affect each other and how their interactions orchestrate the dynamic folding of the three-dimensional genome remain unclear. Here we engineered all possible cohesin and condensin configurations on mitotic chromosomes to delineate the concerted, mutually influential action of SMC complexes. We show that condensin disrupts the binding of extrusive cohesin at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites, thereby promoting the disassembly of interphase topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops during mitotic progression. Conversely, extrusive cohesin impedes condensin-mediated mitotic chromosome spiralization. Condensin reduces peaks of cohesive cohesin, whereas cohesive cohesin antagonizes condensin-mediated longitudinal shortening of mitotic chromosomes. The presence of both extrusive and cohesive cohesin synergizes these effects and inhibits mitotic chromosome condensation. Extrusive cohesin positions cohesive cohesin at CTCF-binding sites. However, cohesive cohesin by itself cannot be arrested by CTCF molecules and is insufficient to establish TADs or loops. Moreover, it lacks loop-extrusion capacity, which indicates that cohesive cohesin has nonoverlapping functions with extrusive cohesin. Finally, cohesive cohesin restricts chromatin loop expansion mediated by extrusive cohesin. Collectively, our data describe a three-way interaction among major SMC complexes that dynamically modulates chromatin architecture during cell cycle progression. Orthogonal acute inducible degradation cell lines are used to delineate the mechanisms of how extrusive cohesin, cohesive cohesin and condensin interact to remodel chromosome architecture from interphase to mitosis."

 Changes in the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions - particulate organic carbon (POC; unprotected carbon) vs. mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC; protected carbon) - affect SOC storage and stability. Here, we compile a SOC fraction dataset from 7219 soil samples across six continents. From 2000 to 2022, POC increases by 21.8% while MAOC decreases by 5.3%, leading to a net gain of 11.0% in SOC storage and a 29.1% increase in the POC/MAOC ratio. However, relative to undisturbed natural ecosystems, SOC declines in planted forests, grazed grasslands, and croplands with management practices such as heavy grazing and conventional tillage, primarily due to rapid declines in POC. Our results highlight that the global increase in SOC is mainly driven by POC, but warn of decreasing SOC stability associated with climate change and human activities. Thus, maintaining soil carbon sinks requires targeted strategies focusing on POC. Here, the authors warn of the declining stability of soil carbon associated with climate change and human activities.

Here, authors analyze the interlayer spacings of a family of oxides and propose an intrinsic structural parameter to serve as a measure of cycling stability. 
 The O3-type layered oxide represents a highly promising candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the intrinsic stability law of these cathodes remains elusive due to the complex phase transition mechanism and migration of transition metal (TM) ions. Here, we underscore how the ratio between the spacings of alkali metal layer and TM layer (R = dO-Na-O/dO-TM-O) plays a critical role in determining the structural stability and the corresponding electrochemical performance. We design a peculiar family of NaxMn0.4Ni0.3Fe0.15Li0.1Ti0.05O2 (0.55 ≤ x ≤ 1) composition that is thermodynamically stable as an O3-type structure even when R is as high as 1.969, far exceeding 1.62 that normal O3-type structures can reach at most. The high R-value puts the O3 cathode in the preparatory stage for the O3-P3 phase transition, resulting in a rapid yet smooth phase transition process. It also induces a significantly stretched interstitial tetrahedral structure to the Na layer, thus effectively impeding TM migration. Leveraging this mechanism, we reexamine the underlying cause for enhanced stability in P2/O3 hybrid structure. Besides the conventional wisdom of an interlocking effect, the high R-value nature of its O3 sub-phase also plays a pivotal role. O3-type layered oxides are promising intercalative electrode materials for Na-ion batteries.

Here, the authors propose a drawing process for Nylon 6 with high IR-transmittance and temperature reduction. 
 Infrared (IR)-transparent radiative cooling textiles show great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption. However, besides a few synthetic fiber materials proposed as IR-transparent textiles, traditional textile materials used to achieve IR transparency have not been realized, impeding large-scale practical applications. Here, based on a common textile material Nylon 6 (PA6), we design a high drawing process with rapid solvent evaporation to achieve IR-transparent PA6 textiles. By altering the chain conformations and crystal structures, the molecular vibrations in the IR region (IR absorption) of PA6 can be significantly weakened. Meanwhile, this process also tailors the fiber to the nanoscale and minimizes IR reflection. Consequently, a human body covered by our textile can stay 2.1 °C cooler than with cotton, corresponding to ~20% indoor energy savings in cooling. We expect that our work offers an innovative pathway to regulate IR radiation for personal thermal management.

 Mammalian genomes are biased towards GC bases at third codon positions, likely due to a GC-biased ancestral genome and the selectively neutral recombination-related process of GC-biased gene conversion. The unwanted transcript hypothesis posits that this high GC content at synonymous sites may be beneficial for protecting against spurious transcripts, particularly in species with low effective population sizes. Utilising a 240 placental mammal genome alignment and single-base resolution conservation scores, we interpret sequence conservation at mammalian four-fold degenerate sites in this context and find evidence in support of the unwanted transcript hypothesis, including a strong GC bias, high conservation at sites relating to exon splicing, less human genetic variation at conserved four-fold degenerate sites, and conservation of sites important for epigenetic regulation of developmental genes. Additionally, we show that high conservation of four-fold degenerate sites in essential developmental genes, including homeobox genes, likely relates to the low mutation rates experienced by these genes.

 The bottom-up reconstitution of self-growing artificial cells is a critical milestone toward realizing autonomy and evolvability.

Here, we report self-growing artificial cell models based on dextran-rich droplets in an aqueous two-phase system of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran (DEX).

We implement the protocells with cell-free transcription-translation systems coupled with DNA amplification/replication, which also show active self-growth. Considering the simplicities in terms of the chemical composition and the mechanism, these results underscore the potential of DEX droplets as a foundational platform for engineering protocells, giving implications for the emergence of protocells under prebiotic conditions.

 An important source of long range forecast skill for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) comes from predictability of tropical rainfall. While the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a better-known driver of the NAO, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) also has an influence, particularly when ENSO is inactive. Given future projected changes to ENSO and the IOD, it is important to understand how the IOD–NAO teleconnection may evolve. Here we use climate model simulations to investigate the IOD and its NAO teleconnection. We find that the IOD itself changes considerably under climate change, with a weakening of the present-day anticorrelation between the dipole nodes and a westward shift in the IOD pattern. While historical model simulations reproduce the IOD–NAO teleconnection pathway seen in observational analyses, the teleconnection is projected to weaken in future, with the weakening linked to the westward IOD shift.

The aggregated P were mitigated in 68% of provinces, while intensified in 32% provinces. Furthermore, the monthly assessment has found that the impact of transboundary water on P varies seasonally, generally alleviating in winter and exacerbating in summer.

 Strong earthquakes in mountain landscapes can trigger widespread slope failures, initiating chains of multiple hydro-geomorphic hazards. These impacts disrupting ongoing response operations may be amplified by extreme post-seismic precipitation delivered by atmospheric rivers (ARs). However, to our knowledge, cases of ARs following major earthquakes have not been previously documented. Here, we document the combined effects of seismic and precipitation extremes that perturbed the area struck by the February 6, 2023, Türkiye-Syrian earthquakes. Strong ground shaking triggered thousands of landslides, and 36 days later, an exceptionally strong AR delivered up to 183 mm of precipitation in just 20 hours. This extreme precipitation induced additional landslides, debris flows, and flooding, disrupting recovery efforts, affecting temporary settlement areas, and claiming more lives.

 Temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and nutrient availability are pivotal in determining the global distribution of marine cyanobacteria. This study demonstrates that the distinct latitudinal niches of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are modulated by their temperature-dependent, mixotrophic nitrogen utilization strategies. Comparative genomic analysis reveals that Prochlorococcus ecotypes differ in their nitrogen transporter repertoire, with low-light ecotypes harboring ~12 transporters, while high-light ecotypes possess ~5 transporters. Conversely, Synechococcus displays greater genomic flexibility, with 17 nitrogen transporters. Reanalysis of Tara Oceans metatranscriptomic data identifies ~15 °C as a key thermal threshold for cyanobacterial distribution. In warmer regions (15-30°C, 35˚S-40˚N), Prochlorococcus optimizes nitrogen transporter functions across their ecotypes, whereas Synechococcus, leveraging its broad nitrogen transporters, exhibits functional plasticity, utilizing inorganic nitrogen in warmer waters and organic nitrogen in cooler waters ranging from -2°C to 15 °C beyond 35˚S/40˚N.

The incorporation of longer wavelengths, which are less susceptible to interference from CDM, could prove beneficial in retrieving water properties, particularly in Arctic waters with high CDM content.

In this study, we propose an algorithm that accounts for elastic scattering and fluorescence of phytoplankton in the full visible spectral domain by coupling a tuned version of the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) algorithm (GSMA) for the AO with an optimized fluorescence emission model. Our novel algorithm, FGSM, demonstrate comparable overall performance to an empirical algorithm derived for chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) estimates in the AO (AO.emp), with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 1.83. In addition, FGSM outperforms both the GSMA and the fluorescence line height (FLH) algorithms, with an improvement in the MAD of Chl estimates up to 41 %. Assessments conducted using both in situ datasets and satellite data at the Lena River Delta, a region characterized by high productivity and the presence of coastal CDM, revealed that for eutrophic waters where Chl is generally high, FGSM significantly mitigate the underestimation of Chl by AO.emp and GSMA, and exhibit enhanced robustness to produce more retrievals than the other semi-analytical algorithms. FGSM also demonstrates superior performance compared to the other algorithms assessed in this study for waters with high suspended particulate matter (SPM). Further validations for Arctic waters, particularly turbid coastal waters, are still expected in the future."

 The 2023 Mw 6.8 Al Haouz earthquake struck Morocco’s Atlas Mountains on September 8, causing over 3000 fatalities and extensive damage, revealing hidden seismic hazards in this slowly deforming region. Despite its impact, Al Haouz earthquake has received limited scientific investigation. The absence of surface rupture, its occurrence in an intraplate seismic silence zone, and ambiguous focal mechanisms have hindered understanding of the fault’s kinematics. To address these gaps, our study employs the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique to refine the coseismic deformation. We further propose two fault-dipping scenarios, northward and southward, reinforced by a unique local seismic dataset to evaluate the fault rupture characterization. Additionally, stress change analysis assessed the stress transfer effects between the mainshock and aftershocks, culminating in a comprehensive geodynamic model. Our findings reveal a northward-dipping reverse fault with a strike of 249.8∘, a dip of 66°, and a rake of 55°, exhibiting a maximum slip of 1.75 m. Stress change analysis demonstrates that stress transfer from the mainshock reactivated pre-existing faults, particularly the Tizi n’Test fault system, triggering shallow aftershocks in high-stress zones. We suggest that mantle upwelling, coupled with fluid injection along pre-existing faults, drives seismic dynamics in the region. The Tizi n’Test fault likely extends to the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary, where active upwelling facilitates magma fluid intrusion, stimulating seismic activity. These findings are consistent with recent research, providing deeper insights into fault mechanics in the Atlas Mountains. They also highlight the significant contribution of satellite-based SAR techniques in uncovering hidden seismic hazards."

 Geological lithological interpretation is a key focus in Earth observation research, with applications in resource surveys, geological mapping, and environmental monitoring. Although deep learning (DL) methods has significantly improved the performance of lithological remote sensing interpretation, its accuracy remains far below the level achieved by visual interpretation performed by domain experts. This disparity is primarily due to the heavy reliance of current intelligent lithological interpretation methods on remote sensing imagery (RSI), coupled with insufficient exploration of sensitive features (SF) and prior knowledge (PK), resulting in low interpretation precision. Furthermore, multi-modal SF and PK exhibit significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity, which hinders their direct integration into DL networks. In this work, we propose the sensitive feature self-aggregation deep fusion network (SFA-DFNet). Inspired by the visual interpretation practices of domain experts, we selected the five most commonly used SF and one type of PK as multi-modal supplementary information. To address the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of SF and PK, we designed a self-aggregation mechanism (SA-Mechanism) that dynamically selects and optimizes beneficial information from multi-modal features for lithological interpretation. This mechanism has broad applicability and can be extended to support any number of modal data. Additionally, we introduced the cross-modal feature interaction fusion module (CM-FIFM), which enhances the effective exchange and fusion of RSI, SF, and PK by leveraging long-range contextual information. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that differences in lithological genesis and types are critical factors affecting interpretation accuracy. Compared with seven SOTA DL models, our method achieves more than a 3% improvement in mIoU, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness."

 Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task to generate pixel-wise category maps. Existing deep learning networks rely heavily on dense pixel-wise labels, incurring high acquisition costs. Given this challenge, this study introduces sparse point labels, a type of cost-effective weak labels, for semantic segmentation. Existing weakly-supervised methods often leverage low-level visual or high-level semantic features from networks to generate supervision information for unlabeled pixels, which can easily lead to the issue of label noises. Furthermore, these methods rarely explore the general-purpose foundation model, segment anything model (SAM), with strong zero-shot generalization capacity in image segmentation. In this paper, we proposed a SAM-adapted weakly-supervised method with three components: 1) an adapted EfficientViT-SAM network (AESAM) for semantic segmentation guided by point labels, 2) an uncertainty-based pseudo-label generation module to select reliable pseudo-labels for supervising unlabeled pixels, and 3) a transformation consistency constraint for enhancing AESAM’s robustness to data perturbations. The proposed method was tested on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset (collected from airplane), the Zurich Summer dataset (satellite), and the UAVid dataset (drone). Results demonstrated a significant improvement in mean F1 (by 5.89 %–10.56 %) and mean IoU (by 5.95 %–11.13 %) compared to the baseline method. Compared to the closest competitors, there was an increase in mean F1 (by 0.83 %–5.29 %) and mean IoU (by 1.04 %–6.54 %). Furthermore, our approach requires only fine-tuning a small number of parameters (0.9 M) using cheap point labels, making it promising for scenarios with limited labeling budgets.

 The regional deposited dose of ultrafine particles in the respiratory tract and their transport to the olfactory region was investigated through an existing particle dosimetry model (Exposure Dose Model 2, ExDoM2). The original dosimetry model was adapted to include a methodology that uses numerical modelling for the transport of ultrafine particles from the nose to the olfactory region. The mass dose to the oesophagus, blood, and lymph nodes was also calculated. Four different cases were studied: heating, traffic, nucleation events and background levels. The results showed that deposition in the olfactory region decreased with increasing particle size (from 0.40 % to 0.12 %). The majority of particles were estimated to penetrate into the thoracic region with 36 % of particles within the size range 14–33 nm deposited in the alveolar-interstitial region, followed by the tracheobronchial (21 %), the extrathoracic (11 %) and olfactory (<0.5 %) regions. In addition, a comparison between the mass, surface, and number doses indicated different governing sources such as a higher number dose was obtained during nucleation (10.5 × 108 particles), while higher mass (9.4 × 10−2 μg) and surface (7.1 × 1012 nm2) dose was obtained during heating periods. Simulations also indicated that after clearance, 56.9 % of ultrafine particles were found in the alveolar region, a finding that is linked to their small size and low clearance rate of this region.

 Accurate precipitable water vapor (PWV) monitoring is critical to understanding weather systems and predicting extreme meteorological events. The Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard the Fengyun-3A (FY-3A) satellite provides PWV products with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km. However, the MERSI PWV products contain a large amount of gross errors due to the stripe noise in the raw MERSI observations. Furthermore, the accuracy of MERSI PWV is also affected by weather conditions and land cover types. To address these limitations, we first applied Gaussian spatial filtering to the MERSI observations to attenuate the stripe noise and generate de-striped observations. Then, the MNPNet (MERSI NIR PWV retrieval Net) was developed based on random forest for the first time to retrieve PWV from the combination of GNSS PWV and MERSI near-infrared (NIR) atmospheric transmittance. The new nets well considered land cover types and weather conditions, and obtained amazing accuracy. The PWV derived from 256 GNSS stations in 2017 is used as a reference to validate the MNPNet PWV. The results show that root mean square errors (RMS) of the new net are 1.95 mm for clear weather, 2.68 mm for uncertain weather, 3.07 mm for cloudy weather, and 2.85 mm for all weather, which indicates improvements of 74 %, 78 %, 87 %, and 85 % over the original FY-3A/MERSI PWV.

 Diurnal cloud cycle (DCC) is closely related not only to the physical processes of cloud formation and development, but also to the different times of the day when clouds cause different radiative effects, which can significantly affect the Earth-atmosphere energy system and its hydrological cycle. Compared with the large number of model assessment studies on seasonal and interannual characteristics of clouds, fewer studies assessed DCC and its radiative effects. In this study, we select three characteristic parameters of DCC, namely mean cloud cover, amplitude and factor of centroid (F), and carry out a quantitative assessment of CMIP6 simulation results based on a systematic analysis of global DCC characteristics and Diurnal cloud cycle radiative effect (DCCRE) using the 2001–2014 ISCCP, CERES satellite observations and MERRA2 reanalysis. The main factors affecting DCCRE are also investigated. The results show that the models perform well in terms of daily mean cloud cover, but diurnal amplitude is smaller in some regions (e.g., the Southern Ocean); and there are large inter-model differences. However, limited comparative results between CMIP5 and CMIP6 indicate that the CMIP6 model makes a significant improvement in simulating the daily amplitude of cloud cover. We also find significant differences in daily phase of cloud amount between CMIP5&6 models and satellite results, namely the models are unable to accurately simulate the timing of daily cloud appearance, suggesting that the models do not represent cloud formation and maintenance mechanisms accurately. The satellite results show that the net radiative effects caused by DCC is mainly dominated by shortwave and that there are significant regional differences. The cloud daily amplitude shows a strong correlation with DCCRE globally, which is the main factor affecting DCCRE. In regions with significant daily variations in cloud cover, cloud daily fluctuations can induce radiative forcing of approximately ±15 W/m2 at TOA. However, the global distribution of simulated DCCRE of the CMIP6 models is significantly different from that of the satellite data, and the correlation between simulated DCCRE and amplitude is not exhibited in most regions, which is mainly due to the inaccuracy of the models in simulating cloud amplitude and phase, resulting in simulated radiative flux error."

Recent studies have reported a small number of biflorane synthases. However, the catalytic mechanism and structural basis for biflorane formation remain unclear. To address these issues, we conducted genome mining of terpene synthases from the sea whip coralParamuricea clavata, resulting in the discovery of a biflorane synthasePcTS1. We performed a series of isotope labeling, crystallography, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, and mutagenesis studies towardPcTS1 to investigate the mechanism. Isotopic labeling studies, together with calculations, elucidate a cascade of 1,10-cyclization, 1,3-hydride shift, 1,6-cyclization, 1,2-hydride shift, 2,6-cyclization, cyclopropane ring opening, and deprotonation by the generated pyrophosphate, forming the biflorane scaffold.

SolubleN-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins drive vesicle fusion, and SNARE proteins seem to be partially assembled before fusion occurs. However, the molecular mechanisms of the vesicle fusion arrest and how vesicle fusion is rescued from the arrest remain not fully understood. We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca2+-dependent vesicle fusion. We provide the model in which the arrest of vesicle fusion can be rescued by the unmasking of PIP2, a lipid catalyst for fusion."

They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population that is fundamentally different from stars and planets."

However, the roles of mechanically heterogeneous primary tumor microenvironment in metastatic organotropism remain an enigma. This study reports that persistent priming in soft but not stiff niches that mimic primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity induces transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of neuron and promotes the acquisition of brain metastatic potential. Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 abolishes niche softness-induced brain metastatic ability. Collectively, this study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of local niche softness within primary tumors in brain metastasis, highlighting the significance of primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity in metastatic organotropism."

Corpuscles are composed of a mechanoreceptor afferent surrounded by lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), enclosed by a multilayered outer core. The spatial arrangement of these components and their contribution to sensory tuning are unclear. We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels. Thus, functional tuning of the Pacinian corpuscle is enabled by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core."

These textured lithium ceramic electrolytes exhibit large columnar grains perpendicular to the surface. The textured electrodes indicate an out-of-plane crystallographic texture. As a result, the Li-ion transport pathways across the grain boundary plane are avoided in the textured lithium ceramic with low tortuosity, resulting in great ionic conductivity enhancement by 42 times compared to its traditional equiaxed counterpart.

Here, we used genome-scale DNA and RNA imaging to investigate 3D-genome organization in transcriptionally distinct cell types in the mouse cerebral cortex. We uncovered a wide spectrum of differences in the nuclear architecture and 3D-genome organization among different cell types, ranging from the size of the cell nucleus to higher-order chromosome structures and radial positioning of chromatin loci within the nucleus. These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes.

Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes.
