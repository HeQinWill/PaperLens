More recently, non-price behavioral interventions have emerged as an alternative. However, there is limited data on the relative efficacies of price and non-price interventions. We report results from long-term field experiments studying unit-level water conservation responses to both price and non-price interventions in the same group of households (n = 64 186 household-days). Conservation habits, attitude-action gaps, principal-agent incongruities, and billing cycles help account for the heterogeneity in response between households, and across time. A non-price behavior modification intervention before the introduction of marginal pricing resulted in a large and significant effect on treated households (33%). The subsequent introduction of marginal volumetric pricing also reduced water use (8%, for previously untreated households). However, this average price effect masks how a large share (21%) of households increased water use, or how a mere 12% of the households accounted for all the aggregate reduction in water use. We investigated such heterogeneous responses as a systematic conservation maximization design question beyond statistical variance in individual responses. We used daily water consumption measurements across three years alongside a household survey to delineate structural and agentic barriers to conservation behavior. Our analysis reveals how combining price and non-price behavioral interventions could hold the key to achieving conservation effects that are both large and persistent."

McLinden;Enrico Dammers;Andre Fogal,Biomass burning CO emissions: exploring insights through TROPOMI-derived emissions  and emission coefficients,"Satellite-derived CO emissions provide new insights into the understanding of global CO emission rates from wildfires. We use TROPOMI satellite data to create a global inventory database of wildfire CO emissions. These satellite-derived wildfire emissions are used for the evaluation and improvement of existing fire emission inventories and to examine how the wildfire CO emissions have changed over the past 2 decades. 
 Emissions from biomass burning are a significant source of air pollution, which can adversely impact air quality and ecosystems thousands of kilometres downwind. These emissions can be estimated by a bottom-up approach that relies on fuel consumed and standardized emission factors. Emissions are also commonly derived with a top-down approach, using satellite-observed fire radiative power (FRP) as a proxy for fuel consumption. Biomass burning emissions can also be estimated directly from satellite trace gas observations, including carbon monoxide (CO). Here, we explore the potential of satellite-derived CO emission rates from biomass burning and provide new insights into the understanding of satellite-derived fire CO emissions globally, with respect to differences in regions and vegetation type. Specifically, we use the TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) high-spatial-resolution satellite datasets to derive burning CO emissions directly for individual fires between 2019 and 2021 globally. Using synthetic data (with known emissions), we show that the direct emission estimate methodology has a 34 % uncertainty for deriving CO emissions (and a total uncertainty of 44 % including wind and CO column uncertainty). From the TROPOMI-derived CO emissions, we derive biome-specific emission coefficients (emissions relative to FRP) by combining the direct emission estimates and the satellite-observed FRP from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). These emission coefficients are used to establish annual top-down CO emission inventories from biomass burning, showing that Southern Hemisphere Africa has the highest CO biomass burning emissions (over 25 % of global total of 300–390 Mt(CO) yr−1 between 2003–2021), and almost 25 % of global CO biomass burning emissions are from broadleaved evergreen tree fires. A comprehensive comparison between direct estimates, top-down and bottom-up approaches, provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each method:   FINN2.5 has higher CO emissions, by a factor between 2 and 5, than all other inventories assessed in this study. Trends over the past 2 decades are examined for different regions around the globe, showing that global CO biomass burning emissions have, on the whole, decreased (by 5.1 to 8.7 Mt(CO) yr−1), where some regions experience increased and others decreased emissions."

Schiferl;Cong Cao;Bronte Dalton;Andrew Hallward-Driemeier;Ricardo Toledo-Crow;Róisín Commane,Multi-year observations of variable incomplete combustion in the New York megacity,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is an air pollutant and an important indicator of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in cities. Using 4 years of winter and spring observations in New York City, we found that both the magnitude and variability of CO from the metropolitan area are greater than expected. Transportation emissions cannot explain the missing and variable CO, which points to energy from buildings as a likely underappreciated source of urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Carbon monoxide (CO) is a regulated air pollutant that impacts tropospheric chemistry and is an important indicator of the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels. In this study, we used 4 years (2019–2022) of winter and spring (January–May) atmospheric CO observations to quantify and characterize city-scale CO enhancements (ΔCO) from the New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA). We observed large variability in ΔCO, roughly 60 % of which was explained by atmospheric transport from the surrounding surface areas to the measurement sites, with the remaining 40 % due to changes in emissions on sub-monthly timescales. We evaluated the CO emissions from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), which has been used to scale greenhouse gas emissions, and found the emissions are much too low in magnitude. During the COVID-19 shutdown in spring 2020, we observed a flattening of the diurnal pattern of CO emissions, consistent with reductions in daytime transportation. Our results highlight the role of meteorology in driving the variability in air pollutants and show that the transportation sector is unlikely to account for the non-shutdown observed CO emission magnitude and variability, an important distinction for determining the sources of combustion emissions in urban regions like the NYCMA."
10.5194/acp-24-10143-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了使用SABER卫星仪器观测到的高纬度中层大气温度和中间层顶的长期趋势。研究发现，高纬度中层大气和低热层区域的温度趋势存在显著的冷却趋势，尤其是在夏季至点附近，冷却趋势达到每十年6摄氏度以上。此外，研究还发现，在特定月份和纬度范围内，存在着每十年1-2.5摄氏度的升温趋势。该研究表明，高纬度中层大气和低热层区域的温度对动态变化更为敏感，这对于理解气候变化和大气环境变化具有重要意义。,"['mesosphere temperature', 'mesopause', 'SABER', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'climate change']",Xiao Liu;Jiyao Xu;Jia Yue;Yangkun Liu;Vania F. Andrioli,Trends in the high-latitude mesosphere temperature and mesopause revealed by SABER,"Disagreement in long-term trends in the high-latitude mesosphere temperature should be elucidated using one coherent measurement over a long period. Using SABER measurements at high latitudes and binning the data based on yaw cycle, we focus on long-term trends in the mean temperature and mesopause in the high-latitude mesosphere–lower-thermosphere region, which has been rarely studied via observations but is more sensitive to dynamic changes. 
 The temperature trend in the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere (MLT) region can be regarded as an indicator of climate change. Using temperature profiles measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument during 2002–2023 and binning them based on the yaw cycle, we obtain a continuous dataset with a wide local time coverage at 50° S–80° N or 80° S–50° N. The seasonal change in temperature, caused by the forward drift in the SABER yaw cycle, is removed using the climatological temperature of the Naval Research Laboratory's Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter Radar model (MSIS2.0). The corrected temperature without any waves is regarded as the mean temperature. At 50° S–50° N, the cooling trends in the mean temperature are significant in the MLT region and are in agreement with previous studies. The novel finding is that the cooling trends of ≥ l2 K per decade exhibit seasonal symmetry and reach peaks of ≥ 6 K per decade at high latitudes around the summer solstice. Moreover, there are warming trends of 1–2.5 K per decade at an altitude range of 10−2–10−3 hPa, specifically at latitudes higher than 55° N in October and December and at latitudes higher than 55° S in April and August.  Over the past 22 years, the mesopause temperature (altitude) in the northern summer polar region has been  ∼ 5–11 K (∼ 1 km) colder (lower) than that in the corresponding southern region. The trends in the mesopause temperature are dependent on latitudes and months, but they are negative at most latitudes and reach larger magnitudes at high latitudes. These results indicate that the temperature in the high-latitude MLT region is more sensitive to dynamic changes."

The underlying dynamical and chemical mechanisms are responsible for the observed ozone anomalies in both events. Our research sheds light on these processes, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of these processes for more accurate climate modeling and forecasting. 
 The impact of major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events and early final stratospheric warming (FSW) events on ozone variations in the middle atmosphere in the Arctic is investigated by performing microwave radiometer measurements above Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (79° N, 12° E), with GROMOS-C (GRound-based Ozone MOnitoring System for Campaigns). The retrieved daily ozone profiles during SSW and FSW events in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere at 20–70 km from microwave observations are cross-compared to MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder). The vertically resolved structures of polar ozone anomalies relative to the climatologies derived from GROMOS-C, MERRA-2, and MLS shed light on the consistent pattern in the evolution of ozone anomalies during both types of events. For SSW events, ozone anomalies are positive at all altitudes within 30 d after onset, followed by negative anomalies descending in the middle stratosphere. However, positive anomalies in the middle and lower stratosphere and negative anomalies in the upper stratosphere at onset are followed by negative anomalies in the middle stratosphere and positive anomalies in the upper stratosphere during FSW events. Here, we compare results by leveraging the ozone continuity equation with meteorological fields from MERRA-2 and directly using MERRA-2 ozone tendency products to quantify the impact of dynamical and chemical processes on ozone anomalies during SSW and FSW events. We document the underlying dynamical and chemical mechanisms that are responsible for the observed ozone anomalies in the entire life cycle of SSW and FSW events. Polar ozone anomalies in the lower and middle stratosphere undergo a rapid and long-lasting increase of more than 1 ppmv close to SSW onset, which is attributed to the dynamical processes of the horizontal eddy effect and vertical advection. The pattern of ozone anomalies for FSW events is associated with the combined effects of dynamical and chemical terms, which reflect the photochemical processes counteracted partially by positive horizontal eddy transport, in particular in the middle stratosphere. In addition, we find that the variability in polar total column ozone (TCO) is associated with horizontal eddy transport and vertical advection of ozone in the lower stratosphere. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that control changes in polar ozone during the life cycle of SSW and FSW events, providing a new aspect of quantitative analysis of dynamical and chemical fields."
10.5194/amt-17-5413-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了铵离子化学电离轨道阱质谱仪（NH4+-Orbitrap）在测量大气中氧合有机分子（OOMs）方面的应用。OOMs 是大气气溶胶形成的重要组成部分，而 NH4+-Orbitrap 能够识别和量化各种 OOMs，包括低氧化度和高氧化度有机分子。论文比较了 NH4+-Orbitrap 与其他先进质谱仪（如硝酸根离子化学电离大气压接口飞行时间质谱仪、质子转移反应飞行时间质谱仪和碘离子化学电离飞行时间质谱仪）的性能，发现 NH4+-Orbitrap 能够测量更广泛的 OOMs。研究结果表明，NH4+-Orbitrap 能够提供更全面的大气有机分子信息，有助于更深入地理解大气氧化过程。,"['atmospheric composition', 'organic molecules', 'mass spectrometry', 'chemical ionization', 'air quality', 'aerosols', 'oxidation processes']",Dandan Li;Dongyu Wang;Lucia Caudillo;Wiebke Scholz;Mingyi Wang;Sophie Tomaz;Guillaume Marie;Mihnea Surdu;Elias Eccli;Xianda Gong;Loic Gonzalez-Carracedo;Manuel Granzin;Joschka Pfeifer;Birte Rörup;Benjamin Schulze;Pekka Rantala;Sébastien Perrier;Armin Hansel;Joachim Curtius;Jasper Kirkby;Neil M. Donahue;Christian George;Imad El-Haddad;Matthieu Riva,Ammonium CI-Orbitrap: a tool for characterizing the reactivity of oxygenated organic molecules,"Due to the analytical challenges of measuring organic vapors, it remains challenging to identify and quantify organic molecules present in the atmosphere. Here, we explore the performance of the Orbitrap chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CI-Orbitrap) using ammonium ion chemistry. This study shows that ammonium-ion-based chemistry associated with the high mass resolution of the Orbitrap mass analyzer can measure almost all inclusive compounds. 
 Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) play an important role in the formation of atmospheric aerosols. Due to various analytical challenges with respect to measuring organic vapors, uncertainties remain regarding the formation and fate of OOMs. The chemical ionization Orbitrap (CI-Orbitrap) mass spectrometer has recently been shown to be a powerful technique that is able to accurately identify gaseous organic compounds due to its greater mass resolution. Here, we present the ammonium-ion-based CI-Orbitrap (NH4+-Orbitrap) as a technique capable of measuring a wide range of gaseous OOMs. The performance of the NH4+-Orbitrap is compared with that of state-of-the-art mass spectrometers, including a nitrate-ion-based chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (NO3--LTOF), a new generation of proton transfer reaction-TOF mass spectrometer (PTR3-TOF), and an iodide-based CI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (I−-CIMS). The instruments were deployed simultaneously in the Cosmic Leaving OUtdoors Droplets (CLOUD) chamber at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) during the CLOUD14 campaign in 2019. Products generated from α-pinene ozonolysis under various experimental conditions were simultaneously measured by the mass spectrometers. The NH4+-Orbitrap was able to identify the widest range of OOMs (i.e., O ≥ 2), from less-oxidized species to highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs). Excellent agreement was found between the NH4+-Orbitrap and the NO3--LTOF with respect to characterizing HOMs and with the PTR3-TOF for the less-oxidized monomeric species. OOM concentrations measured by NH4+-Orbitrap were estimated using calibration factors derived from the OOMs with high time-series correlations during the side-by-side measurements. As with the other mass spectrometry techniques used during this campaign, the detection sensitivity of the NH4+-Orbitrap to OOMs is greatly affected by relative humidity, which may be related to changes in ionization efficiency and/or multiphase chemistry. Overall, this study shows that NH4+-ion-based chemistry associated with the high mass resolution of the Orbitrap mass analyzer can measure almost all inclusive compounds. As a result, it is now possible to cover the entire range of compounds, which can lead to a better understanding of the oxidation processes."

P. Olsen Ice Cap transect, northeast Greenland, for May 2008 through May 2022","The Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring programme has been running since 1995. In 2008, the Glaciological monitoring sub-program GlacioBasis was initiated at the Zackenberg site in northeast Greenland, with a transect of three weather stations on the A. P. Olsen Ice Cap. In 2022, the weather stations were replaced with a more standardized set up. Here, we provide the reprocessed and quality-checked data from 2008 to 2022, i.e., the first 15 years of continued monitoring. 
 The negative surface mass balance of glaciers and ice caps under a warming climate impacts local ecosystems, influencing the volume and timing of water flow in local catchments while also contributing to global sea level rise. Peripheral glaciers distinct to the Greenland ice sheet respond faster to climate change than the main ice sheet. Accurate assessment of surface mass balance depends on in situ observations of near-surface climate and ice ablation, but very few in situ observations of near-surface climate and ice ablation are freely available for Greenland's peripheral glaciers. The transect of three automated weather and ablation stations on the peripheral A. P. Olsen Ice Cap in northeast Greenland is an example of these much needed data. The transect has been monitored since 2008, and in 2022, the old weather and ablation stations were replaced by a new standardized setup. In order to ensure comparable data quality of the old and new monitoring station setups, it is necessary to re-evaluate the data collected between 2008 and 2022. This paper presents the fully reprocessed near-surface climate and ablation data from the A. P. Olsen Ice Cap transect from 2008 to 2022, with a focus on data quality and the usability in ice ablation process studies. The usability of the data is exemplified by the data in an energy balance melt model for two different years. We show that the inherent uncertainties in the data result in an accurate reproduction of ice ablation for just one of the two years. A transect of three automatic ablation and weather stations of this length is unique to Greenland's peripheral glaciers, and it has a broad scale of usage from input to climate reanalysis and detailed surface ablation studies.

Accurate mapping of the spatial-thickness variations of these fallout pyroclastic deposits over large hillslope areas remains a knowledge gap. We attempt to bridge this gap by applying statistical techniques to a field-based thickness measurement dataset of fallout pyroclastic deposits. 
 Determining the spatial thickness (z) of in situ and reworked fallout pyroclastic deposits plays a key role in volcanological studies and in shedding light on geomorphological and hydrogeological processes in peri-volcanic areas. However, this is a challenging line of research because (1) field-based measurements are expensive and time-consuming, (2) the ash might have been dispersed in the atmosphere by several volcanic eruptions, and (3) wind characteristics during an eruptive event and soil-forming and/or denudation processes after ash deposition on the ground surface affect the expected spatial distribution of these deposits. This article tries to bridge this knowledge gap by applying statistical techniques for making representative spatial thickness predictions to be used for the analysis of geomorphic processes at the catchment and sub-catchment scales. First, we compiled a field-based thickness measurement dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8399487; Matano et al., 2023) of fallout pyroclastic deposits in the territories of several municipalities in Campania, southern Italy. Second, 18 predictor variables were derived mainly from digital elevation models and satellite images and were assigned to each measurement point. Third, the stepwise regression (STPW) model and random forest (RF) machine learning technique are used for thickness modeling. Fourth, the estimations are compared with those of three models that already exist in the literature. Finally, the statistical combination of different predictions is implemented to develop a less biased model for estimating pyroclastic thickness. The results show that the prediction accuracy of RF (RMSE <82.46 and MAE <48.36) is better than that of existing models in the literature. Moreover, statistical combination of the predictions obtained from the above-mentioned models through a least absolute deviation (LAD) combination approach leads to the most representative thickness estimation (MAE <45.12) in the study area. The maps for the values estimated by RF and LAD (as the best single model and combination approach, respectively) illustrate that the spatial patterns did not change significantly, but the estimations by LAD are smaller. This combined approach can help in estimating the thickness of fallout pyroclastic deposits in other volcanic regions and in managing geohazards in areas covered with loose pyroclastic materials."

Satellite remote sensing plays a pivotal role in detecting this phenomenon. This study uses AI-based models to extract the daily green tide from MODIS and SAR images and integrates these daily data to introduce a continuous weekly dataset, which aids research in disaster simulation, forecasting, and prevention. 
 Since 2008, the Yellow Sea has experienced the world's largest-scale marine disaster, the green tide, marked by the rapid proliferation and accumulation of large floating algae. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models, namely AlgaeNet and GANet, this study comprehensively extracted and analyzed green tide occurrences using optical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and microwave Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, due to cloud and rain interference and the varying observation frequencies of the two types of satellites, the daily green tide coverage time series throughout the entire life cycle often contain large gaps and missing frames, resulting in discontinuity and limiting their use. Therefore, this study presents a continuous and seamless weekly average green tide coverage dataset with a resolution of 500 m, by integrating highly precise daily optical and SAR data for each week during the green tide breakout. The uncertainty assessment shows that this weekly product conforms to the life pattern of green tide outbreaks and exhibits parabolic-curve-like characteristics, with a low uncertainty (R2=0.89 and RMSE=275 km2). This weekly dataset offers reliable long-term data spanning 15 years, facilitating research in forecasting, climate change analysis, numerical simulation, and disaster prevention planning in the Yellow Sea.

The accuracy of SDUST2022GRA is 4.43 mGal on a global scale, which is at least 0.22 mGal better than that of other models. The spatial resolution of SDUST2022GRA is approximately 20 km in a certain region, slightly superior to other models. These assessments suggest that SDUST2022GRA is a reliable global marine gravity anomaly model. 
 The global marine gravity anomaly model is predominantly recovered from along-track radar altimeter data. Despite significant advances in gravity anomaly recovery, the improvement of the gravity anomaly model remains constrained by the absence of cross-track geoid gradients and the reduction in radar altimeter data, especially in coastal and high-latitude regions. ICESat-2 laser altimetry, with a three-pair laser beam configuration, a small footprint, and a near-polar orbit, facilitates the determination of cross-track geoid gradients and provides valid observations in certain regions. We present an ICESat-2 altimeter data processing strategy that includes the determination of cross-track geoid gradients and the combination of along-track and cross-track geoid gradients. Utilizing these methods, we developed a new global marine gravity model, SDUST2022GRA, from radar and laser altimeter data. Different weight determination methods were applied to each type of altimeter datum. The precision and spatial resolution of SDUST2022GRA were assessed against published altimeter-derived global gravity anomaly models (DTU17, V32.1, NSOAS22) and shipborne gravity measurements. SDUST2022GRA achieved a global precision of 4.43 mGal, representing an improvement of approximately 0.22 mGal over existing altimeter-derived models. In local coastal and high-latitude regions, SDUST2022GRA showed an enhancement of 0.16–0.24 mGal compared to the other models. The spatial resolution of SDUST2022GRA is approximately 20 km in certain regions, which is slightly superior to the other models. The percentage contribution of ICESat-2 to the improvement of the gravity anomaly model is 4.3 % in low- to mid-latitude regions by comparing SDUST2022GRA with ICESat-2 to SDUST2021GRA without ICESat-2, and this is increasing in coastal regions. These assessments suggest that SDUST2022GRA is a reliable global marine gravity anomaly model. The SDUST2022GRA data are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8337387 (Li et al., 2023)."

For over 10 years, the Observatory of Atmospheric Physics in Reunion (OPAR; 21.079° S, 55.383° E) has been operating three active lidar instruments, named lidar 1200 (Li1200), stratospheric ozone lidar (LiO3S), and tropospheric ozone lidar (LiO3T), providing time series of vertical profiles from 3 to 45 km of the aerosol extinction and backscatter coefficients at 355 and 532 nm as well as the linear depolarization ratio at 532 nm. This work provides a full technical description of the three systems, the details about the methods chosen for the signal preprocessing and processing, and an uncertainty analysis. About 1737 nighttime averaged profiles were manually screened to provide cloud-free and artifact-free profiles. Data processing consisted of Klett inversion to retrieve aerosol optical products from preprocessed files. The measurement frequency was lower during the wet season and the holiday periods. There is a good correlation between the Li1200 and LiO3S instruments in terms of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 355 nm (0.001–0.107; R=0.92±0.01) and with LiO3T in terms of Ångström exponent 355/532 (0.079–1.288; R=0.90±0.13). The lowest values of the averaged uncertainty in the aerosol backscatter coefficient for the three time series are 64.4 ± 31.6 % for LiO3S, 50.3 ± 29.0 % for Li1200, and 69.1 ± 42.7 % for LiO3T. These relative uncertainties are high for the three instruments because of the very low values of extinction and backscatter coefficients for background aerosols above Maïdo observatory. Uncertainty increases due to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decrease above 25 km for LIO3S and Li1200 and above 20 km for LiO3T. The lidar ratio (LR) is responsible for an uncertainty increase below 18 km (10 km) for LiO3S and Li1200 (LiO3T). LiO3S is the most stable instrument at 355 nm due to fewer technical modifications and fewer misalignments. Li1200 is a valuable addition meant to fill in the gaps in the LiO3S time series at 355 nm or for specific case studies about the middle and low troposphere.

This database aims to analyze the tropical deep convective systems, the evolution of their associated characteristics over their life cycle, their organization, and their importance in the hydrological and energy cycle. 
 We introduce two databases, TOOCAN (Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm using a 3D segmentatioN) and CACATOES, aimed at facilitating the study of deep convective systems (DCSs) and their morphological characteristics over the intertropical belt during the period spanning from 2012 to 2020. The TOOCAN database is constructed using a tracking algorithm called TOOCAN applied on a homogenized GEOring infrared (IR) archive and enables the documentation of the morphological parameters of each DCS throughout their life cycles. The homogenized GEOring IR database has been built from level-1 data of a fleet of geostationary platforms originating from various sources and has been intercalibrated; spectrally adjusted; and limb-darkening corrected, specifically for high cold clouds, based on a common reference, the IR channel of the Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) radiometer on board the Megha-Tropiques. The resulting infrared observations are then homogeneous for brightness temperatures (BT) <240 K, with a standard deviation lower than 1.5 K, throughout the GEOring. A systematic uncertainty analysis is carried out. First, the radiometric errors are shown to have little impact on the DCS characteristics and occurrences. We further evaluate the impact of missing data and demonstrate that a maximum of 3 h of consecutive missing images represents a favorable compromise for maintaining tracking continuity while minimizing the impact on the DCS morphological parameters. However, beyond this temporal threshold, the segmentation of DCS is significantly compromised, necessitating the interruption of the tracking process. The CACATOES database is derived from the TOOCAN database through a post-processing procedure, which involves projecting the morphological parameters of each deep convective system (DCS) onto a daily 1° × 1° grid. The resultant dataset provides a broader perspective, allowing for an Eulerian analysis of the DCS and facilitating comparisons with auxiliary gridded datasets on the same daily 1° × 1° grid box.Both the TOOCAN and CACATOES databases are provided in a common netCDF format that is compliant with the standards of Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions and the Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD).A total of 15×106 DCSs have been identified over the tropical regions and the 9-year period. The analysis of DCSs over the tropical oceans and continents reveals a large variety of DCS characteristics and organizations. They can last from few hours up to several days, and their cloud shield ranges from 1000 km2 to a few millions of squared kilometers. Oceanic DCSs are characterized by a longer lifetime duration and larger shields. Finally, the DCS geographical distribution is in line with previous DCS climatologies built from other algorithms and satellite observations.All datasets can be accessed via the repository under the following data DOIs:

The results show that the larger the model scale, the more acceleration effect on the GPU-like accelerator, up to 28.9 times. The multi-level parallelism achieves a speedup of 32.7 times on the heterogeneous cluster. By comparing the results, the GPU-like accelerators have more accuracy for the geoscience numerical models. 
 Graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming a compelling acceleration strategy for geoscience numerical models due to their powerful computing performance. In this study, AMD's heterogeneous-compute interface for portability (HIP) was implemented to port the GPU acceleration version of the   piecewise parabolic method (PPM) solver (GPU-HADVPPM) from NVIDIA GPUs to China's domestic GPU-like accelerators like GPU-HADVPPM4HIP. Further, it introduced the multi-level hybrid parallelism scheme to improve the total computational performance of the HIP version of the CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions; CAMx-HIP) model on China's domestic heterogeneous cluster. The experimental results show that the acceleration effect of GPU-HADVPPM on the different GPU accelerators is more apparent when the computing scale is more extensive, and the maximum speedup of GPU-HADVPPM on the domestic GPU-like accelerator is 28.9×faster. The hybrid parallelism with a message passing interface (MPI) and HIP enables achieving up to   a 17.2× speedup when configuring 32 CPU cores and GPU-like accelerators on the domestic heterogeneous cluster. The OpenMP technology is introduced further to reduce the computation time of the CAMx-HIP model by 1.9×. More importantly, by comparing the simulation results of GPU-HADVPPM on NVIDIA GPUs and domestic GPU-like accelerators, it is found that the simulation results of GPU-HADVPPM on domestic GPU-like accelerators have less difference than the NVIDIA GPUs. Furthermore, we also show that the data transfer efficiency between CPU and GPU has a meaningful essential impact on heterogeneous computing and point out that optimizing the data transfer efficiency between CPU and GPU is one of the critical directions to improve the computing efficiency of geoscience numerical models in heterogeneous clusters in the future."

The system is based on a regional sea ice‒ocean‒ice shelf coupled model and can assimilate sea ice concentration observations. By assessing the system's performance in sea ice forecasts, we find that the system can provide reliable Antarctic sea ice forecasts for the next 7 d and has the potential to guide ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice zone. 
 An operational synoptic-scale sea ice forecasting system for the Southern Ocean, namely the Southern Ocean Ice Prediction System (SOIPS), has been developed to support ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice zone. Practical application of the SOIPS forecasts had been implemented for the 38th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition for the first time. The SOIPS is configured on an Antarctic regional sea ice–ocean–ice shelf coupled model and an ensemble-based localized error subspace transform Kalman filter data assimilation model. Daily near-real-time satellite sea ice concentration observations are assimilated into the SOIPS to update sea ice concentration and thickness in the 12 ensemble members of the model state. By evaluating the SOIPS performance in forecasting sea ice metrics in a complete melt–freeze cycle from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, this study shows that the SOIPS can provide reliable Antarctic sea ice forecasts. In comparison with non-assimilated EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) data, annual mean root mean square errors in the sea ice concentration forecasts at a lead time of up to 168 h are lower than 0.19, and the integrated ice edge errors in the sea ice forecasts in most freezing months at lead times of 24 and 72 h maintain around 0.5×106 km2 and below 1.0×106 km2, respectively. With respect to the scarce Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) observations, the mean absolute errors in the sea ice thickness forecasts at a lead time of 24 h are lower than 0.3 m, which is in the range of the ICESat-2 uncertainties. Specifically, the SOIPS has the ability to forecast sea ice drift, in both magnitude and direction. The derived sea ice convergence rate forecasts have great potential for supporting ship navigation on a fine local scale. The comparison between the persistence forecasts and the SOIPS forecasts with and without data assimilation further shows that both model physics and the data assimilation scheme play important roles in producing reliable sea ice forecasts in the Southern Ocean."

To facilitate Lagrangian analysis, we introduce online tracking of sea ice in Community Ice CodE (CICE). We validate the sea ice tracking with buoys and evaluate the sea ice deformation in high-resolution simulations, which show multi-fractal characteristics. The source code is openly available and can be used in various scientific and operational applications. 
 Sea ice models are essential tools for simulating the thermodynamic and dynamic processes of sea ice and the coupling with the polar atmosphere and ocean. Popular models such as the Community Ice CodE (CICE) are usually based on non-moving, locally orthogonal Eulerian grids. However, the various in situ observations, such as those from ice-tethered buoys and drift stations, are subjected to sea ice drift and are, hence, by nature Lagrangian. Furthermore, the statistical analysis of sea ice kinematics requires the Lagrangian perspective. As a result, the offline sea ice tracking with model output is usually carried out for many scientific and validational practices. Certain limitations exist, such as the need for high-frequency model outputs, as well as unaccountable tracking errors. In order to facilitate Lagrangian diagnostics in current sea ice models, we design and implement an online Lagrangian tracking module in CICE under the coupled model system of CESM (Community Earth System Model). In this work, we introduce its design and implementation in detail, as well as the numerical experiments for the validation and the analysis of sea ice deformation. In particular, the sea ice model is forced with historical atmospheric reanalysis data, and the Lagrangian tracking results are compared with the observed buoys' tracks for the years from 1979 to 2001. Moreover, high-resolution simulations are carried out with the Lagrangian tracking to study the multi-scale sea ice deformation modeled by CICE. Through scaling analysis, we show that CICE simulates multi-fractal sea ice deformation fields in both the spatial and the temporal domain, as well as the spatial–temporal coupling characteristics. The analysis with model output on the Eulerian grid shows systematic difference with the Lagrangian-tracking-based results, highlighting the importance of the Lagrangian perspective for scaling analysis. Related topics, including the sub-daily sea ice kinematics and the potential application of the Lagrangian tracking module, are also discussed."

However, TWP contributions to urban fine particles are poorly understood. Here, 72 paired gas-phase and PM2.5 samples were collected in the urban air of the Pearl River Delta, China. The concentrations of 54 compounds were determined, and 28 TWCs were detected with total concentrations of 3130–317,000 pg/m3. Most p-phenylenediamines (PPDs) were unstable in solvent, likely leading to their low detection rates. The TWCs were mainly (73 ± 26%) in the gas phase. 2-OH-benzothiazole contributed 82 ± 21% of the gas-phase TWCs and benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid contributed 74 ± 18% of the TWCs in PM2.5. Guangzhou and Foshan were “hotspots” for atmospheric TWCs. Most TWC concentrations significantly correlated with the road length nearby. More particulate TWCs were observed than model predictions, probably due to the impacts of nonexchangeable portion and sampling artifacts. Source apportionment combined with characteristic molecular markers indicated that TWPs contributed 13 ± 7% of urban PM2.5. Our study demonstrates that TWPs are important contributors to urban air pollution that could pose risks to humans. There is an urgent need to develop strategies to decrease TWP emissions, along with broader urban air quality improvement strategies."

In this study, three QACs (dimethyl dodecyl ammonium, C10-DDAC; benzyldimethyl dodecylammonium, C12-BAC; cetyltrimethylammonium, C16-ATMAC) commonly detected in indoor microenvironments were incubated with human liver microsomes and cytosol (HLM/HLC) simulating Phase I and II metabolism. Thirty-one Phase I metabolites were annotated originating from 19 biotransformation reactions. Four metabolites of C10-DDAC were described for the first time. A detailed assessment of experimental fragmentation spectra allowed to characterize potential oxidation sites. For each annotated metabolite, drift-tube ion-mobility derived collision cross section (DTCCSN2) values were reported, serving as an additional identification parameter and allowing the characterization of changes in DTCCSN2 values following metabolism. Lastly, eight metabolites, including four metabolites of both C12-BAC and C10-DDAC, were confirmed in human urine samples showing high oxidation states through introduction of up to four oxygen atoms. This is the first report of higher oxidized C10-DDAC metabolites in human urine facilitating future biomonitoring studies on QACs."

Here, using magnetospheric multiscale mission, we find a strong dawn‐dusk current with a magnitude of 80 nA/m2 at the magnetotail PSBL. The strong current appears during crossing the PSBL and is primarily contributed by the perpendicular electron currents. Cooperating with an intense fluctuating electric field (reaching ∼40 mV/m) carried by the lower‐hybrid drift waves, this dawn‐dusk current leads to a strong energy conversion with a magnitude larger than 3 nW/m3.

However, the weather stations are unevenly distributed, and are still very sparse in remote regions. The possible sampling error is well known, but not well quantified because we are lack of the adequate and regularly distributed measurements. The high resolution of satellite land surface temperature retrieval during night time provide a nice proxy for near surface temperature as both temperatures controlled by surface longwave radiative cooling and the nocturnal temperature inversion depress land‐atmosphere turbulent exchange. The sampling error of mean value and trend were assessed by comparing station point measurements (pixel of ∼0.01°) with grid (1°) mean and national mean from 2001 to 2021. This method permits us to make the first assessment of under‐sampling error and spatial representative error on both national mean and trend of air temperature during nighttime collected at ∼2,400 weather stations over China. The sampling error in national mean temperature is more than 3°C. The under‐sampling error due to lack of observation explains two thirds and the spatial representative error due to the difference between station and grid/regional mean elevation contribute the other one third. The sampling error in trend account for one third of the national mean trend. The urban heat island effect associated with urbanization around the weather stations (spatial representative error) can explain four fifths of the sampling error in trend, which is consistent with existing studies based on air temperature collected at paired weather station."

 Cell-cell junctions, and specifically desmosomes, are crucial for robust intercellular adhesion. Desmosomal function is compromised in the autoimmune blistering skin disease pemphigus vulgaris. We combine whole-genome knockout screening and a promotor screen of the desmosomal gene desmoglein 3 in human keratinocytes to identify novel regulators of intercellular adhesion. Kruppel-like-factor 5 (KLF5) directly binds to the desmoglein 3 regulatory region and promotes adhesion. Reduced levels of KLF5 in patient tissue indicate a role in pemphigus vulgaris. Autoantibody fractions from patients impair intercellular adhesion and reduce KLF5 levels in in vitro and in vivo disease models. These effects were dependent on increased activity of histone deacetylase 3, leading to transcriptional repression of KLF5. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 increases KLF5 levels and protects against the deleterious effects of autoantibodies in murine and human pemphigus vulgaris models. Together, KLF5 and histone deacetylase 3 are regulators of desmoglein 3 gene expression and intercellular adhesion and represent potential therapeutic targets in pemphigus vulgaris.

 Metabolic imbalance leading to inflammatory hypoxia and stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases. We hypothesize that HIF could be stabilized in CD4+ T cells during intestinal inflammation and alter the functional responses of T cells via regulation of microRNAs. Our assays reveal markedly increased T cell-intrinsic hypoxia and stabilization of HIF protein during experimental colitis. microRNA screen in primary CD4+ T cells points us towards miR-29a and our subsequent studies identify a selective role for HIF-2α in CD4-cell-intrinsic induction of miR-29a during hypoxia. Mice with T cell-intrinsic HIF-2α deletion display elevated T-bet (target of miR-29a) levels and exacerbated intestinal inflammation. Mice with miR-29a deficiency in T cells show enhanced intestinal inflammation. T cell-intrinsic overexpression of HIF-2α or delivery of miR-29a mimetic dampen TH1-driven colitis. In this work, we show a previously unrecognized function for hypoxia-dependent induction of miR-29a in attenuating TH1-mediated inflammation.

Here authors demonstrate BRN1/2 act in concert with NOTCH and primary microcephaly genes to regulate evolutionarily conserved neocortical progenitor behavior across species and determine brain size. 
 The neocortex varies in size and complexity among mammals due to the tremendous variability in the number and diversity of neuronal subtypes across species. The increased cellular diversity is paralleled by the expansion of the pool of neocortical progenitors and the emergence of indirect neurogenesis during brain evolution. The molecular pathways that control these biological processes and are disrupted in neurological disorders remain largely unknown. Here we show that the transcription factors BRN1 and BRN2 have an evolutionary conserved function in neocortical progenitors to control their proliferative capacity and the switch from direct to indirect neurogenesis. Functional studies in mice and ferrets show that BRN1/2 act in concert with NOTCH and primary microcephaly genes to regulate progenitor behavior. Analysis of transcriptomics data from genetically modified macaques provides evidence that these molecular pathways are conserved in non-human primates. Our findings thus demonstrate that BRN1/2 are central regulators of gene expression programs in neocortical progenitors critical to determine brain size during evolution.

Here, a Ni2+-dependent enzyme that hydrolysed metformin to guanylurea and its evolutionary predecessor are presented. 
 The anti-diabetic drug metformin is one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world. Together with its degradation product guanylurea, it is a major pharmaceutical pollutant in wastewater treatment plants and surface waters. An operon comprising two genes of the ureohydrolase family in Pseudomonas and Aminobacter species has recently been implicated in metformin degradation. However, the corresponding proteins have not been characterized. Here we show that these genes encode a Ni2+-dependent enzyme that efficiently and specifically hydrolyzes metformin to guanylurea and dimethylamine. The active enzyme is a heteromeric complex of α- and β- subunits in which only the α-subunits contain the conserved His and Asp residues for the coordination of two Ni2+ ions in the active site. A crystal structure of metformin hydrolase reveals an α2β4 stoichiometry of the hexameric complex, which is unprecedented in the ureohydrolase family. By studying a closely related but more widely distributed enzyme, we find that the putative predecessor specifically hydrolyzes dimethylguanidine instead of metformin. Our findings establish the molecular basis for metformin hydrolysis to guanylurea as the primary pathway for metformin biodegradation and provide insight into the recent evolution of ureohydrolase family proteins in response to an anthropogenic compound.

 The increasing risk of irreversible ecological transformation under global warming has boosted the need to understand the capacity of organisms to adapt to this change. Here, using a resurvey method of populations of the European fly Drosophila subobscura, we show that a known evolutionary response to global warming has accelerated in the past 20 years, in step with regional warming. This genetic response has come entirely by resorting pre-existing variation—and not from novel inversions—for tolerance to high temperature. Temperate populations are predicted to converge to the typical Mediterranean chromosomal composition by the mid-2050s, at which point this classic example of steep genetic cline will have vanished. Our results suggest that species with broad geographic ranges, large population sizes and high genetic diversity may have the evolutionary potential to cope with climate change.

 Temperature and precipitation variability and extremes impact production globally. These production disruptions will change with future warming, impacting consumers locally as well as remotely through supply chains. Due to a potentially nonlinear economic response, trade impacts are difficult to quantify; empirical assessments rather focus on the direct inequality impacts of weather extremes. Here, simulating global economic interactions of profit-maximizing firms and utility-optimizing consumers, we assess risks to consumption resulting from weather-induced production disruptions along supply chains. Across countries, risks are highest for middle-income countries due to unfavourable trade dependence and seasonal climate exposure. We also find that risks increase in most countries under future climate change. Global warming increases consumer risks locally and through supply chains. However, high-income consumers face the greatest risk increase. Overall, risks are heterogeneous regarding income within and between countries, such that targeted local and global resilience building may reduce them.

 Anthropogenic perturbations profoundly affect aquatic ecosystem microbiomes and associated ecological functions. Comparatively, the effects of geological stresses on microbiome composition and stability remain poorly explored. Here, we monitored the archaeal, bacterial and microeukaryotes community structure over an 8-years period in Lake Dziani Dzaha (Comoros archipelago), that experienced a major earthquake swarm mid-survey, providing a rare opportunity to investigate the aftermaths of seismo-volcanic events on microbiome.

 Environmental factors shape subsurface microbial ecosystems, and well-characterized sites are ideal for determining how environmental parameters shape sediment communities. Sediments from eight geologically and thermally distinct sites were drilled during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 385 in Guaymas Basin, an expedition focused on the hydrothermal deep biosphere. Using high-throughput 16S ribosomal nucleic acid sequencing, cell counts, phylogenetics, metatranscriptomics, and mineralogical/elemental X-ray spectroscopy, we examine linkages and feedbacks between mineral composition, temperature, geochemistry, and microbial populations. We show subsurface life is dominated by heterotrophic, cosmopolitan prokaryotes that thrive within a range of sediments and temperature conditions across Guaymas Basin. Hydrothermally-affiliated lineages are detected in low numbers at sites with steepest temperature gradients, within communities of mesophilic taxa that occur throughout Guaymas Basin and in other marine subsurface habitats. Thus, hydrothermal lineages do not replace the cosmopolitan, mesophilic subsurface community, but remain specific to sites where volcanic intrusions drive hydrothermal circulation. “Subsurface bacteria and archaea in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, thrive within a wide range of sediments and temperature conditions, according to geobiological, geochemical, and mineralogical studies on microbial populations and sediment samples.”"

 Understanding and managing unrest at a volcano include i) ascertaining the magmatic distribution and migration, and ii) tracking the evolution of the shallow plumbing system. Here we use multi-technique geodetic data, mechanical models, and petrological simulations to define both aspects for the ongoing (2005-present) unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy. Results show a deformation source exhibiting progressive widening and shallowing, from 5.9 to 3.9 kilometres. Concurrently, a deeper tabular source at 8 km depth experiences limited but constant deflation. Petrological calculations explain inflation of the shallower source resulting from the rise of 0.06 to 0.22 cubic kilometres of magma from depth ≥8 kilometres. Our analysis provides strong evidence that magma ascent to depths shallower than 8 kilometres is the ultimate driver behind the ongoing unrest. This merging of geodetic and petrological approaches to track the evolution of a plumbing system better constrains magma ascent at volcanoes experiencing unrest.

 The determination of river velocity is important for hydromorphological analyses and river monitoring systems. Indirect measurements of river velocity using videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) allow fast and cost-effective processing of information about the river stretch. This paper presents a method for computing flow velocity of the river surface using deep supervised model RAFT to determine the optical flow in combination with image pre-processing by convolutional operations. Moreover, the windiness coefficients and variance score were proposed to evaluate reliability of the collected data and the obtained results of optical flow detection. Various image pre-processing techniques were applied, namely the selection of the analysed area and the number of convolutional operations to select the one with the lowest variance score. This score represents the consistency of the river flow velocity during the video and can be used to filter out unreliable results. The numerical experiments were performed using the videos and directly measured velocity values of 4 shallow rivers in Lithuania collected during the field surveys. The optical velocity estimation method showed good correspondence to the directly measured values for the velocity range from 0 m/s to 0.8 m/s in the points with low variance score up to 0.192 that represents the first quartile of the variance. The optical flow method tends to underestimate the velocity up to 0.5 m/s for the quartiles with the higher variance scores. It was shown that in most cases the lowest variance score value was obtained using pre-processing techniques without convolutional operations. However, the need to analyse various pre-processing techniques arises from the different origin of the objects moving on the river surface."

 The launch of GEDI opens a new era of forest structure monitoring using full-waveform LiDAR from space. Simulation of GEDI waveform is of great importance for the algorithm design and forest structure metric estimation. DART is a universal 3D radiative transfer model for simulating remote sensing signals by modeling light propagation in 3D landscape, with DART-RC adopting forward ray tracing and DART-Lux adopting bidirectional path tracing to model multi-mode multi-platform LiDAR signals. GEDI simulator is a semi-empirical model for simulating GEDI waveform with point clouds. In view of their different solutions, this study aims to evaluate and inter-compare the accuracy of DART-RC, DART-Lux, and GEDI simulator for simulating GEDI waveforms in forests. Because there are possible geolocation errors and 3D modeling uncertainty in real forests, we propose to adopt virtual forests (turbid medium, RAMI scenes) for consistency evaluation and real forests for accuracy evaluation. Metrics including R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSD (root mean square deviation), RMSE (root mean square error), and bias were calculated from the normalized waveform intensities from different simulation methods.According to the results, it is demonstrated that DART-RC/Lux, when only considering first order scattering, can simulate waveforms that are highly consistent compared to GEDI simulator in virtual forests. In real forests, DART-RC/Lux which considers first order and multiple scattering can simulate more accurate waveforms than GEDI simulator in sparse canopies (ePAI < 1.2). The median R2 were 0.935, 0.928, 0.898 and the median RMSE were 0.035, 0.037, 0.044, for DART-RC, DART-Lux and GEDI simulator respectively. However, GEDI simulator slightly outperforms DART-RC/Lux in dense canopies (ePAI > 1.2). The challenge in accurate forest 3D modeling is the most likely reason causing decreasing accuracy of DART-RC/Lux in dense forests. We recommend the use of GEDI simulator when airborne point cloud is available, while the use of DART-RC and DART-Lux for mechanism studies or theoretical analysis.

 Spatially continuous fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mapping with hourly updated is essential for monitoring environmental pollution and promoting public health. The intensive observation of geostationary satellite enables accurate estimation of PM2.5 at a fine-scale. However, current estimation models are still limited by their weak transferability and hard to provide a robust hourly PM2.5 estimation. In this research, we aim to estimate the daytime PM2.5 concentrations at fine spatial and temporal resolution (1 km and hourly) in mainland China using an improved deep learning algorithm and the AOD products from geostationary satellite Himwari-8. An Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Multiscale Neural Network (ASTMNN) which contains three sub-networks and an adaptive weight was proposed to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hourly PM2.5. The three subnetworks of ASTMNN are spatial adjacency module (SaM), temporal adjacency module (TaM) and global module (GM), which used to incorporate the information from spatial neighborhood, temporal neighborhood, and global spatiotemporal range, respectively. And the weight function combines the outputs from the three subnetworks, where the weights were adaptively trained from the model optimization. The proposed model outperformed most current hourly PM2.5 estimation models with the sample-based, time-based, and site-based cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, respectively. Besides, we used our PM2.5 product to track extreme dust events. Our findings provide valuable implications for tracking continuous variation in particulate pollution using geostationary satellites."

 Accurately estimating fractional cover of vegetated ecosystems over large areas is essential for many scientific studies, including climate change, land cover and land use, etc. Taking both accuracy and large spatial coverage into account, different methods have been proposed, such as upscaling from high to low spatial resolution remote sensing images, and harmonized data from varied sources. In this work, a new method, called centroid-based endmember optimization (CEO), is proposed to assist endmember selection for fractional cover estimation using the triangular space method. The basic idea is to retrieve endmembers from a triangular space built on a fine spatial resolution image, then correct and apply them to a coarse spatial resolution image. The method is discussed and tested using Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI images to estimate non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), photosynthetic vegetation (PV), and bare soil (BS) fractional cover. With CEO, the fractional cover of an OLCI image can be estimated more accurately, reducing the work of mosaicking MSI images to acquire fractional cover of the same large area. The premises that CEO can be applied effectively are: (1) the acquisition dates of the MSI and OLCI images are close, ensuring a similar land cover; and (2) the spatial overlap between the MSI and OLCI images covers enough NPV, PV, and BS endmembers. When taken the average fractional cover retrieved from an MSI image as truth value, the CEO method reduced the estimation difference to 0.7%, compared to the differences of 8.1% and 6.6% retrieved using uncorrected or incompletely corrected triangular space method of an OLCI image, respectively. In addition to the average fractional cover estimation, the histogram of fractional cover distribution also improved obviously. When applying CEO to a full OLCI image, two full MSI images covering different locations were used for fractional cover validation, which supported a robust estimation result."

Here, we report Landau-phonon polaritons (LPPs) in magnetized charge-neutral graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). These quasiparticles emerge from the interaction of Dirac magnetoexciton modes in graphene with the hyperbolic phonon polariton modes in hBN. Using infrared magneto-nanoscopy, we reveal the ability to completely halt the LPP propagation in real space at quantized magnetic fields, defying the conventional optical selection rules. The LPP-based nanoscopy also tells apart two fundamental many-body phenomena: the Fermi velocity renormalization and field-dependent magnetoexciton binding energies. Our results highlight the potential of magnetically tuned Dirac heterostructures for precise nanoscale control and sensing of light-matter interaction."

In particular, several studies argue that these cross-basin influences may be mere statistical artifacts resulting from the high auto-correlation of ENSO. To clarify this issue, we conduct a series of perfect model hindcast experiments to untangle the individual and synergistic effects of the tropical Indian and Atlantic oceans. Our results clearly demonstrate that without these cross-basin effects, the Pacific warming would rarely reach super El Niño level. Specifically, the individual effect of the Indian Ocean efficiently enhances the development of super El Niño events. In contrast, the Atlantic’s effect is initially limited because it fails to establish the Bjerknes feedback in the Pacific. However, when coupled with the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic’s effect becomes more pronounced as it is amplified by the Bjerknes feedback established by the Indian Ocean."

Here, we present two-dimensional assemblies of acene chromophores achieved using a tripodal triptycene supramolecular scaffold, which have been shown to exhibit a strong ability to assemble molecular and polymer motifs two-dimensionally. We designed pentacene and anthracene derivatives sandwiched by two triptycene units. These compounds assemble into expected two-dimensional structures, with the pentacene chromophores having both sufficient overlap to cause singlet fission and space for conformational change to facilitate the dissociation of a triplet pair into free triplets, which is not the case for the anthracene analog. Detailed spectroscopic analysis revealed that the pentacene chromophore in the assembly undergoes singlet fission with a quantum yield of 88 ± 5%, giving rise to triplet pairs, from which free triplets are efficiently generated (ΦT= 130 ± 8.8%). This demonstrates the utility of the triptycene-based scaffold to design functional π-electronic molecular assemblies."

However, the knowledge of INP sources, concentrations, and their impact on CRE over the Tibetan Plateau (TP)—a highly climate-sensitive region—remains largely hypothetical. Here, we integrated data from multisource satellite observations and snowpack samples collected from five glaciers to demonstrate that dust particles constitute primary INP sources over the TP. The springtime dust influxes lead to seasonally elevated ice concentrations in mixed-phase clouds. Furthermore, the decadal reduction in dustiness from 2007 to 2019 results in decreased springtime dust INPs, thereby amplifying the cooling effect of clouds over the TP, with a 1.98 ± 0.39–watt per square meter reduction in surface net CRE corresponding to a 0.01 decrease in dust optical depth.

Still, the mechanisms governing the targeting of selected regions of the genome to nucleolus-associated domains (NADs) remain enigmatic. Here, we reveal the essential role of ZNF274, a SCAN-bearing member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)–containing zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, in sequestering lineage-specific gene clusters within NADs. Ablation of ZNF274 triggers transcriptional activation across entire genomic neighborhoods—encompassing, among others, protocadherin and KZFP-encoding genes—with loss of repressive chromatin marks, altered the 3D genome architecture and de novo CTCF binding. Mechanistically, ZNF274 anchors target DNA sequences at the nucleolus and facilitates their compartmentalization via a previously uncharted function of the SCAN domain. Our findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying NAD organization and suggest that perinucleolar entrapment into repressive hubs constrains the activation of tandemly arrayed genes to enable selective expression and modulate cell differentiation programs during development."

MNK1 is known to influence cancer stem cells (CSCs); self-renewing populations that support metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapeutic resistance, making them a clinically relevant target. The precise function of MNK1 in regulating CSCs, however, remains unexplored. Here, we generated MNK1 knockout cancer cell lines, resulting in diminished CSC properties in vitro and slowed tumor growth in vivo. Using a multiomics approach, we functionally demonstrated that loss of MNK1 restricts tumor cell metabolic adaptation by reducing glycolysis and increasing dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, MNK1-null breast and pancreatic tumor cells demonstrated suppressed metastasis to the liver, but not the lung. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from breast cancer patients validated the positive correlation between MNK1 and glycolytic enzyme protein expression.

This study presents the in vivo images of positronium lifetime in a human, for a patient with a glioblastoma brain tumor, by using the dedicated Jagiellonian PET system enabling simultaneous detection of annihilation photons and prompt gamma emitted by a radionuclide. The prompt gamma provides information on the time of positronium formation. The photons from positronium annihilation are used to reconstruct the place and time of its decay.

Over the past two decades, the SCS has experienced increasing CANTlevels, with notable interannual fluctuations driven by El Niño and La Niña events influencing Kuroshio intrusion, generating anomalously high and low CANTinventories, respectively.

To produce such motifs, plants specify boundaries dividing petals into subdomains where cells develop distinctive pigmentations, shapes, and textures. While some transcription factors and biosynthetic pathways behind these characteristics are well studied, the upstream processes restricting their activities to specific petal regions remain enigmatic. Here, we unveil that the petal surface ofHibiscus trionum, an emerging model featuring a bullseye on its corolla, is prepatterned as the bullseye boundary position is specified long before it becomes visible. Using a computational model, we explore how pattern proportions are maintained while petals experience a 100-fold size increase. Exploiting transgenic lines and natural variants, we show that plants can regulate boundary position during the prepatterning phase or modulate growth on either side of this boundary later in development to vary bullseye proportions. Such modifications are functionally relevant, as buff-tailed bumblebees can reliably identify food sources based on bullseye size and prefer certain pattern proportions."

Roughly half of the heat that Earth loses through its surface today comes from the three long-lived, heat-producing elements (potassium, thorium, and uranium). These three elements have long been believed to be highly lithophile and thus concentrate in the mantle of rocky planets. However, our study shows that they all become siderophile under the pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the core formation of large rocky planets dubbed super-Earths. Mantle convection in super-Earths is then primarily driven by heating from the core rather than by a mix of internal heating and cooling from above as in Earth. Partitioning these sources of radiogenic heat into the core remarkably increases the core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature and the total heat flow across the CMB in super-Earths. Consequently, super-Earths are likely to host long-lived volcanism and strong magnetic dynamos."
10.1126/sciadv.ado1969,False,Science Advances,这篇论文研究了不可压缩 Navier-Stokes 方程描述的湍流中涡旋线的拓扑结构和动力学。它发现涡旋线的自拉伸会导致涡旋线的扭曲，而这种扭曲会自发地产生一种反扭曲机制，防止涡旋线无限增长。论文的研究重点在于流体动力学中的涡旋线行为，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Dhawal Buaria;John M. Lawson;Michael Wilczek,Twisting vortex lines regularize Navier-Stokes turbulence,"Fluid flows are intrinsically characterized via the topology and dynamics of underlying vortex lines. Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity."

Michael Ostap,Myosin-I synergizes with Arp2/3 complex to enhance the pushing forces of branched actin networks,"Class I myosins (myosin-Is) colocalize with Arp2/3 complex–nucleated actin networks at sites of membrane protrusion and invagination, but the mechanisms by which myosin-I motor activity coordinates with branched actin assembly to generate force are unknown. We mimicked the interplay of these proteins using the “comet tail” bead motility assay, where branched actin networks are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex on the surface of beads coated with myosin-I and nucleation-promoting factor. We observed that myosin-I increased bead movement efficiency by thinning actin networks without affecting growth rates. Myosin-I triggered symmetry breaking and comet tail formation in dense networks resistant to spontaneous fracturing. Even with arrested actin assembly, myosin-I alone could break the network. Computational modeling recapitulated these observations, suggesting myosin-I acts as a repulsive force shaping the network’s architecture and boosting its force-generating capacity. We propose that myosin-I leverages its power stroke to amplify the forces generated by Arp2/3 complex–nucleated actin networks."

In amorphous materials, these defects are broadly described by the tunneling two-level systems (TLSs) model. TLS have recently taken on further relevance in quantum computing because they dominate the coherence limit of superconducting quantum circuits. Efforts to mitigate TLS impacts have thus far focused on circuit design, material selection, and surface treatments. Our work takes an approach that directly modifies TLS properties. This is achieved by creating an acoustic bandgap that suppresses all microwave-frequency phonons around the operating frequency of a transmon qubit. For embedded TLS strongly coupled to the transmon qubit, we measure a pronounced increase in relaxation time by two orders of magnitude, with the longestT1time exceeding 5 milliseconds. Our work opens avenues for studying the physics of highly coherent TLS and methods for mitigating noise within solid-state quantum devices."

Yet due to measurement problems and cross-country differences, recent research has been inconclusive regarding the prevalence of ideological self-selection into like-minded online news. We introduce a multi-method design combining the web-browsing histories and survey responses of more than 7000 participants from six major democracies with supervised text classification to separate political from nonpolitical news exposure. We find that political online news exposure is both substantially less prevalent and subject to stronger ideological self-selection than nonpolitical online news exposure, especially in the United States. By highlighting the peculiar role of political news content, the results improve the understanding of online news exposure and the role of digital media in democracy."

The release of lipid polysaccharides after antibiotic treatment and subsequent progress of proinflammatory cascade highlights the necessity to apply effective inflammation management simultaneously. This work describes modular self-assembling peptides for rapid anti-inflammatory programming (SPRAY) to form nanoparticles targeting macrophage specifically, having anti-inflammation and bactericidal functions synchronously. SPRAY nanoparticles accelerate the self-delivery process in macrophages via lysosomal membrane permeabilization, maintaining anti-inflammatory programming in macrophages with efficacy close to T helper 2 cytokines. By pulmonary deposition, SPRAY nanoparticles effectively suppress inflammatory infiltration and promote alveoli regeneration in murine aseptic acute lung injury. Moreover, SPRAY nanoparticles efficiently eradicate multidrug-resistant GNB in alveoli by disrupting bacterial membrane. The universal molecular design of SPRAY nanoparticles provides a robust and clinically unseen local strategy in reverse acute inflammation featured by a high accumulation of proinflammatory cellularity and drug-resistant bacteria."

InCaenorhabditisnematodes, androdioecy, a sexual polymorphism composed of males and hermaphrodites having the ability to self-fertilize, has evolved independently multiple times. While the modification of noncoding regulatory elements likely contributed to the evolution of hermaphroditism, little is known about these changes. Here, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) focusing on the evolution of hermaphroditism inCaenorhabditisnematodes. We found that, in androdioecious nematodes, mutations rapidly accumulated in CNEs’ neighboring genes associated with sexual traits. Expression analysis indicate that the identified CNEs are involved in spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites and associated with the transition of gene expression from dioecious to androdioecious nematodes. Last, genome editing of a CNE neighboringlaf-1resulted in a change in its expression in the gonadal region undergoing spermatogenesis. Our bioinformatic and experimental analyses highlight the importance of CNEs in gene regulation associated with the development of hermaphrodites."

Using a life course Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, we investigated the causal effects of childhood and adulthood BMI on adult psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia, using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and FinnGen study. Childhood BMI was significantly associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, while adulthood BMI was associated with a decreased risk of OCD and schizophrenia. Multivariable MR analyses indicated a direct causal effect of childhood BMI on schizophrenia, independent of adulthood BMI and lifestyle factors. No evidence of causal associations was found between childhood BMI and other psychiatric outcomes. The sensitivity analyses yielded broadly consistent findings. These findings highlight the critical importance of early-life interventions to mitigate the long-term consequences of childhood adiposity."
