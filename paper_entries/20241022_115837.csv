10.5194/acp-24-11727-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文利用ACE-FTS、OMPS LP和MLS等多种卫星仪器观测数据，研究了2023年加拿大异常严重的野火季对大气垂直方向的影响。结果表明，尽管过火面积创历史新高，但进入平流层的烟雾量却很少。这说明2023年野火季很少出现有利于深对流的天气条件，即使过火面积巨大，也不一定意味着会对平流层造成扰动。研究发现，烟雾主要到达对流层上层，只有少量烟雾突破了对流层顶。仅有少数ACE-FTS观测到平流层最低层存在生物质燃烧产物含量升高的情况。OMPS LP气溶胶测量结果也表明，即使有烟雾越过对流层顶，其持续时间和高度也不足以显著扰动平流层成分。虽然这项工作主要关注加拿大野火，但也分析了其他地区（如西伯利亚）的pyroCbs。研究结果表明，尽管大型野火会产生许多pyroCbs，但能够穿透对流层顶的pyroCbs极其罕见，这意味着即使过火面积巨大，也不一定对平流层产生影响。,"['stratospheric aerosols', 'tropospheric aerosols', 'biomass burning', 'wildfire smoke', 'satellite remote sensing', 'ACE-FTS', 'OMPS LP', 'MLS', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'vertical profile', 'pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb)']",Selena Zhang;Susan Solomon;Chris D. Boone;Ghassan Taha,Investigating the vertical extent of the 2023 summer Canadian wildfire impacts with satellite observations,"This paper investigates the vertical impacts of the anomalous 2023 Canadian wildfire season using multiple satellite instruments. Our results highlight that despite a record-breaking area burned, only a small amount of smoke managed to enter the stratosphere. This shows that the conditions for deep convection were rarely met in the 2023 wildfire season, suggesting that even a massive area burned is not necessarily an indicator of stratospheric perturbations. 
 Pyrocumulonimbus clouds (pyroCbs) generated by intense wildfires can serve as a direct pathway for the injection of aerosols and gaseous pollutants into the lower stratosphere, resulting in significant chemical, radiative, and dynamical changes. Canada experienced an extremely severe wildfire season in 2023, with a total area burned that substantially exceeded those of previous events known to have impacted the stratosphere (such as the 2020 Australian fires). This season also had record-high pyroCb activity, which raises the question of whether the 2023 Canadian event resulted in significant stratospheric perturbations. Here, we investigate this anomalous wildfire season using retrievals from multiple satellite instruments, ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment – Fourier transform spectrometer), OMPS LP (Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler), and MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder), to determine the vertical extents of the wildfire smoke along with chemical signatures of biomass burning. These data show that smoke primarily reached the upper troposphere, and only a nominal amount managed to penetrate the tropopause. Only a few ACE-FTS occultations captured elevated abundances of biomass-burning products in the lowermost stratosphere. OMPS LP aerosol measurements also indicate that any smoke that made it past the tropopause did not last long enough or reach high enough to significantly perturb stratospheric composition. While this work focuses on Canadian wildfires given the extensive burned area, pyroCbs at other longitudes (e.g., Siberia) are also captured in the compositional analysis. These results highlight that despite the formation of many pyroCbs in major wildfires, those capable of penetrating the tropopause are extremely rare; this in turn means that even a massive area burned is not necessarily an indicator of stratospheric effects."
10.5194/acp-24-11679-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了大气中过氧自由基（RO2）的一种新的化学反应通道，该通道可以形成醚和酯类物质，这些物质是形成大气气溶胶的重要组成部分。研究使用了改进的GECKO-A软件模拟了多种有机物氧化过程中形成的过氧自由基对的反应，并利用结构-活性关系（SARs）预测了可能的产物。结果揭示了哪些类型的过氧自由基更有效地形成低挥发性产物，以及哪些类型的过氧自由基效率出奇地低。这些发现有助于理解大气中新粒子形成的过程，以及有机气溶胶的形成机制。研究结果与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它有助于改进大气成分分析模型，从而提高空气质量监测和卫星观测的精度。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Organic aerosol', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Peroxy radicals', 'New particle formation']",Lauri Franzon;Marie Camredon;Richard Valorso;Bernard Aumont;Theo Kurtén,Ether and ester formation from peroxy radical recombination:  a qualitative reaction channel analysis,"In this article we investigate the formation of large, sticky molecules from various organic compounds entering the atmosphere as primary emissions and the degree to which these processes may contribute to organic aerosol particle mass. More specifically, we qualitatively investigate a recently discovered chemical reaction channel for one of the most important short-lived radical compounds, peroxy radicals, and discover which of these reactions are most atmospherically important. 
 The least volatile organic compounds participating in atmospheric new-particle formation are very likely accretion products from self- and cross-reactions of peroxy radicals (RO2). It has long been assumed that the only possible accretion product channel in this reaction is that forming a peroxide (RO2+RO2→ROOR+O2), but it has recently been discovered that a rapid alkoxy radical (RO) decomposition may precede the accretion step of the mechanism, forming slightly fragmented but more stable ether (ROR) or ester (RC′(O)OR) accretion products. In this work, the atmospheric implications of this new reaction channel have been explored further by using a modified version of the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A) software to generate a large amount of representative RO2 + RO2 reactive pairs formed from the oxidation of typical primary hydrocarbons and by applying structure–activity relationships (SARs) to predict the potential accretion products. These data are analysed in terms of the formation of low-volatility products, and new discoveries are presented on what types of RO2 are especially efficient (and which are surprisingly inefficient) at forming accretion products. These findings are discussed in terms of the atmospheric relevance of these new RO2 + RO2 reaction channels. As the generation of these data rests on several simplifications and assumptions, many open questions worthy of later studies are also raised."
10.5194/acp-24-11701-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了夜间大气中α-蒎烯与臭氧和硝酸根自由基的协同氧化作用，以及该过程对低挥发性有机物（LVOCs）和气溶胶粒子形成的影响。研究发现，协同氧化显著抑制了高氧化有机分子（HOMs）的生成，从而减少了LVOCs的形成，最终抑制了新粒子的产生。该研究结合了实验测量和动力学模型，揭示了协同氧化过程中不同来源的过氧自由基之间的交叉反应机制。其结果对理解生物排放的夜间大气化学过程，以及改进大气化学模型和空气质量预测至关重要。虽然论文本身没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究成果对改进大气成分分析模型，特别是与VOCs，气溶胶和空气质量相关的模型具有重要意义，这些模型是许多大气环境遥感应用的基础。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Particle formation', 'Biogenic emissions', 'Oxidation', 'Nighttime chemistry', 'Monoterpenes', 'Remote sensing']",Han Zang;Zekun Luo;Chenxi Li;Ziyue Li;Dandan Huang;Yue Zhao,Nocturnal atmospheric synergistic oxidation  reduces the formation of low-volatility organic compounds from biogenic emissions,"Atmospheric organics are subject to synergistic oxidation by different oxidants, yet the mechanisms of such processes are poorly understood. Here, using direct measurements and kinetic modeling, we probe the nocturnal synergistic-oxidation mechanism of α-pinene by O3 and NO3 radicals and in particular the fate of peroxy radical intermediates of different origins, which will deepen our understanding of the monoterpene oxidation chemistry and its contribution to atmospheric particle formation. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are often subject to synergistic oxidation by different oxidants in the atmosphere. However, the exact synergistic-oxidation mechanism of atmospheric VOCs and its role in particle formation remain poorly understood. In particular, the reaction kinetics of the key reactive intermediates, organic peroxy radicals (RO2), during synergistic oxidation is rarely studied. Here, we conducted a combined experimental and kinetic modeling study of the nocturnal synergistic oxidation of α-pinene (the most abundant monoterpene) by O3 and NO3 radicals as well as its influences on the formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) and particles. We find that in the synergistic O3 + NO3 regime, where OH radicals are abundantly formed via decomposition of ozonolysis-derived Criegee intermediates, the production of CxHyOz HOMs is substantially suppressed compared to that in the O3-only regime, mainly because of the depletion of α-pinene RO2 derived from ozonolysis and OH oxidation by those arising from NO3 oxidation via cross reactions. Measurement–model comparisons further reveal that the cross-reaction rate constants of NO3-derived RO2 with O3-derived RO2 are on average 10–100 times larger than those of NO3-derived RO2 with OH-derived RO2. Despite a strong production of organic nitrates in the synergistic-oxidation regime, the substantial decrease in CxHyOz HOM formation leads to a significant reduction in ultralow- and extremely low-volatility organic compounds, which significantly inhibits the formation of new particles. This work provides valuable mechanistic and quantitative insights into the nocturnal synergistic-oxidation chemistry of biogenic emissions and will help to better understand the formation of low-volatility organic compounds and particles in the atmosphere."

Here a state-of-the-art quantum-chemistry-based method was used to predict the hygroscopic growth factors (HGFs) of a group of atmospherically relevant OS compounds and their mixtures with (NH4)2SO4. A good agreement was observed between their model-estimated and experimental HGFs. 
 Organosulfur (OS) compounds are important sulfur species in atmospheric aerosol particles, due to the reduction of global inorganic sulfur emissions. Understanding the physicochemical properties, such as hygroscopicity, of OS compounds is important for predicting future aerosol–cloud–climate interactions. However, their hygroscopicity is not yet well understood due to the scarcity of authentic standards. In this work, we investigated a group of OS compounds with short carbon chains (C1–C5) and oxygen-containing functional groups in the form of sodium, potassium, or ammonium salts and their mixtures with ammonium sulfate. The hygroscopic growth factors (HGFs) of these OS compounds have been experimentally studied. Here, the HGFs were calculated from mass fraction of water that was computed using the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS). A good agreement was found between the model-estimated and experimental HGFs for the studied OS compounds. This quantum-chemistry-based approach for HGF estimation will open up the possibility of investigating the hygroscopicity of other OS compounds present in the atmosphere."
10.5194/essd-16-4709-2024,True,Earth System Science Data,这篇论文介绍了一个基于哥白尼Sentinel卫星数据的高分辨率（100米）蒸散发（ET）数据集。该数据集覆盖了地中海地区的四个流域，时间跨度为2017-2021年。研究使用Priestley-Taylor两源能量平衡（TSEB-PT）模型，结合Sentinel-2的多光谱数据和Sentinel-3的陆表温度数据以及ERA5气候再分析数据，生成每日ET地图。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星遥感技术监测地表蒸散发，这对于理解区域水循环，特别是干旱地区的干旱监测和水资源管理至关重要。高分辨率的数据能够更精细地捕捉局部尺度的变化，提高了水资源管理的精度。论文中提到的陆表温度（LST）也是大气环境遥感中的一个重要参数。,"['Land Surface Temperature (LST)', 'Evapotranspiration (ET)', 'Sentinel-2', 'Sentinel-3', 'Remote Sensing', 'Water resource management', 'Drought monitoring', 'Mediterranean climate']",Paulina Bartkowiak;Bartolomeo Ventura;Alexander Jacob;Mariapina Castelli,A Copernicus-based evapotranspiration dataset at 100 m spatial resolution over four Mediterranean basins,"This paper presents the Two-Source Energy Balance evapotranspiration (ET) product driven by Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 imagery together with ERA5 climate reanalysis data. Daily ET maps are available at 100 m spatial resolution for the period 2017–2021 across four Mediterranean basins: Ebro (Spain), Hérault (France), Medjerda (Tunisia), and Po (Italy). The product is highly beneficial for supporting vegetation monitoring and sustainable water management at the river basin scale. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is responsible for regulating the hydrological cycle, with a relevant impact on air humidity and precipitation that is particularly important in the context of acute drought events in recent years. With the intensification of rainfall deficits and extreme heat events, the Mediterranean region requires regular monitoring to enhance water resource management. Even though remote sensing provides spatially continuous information for estimating ET on large scales, existing global products with spatial resolutions ≥ 0.5 km are insufficient for capturing spatial detail at a local level. In the framework of ESA's 4DMED-Hydrology project, we generate an ET dataset at both high spatial and high temporal resolutions using the Priestley–Taylor Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB-PT) model driven by Copernicus satellite data. We build an automatic workflow to generate a 100 m ET product by combining data from Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (S3) land surface temperature (LST) with ERA5 climate reanalysis derived within the period 2017–2021 over four Mediterranean basins in Italy, Spain, France, and Tunisia (Po, Ebro, Hérault, and Medjerda). First, original S2 data are pre-processed before deriving 100 m inputs for the ET estimation. Next, biophysical variables, like leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover, are generated, and then they are temporally composited within a 10 d window according to S3 acquisitions. Consequently, decadal S2 mosaics are used to derive the remaining TSEB-PT inputs. In parallel, we sharpen 1 km S3 by exploiting the dependency between coarse-resolution LST and 100 m S2 reflectances using a decision tree algorithm. Afterwards, climate forcings are utilized to model energy fluxes and then for daily ET retrieval. The daily ET composites demonstrate reasonable TSEB-PT estimates. Based on the validation results against eight eddy covariance (EC) towers between 2017 and 2021, the model predicts 100 m ET with an average RMSE of 1.38 mm d−1 and a Pearson coefficient equal to 0.60. Regardless of some constraints mostly related to the high complexity of EC sites, TSEB-PT can effectively estimate 100 m ET, which opens up new opportunities for monitoring the hydrological cycle on a regional scale.

10.5194/essd-2024-414,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,这篇论文研究了2000年至2023年期间全球范围内由火灾引起的PM2.5浓度。研究人员利用GEOS-Chem化学传输模型，结合GFED4.1s和QFED2.5两个火灾排放清单，并利用来自全球9000多个监测站的地面观测数据进行机器学习偏差校正，构建了一个高分辨率的全球每日火灾源PM2.5浓度数据集。该数据集显示了过去几十年火灾PM2.5的显著时空变化，可用于研究火灾相关空气污染物对气候、生态系统和公众健康的影响。研究中使用了地面观测数据，虽然没有直接提及具体的卫星传感器，但其研究结果与卫星观测到的火灾信息和气溶胶分布密切相关，可为大气环境遥感技术提供重要的数据支持。所以，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['PM2.5', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Fire emissions', 'Aerosols', 'Satellite observations', 'Chemical transport model', 'Climate', 'Public health', 'Ground-based measurements']",Yonghang Hu;Chenguang Tian;Xu Yue;Yadong Lei;Yang Cao;Rongbin Xu;Yuming Guo,Global high-resolution fire-sourced PM2.5 concentrations for 2000–2023,"We develop a global dataset of daily fire-sourced PM2.5 concentration at a spatial resolution of 0.25° for 2000–2023, using a chemical transport model driven with two fire emission inventories and a machine learning approach trained with ground measurements from over 9000 sites. The dataset shows significant spatiotemporal variations of fire PM2.5 in the past decades, serving a useful tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health. 
 Fires are a significant disturbance in Earth’s systems. Smoke aerosols emitted from fires can cause environmental degradation and climatic perturbations, leading to exacerbated air pollution and posing hazards to public health. However, research on the climatic and health impacts of fire emissions is severely limited by the scarcity of air pollution data directly attributed to these emissions. Here, we develop a global daily fire-sourced PM2.5 concentration ([PM2.5]) dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.25° for the period 2000–2023, using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven with two fire emission inventories, the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 with small fires (GFED4.1s) and the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.5r1 (QFED2.5) . Simulated all-source [PM2.5] are bias-corrected using a machine learning algorithm, which incorporates ground observations from over 9000 monitoring sites worldwide. Then the simulated ratios between fire- and all-source [PM2.5] at individual grids are applied to derive fire-sourced [PM2.5]. Globally, the average fire-sourced [PM2.5] is estimated to be 1.94 μg m-3 with GFED4.1s and 3.74 μg m-3 with QFED2.5. Both datasets show consistent spatial distributions with regional hotspots in central Africa and widespread decreasing trends over most areas. While the mean levels of fire-sourced [PM2.5] are much larger at low latitudes, fire episodes at the boreal regions can cause comparable PM2.5 levels as in the tropics. This dataset serves as a valuable tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health, enabling accurate assessments and supports for decision-making in environmental management and policy."

Gardner,Elevation Change of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its Peripheral Glaciers: 1992–2023,"Integrating data from multiple satellite altimetry missions, we analyzed Greenland’s peripheral glaciers and Ice Sheet (GrIS) from 1992–2023. Our methodology ensures consistent, reliable elevation change data, now publicly available via NASA's ITS_LIVE project. The GrIS lost an average of -173 ± 19 Gt a-1 and peripheral glaciers -23 ± 5 Gt a-1 from 1992–2022. The study highlights the importance of continued monitoring to understand climate change impacts on Earth's Cryosphere. 
 The integration of data from multiple satellite altimetry missions, each offering unique observational characteristics, has enabled us to discern both short-term variability and long-term climate trends affecting Greenland’s peripheral glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Our methodology, adapted and informed by lessons learned from our similar efforts in Antarctica, ensures the consistency and reliability of the derived elevation change dataset. The data covers the years 1992–2023 and is made publicly available as part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Inter-Mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project. Our analysis of the dataset reveals significant patterns of mass loss across the GrIS. We find that the ice sheet and peripheral glaciers have experienced an average mass loss of -173 ± 19 Gt a-1 and -23 ± 5 Gt a-1 respectively over the 1992–2022 time period (given temporal availability of selected firn models), with notable variations over time. Specifically, the early years of the record exhibit a positive mass balance, likely due to anomalously positive surface mass balance. However, this trend shifts in subsequent years, with a pronounced increase in mass loss rates, highlighting the accelerating impact of a changing climate on ice sheet dynamics and surface mass balance. Moreover, our analysis underscores the importance of considering peripheral glaciers in addition to the continental ice sheet when assessing overall mass trends. By incorporating data from peripheral glaciers, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of Greenland’s total contributions to global sea level rise. Our findings reveal not only the magnitude of mass loss but also its evolution over time, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and research to better understand the impacts of climate change on Earth's cryosphere."
10.5194/gmd-2024-185,False,Geoscientific Model Development Discussions,这篇论文关注的是利用神经网络来修正海洋环流模型(NEMO)中的海气热通量。其核心是改进海洋温度模拟的精度，并非直接与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等相关。文中提到的'大气强迫'指的是大气对海洋的影响，而非大气成分本身。因此，虽然研究中使用了大气数据，但其目的并非分析大气成分，而是改进海洋模型。,"['air-sea heat fluxes', 'ocean temperature', 'NEMO ocean model', 'neural networks', 'climate modeling']",Andrea Storto;Sergey Frolov;Laura Slivinski;Chunxue Yang,Correction of Air-Sea Heat Fluxes in the NEMO Ocean General Circulation Model Using Neural Networks,"Inaccuracies in air-sea heat fluxes severely downgrade the accuracy of ocean numerical simulations. Here, we use artificial neural networks to correct the air-sea heat fluxes as a function of oceanic and atmospheric state predictors. The correction successfully improves surface and subsurface ocean temperatures beyond the training period and in prediction experiments. 
 The atmospheric forcing and the heat exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere represent one of the major sources of uncertainty for numerical ocean reconstructions and predictions. Air-sea heat fluxes may suffer from inaccuracies in meteorological fields, sea surface variables, and bulk formulations, which have a strongly non-linear dependence on the ocean state. Here, state-dependent errors of the heat fluxes are learned by artificial neural networks (ANN) from a dataset of heat flux correction terms, derived in turn from previous sea surface temperature nudging experiments. The pre-trained model predictors include stationary fields, atmospheric forcing data, ocean state, and stratification indices. Variable importance scores emphasize the dependence of the air-sea heat flux errors on the wind forcing. The pre-trained model of heat flux correction is then used to adaptively correct the fluxes online, in a series of global ocean experiments performed with the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) ocean general circulation model, augmented with ANN inference capabilities. Results indicate the positive impact of the correction procedure, beyond the training period, e.g., in independent observation-poor and -rich periods, leading to the same dynamical and subsurface signature as in nudging experiments. Prediction experiments also indicate the method's potential for operational forecast applications. The method may also be adopted in coupled long-term reanalyses, long-range predictions, and projections."

Our model achieves accuracy comparable to traditional numerical methods while significantly improving speed, making it operable on standard laptops. This work demonstrates AI's potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of global wave modeling. 
 Significant Wave Height (SWH) is crucial for many human activities, such as marine navigation, offshore operations, and coastal management. Traditionally, SWH is modeled using numerical wave models, which, while accurate, are computationally intensive and constrained by incomplete physical representations of wave spectral evolution. This study introduces a simple global deep learning-based model for SWH, which uses the current SWH field and the wind field at the next time step as inputs to predict the SWH field at the next time step. This approach mirrors the rolling prediction strategy of numerical wave models. After training on a re-analysis dataset, the errors of the model diverge lightly with time when given a good initial field because no spectral information is used. However, after diverging for ~200 hours, the errors stabilize, remaining comparable to those of state-of-the-art numerical wave models. Additionally, the error divergence can be mitigated through the assimilation of altimeter measurements. This deep learning model can not only serve as an efficient surrogate for traditional numerical wave models but also provide a baseline for statistical modeling of global SWH due to its simplicity in inputs and outputs."

Both EC and OC are known to be photoactive under solar radiation. However, research on their coupling effect during photochemical aging remains limited. This study examines how the optical properties and oxidative potential (OP) of wood, coal, and diesel soot particles with varying EC and OC levels are affected by exposure to visible light. Wood soot, which has the highest OC content, showed the most significant changes in both optical properties and OP, indicating its highest sensitivity to visible light aging. Molecular composition analysis revealed that the reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and methyl-PAHs primarily affects the optical properties, while oxygenated PAHs play a major role in OP.

However, large amounts of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) remain in sludge, and their interactions with microbes and enzymes would affect resource recovery. This article reviews the effects and mechanisms of PPCPs on anaerobic sludge treatment. Most PPCPs posed adverse impacts on methane production, while certain low-toxicity PPCPs could stimulate volatile fatty acids and biohydrogen accumulation. Changes in the microbial community structure and functional enzyme bioactivities were also summarized with PPCPs exposure. Notably, PPCPs such as carbamazepine could bind with the active sites of the enzyme and induce microbial stress responses. The fate of various PPCPs during anaerobic sludge treatment indicated that PPCPs featuring electron-donating groups (e.g., ·–NH2 and ·–OH), hydrophilicity, and low molecular weight were more susceptible to microbial utilization. Key biodegrading enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 and amidase) were crucial for PPCP degradation, although several PPCPs remain refractory to biotransformation. Therefore, remediation technologies including physical pretreatment, chemicals, bioaugmentation, and their combinations for enhancing PPCPs degradation were outlined. Among these strategies, advanced oxidation processes and combined strategies effectively removed complex and refractory PPCPs mainly by generating free radicals, providing recommendations for improving sludge detoxification."

Subduction interfaces exhibit various slip styles, including slow slip events (SSEs). We use a micromechanics‐based approach to calculate the effective rheology of a shear zone containing ellipsoidal amphibolite clasts deforming by dislocation creep within an interconnected linear‐viscous phyllosilicate‐dominated matrix. Frictional failure occurs if local stress exceeds Mohr‐Coulomb yield strength. At moderate fluid overpressure, mixed‐frictional‐viscous behavior emerges at ∼ ${\sim} $350–560° ${}^{\circ}$C, consistent with a broad zone of mixed fault slip behavior without requiring extreme fluid overpressures. Increasing stress in this transition zone promotes local frictional failure and raises bulk strain rate. If, however, the bulk strain rate increases by more than one order of magnitude, system‐wide frictional sliding becomes preferable. This strain rate increase is insufficient to explain the slip rates observed in geophysically detectable SSEs. Therefore, viscous matrix flow as modeled here cannot explain SSEs without either invoking dynamic weakening within a frictional‐viscous flow or a mechanism switch to dominantly frictional sliding."

Karthikeyan,Role of Initial Conditions and Meteorological Drought in Soil Moisture Drought Propagation: An Event‐Based Causal Analysis Over South Asia,"
The role of meteorological droughts and initial conditions (land and atmosphere) in soil moisture drought (SMD) propagation are not yet fully understood. This work uses a drought event‐based causal framework to investigate the relative importance of meteorological drought (MD) duration and intensity and initial conditions that result in surface and rootzone SMD, considering their event‐level propagation time (PT) over South Asia. Initially, spatial variability of drought propagation is assessed by the Propagation Ratio (PR) computed based on MD counts that trigger SMD at various lags. PR depicts 2–3 months slower rootzone propagation than at surface. The gradual decrease in PR with increasing regional aridity indicates faster propagation over humid regions. The causal impact of initial conditions and MD parameters on propagating SMD are evaluated using normalized mutual information and a newly proposed normalized conditional mutual information. We found greater importance of triggering MD parameters followed by initial soil moisture condition on propagating SMD. This behavior is more evident for the surface layer propagation at shorter PT. There is a confounding effect of initial atmospheric conditions on drought propagation through initial soil moisture, depicting the significance of land‐atmosphere interactions prior to propagation. In the rootzone propagation, initial soil moisture has a greater influence on propagation, especially at longer PT, indicating the significance of soil moisture persistence. Stronger causal links obtained through the joint influence of MD parameters on SMD suggest the importance of accounting for MD duration and intensity simultaneously, which are not considered in drought index‐based propagation studies."

 In 2022, Europe faced an extensive summer drought with severe socioeconomic consequences. Quantifying the influence of human-induced climate change on such an extreme event can help prepare for future droughts. Here, by combining observations and climate model outputs with hydrological and land-surface simulations, we show that Central and Southern Europe experienced the highest observed total water storage deficit since satellite observations began in 2002, probably representing the highest and most widespread soil moisture deficit in the past six decades. While precipitation deficits primarily drove the soil moisture drought, human-induced global warming contributed to over 30% of the drought intensity and its spatial extent via enhanced evaporation. We identify that 14–41% of the climate change contribution was mediated by the warming-driven drying of the soil that occurred before the hydrological year of 2022, indicating the importance of considering lagged climate change effects to avoid underestimating associated risks. Human-induced climate change had qualitatively similar effects on the extremely low observed river discharges. These results highlight that global warming effects on droughts are already underway, widespread and long lasting, and that drought risk may escalate with further human-induced warming in the future.

 Boron, essential for plant growth, necessitates precise regulation due to its potential toxicity. This regulation is achieved by borate transporters (BORs), which are homologous to the SLC4 family. The Arabidopsis thaliana Bor1 (AtBor1) transporter from clade I undergoes slow regulation through degradation and translational suppression, but its potential for fast regulation via direct activity modulation was unclear. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, and functional characterization to study AtBor1, revealing high-resolution structures of the dimer in one inactive and three active states. Our findings show that AtBor1 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: an autoinhibitory domain at the carboxyl terminus obstructs the substrate pathway via conserved salt bridges, and phosphorylation of Thr410 allows interaction with a positively charged pocket at the cytosolic face, essential for borate transport. These results elucidate the molecular basis of AtBor1’s activity regulation and highlight its role in fast boron level regulation in plants.

 Signatures of confidence emerge during decision-making, implying confidence may be of functional importance to decision processes themselves. We formulate an extension of sequential sampling models of decision-making in which confidence is used online to actively moderate the quality and quantity of evidence accumulated for decisions. The benefit of this model is that it can respond to dynamic changes in sensory evidence quality. We highlight this feature by designing a dynamic sensory environment where evidence quality can be smoothly adapted within the timeframe of a single decision. Our model with confidence control offers a superior description of human behaviour in this environment, compared to sequential sampling models without confidence control. Using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG), we uncover EEG correlates of the model’s latent processes, and show stronger EEG-derived confidence control is associated with faster, more accurate decisions.

 Replication, heredity, and evolution are characteristic of Life. We and others have postulated that the reconstruction of a synthetic living system in the laboratory will be contingent on the development of a genetic self-replicator capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. Although DNA-based life dominates, the in vitro reconstitution of an evolving DNA self-replicator has remained challenging. We hereby emulate in liposome compartments the principles according to which life propagates information and evolves. Using two different experimental configurations supporting intermittent or semi-continuous evolution (i.e., with or without DNA extraction, PCR, and re-encapsulation), we demonstrate sustainable replication of a linear DNA template – encoding the DNA polymerase and terminal protein from the Phi29 bacteriophage – expressed in the ‘protein synthesis using recombinant elements’ (PURE) system. The self-replicator can survive across multiple rounds of replication-coupled transcription-translation reactions in liposomes and, within only ten evolution rounds, accumulates mutations conferring a selection advantage. Combined data from next-generation sequencing with reverse engineering of some of the enriched mutations reveal nontrivial and context-dependent effects of the introduced mutations. The present results are foundational to build up genetic complexity in an evolving synthetic cell, as well as to study evolutionary processes in a minimal cell-free system.

 Arterial thrombosis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide with no effective bioassay for clinical prediction. As a symbolic feature of arterial thrombosis, severe stenosis in the blood vessel creates a high-shear, high-gradient flow environment that facilitates platelet aggregation towards vessel occlusion.

Here, the authors show that voluntary temporal attention engages both periodic and transient modulations of visual cortical activity to improve perception at precise time points. 
 We can often anticipate the precise moment when a stimulus will be relevant for our behavioral goals. Voluntary temporal attention, the prioritization of sensory information at task-relevant time points, enhances visual perception. However, the neural mechanisms of voluntary temporal attention have not been isolated from those of temporal expectation, which reflects timing predictability rather than relevance. Here we use time-resolved steady-state visual evoked responses (SSVER) to investigate how temporal attention dynamically modulates visual activity when temporal expectation is controlled. We recorded magnetoencephalography while participants directed temporal attention to one of two sequential grating targets with predictable timing. Meanwhile, a co-localized SSVER probe continuously tracked visual cortical modulations both before and after the target stimuli. We find that in the pre-target period, the SSVER gradually ramps up as the targets approach, reflecting temporal expectation. Furthermore, we find a low-frequency modulation of the SSVER, which shifts approximately half a cycle in phase according to which target is attended. In the post-target period, temporal attention to the first target transiently modulates the SSVER shortly after target onset. Thus, temporal attention dynamically modulates visual cortical responses via both periodic pre-target and transient post-target mechanisms to prioritize sensory information at precise moments. People can direct attention to specific moments that they anticipate will be relevant to their goals.

In a subset of 100 tissues from nine dogs and 12 embryos, we characterized gene expression activity for each promoter, including alternative and novel, i.e., previously not annotated, promoter regions, using the 5’ targeting RNA sequencing technology STRT2-seq. We identified over 100,000 promoter region candidates in the recent canine genome assembly, CanFam4, including over 45,000 highly reproducible sites with gene expression and respective tissue enrichment levels. We provide a promoter and gene expression atlas with interactive, open data resources, including a data coordination center and genome browser track hubs. We demonstrated the applicability of Dog Genome Annotation (DoGA) data and resources using multiple examples spanning canine embryonic development, morphology and behavior, and diseases across species. The Dog Genome Annotation (DoGA) study is based on 5’ transcriptomics of 132 dog tissues. Here the authors identify over 100,000 promoters and provide an expression atlas to facilitate regulatory understanding of disease, morphology and behavior."

They show that increased aridity of anuran habitats and drought exposure under climate change, combined with warming, can substantially reduce anuran activity. 
 Compared with the risks associated with climate warming and extremes, the risks of climate-induced drying to animal species remain understudied. This is particularly true for water-sensitive groups, such as anurans (frogs and toads), whose long-term survival must be considered in the context of both environmental changes and species sensitivity. Here, we mapped global areas where anurans will face increasing water limitations, analysed ecotype sensitivity to water loss and modelled behavioural activity impacts under future climate change scenarios. Predictions indicate that 6.6–33.6% of anuran habitats will become arid like by 2080–2100, with 15.4–36.1% exposed to worsening drought, under an intermediate- and high-emission scenario, respectively. Arid conditions are expected to double water loss rates, and combined drought and warming will double reductions in anuran activity compared with warming impacts alone by 2080–2100. These findings underscore the pervasive synergistic threat of warming and environmental drying to anurans.

 Climate change intensifies fire smoke, emitting hazardous air pollutants that impact human health. However, the global influence of climate change on fire-induced health impacts remains unquantified. Here we used three well-tested fire–vegetation models in combination with a chemical transport model and health risk assessment framework to attribute global human mortality from fire fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions to climate change. Of the 46,401 (1960s) to 98,748 (2010s) annual fire PM2.5 mortalities, 669 (1.2%, 1960s) to 12,566 (12.8%, 2010s) were attributed to climate change. The most substantial influence of climate change on fire mortality occurred in South America, Australia and Europe, coinciding with decreased relative humidity and in boreal forests with increased air temperature. Increasing relative humidity lowered fire mortality in other regions, such as South Asia. Our study highlights the role of climate change in fire mortality, aiding public health authorities in spatial targeting adaptation measures for sensitive fire-prone areas.

Here fire model ensembles and impact attribution show that climate change increasingly explains changes in global burned area. 
 Fire behaviour is changing in many regions worldwide. However, nonlinear interactions between fire weather, fuel, land use, management and ignitions have impeded formal attribution of global burned area changes. Here, we demonstrate that climate change increasingly explains regional burned area patterns, using an ensemble of global fire models. The simulations show that climate change increased global burned area by 15.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) [13.1–18.7]) for 2003–2019 and increased the probability of experiencing months with above-average global burned area by 22% (95% CI [18–26]). In contrast, other human forcings contributed to lowering burned area by 19.1% (95% CI [21.9–15.8]) over the same period. Moreover, the contribution of climate change to burned area increased by 0.22% (95% CI [0.22–0.24]) per year globally, with the largest increase in central Australia. Our results highlight the importance of immediate, drastic and sustained GHG emission reductions along with landscape and fire management strategies to stabilize fire impacts on lives, livelihoods and ecosystems. Complex interactions between drivers have hampered efforts to understand observed changes in fire behaviour worldwide.

 Social movements have the power to drive large-scale social change but the effectiveness of disruptive tactics in achieving this change is uncertain. To shed light on this debate, we conducted nationally representative surveys before and after a week-long disruptive campaign to block London’s M25 motorway (November 2022) by the protest group Just Stop Oil (n = 1,415). Our results suggest that increased awareness of a radical group as a result of a highly publicized non-violent disruptive protest can increase identification with and support for more moderate climate groups (here, Friends of the Earth) in the span of only 2 weeks. Our study provides new insights into the dynamics of social movements and the role of radical protest in driving change. The positive radical flank effect observed here suggests that non-violent radical actions may constitute a largely untapped strategic resource for moderate groups within the broader climate movement.

Predicting cold-induced demand surges is relatively understudied, especially on the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescale of 2 weeks to 2 months. North American winter weather regimes are atmospheric tools that are based on persistent atmospheric circulation patterns, and have been linked to potential S2S predictability of extreme cold in the central US. We study the relationship between winter weather regimes and daily peak load across 13 balancing authorities in the Southwest Power Pool. Anomalous ridging across Alaska, the West Coast, and Greenland drive increases in demand and extreme demand risk. Conversely, anomalous troughing across the Arctic and North Pacific reduces extreme demand risk. Thus, weather regimes may not only be an important long-lead predictor for North American electricity load, but potentially a useful tool for end users and stakeholders."

 Pantropical climate interactions across ocean basins operate on a wide range of timescales and can improve the accuracy of climate predictions. Here, we show in observations that Central Pacific (CP) El Niño-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies have coevolved with tropical South Atlantic SST anomalies on a quasi-decadal (~10-year) timescale over the past seven decades. During the austral autumn–winter season, decadal warm SSTs in the tropical CP effectively induce tropical SST cooling in the South Atlantic, mainly by strengthening the South Atlantic subtropical anticyclone via an extratropical atmospheric wave teleconnection in the southern hemisphere. Partially coupled pacemaker simulations corroborate the observational findings, indicating that tropical CP decadal SSTs play a primary pacing role, while Atlantic feedback is of secondary importance throughout the study period. Our results suggest that the tropical CP could be an important source of decadal predictability for tropical South Atlantic SST and the surrounding climate."

 Understanding litter decomposition processes in coastal macrophyte habitats is critically important for predicting ecosystem functioning. However, decomposition processes of litter mixtures in coastal habitats remain largely unexplored. Here, we evaluated the litter mixture effects on the decomposition of six marine macrophytes (two seagrasses and four macroalgae) through in situ litter-mixing experiments with five levels of litter species richness and 36 different litter compositions. We found that the litter species identity and composition, rather than species richness, were crucial in structuring benthic faunal communities. Macroalgal litter, particularly Sargassum sp., hosted higher numbers of polychaetes and crustaceans than seagrass litter. More macroalgal presence induced faster decomposition rates of seagrass litter in the late stage, but not in the early stage. These findings suggest that changes in macrophyte diversity and composition can alter decomposition processes and, consequently, the sediment organic carbon stock through the transition of litter sources and benthic faunas.

 Low atmospheric oxygen levels during the mid-Proterozoic were occasionally interrupted by transient high oxygen levels. The cause of mid-Proterozoic ocean redox variability remains unclear. Here we investigate mercury chemostratigraphy across the Jixian section of North China Craton through two oxygenation intervals. Abnormal spikes in mercury concentration and excursions of mercury isotopes are observed in the Dahongyu and Hongshuizhuang formations, which occur just below the two oxygenation intervals, respectively. These mercury anomalies suggest that the two oxygenation events were preceded by subaerial volcanism. Furthermore, the two oxygenation intervals show increased nutrient concentrations and negative shifts in mercury isotopes, indicating that enhanced weathering and terrestrial nutrient influx occurred during oxygenation intervals. We infer that in the breakup setting of the Columbia supercontinent, large igneous province volcanism and its efficient low-latitude weathering could rapidly increase terrestrial nutrient influx into the ocean, promoting oceanic productivity and a pulsed rise in oxygen levels.

In this work we present a quantitative methodology to forecast levels of food consumption for 60 consecutive days, at the sub-national level, in four countries: Mali, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen. The methodology is built on publicly available data from the World Food Programme’s global hunger monitoring system which collects, processes, and displays daily updates on key food security metrics, conflict, weather events, and other drivers of food insecurity.

 Average leaf inclination angle (θ¯L) is an important canopy structure variable that influences light regime, photosynthesis, and evapotranspiration of plants. θ¯L can be measured through direct methods (e.g., protractor), which are labor-intensive and time-consuming, or through indirect optical instruments, which are more efficient than the direct methods. However, uncertainties of different indirect optical instruments for quantifying θ¯L remain largely unquantified. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performances of three major indirect optical instruments: (1) LAI-2200, (2) 30°-tilted camera, and (3) digital hemispherical photography (DHP), in different crop fields over a growing season, benchmarked with direct measurements. LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted camera showed higher agreement with direct θ¯ measurements (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 7.37°; R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 8.08°) than DHP (R2 = 0.14, RMSE = 13.96°). Different performances of indirect optical instruments could be attributed to the accuracy of gap fraction measurement and the performance of the θ¯L quantification algorithms. When using the LAI-2200 algorithm, larger gap fraction gradients over view zenith angles led to larger θ¯L values, and smaller gap fraction gradients led to smaller θ¯L values. Such error propagation was larger in sparse canopy than in dense canopy. The Wilson G function of the LAI-2200 algorithm performed better in estimating θ¯L than the G function based on the ellipsoidal LAD function used by the CAN_EYE algorithm. We also proposed a modification of the LAI-2200 algorithm, which further improved the performance of LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted cameras in estimating θ¯L. We envision that the low-cost 30°-tilted cameras provide a promising sensor solution to continuously monitor canopy structure for various ecosystems."

 Existing evidence suggests that exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) causes various adverse health outcomes through systemic inflammation. We explored the association between PM exposure and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in a Korean population. This cross-sectional study included a representative sample of 21,154 Korean individuals, linked to modeled air quality data from 2015 to 2018. Concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were estimated for 1-week (short-term), 2-month, 4-month, 6-month (medium-term), and 1-year (long-term) moving averages before the survey date for each participant. The association between log-transformed hs-CRP levels and PM exposure was assessed using linear regression. The effect sizes were expressed as percent changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The percent change (95% CI) in hs-CRP levels per a 10-μm/m3 increase in PM10, according to moving averages, was 0.47 (−1.13, 2.10) for 1-week, 4.87 (2.50, 7.29) for 2-month, 8.21 (4.89, 11.64) for 4-month, 11.26 (6.81, 15.89) for 6-month, and 7.15 (2.54, 11.98) for 1-year. The percent change (95% CI) in hs-CRP levels per a 10-μm/m3 increase in PM2.5, according to moving averages, was 0.66 (−2.38, 3.79) for 1-week, 7.51 (2.86, 12.36) for 2-month, 14.26 (8.23, 20.62) for 4-month, 20.29 (12.42, 28.70) for 6-month, and 17.76 (8.51, 27.79) for 1-year. The relationship between PM exposure and hs-CRP levels remained independent even after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and other co-pollutants. Exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, particularly over longer periods, showed positive association with hs-CRP levels in Korean adults. These findings highlight the necessity for policy efforts aimed at enhancing air quality and mitigating the health impacts of PM exposure."

 The temporal and spatial variations in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fluxes in a city are vital for understanding the magnitude of emissions, their attributes, and the dynamics of air pollutants. We measured NO2 and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes concurrently using the eddy covariance method at 112 m above the ground from 2021 to 2023 in the city center of Sakai, Japan. The mean half-hourly NO2 flux was 13.3 ± 11.9 (±1 standard deviation; SD) nmol m−2 s−1 from January to December 2021–2023. The diurnal pattern of the NO2 flux exhibited a daytime peak, and the daytime NO2 flux was 1.8 times higher on weekdays than on weekends, regardless of the season. Based on flux footprint analysis, the NO2 fluxes were higher on the western side (20–24 nmol m−2 s−1 on average) than on the eastern side (6–10 nmol m−2 s−1 on average). To identify the main emission source areas at a high resolution, we further obtained the NO2, NO, and CO2 concentrations in each street, including major roads leading to industrial areas and nonmajor roads in residential areas, via mobile measurements with a bicycle or vehicle within the flux footprint from October 2022 to August 2023. Notably, the NO2 emission hotspots were major roads leading to the city center and waterfront industrial areas where the traffic volume of heavy-duty trucks mostly comprised diesel-powered vehicles. In addition, we examined the ratio of the NO2 and CO2 fluxes (FNO2/FCO2), which will be beneficial for identifying the characteristics of NO2 because CO2 is co-emitted as vehicle exhaust. The observed flux ratio during day (approximately 0.77 nmol μmol−1) was rescaled to 1.35–1.54 nmol μmol−1 for vehicle origin when contributions of vehicles to CO2 fluxes and contributions of nitric monoxide (NO) fluxes to total NOx (=NO2 + NO) fluxes were approximated. The rescaled ratio was close to the ratio of NOx and CO2 concentrations observed in the tunnel where photochemical reactions can be neglected. Compared to those in other cities, the NO2 fluxes in Sakai were lower, possibly due to the lower prevalence of diesel vehicles. Measured NO2 fluxes are useful for modeling atmospheric pollutants, validating emission inventories, and assessing emission reductions under the implementation of policies issued by local governments."
