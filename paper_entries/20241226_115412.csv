However, potential mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, a 3T3-L1 adipocyte model was used to explore the dynamic changes in adipocyte differentiation (2, 4, and 8 days) under PFOA and HFPO–DA exposure. PFOA and HFPO–DA increased the adipocyte formation rate and intracellular levels of triglycerides (TG). Meanwhile, adipocyte browning was induced by PFOA and HFPO–DA, which was characterized by small lipid droplets, low levels of TG per adipocyte, increased ATP levels, and elevated mitochondrial respiration activities with time-dependent differentiation. The browning potency indexes of PFOA and HFPO–DA were approximately 1.5 times higher than those of the controls. Time-course transcriptomics analysis showed that PFOA and HFPO–DA activated the biological process of adipocyte browning but different gene expression patterns regulated adipocyte browning. Only overexpressed hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (Hmgcs2) was shared between PFOA and HFPO–DA groups from 2 to 8 days. Hmgcs2 could regulate adipocyte browning induced by PFOA and HFPO–DA, and this observation was lost when Hmgcs2 was knocked down. Our study suggests that PFOA and HFPO–DA could play dual roles in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and Hmgcs2 might be a target of PFOA- and HFPO–DA-induced adipocyte browning."

Walker,Nanomolar PFOA Concentrations Affect Lipid Membrane Structure: Consequences for Bioconcentration Mechanisms,"Independent methods show that sub-microMolar concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a member of the PFAS family of “forever chemicals”, change the properties of DPPC vesicle bilayers. Specifically, calorimetry measurements show that PFOA at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM lowers DPPC’s gel–liquid crystalline transition enthalpy by several J/g without changing the transition temperature (Tgel-LC), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data illustrate that PFOA markedly broadens the size distribution of DPPC vesicles. Furthermore, DLS results from PFOA-containing, DPPC vesicle solutions also contain smaller objects having diameters of 30–50 nm. Close inspection of cryo-EM images reveals that DPPC vesicles formed in the presence of PFOA are multilamellar and the smaller objects have a clear bilayer structure similar to niosomes. A consequence of these PFOA-induced changes to DPPC bilayer structure is that the bilayers themselves are more susceptible to secondary solute accumulation. Time resolved emission measurements of Coumarin 152 (C152) report that C152 is 3-fold more likely to partition into the bilayer’s acyl chain, hydrophobic interior when PFOA is present, and fluorescence lifetimes from C152 partitioned into the polar region of the lipid bilayer show evidence of PFOA-induced membrane hydration below Tgel-LC."

However, the precise engineering of such catalytic systems toward PT decontamination is still challenging, and the conventional SACs are plagued by low structural stability of carbon material support. Here, we adopted magnesium oxide (MgO) as a structurally stable alternative for loading single copper (Cu) atoms to drive peroxymonosulfate-based Fenton-like reactions. Through fine-tuning the Cu atom steric location from lattice-embedding to surface-loading, the system exhibited a fundamental transition in the catalytic pathways toward the PT process and drastically improved decontamination efficiency. The catalytic pathway change was mainly ascribed to a downshifted d-band center of the Cu atoms. The optimized catalyst achieved complete, rapid removal of phenolic compounds from water via nearly 100% PT pathway, accompanied by high oxidant utilization efficiency surpassing most state-of-the-art SACs. Moreover, it showed excellent structural stability and environmental robustness and was successfully used for the treatment of lake water and industrial coking wastewater. The adaptability of the spatial engineering strategy to other MgO-supported single atoms, including Fe, Co, and Ni SACs, was also demonstrated. Our work lays a foundation for further advancing SACs-based advanced oxidation technologies toward sustainable water purification applications."

Saleh,Speciation and Aqueous Dissolution of Macronutrients in Fire Ash: Variation across Ecosystems and the Effects on Nutrient Cycling,"This study investigated the speciation and aqueous dissolution of macronutrients in fire ash from diverse ecosystems and speciation of ash and smoke from laboratory burning, exploring the variations and their causes. The speciation of phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and potassium (K) in fire ash from five globally distributed ecosystems was characterized by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequential fractionation. Aqueous dissolution of the macronutrients was measured by batch experiments at acidic and alkaline pHs. The results showed that P existed mainly as Ca phosphates, Ca as double carbonates, calcite, and sulfates, and most K was associated with Ca carbonates. Mineralogy and the relative abundance of the species were primarily controlled by elemental stoichiometry and fire temperature. Differences in Ca and P speciation existed between ash and smoke from laboratory burning, possibly caused by the temperature difference and/or mass fractionation during burning. The rates, extents, and pH dependencies of macronutrient dissolution differed among macronutrients and depended on their speciation, with K being highly soluble and the P and Ca regulated by solution pH. The variability in ash macronutrient chemistry and ecosystem-specific fire ash loads resulted in varying loads and availability of individual macronutrient from fire among ecosystems. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how fires transform the chemistry of macronutrients and affect macronutrient returns to soils across different ecosystems, which is essential for evaluating the disturbance to ecosystem nutrient cycling by fires."

Although extensively studied for neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption, its stage-specific effects on amphibian metamorphosis and receptor-level interactions remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of CPF on Xenopus laevis metamorphosis at environmentally relevant concentrations (1.8 and 18 μg/L) across key developmental stages, with end points including premetamorphic progression, thyroid hormone (TH)-responsive gene expression, and levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Additionally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and luciferase reporter gene assays were employed to elucidate CPF’s interaction with the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRα). CPF accelerated premetamorphic development and upregulated TH-responsive genes but delayed later-stage metamorphosis. After 21 days of exposure to 18 μg/L CPF, T3 and T4 levels were reduced by 28% and 39.4%, respectively, compared to controls. Cotreatment with T3 and CPF slowed tadpole development, indicating that CPF affects thyroid signaling in a stage-dependent manner. CPF competed with T3 for TRα binding and stimulated TRα-mediated luciferase activity when administered alone, but this activity decreased when CPF was coexposed to T3. These findings suggest that CPF functions as a partial agonist of TRα, disrupting thyroid signaling and adversely affecting amphibian development."

Catalytic oxidation effectively removes these pollutants, but catalyst deactivation is a challenge. Our study focused on the hydrolysis oxidation of chlorobenzene (CB) and ethyl acetate (EA) over Ru/MOx/HZSM-5 (M = W, Mo). It was found that doping MoOx to the catalyst increased the structural hydroxyl amount and balanced surface acidity, thus significantly improving the catalytic stability, with Ru/MoOx/HZSM-5 exhibiting a better activity for CB and EA oxidation (T90% = 438 and 276 °C at space velocity = 20,000 mL g–1 h–1, respectively). Water vapor introduction considerably promoted hydrolysis oxidation and protected the active sites from being poisoned by cumulative chlorine. The synergistic interaction of the Mo–O(H)–Al structure in Ru/MoOx/HZSM-5 with the Si–OH–Al structure promotes the activation of H2O to form bridging hydroxyl groups, which provide a proton-rich environment for hydrolysis oxidation. It was also found that dissociated H2O reacted with adsorbed oxygen species to form highly active *OOH, accelerating the deep oxidation of intermediates. We believe that the present study can provide a unique strategy for the effective elimination of multicomponent VOCs under complex conditions."

Vivianite, an Fe(II)-phosphate mineral, can be a major P sink in nonsulfidic, reducing coastal sediments. Despite its importance, vivianite formation processes in sediments remain poorly understood. Here, we applied a novel approach to detect and quantify in situ vivianite formation in three intertidal flats. We conducted 7-week long incubations of mesh-bags filled with sediments mixed with (1) 57Fe-ferrihydrite, (2) 57Fe-ferrihydrite with adsorbed phosphate, and (3) 57Fe-ferrihydrite with adsorbed phosphate and some vivianite (natural Fe isotope abundance), which could serve as crystal growth sites. Synthesizing the ferrihydrite from 57Fe (96.1%)  enabled us to detect transformation products using 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy. Vivianite formed only in treatments containing adsorbed phosphate and only at the two sites where vivianite formation was thermodynamically feasible based on porewater chemistry. These results demonstrate vivianite formation within weeks when locally favorable Fe:P ratios exist. Although vivianite comprised a minor fraction of Fe (up to 15%), it represented a significant P pool (up to 72%), emphasizing its role in coastal P burial.

However, the ecological toxic effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of TDtBPP in organisms remain entirely unknown. In this study, 1 month old zebrafish were exposed to 0, 50, 500, or 5000 ng/L TDtBPP for 150 days, and the reproductive toxicity in male fish was evaluated. Results demonstrated that TDtBPP exposure significantly inhibited the maturation of spermatozoa and thus decreased spermatogenesis. Furthermore, abnormal sperm morphology and decreased sperm motility were also observed. The decrease in sperm quantity and quality eventually resulted in the declining fecundity. Moreover, TDtBPP exposure downregulated the expression of hsd3b1 in vivo and in vitro and subsequently inhibited the synthesis of androgens in zebrafish testes and Leydig cells. This inhibition of androgen synthesis appeared to be responsible for the observed reproductive toxicity in male fish. Molecular docking and dual-luciferase reporter gene experiments elucidated that TDtBPP inhibited the promotion of vitamin D on hsd3b1 transcription by the vitamin D receptor and thus downregulated the expression of hsd3b1.

Current mitigation strategies predominantly focus on reducing the availability of inorganic Hg (IHg) for Hg methylation, achieved primarily through Hg emission control and in situ Hg immobilization. While these IHg-targeted approaches have effectively reduced MeHg bioaccumulation and subsequent human exposure, their efficacy is largely undermined by Hg transformations and fluctuating environmental conditions due to the complex and protracted pathway linking IHg from environmental sources to MeHg at the point of human exposure. In light of recent advancements in MeHg-related transformations, we emphasize the development of MeHg-targeted strategies to improve the overall efficiency of Hg risk management in rice-paddy systems. MeHg-targeted strategies include microbial regulation to diminish net MeHg production, facilitating MeHg demethylation in soils, and promoting the in vivo MeHg degradation within rice plants. Although these approaches are still in their nascent stages, they hold significant promise due to their potential high mitigation efficacy and reduced uncertainties, owing to the shorter pathway between MeHg production and human exposure. Integrating IHg- and MeHg-targeted strategies offers a comprehensive and synergistic approach, paving the way for more effective mitigation of human exposure to MeHg in rice-paddy systems."

This study examined NOCs from dung and bitumite combustion in the TPL and their atmospheric oxidation by hydroxyl (·OH) and nitrate (·NO3) radicals using an integrated experimental and theoretical approach. Dung produced higher NOC emissions, mainly methyl types, while bitumite emitted more fused‐ring NOCs. Exposure to intense solar radiation resulted in substantial photobleaching of methyl NOCs through hydroxyl (·OH) reactions, reducing the maximum molar absorption at 300–400 nm wavelengths by 76.9%–96.4%. Moreover, nitrate radical (·NO3) oxidation maintained spectral characteristics while producing minor absorption decreases of 48.9%–58.8%. The oxidative aging of fused‐ring NOCs exhibited structure‐dependent responses, wherein both ·NO3 and ·OH oxidation induced photo‐enhancement effects proportional to the number of aromatic rings in the molecular structure. Oxidation generally reduced radiative forcing for methyl NOCs but enhanced it for fused‐ring NOCs, particularly through ·OH reactions, which increased simple forcing efficiency at 300–400 nm by 43.7%.

A high‐resolution simulation of the historical climate in Alaska can provide an important benchmark for climate change studies. In this study, we utilized the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and conducted coupled land‐atmosphere modeling for Alaska and Yukon River Basin at 4‐km grid spacing. In RASM, the land model was replaced with the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) given its comprehensive process representations for cold regions. The microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) atmospheric model were manually tuned for optimal model performance. This study aims to maintain good model performance for both hydroclimate and terrestrial hydrology, especially streamflow, which was rarely a priority in coupled models. Therefore, we implemented a strategy of iterative testing and optimization of CTSM. A multi‐decadal climate data set (1990–2021) was generated using RASM with optimized land parameters and manually tuned WRF microphysics. When evaluated against multiple observational data sets, this data set well captures the climate statistics and spatial distributions for five key weather variables and hydrologic fluxes, including precipitation, air temperature, snow fraction, evaporation‐to‐precipitation ratios, and streamflow. The simulated precipitation shows wet bias during the spring season and simulated air temperatures exhibit dampened seasonality with warm biases in winter and cold biases in summer. We used transfer entropy to investigate the discrepancy in connectivity of hydrologic and energy fluxes between the offline CTSM and coupled models, which contributed to their discrepancy in streamflow simulations."

During the development of Hinnamnor, its energy growth rate (EGR) continuously increases as RI progresses. After Hinnamnor reaches its maximum intensity, although its EGR weakens a little, it remains relatively large. If it had not been for the influence of the external environment (such as the tropical depression), its maximum intensity would have been far greater than the actual maximum intensity (140 knots). As the WISHE effect progressively weakens, the number of convective bursts (CBs) gradually diminishes. This, in turn, gives rise to a corresponding weakening of the warm core and a subsequent delay in the start time of the axisymmetrization of the inner core, thereby affecting the intensification rate of the vortex and the final maximum intensity. Consequently, the start time of RI is also correspondingly postponed. Differing from the maximum potential intensity theory, when the EGR approaches zero, a TC does not immediately reach its maximum intensity. Instead, it attains its peak intensity approximately 12 hr later. During this additional 12 hr period, the number of CBs continues to increase, the warm core keeps on strengthening and the inner core continues its progress toward axisymmetric until the end of the RI process. This indicates that the dynamical and thermodynamical processes are also of great importance during the RI stage."

Based on three experiments with low aerosol concentration background (“Low”), medium aerosol concentration background (“Medium”), and high aerosol concentration background (“High”), the effects of hydrophilic aerosol serving as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) on microphysical and precipitation processes are investigated. Results indicate the impact of hydrophilic aerosol on clouds and precipitation structure exhibits structural difference. Aerosol increases from “Low” to “Medium”, precipitation in middle circle of SWV decreases, precipitation in outer circle of SWV increases. Because the outer circle of SWV with strong convection competes with the middle circle of SWV for liquid droplets, leading to a reduction in ice‐phase particles in middle circle of SWV. In contrast, more ice‐phase particles are formed in outer circle of SWV. The increased ice‐phase particles melt into raindrops, leading to an increase in precipitation. Aerosol increases from “Medium” to “High”, precipitation in middle circle of SWV increases, precipitation in outer circle of SWV decreases. The size of liquid droplets formed in outer circle of SWV further becomes smaller. This is not conducive to the formation of ice‐phase particles, leading to weaker convection, which makes it becomes less competitive. A large number of small cloud droplets in middle circle of SWV are transported above the freezing layer and participate in the formation of ice‐phase particles.

The leading mode is characterized by positive SLP anomalies over the East Asia‐Northwest Pacific region. Inter‐model regression analyses reveal the relationship between the leading mode and historical sea surface temperature (SST). The inter‐model uncertainties of the NWPSH projections are closely related to the historical tropical North Atlantic (TNA) cold SST anomalies. The TNA cold SST anomalies result in increased precipitation in the subtropical North Pacific through westward propagated Rossby wave responses, further enhancing the subtropical North Pacific cold SST anomalies in the future through the reinforced convection‐shortwave‐SST negative feedback. Suppressed convection over the subtropical North Pacific strengthens the NWPSH through the anticyclonic Rossby wave response. The emergent constraints based on the observed TNA SST pattern reduce the uncertainties of the NWPSH projections by 32.5%, indicating a weaker NWPSH compared to the multi‐model mean. Cold biases of the simulated present‐day TNA SST in most CMIP6 models indicate that the multi‐model ensemble mean (MME) may overestimate the intensity of NWPSH in the warmer future. This study helps improve the accuracy of NWPSH projections, contributing to climate change adaptations for many important sectors impacted by NWPSH variation, such as agriculture, infrastructure, and energy."

 Remote Sensing Image (RSI) scene classification plays a pivotal role in diverse applications such as land cover mapping, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Traditional deep learning approaches, however, heavily rely on abundant labeled data, which is often costly and challenging to acquire. Semi-supervised learning emerges as a cost-effective alternative, yet existing methods frequently overlook the intricate characteristics of remote sensing data, such as multi-scale features and complex spatial patterns, thereby limiting their ability to effectively address these challenges. In this study, a novel Scene Semi-Supervised Method (SSSM) is introduced, marking a significant advancement in both network architecture and semi-supervised techniques. At the core of the SSSM framework lies the Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), meticulously designed to extract and integrate complex features from remote sensing data across diverse scales and locations. To optimize the utilization of pseudo-labels and minimize mislabeling, the Pseudo-Label Multi-Level Sampling strategy (PMLS) is proposed, a probabilistic approach that selectively identifies high-quality pseudo-labels to enhance training. Rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets reveal that the SSSM method significantly improves classification accuracy, achieving an increase of 3%–5% on a specific dataset compared to existing approaches. This accomplishment underscores the effectiveness of the MFFN design and the semi-supervised strategy in tackling the complexities of remote sensing scene classification. In summary, the MFFN-driven pseudo-label framework presented in this research pioneers a cutting-edge and promising new direction for semi-supervised remote sensing scene classification."

 Land surface temperature (LST) serves as a crucial indicator of the thermal state and environmental changes on the Earth’s surface, and it can be retrieved effectively from satellite thermal infrared sensors. Although algorithms for retrieving LSTs have been developed successfully for many satellites, the newly launched Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), which includes three thermal infrared bands, does not yet include effective LST algorithms and parameters. Here, parameters are calibrated for retrieving LSTs from SDGSAT-1 Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) data for the split-window (SW) method and the three-channel (TC) method under both daytime and nighttime conditions. In this process, the Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset and observation data from the University of Wyoming were used. Validations were conducted using in situ LST measurements at the Guantao, Turpan, and Heihe sites in China and from the Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) network in North America, covering cropland, desert and bare land, and grassland. The overall accuracies of the models are fairly good, with RMSEs of 2.507 K and 2.272 K for split-window method during daytime and nighttime respectively, and 2.847 K and 1.923 K for three-channel method. Additionally, the LST retrieval models that use observation data from the University of Wyoming had higher accuracy than those using the TIGR2000 profiles. Currently, the proposed models can be applied under different atmospheric water vapor contents and underlying surface conditions both during the day and at night, paving the way for retrieving LST products from SDGSAT-1."

 Quantifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect and its impact on summer heat-related risk is important for both urban environment and human well-being. Existing studies frequently adopt the static (fixed) urban boundary to define urban/rural area in UHI measurement, overlooking the exacerbation of the urbanization-induced warming during long-term urban expansion and the consequent increase in urban heat risks. Here we measured the global surface UHI (SUHI) intensity up to 7,554 urban patches during 2000–2015 using every five-year dynamic urban boundary, followed by a two-stage analysis based on a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to quantify the additional heat-related risks caused by the urbanization-induced warming. Our results show that the global average SUHI intensity increased by approximately 10 % in 15 years with distinct seasonal and diurnal variations. The global urban expansion from 2000 to 2015 resulted in an average increase of 0.61℃ (95 % CI = 0.56℃-0.66℃) in summer UHI intensity for newly built-up areas. This urbanization-induced warming further leads to a 20 % (95 % CI = 14.8 %-25.2 %) increase in summer heat relative risk (RR) on average, which implied an average increase of 20 % (95 % CI = 14.8 %-25.2 %) in annual heat-related mortality for the newly built-up areas. Furthermore, over 2.3 % of the world population would experience an RR increase greater than 10 %.

 Accurate identification and classification of tree species on a large scale are crucial for the effective management of urban green spaces; however, previous research combining airborne sensors such as LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging for tree classification has generally focused on smaller areas or specific sites, with limited studies applying this approach at the city-wide scale. This study focuses on the utilization of multi-temporal airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data for the classification of 10 species of urban trees at the city scale, which collectively cover over 95 % of the tree-covered areas within the city. Our objective is to evaluate the utility of metrics and indices derived from LiDAR (leaf-on/leaf-off) and HSI (peak growing season/autumn senescence) data in a 35.86 km2 urban green space in Gwacheon, Republic of Korea. A comprehensive set of 15 independent variables was extracted from preprocessed and calibrated airborne LiDAR data (footprint size: 0.46 m, density: 42.7 points/m2) and HSI data (127 bands, 400–970 nm range, spatial resolution: 0.68 m) to train seven machine learning classifiers. The model was trained on a stratified random sample of 21,826 tree crown polygon samples collected from individual trees surveyed. The results showed that the combination of airborne LiDAR and HSI data from two seasons achieved the highest classification accuracy with the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) classifier (90.6 %; Kappa: 0.895) for all 10 major tree species across the entire city, especially for Ginkgo, American sycamore, and Yoshino cherry. Among all variables, the maximum tree height (Hmax) and the intersection symmetric difference ratio index (ISDRI) were among the top influential factors for tree species classification accuracy. Hmax, with an importance value of 0.490, is particularly effective due to the characteristics of urban green spaces. ISDRI, with an importance value of 0.336, highlights seasonal leaf volume differences, aiding in species differentiation. The spectral indices acquired during the autumn leaf senescence showed a cumulative shapley additive explanations (SHAP) importance score that was 0.374 points higher than that of the leaf-on period, highlighting the enhanced significance of hyperspectral data from the leaf senescence phase in classifying tree species. The synergistic integration of airborne LiDAR, HSI, and seasonal data gathered during key phenological periods, along with relevant indices, will contribute significantly to urban forest management at the city-wide level."

The results revealed that all three greenhouse gases exhibited an increase over the study period, with interannual growth rates of 5.249 ± 0.255 ppb/yr for CH4, 2.24 ± 0.027 ppm/yr for CO2, and 0.894 ± 0.015 ppb/yr for N2O. Significant seasonal variations were observed for each gas: CH4 concentrations were elevated from June to September, displaying an obvious unimodal distribution. For CO2, peak concentrations occurred in April and the lowest in August, also following a unimodal distribution. The N2O exhibited two peaks in March and October, with a trough in June, indicating a bimodal single-trough distribution. Comparative seasonal analysis with two other northern hemisphere stations (LMP and NWR) showed that the seasonal variation of CO2 demonstrates stronger global consistency, whereas the seasonal characteristics of CH4 and N2O reflect regional differences. Correlation analysis among the three greenhouse gases showed a strong negative correlation between CH4 and CO2 (correlation coefficient −0.84, p < 0.05) and a strong positive correlation between N2O and CO2 (correlation coefficient 0.88, p < 0.05).

However, O3 has replaced PM2.5 as the primary pollutant affecting air quality in many Chinese cities. For the prevention and control of ozone pollution, an integrated risk assessment framework is proposed. From the perspective of anthropogenic emission sources of O3 precursors (NOX and VOCS), the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) method is explored to carry out the causation analysis and the Empirical Kinetics Modeling Approach (EKMA) is used for sensitivity analysis. A causation FTA model is established for excessive emission of O3 precursors, the key risk factors are identified, and a quantitative probability calculation strategy is proposed for the risk factors. The case study results showed that the probability of the excess ozone precursor emissions in Dongguan was 0.7193, and Excess vehicles (X1) was the primary factor of the top event. The other 12 basic risk factors related to industrial sources such as solvent paint use and industrial furnaces also had certain impacts. The sensitivity analysis results showed that the generation of O3 in Dongguan was limited by VOCS in spring and winter, while it was limited by NOX-VOCS synergy in summer and autumn. According to the causation and sensitivity analysis results, some control strategies for O3 pollution are proposed, such as controlling the number of fossil fuel vehicles, promoting new energy vehicles, strengthening the supervision of industrial sources, and encouraging the relevant enterprises to improve the production techniques and management, etc. This work might provide significant theoretical support for the prevention and control of O3 pollution in target cities."

 Accurate prediction of PM2.5 levels is critical for safeguarding public health and informing environmental policies. However, forecasting remains challenging due to the complex transport of pollutants between monitoring stations and the dynamic nature of atmospheric conditions. This study introduces a new PM2.5 prediction model utilizing a dynamic wind-driven graph fusion approach that explicitly incorporates inter-station pollutant transport. By dynamically adjusting graph edge weights based on evolving wind patterns, the model captures the spatiotemporal dependencies between meteorological conditions and pollutant dispersion across multiple monitoring stations, which in turn enhances its interpretability by providing insights into the underlying relationships between environmental factors and air quality dynamics. An ablation study underscores the effectiveness of each component, particularly highlighting the impact of inter-station transport considerations on prediction accuracy. The model demonstrates superior performance, with over 70% of station-specific predictions achieving lower RMSE compared to leading models. Additionally, transfer learning techniques are employed to extend the model's scalability and efficiency, reducing the required training data by 80% and cutting training time by a factor of 50. This approach not only enhances the accuracy and interpretability of PM2.5 forecasts but also provides valuable insights into pollutant transport dynamics, offering a useful tool for air quality management and policy decision-making."

The spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 during this pollution event were analyzed using surface measurements and satellite observations. The peak pollution levels of PM2.5 occurred on October 30 at 19:00 (186 μg/m³) and on November 1 at 21:00 (197 μg/m³).

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.121013,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇研究论文利用卫星遥感技术观测到的气溶胶光学厚度 (AODf) 数据，分析了印度 COVID-19 封锁期间全州范围内的细颗粒物 (PM2.5) 浓度变化。研究发现，尽管城市地区的 PM2.5 浓度有所下降，但在许多州，由于农村地区污染物排放的增加，全州范围内的 AODf 反而显著增加。这表明，仅仅关注城市地区 PM2.5 的变化不足以全面评估封锁对印度空气质量的影响。研究排除了长期污染模式和时间滞后效应的影响，结果显示先前环境干预措施也可能影响对封锁影响的评估。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测数据来分析大气成分 (PM2.5) 的变化，并评估了其对空气质量的影响。,"['PM2.5', 'Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'India', 'Lockdown effect']",Tunde O.

 Atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5, near-surface concentrations when size is ≤ 2.5 μm) affects global climate and human health. India alone accounts for a quarter of the global PM2.5-related health burden. Studies in India, mostly in urban areas, have reported significant declines in PM2.5 concentrations because of COVID-19 lockdown. These studies did not consider the long-term PM2.5 patterns and time-lag effect (inter-yearly variations in PM2.5 concentrations carried forward from one period to another due to interannual shifts in meteorological conditions). Since the studies focused primarily on urban areas, not covering rural/remote areas where pollution may rise during lockdown, it is still unclear what impact lockdown had on statewide pollution levels in India. Here, we examine whether significant changes in fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AODf: columnar PM2.5) occurred statewide across India because of lockdown after excluding the confounding variables. We found a substantial decrease in AODf in a few (28%) states/territories. The declines were significant (ANCOVA; α = 0.05) in some Northeastern states/territories: Sikkim (29%), Arunachal Pradesh (24%), Nagaland (5%), Mizoram (4%) and Uttarakhand (3%). However, in most states/territories, AODf increased significantly because of lockdown. The lockdown-associated hardship caused more people to rely on polluting cooking fuels, thereby increasing residential emissions, particularly in rural areas. At city-level, we found significant reductions in near-surface PM2.5 concentrations due to lockdown. These declines were comparable or greater than previously reported. Also, there were significant reductions in AODf (PM2.5 concentrations) at state (city) levels resulting from previous environmental intervention measures. If not accounted, previous environmental intervention measures can significantly bias lockdown effect estimates in India."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120989,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文提出了一种利用混合机器学习方法（随机森林和自动编码器深度残差神经网络的结合）来估算缺失气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）的鲁棒方法。研究使用了MAIAC卫星数据，并利用MERRA-2数据进行空间降尺度，以提高AOD数据在时空上的分辨率和精度。该方法有效地解决了云和高地表反射率导致的MAIAC AOD数据缺失问题，并利用PM2.5前体物柱浓度信息提高了估算精度。结果表明，该方法在提高AOD估算精度方面显著优于传统的双线性插值和最近邻插值方法，对改善细颗粒物（PM2.5）反演和健康风险评估具有重要意义，并能提升气候模型的模拟和预测能力。研究重点关注大气成分中的气溶胶，利用卫星遥感技术（MAIAC）进行观测，并应用于空气质量监测和健康影响评估等领域。,"['Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'MAIAC', 'MERRA-2', 'PM2.5', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Spatial downscaling', 'Machine learning', 'Hybrid model', 'Random Forest', 'Autoencoder']",Abula Tuheti;Zipeng Dong;Guanghua Li;Shunxi Deng;Zhengqiang Li;Li Li,Spatiotemporal imputation of missing aerosol optical depth using hybrid machine learning with downscaling,"•Developed a robust RF-AutoResnet method combining Random Forest and Autoencoder's Deep Residual Neural Network for estimating missing MAIAC AOD data. •The RF model downscales MERRA-2 AOD more accurately than Bilinear and Nearest algorithms, achieving better R and RMSE values. •The RF-AutoResnet model captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity of AOD effectively from 2019 to 2022 in the HCHO + SO2+NO2scenario from 2019 to 2022. •The method outperformed other models with higher R2and lower RMSE and MAE values. 
 The Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) provides high spatiotemporal resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), which is crucial for characterizing aerosol evolution on a spatial scale and supports exposure assessments and health research. The influence of clouds and high surface reflectance causes the loss of MAIAC AOD on a spatial scale, leading to inaccuracies in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) retrieval and health risk assessments over the Fenwei Plain (FWP). However, the column concentration of PM2.5 precursors has not been used to impute missing AOD. Meanwhile, a spatial downscaling model that reduces errors and higher spatial resolution needs to be developed to assist in the AOD gap-filling task. Thus, we propose a robust estimation method for imputing missing MAIAC AOD (RF-AutoResnet) using a combination of Random Forest (RF) and Autoencoder's Deep Residual Neural Network (AutoResnet). The RF model downscales the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD spatially and introduces AutoResnet for AOD imputation. Compared with the Bilinear and Nearest algorithms, the RF downscaling model more accurately reflects the spatial variability of AOD, achieving better R (0.71) and lower RMSE (0.10). Scenario analysis found that in the HCHO+SO2+NO2 scenario (Simultaneously adding formaldehyde (HCHO) sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to the RF-AutoResnet model) scenario, from 2019 to 2022, the RF-AutoResnet model captured the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of AOD on a fine spatial scale for missing daily and monthly average MAIAC AOD. Compared with Bilinear-AutoResnet and Nearest-AutoResnet, the RF-AutoResnet method achieved better performance (average R2 =0.86-0.98; average RMSE =0.02-0.05; average MAE =0.01-0.02). Considering the gap-filled AOD estimated by the column concentration of PM2.5 precursors, it shows a strong correlation with the AOD of the Sun sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) (R = 0.91, RMSE = 0.06, Bias = 0.01). These results underscore the reliability of this hybrid machine learning approach for AOD estimation. This is highly significant for improving the precision of evaluating PM2.5 effects on human health at a finer scale and enhancing the simulation and prediction capabilities of climate models."

 Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation plays a crucial role in regional cloud-precipitation and global climate. However, inaccuracies in CCN activation parameterization, stemming from the presence of unactivated particles in CCN measurements that are mistakenly included in developing CCN activation parameterizations, can introduce biases in model predictions of cloud droplet number concentration, subsequently affecting cloud microphysics, precipitation initiation, and radiation. To address this issue, this study proposes correction coefficients for CCN activation parameterization using the Twomey power-law function and applies them in the large-eddy model to simulate continental shallow cumulus over the Southern Great Plains, USA. Results reveal that compared to simulations using uncorrected CCN parameterization, those using corrected parameterization decrease cloud droplet number concentration by 32.8 %, leading to an increase of cloud water autoconversion rate by 8.9 % and a decrease of cloud optical thickness by 17.3 %. This indicates a suppression of cloud-precipitation processes and an overestimation of cloud radiative cooling in the default scheme. Moreover, as aerosol loading increases, the differences between the corrected and uncorrected parameterization slightly diminish. Compared to uncorrected CCN parameterization, those using corrected parameterization exhibit stronger cloud sensitivity to aerosols, which partially mitigates the overestimation of cloud radiative cooling in the default scheme. The corrected CCN activation parameterization could help alleviate the overestimation of aerosol indirect effects, particularly in clouds with low supersaturation conditions, thereby contributing to reduced uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interaction simulations.Short summaryCloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are particles that help clouds form, but inaccuracies in measuring them can lead to errors in predicting cloud behavior. This study introduces a correction for CCN activation in models, showing that the uncorrected parameterization can significantly overestimate cloud droplet numbers. The corrected approach provides more accurate predictions, reducing uncertainties in weather and climate models and enhancing our understanding of how aerosols interact with clouds."

 Understanding the transport patterns of aerosols between urban and rural areas and predicting their spatiotemporal variations is crucial. In this study, from June 2022 to December 2023, ground-based Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations were conducted in urban and rural areas of Hefei, Anhui, China. Anhui University (AHU) and Changfeng (CF) were selected as representative urban and rural sites, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the MAX-DOAS aerosol extinction measurements at the lower layer and in situ PM2.5 at AHU reached 0.720. The study found that the seasonal average aerosol profiles at AHU exhibited a Gaussian pattern, while those at CF showed both Gaussian and band-like distributions, with the maximum aerosol loading appearing within 1200 m. Seasonal average aerosol vertical profiles indicated that in spring, summer, and autumn, peak aerosol extinction values at AHU occurred approximately two hours earlier than at CF. In winter, however, peak aerosol extinction values at CF appeared about two hours earlier than at AHU. The study also revealed the phenomenon of high-altitude aerosol transport during the observation period. Typical transport cases were selected for each season: August 21, October 1, December 13, 2022, and April 9, 2023. It was found that the main aerosol transport height ranged from 300 to 1200 m, with aerosol transport fluxes ranging from 1.744 to 3.954 km−1∙m∙s−1. Potential source analysis indicated that aerosols at AHU and CF primarily originated from nearby urban areas, with significant transport from southeastern Henan, eastern Hubei, northern Jiangxi, and northwestern Zhejiang, with relatively short transport distances. Additionally, using a deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, we predicted the daily average aerosol vertical profiles at the CF from July to December 2023. The correlation between the predicted data and the actual MAX-DOAS observations at CF reached 0.750, demonstrating the model's accuracy in spatiotemporal prediction. Predicting daily average aerosol vertical profiles can provide early warnings of aerosol pollution events and support the formulation and implementation of environmental policies."

 In Southern China (SC), heatwaves have intensified and became more frequent since the early 2000s. Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), SC heatwaves were classified into four distinct types. SOM1, the dominant pattern (accounting for 75.9 % events), centered in the Yangtze River Basin. The most severe events in this category featured a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 44.5 °C, impacted 600 stations, and lasted for 13 days. SOM1 was primarily influenced by the westward extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), the eastward extension of the South Asian High (SAH), abnormal European Blocking (EB) and Silk Road Pattern (SRP). Four most extreme heatwaves were categorized under SOM2, including the 2022 mega heatwave, which recorded a higher Tmax (45.0 °C), broader coverage (623 stations), and longer duration (36 days). These events are driven by much stronger EB, WPSH, and SAH anomalies, indicating a more intensified circulation pattern compared to SOM1. SOM3 comprising eight events, primarily affected eastern SC. In contrast, SOM4 including two cases mainly affected western SC. Increased SC heatwaves have been linked to changing large-scale circulations and spring Barents Sea ice loss. Random Forest quantified the relative importance of different large-scale circulation factors, revealing that the reconstructed circulation pattern associated with SOM1 showed a significant enhancement, with its contribution to heatwaves increasing from 14.5 % to 47.2 % since the early 2000s. Spring Barents Sea ice loss influenced SC heatwaves by adjusting aforementioned circulations, especially after the early 2000s, supported by diagnosis and numerical experiments."
