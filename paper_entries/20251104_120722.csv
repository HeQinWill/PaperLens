10.5194/acp-25-14333-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了使用被动传感器获取的气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）产品中存在的季节性偏差问题。研究发现，太阳天顶角（SZA）效应对被动传感器（如MODIS）的AOD反演质量有显著影响，尤其是在高纬度地区，导致冬季AOD值偏低。研究通过对比CALIOP（一种主动激光雷达）和MODIS的数据，揭示了低质量反演和SZA之间的关系，并指出这种偏差会影响我们对北极地区气溶胶季节性变化的理解。该研究对改进卫星AOD反演算法，减少不确定性，以及更准确地评估气溶胶对气候的影响具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)', 'Passive Sensors', 'Lidar', 'Solar Zenith Angle (SZA)', 'Satellite Observations', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'MODIS', 'CALIOP', 'Arctic Aerosols']",Sarah Smith;Yutian Wu;Rob Levy;Mingfang Ting,Seasonality biases arise from the interplay of retrieval quality and solar zenith angle effects in passive sensor AOD products,"A lidar satellite instrument shows Arctic particulate matter is highest in winter and lowest in summer, while sunlight-based instruments show the opposite. When the sun is low on the horizon, sunlight-based measures increasingly decline relative to lidar (but only in certain cases), driving lower average winter values even beyond the Arctic. These seasonality biases are important for user guidance, while this new insight may help reduce particulate measurement uncertainties in complex scenes. 
 Station observations of surface Arctic aerosol have long shown a pronounced seasonal cycle, with burdens characteristically peaking in the late winter/early spring. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products replicate this seasonality, but passive sensor and reanalysis data products do not. We find that the sub- and low-Arctic seasonality of gridded AOD products from six passive sensors diverges from that of CALIOP data products during the months of September–April, even when controlling for sampling biases. Using colocated CALIOP and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Aqua) retrievals, we find that for colocations characterized by low-quality MODIS retrievals, the bias between MODIS and CALIOP strongly depends on the solar zenith angle (SZA), with MODIS AODs showing a 132 % reduction relative to the instrument-mean over a theoretical 0–90° SZA domain. As the fraction of MODIS retrievals flagged as “low-quality” increases with higher SZAs, retrieval quality mediates the relationship between the SZA and dataset biases in gridded products. The dependency may be the result of cloud adjacency effects, and likely also affects midlatitude AOD seasonality. Though additional sources of uncertainty in high latitude retrievals remain, the observed dependency impacts passive sensor data products' representations of (sub-)Arctic aerosol burdens in boreal spring and autumn, which are important for understanding aerosol processes in a highly sensitive yet understudied region. This work also contributes to improved understanding and quantification of the effects of viewing geometry on satellite AOD retrievals, which can help constrain aerosol observations and associated forcings, globally."

However, their degradation routes are not clear. Here, we find a rapid route for the degradation of linear perfluoroaldehydes by hydroperoxy radical. The chemical processes are dominant over the corresponding oxidation processes by hydroxyl radical. The present findings are of great importance for elucidating the chemical transformation of linear perfluoroaldehydes in the atmosphere. 
 Linear perfluoroaldehydes are important products formed in the atmospheric oxidation of industrial fluorinated compounds. However, their atmospheric lifetimes are incompletely known. Here, we employ high level quantum chemistry methods and a dual-level strategy for kinetics to investigate the reactions of C2F5CHO and C3F7CHO with HO2. Our calculated results unveil almost equal activation enthalpies at 0 K for linear perfluoroaldehydes reaction with HO2, indicating that the carbon chain length negligibly influences reaction thermodynamics. The calculated kinetics reveal that vibrational anharmonicity enhances rate constants by a factor of 3–10, while torsional anharmonicity reduces rate constants by 34 %–55 %. Additionally, we also find that the reaction of C3F7CHO with HO2 exhibits significant pressure dependence, with transition pressures ranging from 0.026 to 2.3 bar across a temperature range of 190–350 K. Furthermore, atmospheric lifetimes of C2F5CHO and C3F7CHO are discussed based on the homogenous and heterogeneous processes. Our findings also reveal that the reactions of C2F5CHO and C3F7CHO with HO2 radicals dominate over those with OH radicals in Russia, Malaysia, and parts of Africa by the calculated results in combination with data based on global atmospheric chemical model simulations. Under nighttime conditions, HO2-initiated degradation represents a major atmospheric sink, comparable in magnitude to photolysis and Cl-initiated oxidation in gas phase, whereas hydrolysis at the air-water interface plays a critical role in the sink of linear perfluoroaldehydes. These findings establish chain-length-dependent pressure effects and conformational sampling as critical, previously unrecognized factors in kinetics calculations, providing a framework for modelling complex fluorotelomer transformations and guiding emission mitigation strategies."

Teixeira;Alistair Sellar;Duncan Watson-Parris;Yang Yang;Jialei Zhu;Srinath Krishnan;Annele Virtanen;Daniel G. Partridge,Towards an improved understanding of the impact of clouds and precipitation on the representation of aerosols over the Boreal Forest in GCMs,"Climate models struggle to predict how clouds and aerosols interact, affecting Earth’s energy balance. This study compares models to observations to see how they describe effects of clouds and rain on aerosols. While both models show similar overall trends, seasonal differences emerged. These, however, align with differences in key variables participating in cloud formation. The study provides insights on how to improve the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. 
 Global climate models (GCMs) face uncertainties in estimating Earth's radiative budget due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Accurate particle number size distributions (PNSDs) are crucial for improving ACI representation, requiring precise modelling of aerosol sources and sinks. Using a Lagrangian trajectory framework, we examine how clouds and precipitation influence aerosols during transport, and thereby influence aerosol–cloud relationships in the boreal forest. Two GCMs, the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1) and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0 with the SALSA2.0 aerosol module (ECHAM-SALSA), are complemented with model-derived trajectories and evaluated against in-situ observations, which are accompanied by reanalysis trajectories. Overall aerosol–precipitation trends are similar between GCMs and observations. However, seasonal differences emerge: in summer, UKESM1 exhibits more efficient aerosol removal via precipitation than ECHAM-SALSA and observations, whereas in winter, the opposite is observed. These differences coincide with key variables controlling aerosol activation, such as sub-grid scale updraught velocities and PNSDs. For example, in winter, removal of total aerosol mass in ECHAM-SALSA was stronger than in UKESM1, coinciding with higher activated fractions and larger sub-grid scale updraught velocities in ECHAM-SALSA. For both GCMs, cloud processing along trajectories increased SO4 mass, mainly in the accumulation mode, consistent with observations and model parametrizations. Discrepancies arise more from differences in PNSDs and updraught velocities than from wet removal parametrizations, an example being the underrepresentation of small particles in UKESM1. While our findings are representative of boreal region with predominantly stratiform precipitation, further work is needed to evaluate their applicability to other regions."
10.5194/acp-25-14353-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用TROPOMI卫星观测数据，通过局部集合变换卡尔曼滤波反演方法，量化了2019-2023年全球甲烷排放量，并分析了其趋势和季节性变化。研究结果表明，2020-2021年甲烷排放量激增，之后在2022-2023年有所下降，并将排放量激增主要归因于东非地区的洪水导致的湿地排放。该研究还发现，现有湿地模型低估了该地区的排放量，导致先前的一些研究错误地将非洲甲烷排放量的激增归因于牲畜。此外，该研究还探讨了不同地区甲烷排放的季节性变化，并发现美国油气田在寒冷季节的排放量较高，可能反映了泄漏增加。,"['methane emissions', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric methane', 'TROPOMI', 'wetlands', 'emission trends', 'air quality']",Drew C.

Worden,Trends and seasonality of 2019–2023 global methane emissions inferred from a localized ensemble transform Kalman filter (CHEEREIO v1.3.1) applied to TROPOMI satellite observations,"We use satellite observations of atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas, to calculate emissions from both human and natural sources. We find that methane emissions surged in 2020–2021 before declining in 2022–2023. We attribute the surge in large part to emissions from eastern Africa, which experienced large methane-generating floods. Wetland models underestimate emissions in that region, which has led some previous work to incorrectly attribute the African surge in methane emissions to livestock. 
 We use 2019–2023 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane to quantify global methane emissions at monthly 2° × 2.5° resolution with a localized ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) inversion, deriving monthly posterior estimates of emissions and year-to-year evolution. We apply two alternative wetland inventories (WetCHARTs and LPJ-wsl) as prior estimates. Our best posterior estimate of global emissions shows a surge from 560 Tg a−1 in 2019 to 587–592 Tg a−1 in 2020–2021 before declining to 572–570 Tg a−1 in 2022–2023. Posterior emissions reproduce the observed 2019–2023 trends in methane concentrations at NOAA surface sites and from TROPOMI with minimal regional bias. Consistent with previous studies, we attribute the 2020–2021 methane surge to a 14 Tg a−1 increase in emissions from sub-Saharan Africa but find that previous attribution of this surge to anthropogenic sources (livestock) reflects errors in the assumed wetland spatial distribution. Correlation with GRACE-FO inundation data suggests that wetlands in South Sudan played a major role in the 2020–2021 surge but are poorly represented in wetland models. By contrast, boreal wetland emissions decreased over 2020–2023 consistent with drying measured by GRACE-FO. We find that the global seasonality of methane emissions is driven by northern tropical wetlands and peaks in September, later than the July wetland model peak and consistent with GRACE-FO. We find no global seasonality in oil/gas emissions, but US fields show elevated cold season emissions that could reflect increased leakage."
10.5194/acp-25-14411-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了COVID-19封锁对全球21个城市PM2.5空气质量的影响。研究结合地面观测数据和全球气溶胶模型，评估了封锁期间人为排放减少对PM2.5的影响。研究结果表明，全球范围内封锁并未系统性地降低PM2.5浓度，部分地区PM2.5浓度降低与封锁政策相关，但其他地区受到气象条件、沙尘和野火等因素的影响。此外，研究还指出，目前的卫星气溶胶光学厚度遥感技术无法可靠地识别COVID-19封锁对地面PM2.5的影响。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了地面观测和卫星遥感数据来监测空气质量，并分析了大气成分的变化。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite remote sensing', 'aerosol optical depth', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'urban air quality']",Claire M.

Colarco;Hongbin Yu,Assessing COVID-19 lockdowns' impacts on global urban PM2.5 air quality with observations and modeling,"The regional lockdowns, implemented over 2020–2022 to contain the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease, inadvertently created a natural laboratory for investigating the effect of reducing anthropogenic emissions on urban air quality in unprecedentedly large temporal and spatial scales.

 The regional lockdowns, implemented around the world over 2020–2022 to contain the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), inadvertently created a natural laboratory for investigating the effect of reducing anthropogenic emissions on urban air quality at unprecedentedly large temporal and spatial scales. In this study, we analyze multi-year surface PM2.5 observations in 21 cities around the globe to examine an anomaly of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 µm) concentrations during major COVID-19 lockdowns with respect to that measured in the pre-pandemic years. We then use a set of Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) global aerosol transport modeling experiments to disentangle the effect of the lockdown emission reductions from other non-lockdown effects. Our analysis shows that no systematic reductions in PM2.5 are found in response to the lockdowns globally. In some locations, we find the coincidences of an increasing stringency index and decreasing surface PM2.5, which often lead to the record low of PM2.5 over extensive periods. These observations clearly suggest the positive impacts of COVID-19-lockdown-induced anthropogenic emission reductions on air quality. In other stations, however, the lockdowns' impacts could be masked by differing meteorology and the occurrence of dust and wildfire events. We also found that current satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth cannot be used to reliably discern the change of surface PM2.5 due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. The results of this study provide a preview of potential mixed effects on urban air quality when implementing air pollution control regulations such as transitioning from gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles."
10.5194/acp-25-14301-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了有机硫酸盐表面活性剂对气溶胶颗粒以及它们对大气中相对湿度变化的响应。研究发现，这些表面活性剂即使在非常小的量下也能显著降低表面张力，从而影响云的形成和亮度等特性。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术，但该研究通过了解气溶胶的特性（如吸湿性），间接影响我们对云的形成和性质的理解，从而影响卫星观测中云的反射率（反照率）和大气成分分析。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有一定的相关性，尤其是在理解和解释卫星观测数据方面。,"['aerosols', 'hygroscopicity', 'organosulfate surfactants', 'cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'cloud formation', 'cloud properties', 'albedo', 'atmospheric composition']",Vahid Shahabadi;Cassandra Lefort;Hoi Tang Law;Man Nin Chan;Thomas C. Preston,Surface tension and hygroscopicity analysis of aerosols containing organosulfate surfactants,"This research explores how organosulfate surfactants affect aerosol particles and their response to changes in relative humidity in the atmosphere. Using optical trapping and strong electric fields to investigate single particles, it is found that these surfactants can significantly lower surface tension, even in very small amounts. These findings are important for understanding how such particles influence cloud formation and properties like brightness. 
 Organosulfate (OS) surfactants can influence cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and hygroscopic growth by reducing the surface tension of aerosol particles. We investigate the surface tension and hygroscopicity of aerosols containing short- and long-chain OSs in supersaturated aqueous droplets using an electrodeformation method coupled with Raman spectroscopy. For droplets containing short-chain OSs, the surface tension decreases as relative humidity (RH) decreases, even under dry and highly viscous conditions. Sodium ethyl sulfate (SES) lowered surface tension to approximately 30 mN m−1, a value lower than that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at its critical micelle concentration. We also studied ternary systems containing OSs with citric acid (CA) or sodium chloride (NaCl). Even small amounts of SDS, with a molar ratio of 10−3 relative to CA, reduce surface tension by up to 40 % at low RH compared to CA alone. Despite strong surface tension reduction, ternary OS–CA–water systems show hygroscopicity nearly identical to binary CA–water systems, suggesting that surface tension does not influence water uptake under subsaturated conditions. Ternary systems containing NaCl and OS undergo efflorescence at 47 % RH, but the crystallized NaCl becomes partially engulfed. If the RH is subsequently increased, the particle takes up water. At the deliquescence point (72 % RH), the particle becomes homogeneous again. These findings improve our understanding of particle growth and cloud drop formation processes, which influence cloud properties like albedo and lifetime."

The well-mixed planetary boundary layer serves as a convenient environment for such studies, since the fluorescence backscattering coefficient should remain constant in the absence of water uptake effects. However, during some episodes, we observed a systematic decrease in fluorescence backscattering, which likely indicates fluorescence quenching. 
 This study investigates the impact of water uptake by particles during hygroscopic growth on aerosol fluorescence properties, using multiwavelength Mie–Raman–fluorescence lidar measurements conducted at the ATmospheric Observation at LiLLe (ATOLL) observatory (Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosphérique, University of Lille) between 2021 and 2024. During certain episodes, we observed a systematic height-dependent decrease in the fluorescence backscattering coefficient within the well-mixed planetary boundary layer. This phenomenon begins at relatively low relative humidity (RH ∼ 50 %) simultaneously with a decrease in the particle depolarization ratio. However, the rapid growth of the aerosol backscattering coefficient at high RH is not mirrored by the same rate of fluorescence reduction. This distinct behavior suggests a nonlinear relationship between water uptake and fluorescence suppression, likely indicating that water-induced quenching effects operate independently of bulk hygroscopic growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability to retrieve particle volume and surface area density from single-wavelength extinction coefficients during strong hygroscopic growth episodes, validated against full 3β+2α lidar measurements. The values of the conversion factors for urban aerosol and smoke at 355 and 532 nm, together with associated uncertainties, are presented."

We also show the results of its validation campaign in a challenging urban setting in Rome, showing very good agreement with two reference instruments. Having an imaging instrument rather than the currently state-of-the-art unidirectional spectrometers brings promising capability in the context of satellite product validation. 
 Elevated surface concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are associated with poor air quality, making its detection and monitoring important for human health and the environment. Existing instruments such as the TROPOMI satellite currently deliver daily global maps of NO2 tropospheric columns, and the future Sentinel-4 instrument will return hourly maps. While areas of strong concentrations (cities, large industries) can be detected in these satellite observations, their spatiotemporal resolution remains too coarse to capture local hot spots and quick variations.In the context of urban air quality monitoring, we present a new type of remote sensing instrument capable of observing spatial and temporal gradients in the NO2 field, which is not currently possible with either space instruments or from the routine operations of conventional diffraction grating and other ground-based remote sensing instruments. This novel instrument is based on an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF) located at the heart of a telecentric imaging system. The instrument acquires spectral images in the region 430–455 nm, where NO2 exhibits strong absorption features. A dense spectral sampling was commanded in order to enable the application of the DOAS (differential optical absorption spectroscopy) method in the processing of the spectra measured by each detector pixel.In March 2024, the instrument was deployed at the BAQUNIN supersite for atmospheric research, located in the center of Rome. In order to validate the NO2 camera measurements, coincident acquisitions by a MAX-DOAS and a Pandora spectrometer were performed. The results show very good agreement among the three instruments. They also illustrate the additional capabilities of the NO2 camera in observing the spatial and temporal variability of the urban NO2 field."

It combines holographic imaging with environmental sensors to measure droplet size, movement, and surrounding air conditions. The system records hologram pairs to track droplet motion. While it can be used in the lab, it is mainly designed for in-flight use to measure cloud droplets in-situ. This paper presents the instrument’s design and evaluates its performance through testing. 
 We present HoloTrack, a novel, fully autonomous measurement system designed to capture three-dimensional (3D) cloud droplet data and provide detailed insights into droplet dynamics, their spatial distribution and velocity.  The HoloTrack system integrates a high-accuracy holographic imaging system with environmental sensors, including pitot tubes for airflow measurements, and a navigation system. Designed for deployment on airborne platforms like the CloudKite and hence having a compact and autonomous design, HoloTrack is also ideally suited for deployment in laboratory or ground-based environmental research. The system records up to 25 hologram pairs per second (50 holograms per seconds with the resolution of 65 megapixels), each of which provides two independent measurements of droplet position, size, and shape and measures individual droplet velocities. With laboratory tests we confirmed, that the holographic system reliably detects particles down to 10 µm, within a sample volume of 17 cm3 (1.84 cm × 1.84 cm × 5 cm) of each hologram. For a recorded hologram pair with mean displacement of 0.5 cm caused by e.g. an inter-frame time of 500 µs and a mean velocity of 10 m s−1, this results in 21.5 cm3 combined volume, where particle position and size is sampled and 12.3 cm3 overlapping volume where the two-frame particle velocimetry can be applied to resolve individual droplet velocities. Reliable sub-volumes for measuring droplets at different yaw angles, to account for the influence of the instrument body are further defined. The droplet velocity in longitudinal and vertical direction is measured with errors of less than 0.07 m s−1 for inter-frame times of 500 µs. The transverse velocity is less accurate with errors in the range of 0.1–0.5 m s−1, depending on the position of the particles in the sample volume. Nevertheless, the flexible timing allows the adjustment to different displacements to optimize the overlapping volume and 3D velocity uncertainties according to the needs of the experiment. A series of laboratory tests and a maiden flight tests validated the system's capabilities, characterizing the detection, robustness, automation and its ability to measure droplet dynamics. HoloTrack's unique combination of holographic particle measurements including capturing their velocities makes it a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of cloud microphysics, including droplet spatial distribution, collision-coalescence, entrainment, and turbulent mixing processes."

It includes detailed catchment attributes and represents diverse hydrological regimes. This open-access resource enables model evaluation and international comparisons and helps fill a key regional gap in global hydrological data. 
 We present the first large-sample catchment hydrology dataset for Aotearoa New Zealand with hourly time series: the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies – New Zealand (CAMELS-NZ). This dataset provides hourly hydrometeorological time series and comprehensive landscape attributes for 369 catchments across New Zealand, ranging from 1972 to 2024. Hourly records include streamflow, precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and potential evapotranspiration, with more than 65 % of streamflow records exceeding 40 years in length. CAMELS-NZ offers a rich set of static catchment attributes that quantify physical characteristics such as land cover, soil properties, geology, topography, and human impacts, including information on abstractions, dams, groundwater, or snowmelt influences, as well as on ephemeral rivers. New Zealand's remarkable gradients in climate, topography, and geology give rise to diverse hydroclimatic landscapes and hydrological behaviours, making CAMELS-NZ a unique contribution to large-scale hydrological studies. Furthermore, New Zealand's hydrology is defined by highly permeable volcanic catchments, sediment-rich alpine rivers with glacial contributions, and steep, rainfall-driven fast-rising rivers, providing opportunities to study diverse hydrological processes and rapid hydrological responses. CAMELS-NZ adheres to the standards established by most previously published CAMELS datasets, enabling international comparison studies. The dataset fills a critical gap in global hydrology by representing a Pacific Island environment with complex hydrological processes. This dataset supports a wide range of hydrological research applications, including model development and climate impact assessments, predictions in ungauged basins, and large-sample comparative studies. The open-access nature of CAMELS-NZ ensures broad usability across multiple research domains, providing a foundation for national water resource and flood management, as well as international hydrological research. By integrating long-term high-resolution data with diverse catchment attributes, we hope that CAMELS-NZ will enable innovative research into New Zealand's hydrological systems while contributing to the global initiative to create freely available large-sample datasets for the hydrological community.

 Formerly known as one of the most polluted regions of the globe, East Asia underwent a dramatic improvement of air quality, especially for aerosols, starting in the 2010s. Numerous satellites have observed East Asia for a long time duration, but often with a low spatial or temporal resolution, limiting their ability to capture small-scale variabilities or provide continuous observations of long-range transport of aerosols. In this study, we provide an hourly aerosol optical property (AOP) dataset retrieved from the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), with a high spatial resolution of 2 km at nadir, covering the entire operational period from March 2011–March 2021. The dataset is retrieved using the Yonsei Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm, providing aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm as the primary product, along with fine mode fraction, single scattering albedo, Ångström exponent, and aerosol type as ancillary products. Seasonal validation of AOD against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) showed that the fraction of data points within the expected error range of 0.05+15 % varied from 56.4 % in June–July–August to 64.5 % in September–October–November, with the mean bias generally within ±0.05. Compared to the operational version, the high-resolution product demonstrated improved retrieval capability in the presence of broken clouds, along complex coastlines, and in capturing AOD variability at the sub-district level. The decadal AOD exhibited a decreasing trend over four major cities within the observation domain. We expect this data to be widely used in climate modelling, reanalysis, atmospheric chemistry, marine optics, environmental health studies, variability and trend analysis, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between climate change, trace gases, human health, and AOPs.

Using satellite and street view imagery, we created an operational way to identify crop types and field boundaries without in-person surveys. This novel dataset provides reliable crop type ground truth with delineated field boundaries that can support large-scale crop monitoring and decision-making. The dataset can be accessed via: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15702415. 
 Accurate and scalable crop type maps are vital for supporting food security, as they provide critical information on the specific crops cultivated in a given area to inform agricultural decision-making and enhance crop productivity. The generation of these maps depends on high-quality crop type ground truth data, which are essential for developing remote sensing–based crop type classification models applicable across varying spatial and temporal contexts. Yet existing crop type ground truth datasets often focus on specific crop types of limited spatial and temporal ranges, constrained by the high cost and labor intensity of traditional field surveys. This limitation hinders their applicability to large-scale and multi-year applications, such as nationwide crop monitoring and long-term yield forecasting. Additionally, most existing crop type ground truth datasets contain only pixel-level labels without explicit field boundaries, impeding the extraction of field-level texture and structure information needed for accurate crop type mapping in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Collectively, these limitations hinder the development of scalable crop type mapping workflows and reduce the precision and reliability of resulting crop type maps for agricultural monitoring and decision support. In this study, we introduce CropSight-US, the first national scale, object-based crop type ground truth dataset for the contiguous United States (CONUS). This dataset spans the years 2013 to 2023 and includes over 100,000 crop type ground truth objects across 17 major crops and 294 Agricultural Statistics Districts, offering broad spatial and temporal coverage and high representativeness at field level. Each crop type ground truth object is accompanied by an uncertainty score that quantifies the confidence in its crop type identification, enabling users to filter or weight samples according to their specific reliability requirements. The crop type ground truthing framework of CropSight-US innovatively integrates crop labels derived from Google Street View imagery with field boundaries delineated from Sentinel-2 imagery to produce object-based crop type ground truth data. This scalable framework offers a valuable alternative to traditional field surveys by replacing in-person observations with virtual audits, significantly improving the efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of ground truth data collection. This framework achieves 97.2 % overall accuracy in crop type identification and 98.0 % F1 score in cropland field boundary delineation using the reference dataset. By delivering high-resolution, standardized, and reproducible reference data, CropSight-US establishes a new benchmark for crop type ground truthing and supports more informed agricultural research, monitoring, and decision-making.

We introduce a lightweight approach that applies variable NOx/NO2 ratios and piecewise fitting based on the directional derivative framework (DDA) to estimate regional and point-source NOx emissions.

 An appropriate representation of the NOx/NO2 ratio and NOx lifetime is essential for estimating NOx emissions from satellite NO2 observations. We introduce a satellite-based, data-driven approach that applies variable NOx/NO2 ratio and derives a nonlinear chemical lifetime using a piecewise fitting method based on the directional derivative approach (DDA). This method enables the estimation of both regional and point-source NOx emissions across China, representing the first application of a lightweight, satellite-driven method to directly capture nonlinear NOx lifetime for emission estimation over large, topographically complex region. The incorporation of a variable NOx/NO2 ratio enhances the accuracy of source divergence and emission estimates and the improved fitting scheme captures the nonlinear behavior of NOx chemistry. Anthropogenic contributions are isolated by subtracting natural sources from satellite-derived total emissions, with natural NOx identified using a seasonal criterion and further constrained by Nighttime Light (NTL) data. Estimated anthropogenic NOx emissions in China from 2019 to 2024 are 20.2 Tg, 18.5 Tg, 19.4 Tg, 18.9 Tg, 20.7 Tg and 18.8 Tg, respectively, with annual uncertainties of 27 %–30 %. These values show good agreement with both bottom-up inventories and top-down inversions, with national scale discrepancies ranging from −11.8 % to 0.8 %. The DDA captures key spatial and temporal emission patterns, including consistent decline in NOx emissions in megacities and provincial disparities linked to urbanization and economic development. The DDA estimates are consistent with previous studies on coal-fired power plant emissions, and emissions from 124 plants vary between 0.02–2.13 kg s−1 for 2019–2024, with uncertainties spanning 4 %–78 %, averaging 16 %. This satellite-based, lightweight method enables low-latency, timely long-term monitoring of NOx emissions and offers a promising alternative to bottom-up inventories and resource-intensive top-down models.

Comparison of the CO column with independent measurements shows a systematic low bias in biomass burning CO emissions without assimilation. 
 This paper describes a new version of the Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) which uses National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC) coupling to combine the RAQMS chemical mechanism with the Global Ensemble Forecasting System with Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols), the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model (GOCART) aerosol mechanism, and NOAA's Unified Forecast System (UFS) version 9.1 Finite Volume Cubed Sphere (FV3) dynamical core. We also present an application of TROPOMI CO column data assimilation in UFS-RAQMS with the NOAA Grid Point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) analysis system to constrain UFS-RAQMS CO. We validate UFS-RAQMS control and TROPOMI CO data assimilation CO analyses for the period 15 July–30 September 2019 against independent satellite, ground-based, and airborne observations. We show that the largest impacts of the TROPOMI CO data assimilation are in the lower troposphere over Siberia and Indonesia. We find that UFS-RAQMS biomass burning signatures in CO column are not consistent with those in aerosol optical depth (AOD) near the Siberian and Indonesian biomass burning source regions within our control experiment. Assimilation of TROPOMI CO improves the representation of the biomass burning AOD/CO relationship in UFS-RAQMS by increasing the CO column, which suggests that the biomass burning CO emissions from the Blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product (GBBEPx) used in UFS-RAQMS are too low for boreal wildfires."

This provides an efficient way to track all the model's rain and snow back to the average location of the evaporative source, as shown in a present-day simulation. The new scheme can be used in simulations of the future to predict how sources of regional rain or snowfall might change owing to human actions, providing useful information for water management purposes. 
 There is an increasing need to understand how water is cycled and transported within the atmosphere, to aid water management. Here, atmospheric water tracers are added to the Met Office Unified Model (UM) to allow tracking of water within the model. This requires the implementation of water tracers in the following parts of the model code: large-scale advection, surface evaporation, boundary layer mixing, large-scale precipitation (microphysics), large-scale clouds, stochastic physics, and convection. A single water tracer is found to track all water in the model to a high degree of accuracy during a 35 year simulation; the differences are typically less than 10−16 kg kg−1 at the end of every time step, prior to a very small adjustment to prevent the build up of numerical error. The increase in computing time for each water tracer is between 3.1 % and 3.8 %, depending on the model resolution. The model development is tested by using the water tracers to find the sources of precipitation in a historical UM simulation. As expected, the majority of precipitation is found to be sourced directly from the ocean, with the recycling of water over land becoming increasingly important downwind across continents. The UM results for the mean evaporative source properties of precipitation are comparable to those of the ECHAM6 atmospheric model, with some interesting local differences over Antarctica, Greenland, and the Indian monsoon region. Finally, global model hydrological fluxes are derived from the water tracers to show the amount of precipitation sourced from the land and ocean separately, illustrating the additional information that can be provided from the new development."

As the northern terminus of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), it thus both affects, and is affected by, the Atlantic MOC. Here we quantify the magnitudes of the two overturning cells in density space, and then decompose the water mass transformation rates into net pan‐Arctic contributions from surface forcing and diapycnal mixing. We use a high‐resolution, quasi‐synoptic ice and ocean hydrographic data set spanning the four main Arctic Ocean gateways—Fram, Davis and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening. Two surface flux reanalyses and a hydrographic climatology are used to generate estimates of surface water mass transformation rates by density class. A box model then determines the profiles of turbulent mixing transformation rates, and associated turbulent diffusivities. We show that turbulent mixing and surface forcing drive transformations of similar magnitudes, while mixing dominates in the upper cell and surface fluxes in the lower cell. Consideration of uncertainties and timescales leads to the tentative suggestion that our results might be representative of recent decades. We discuss the possible significance of tides and sea ice brine rejection as energy sources driving turbulent mixing. Finally, we speculate as to whether water mass transformation rates may change in future as ocean heat transport into the Arctic increases. As sea ice declines and the efficiency of atmosphere‐to‐ocean momentum transfer increases, the Arctic Ocean is expected to “spin up,” causing more intense turbulent mixing, with uncertain consequences."

Results show that the Northern Hemisphere experiences a wetter land‐atmosphere system (62.3%) following deforestation, with increased SM and decreased VPD.

As aridity increases, vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity and self‐organizes into heterogeneous vegetation patterns, a step before a catastrophic shift to bare soil. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities in time or space are crucial to understand these phenomena. Using a unified mathematical model and incorporating environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation patterns create a hysteresis loop as the mortality level changes. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass that forms self‐organized hexagonal‐like patterns. However, when the mortality trend is reversed, one observes a branch with low biomass and no periodicity, where vegetation spots form disordered clusters instead of a hexagonal lattice. This behavior is supported by remote sensing and field observations and can be linked to climate change in arid ecosystems."

By training on Cenozoic basalts, our machine learning achieves a high accuracy of global test sets spanning Phanerozoic to late Proterozoic, proving both its spatial and temporal effectiveness.

The transition between these seasons is driven by an increase in atmospheric baroclinicity. During this transition, the likelihood of both strong wind events and significant precipitation increases. This transition typically coincides with a minimum in regional fuel moisture, a time of high risk for severe fire weather. Therefore, when strong winds occur before significant precipitation, large wildfires can occur. While it is well understood that warming is increasing evaporative demand and lowering fuel moisture across the region, less is known about changes to the timing of precipitation and wind. Toward addressing this gap, we use 11 regional climate models to assess projected changes to the timing of the first significant precipitation and the first strong wind events across the MWUS. Historical model simulations reproduce the broad spatial and seasonal patterns of rain and wind onset. The models project that by the end of the century under an aggressive but plausible warming scenario, the average date of the first strong wind will occur later in the year across most of California and some of the Pacific Northwest. A majority of models also project a later rain onset over the Pacific Northwest, but this shift is generally smaller than wind, and models disagree on significance. Models project a slight decrease in the likelihood that wind onset precedes rain onset but disagree on significance and sign of change."

This study reveals how midlatitude dynamics triggered this unusual event. Using reanalysis, we perform a moisture budget analysis and local wave activity (LWA) diagnostics and find that the enhanced mid‐tropospheric baroclinic instability >1.1day−1 ${ >} 1.1\ \mathrm{d}\mathrm{a}{\mathrm{y}}^{-1}$ (1.34σ) $(1.34\sigma )$ peaked during 13–17 August in the North Atlantic, 7–10 days before the NWI rainfall event. This instability fueled the North Atlantic westerly jet and reinforced a “Ω ${\Omega }$” shaped blocking high over the Ural Mountains (“Ural block”) that developed over 21–22 August. This block initiated a wave train that propagated eastward with increasing amplitude over subsequent days. The downstream distorted Rossby waves broke, triggering a pronounced Caspian Sea trough that deepened by 25–26 August, strengthening a subtropical jet streak north of the Tibetan Plateau, with maximum geostrophic wind speeds exceeding 120 ms−1 $\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$. The NWI was in the jet streak's right entrance region, where the upper‐level divergence and compensatory upward motion intensified a low‐pressure system that had been steered northwestward into the region. Despite monsoon break conditions, the elevated mid‐tropospheric humidity allowed sustained deep convection, which combined with the quasigeostrophic ascent arising from the jet streak entrance region and led to extreme rainfall over NWI. Our analysis provides a case study showing the importance of the growing influence of mid‐latitude circulation changes traceable to alterations in the North Atlantic for Indian monsoon variability. The physical linkages demonstrated here may be crucial for improving monsoon behavior in changing climate."

However, precipitation anomalies during different stages of MHWs remain insufficiently explored. This study investigates the relationship between MHWs and precipitation using observations and reanalysis data from 2002 to 2021. Based on precipitation anomalies before and after the peak intensity of MHWs, four distinct MHW types are identified. Globally, the most common type exhibits negative precipitation anomalies during both the 5 days preceding (early stage) and following (late stage) the MHW peak (NN type, ∼46%), followed by events with negative anomalies in the early stage and positive anomalies in the late stage (NP type, ∼26%). On average, precipitation anomalies are negative in the early stage and positive in the late stage globally, except in the central equatorial Pacific. The MHW‐associated global mean precipitation anomalies change from −1.69 mm/day (early) to 2.82 mm/day (late), indicating that NP MHWs have a more pronounced influence on precipitation anomalies. To further elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms, the MHWs in the South China Sea (SCS) during the boreal summer is examined. Compared with NN MHWs, NP MHWs over the SCS are characterized by warmer sea surface temperature in the early stage, which enhances evaporation and water vapor convergence. This results in higher moist static energy (MSE), primarily driven by moisture contributions. The elevated MSE in the early stage promotes increased precipitation in the late stage, which in turn accelerates the decay of MHWs."

A direct numerical simulation model is initialized with different CDSDs to fill the gap. These results show that d decreases for broad CDSDs and increases for narrow ones, ultimately converging to approximately 0.5 regardless of initial CDSDs during the evaporation‐dominated mixing stage. The supersaturation fluctuation and the shape of CDSDs jointly influence the convergence behavior of d. Further sensitivity tests show that the initial microphysical/dynamical/thermodynamical conditions exert negligible effects on the final converged value of d but affect the convergence rate (k). The k generally increases with increasing droplet number concentration and dissipation rate, and increases with decreasing liquid water content, relative humidity of entrained air, and mixing fraction of cloudy air. A conceptual model with two timescales is proposed; k and the timescales are negatively correlated, meaning that slow mixing and/or evaporation process results in slow convergence of d.

This study aims to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms behind Iberian ARs and to quantify their contribution to precipitation over a long‐term period. We identify ARs affecting the IP in the ERA5 reanalysis with a 31‐km horizontal resolution and covering a 42‐year period (1979–2020). Additionally, we explore their association with the fronts of extratropical cyclones. Impact on IP precipitation is evaluated using regional observational gridded products (E‐OBS, IB01) and global reanalysis (ERA5). Three AR events (unnamed storm in October 1979, Storm Gong in January 2013, and Storm Ana in December 2017) were selected as case studies and analyzed in detail. During 1979–2020, the IP was affected by 580 persistent ARs (lasting at least 18 hr) with an annual mean of 13.8 ± 2.8 ARs and the northern IP coast being the most affected region. The year 2013 is marked by the highest total number of persistent ARs (20). Cold fronts were found more often in the vicinity of ARs than warm fronts. Case studies highlight changes in the relationship between ARs and fronts throughout their lifecycle. Precipitation associated with persistent ARs exhibits a strong north‐south gradient in the western IP with the highest contribution to annual precipitation occurring in the northern region (∼30%).

In this study, we reconstructed East Asia climate from fossil pollen using the biomization method and modern analog technique. The results show significant spatial variations in paleoclimate: warming dominates the Tibetan Plateau, whereas cooling is observed over northwestern and eastern monsoonal regions. In contrast, Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project multi‐model ensemble simulations show widespread warming across East Asia, indicating significant model‐data discrepancies in the northwest and eastern monsoon domains. To explore the underlying causes, we apply an energy balance decomposition to the simulated surface temperatures. We find region‐specific physical mechanisms: warming over the Tibetan Plateau is mainly driven by enhanced clear‐sky downward longwave radiation and vegetation‐induced surface albedo reduction; cooling in the northwest is linked to increased precipitation suppressing sensible heat flux; whereas, in the eastern monsoon region, cooling is driven either by the combined effects of cloud radiative forcing and latent heat flux changes due to increased precipitation or by reduced clear‐sky shortwave radiation independent of surface albedo feedback. These findings highlight the spatially non‐uniform climate responses across East Asia and underscore the critical roles of distinct physical processes in shaping regional climate, offering new perspectives to bridge model‐proxy gaps."

We combine top‐down and bottom‐up approaches to evaluate the N2O and CH4 emission inventory for Rotterdam based on high‐precision measurements made using an aircraft and a mobile vehicle. We divided the Rotterdam area into two sub‐areas: (a) west industrial area (WIA) and (b) Rotterdam urban area (RUA). For the top‐down estimate, the total emissions from Rotterdam are calculated as the sum of quantified emissions from both the WIA and the RUA based on aircraft observations. We further quantified emissions from key source categories including Wastewater Treatment Plants, Traffic and Transportation, Chemical Industry, Energy, and Refineries based on mobile vehicle and aircraft measurements. These measurements revealed that N2O and CH4 emissions were 2–4 and 4–16 times higher than inventory estimates, respectively. We revised the inventory after which the discrepancy between top‐down estimates and Rotterdam's emission inventory decreased from approximately a factor of 4 to about 2 for N2O, whereas CH4 emissions between top‐down and inventory showed no significant difference within the uncertainty. The persistent gap between top‐down and bottom‐up estimates implies the underestimation of N2O emissions from other sources (such as sewerage and landfills) and/or the existence of missing sources that are not fully accounted for in the inventory. Our findings highlight the need for further comprehensive quantification across additional source categories and temporal scales."

Yet projected changes in Meiyu rainfall and its coupling with ARs remain uncertain. This study utilizes the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 models under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2–4.5 (SSP245) and 5–8.5 (SSP585) scenarios to analyze four land regions with substantial Meiyu rainfall: Korean Peninsula (KR), South Japan (JP), lower Yangtze River basin (LYRB), and South China coast with Taiwan Island (SCTW). Under both scenarios, mean and extreme Meiyu precipitation increase with marked regional variations. Specifically, under the SSP585 scenario, SCTW experiences the largest increase (>40%), while JP exhibits the weakest amplification in Meiyu rainfall by the end of this century. The frequency of hazardous rainfall events is anticipated to increase substantially, particularly over KR and SCTW. AR landfalls are projected to intensify by approximately 70% over KR and LYRB and to nearly double over SCTW, with a smaller increase over JP, leading to an enhancement in the local AR‐related wet‐day and extreme precipitation frequency, while the efficiency of AR precipitation may reduce. Attribution analyses suggest thermodynamic moistening (vertical moisture term) broadly dominates precipitation increases, partly offset (strengthened) by the vertical circulation effect in the LYRB and JP (KR and SCTW). These findings underscore the challenges of climate risk management under global warming, and the mitigation (SSP245) scenario markedly reduces intensification and risk, highlighting the urgent need for climate protection measures in East Asia."

 Understanding and predicting marine-terminating glacier instability presents one of the greatest challenges to forecasting future sea level rise. An extreme case of such instability is the Hektoria Glacier on the Eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which retreated ~25 km between January 2022 and March 2023. Here we investigate the dynamics and drivers of this retreat event primarily from analysis of geophysical data and satellite imagery. We find that retreat commenced immediately after the loss of decade-old fast ice in the Larsen B embayment and was associated with an almost 6-fold increase in flow speed and 40-fold increase in glacier thinning, relative to the period immediately before the fast ice loss. We also find that in November–December 2022, the glacier retreated a total of 8.2 ± 0.2 km in two months—a retreat rate nearly an order of magnitude faster than published values—and began with a transition from tabular iceberg calving to buoyancy-driven calving on an ice plain, a flat area where the glacier was only lightly grounded. Hence we conclude that in this case, retreat primarily resulted from an ice plain calving process, rather than atmospheric or oceanic conditions as suggested previously. This implies that marine-terminating glaciers with ice plain bed geometry can be easily destabilized.

 High-temperature afterglow organic amorphous materials expand the operational temperature beyond traditional room-temperature phosphorescent materials, broadening their potential applications. However, achieving tunable high-temperature afterglow from a single luminescent molecule remains a formidable challenge. Here, we employ host-guest anchoring coupled with single-bond rotors to achieve effective phosphorescence and tunable afterglow at high temperature simultaneously. The material demonstrates a wavelength-tunable afterglow: during heating (298 K to 473 K), the chromaticity coordinate shifts from (0.24, 0.47) to (0.18, 0.20) and the lifetime from 836 ms to 6.34 ms. The theoretical investigations reveal that the excited-state conformation of phosphors undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation, inducing the wavelength-tunable high-temperature afterglow phenomenon. This work offers a strategy for designing tunable high-temperature afterglow-emitting amorphous polymers, advancing the development of organic phosphorescent materials capable of delivering tunable high-temperature afterglow emissions. ‘High temperature afterglow materials are of interest, though designing luminescent single molecules is a challenge.

Chiral polymer films are presented with state-of-the-art Verdet constants, revealing the role of chirality, and a strategy to enhance the magnetooptical B term. 
 Connections between magnetic field induced optical activity and chirality have a rich and complicated history. Although the broken inversion symmetry of chiral molecules generates ‘natural’ optical activity, magnetic optical activity is generated by breaking time reversal symmetry. Therefore, molecular chirality is not expected to influence magnetic optical phenomena, such as Faraday rotation. Here we show that the chiral supramolecular assembly of polymers can result in large Faraday effects (Verdet constants = 105 °T–1m–1). This strong Faraday rotation, which is amongst the highest value known for organic materials, originates from the so-called Faraday B term. Typically, B term Faraday responses are weak. We demonstrate large amplification through excitonic coupling within the supramolecular assembly, where the chirality of the system controls the assembly formed. These observations provide an alternative means to enhance the Faraday rotation of low symmetry systems and clarify the role of chirality in previous reported materials. The relation between magnetooptical activity and chirality has previously been confused. Chiral polymer films are presented with state-of-the-art Verdet constants, revealing the role of chirality, and a strategy to enhance the magnetooptical B term."

This study found that thorax acceleration during non-flight vibrations peaks at 25 °C for these bumblebees, while vibration frequency continues to increase with temperature. 
 Increasing temperature beyond a species’ optimum is a major threat to insect biodiversity, particularly in rapidly warming regions such as the Arctic. For cold-adapted pollinators, high temperatures can disrupt physiology and ecosystem services, threatening pollinator populations and plant reproduction. In bumblebees, increased temperature disrupts the physiology of the indirect flight muscles. However, these muscles, which generate the bee’s charismatic buzz, also facilitate key non-flight behaviours including communication, defence, and buzz-pollination, where temperature effects remain unexplored. Here, we assess the thermal performance of non-flight muscle function across 15 Arctic bumblebee species by measuring thorax vibrations during defensive buzzing behaviour. Thorax acceleration is found to peak at an air temperature of 25 °C, declining after this peak as a potential strategy to prevent overheating. Conversely, vibration frequency continues to increase with temperature, and is better explained by thorax temperature than air temperature. Surprisingly, there are no differences in thermal response across species, castes, or temperature habitat specialisations, indicating that non-flight vibrations are similarly susceptible to unfavourable temperatures across bumblebee species. If such findings translate to non-flight buzzing in other contexts, such as buzz-pollination, changes in buzzes have the potential to disrupt key plant-pollinator interactions.

 α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH), and its expression in CD4 + T-cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T-cell metabolism and function is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T-cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using murine models of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T-cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo in female mice. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T-cell-mediated inflammation. α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase, and its expression in CD4 + T-cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis.

 Standard episodic patient monitoring of vital signs on the medical-surgical wards can potentially miss changes in health status and delay recognition of risk. To reduce these delays, we develop a clinical wearable-based deep learning model, using 9 inputs, comprised of continuous vital signs and demographics, to identify the onset of deterioration early and accurately. Using validated data from 888 adult non-intensive care unit inpatient visits with 135 outcomes, from two different clinical grade wearables, we train a recurrent neural network to predict clinical alerts and adverse clinical outcomes in the subsequent 24 hours. Our continuous clinical alert model is able to predict both clinical alerts (Area under both the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve 0.89 + /− 0.3, Precision Recall curve 0.58 + /− 0.14) and adverse clinical outcomes (accuracy: 81.8% on 11 events) up to 17 hours in advance. Our wearable based continuous clinical alert system outperforms episodic clinical support tools in detecting deterioration, retains its performance when tested on data from a different clinical wearable than the one it was trained on and can produce alerts ahead of a broad class of adverse clinical outcomes, enabling timely interventions that can avert preventable deteriorations and reduce hospital costs.

 SARS-CoV-2 NSP14, an N7-guanosine methyltransferase, plays a critical role in viral RNA capping, enabling viral replication and immune evasion. While NSP14 has emerged as a promising drug target, its role in host-virus crosstalk and the cellular consequences of NSP14 inhibition remain poorly understood. Here, we present the identification and characterization of C10, a highly potent and selective non-nucleoside inhibitor of the NSP14 S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding pocket. C10 demonstrates robust antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, with EC50 values ranging from 64.03 to 301.9 nM, comparable to the FDA-approved drug remdesivir in our cell-based assays. C10 also exhibits broad-spectrum activity against other betacoronaviruses and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 at the replication stage. C10 suppresses viral translation and exhibits immunostimulatory effect. Additionally, C10 specifically reverses NSP14-mediated alterations in host transcriptome. The antiviral efficacy of C10 is further validated in a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight C10 as a promising candidate for the development of effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. This study also uncovers a novel mechanism of NSP14 in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its therapeutic potential, providing insights that may extend to other viral capping methyltransferases.

 Ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) is a proximity labeling enzyme used for subcellular proteomics at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, toxicity of its substrate hydrogen peroxide and background labeling by endogenous peroxidases limit its use to in vitro studies of specific cell types. To minimize toxicity and reduce non-specific background labeling we establish a more versatile in situ APEX activation (iAPEX) workflow by combining APEX2 with a D-amino acid oxidase to locally produce hydrogen peroxide. Using iAPEX, we profile the proteomes of a cellular microdomain, the primary cilium, in cell lines not readily accessible to conventional APEX labeling and identify unknown ciliary proteins. Our study validates common ciliary proteins across two distinct cell lines, while observed differences may reflect heterogeneity in primary cilia proteomes. Furthermore, iAPEX proximity labeling is applicable to a range of cellular compartments including mitochondria and lipid droplets and can be employed in Xenopus laevis, which provides a proof-of-concept for future in vivo applications.

 Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising decarbonization solution for aviation, but its adoption remains below 1% due to high cost. As municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to grow and sustainable disposal remains challenging, converting MSW into SAF offers an attractive pathway to align the goals of zero-waste cities and carbon-neutral aviation, given its reliable availability, low emissions and low cost. Here we evaluate MSW as feedstock for SAF production via industrial-scale gasification and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis data. The life cycle assessment indicates that MSW-based SAF can reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 80–90% compared with conventional jet fuel, with gasification being the primary technical challenge. Incorporating green hydrogen further enhances mitigation, reducing emissions by up to 50% and enabling a reduction of over 170 kg of CO2 per tonne of processed MSW. Globally, MSW-based SAF production could exceed 50 Mt yr−1 (62.5 billion litres), offering a 16% reduction in aviation greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, the estimated 5.4 Mt yr−1 SAF capacity from this study exceeds the European Union blending mandate and complies with its restriction to non-food and feed feedstocks.

 The western North Pacific anomalous anticyclone (WNPAC) is a key atmospheric circulation system that significantly influences East Asian climate variability. Its formation and persistence result from complex interactions among the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations, this study examines projected changes in WNPAC under anthropogenic warming and quantifies the seasonal contributions from the three tropical oceans. The results show a clear intensification of WNPAC in winter, spring, and summer, primarily driven by enhanced Atlantic and Pacific forcing. The Atlantic’s influence intensifies through enhanced equatorial wave activity and the development of quasi-stationary Rossby wave trains, most prominent in winter and spring. During summer, equatorial Rossby wave mechanisms dominate. The Pacific’s strongest influence emerges in summer, linked to intensified easterly winds over the western Pacific, associated with enhanced sea surface temperature gradients between the Indo-Pacific warm pool and the central-western Pacific. The Indian Ocean shows comparatively weaker changes across all seasons. These findings provide a quantitative assessment of the evolving three-ocean influence on WNPAC and underscore the increasing roles of Atlantic and Pacific variability in shaping East Asian climate under future greenhouse gas emissions."

 Enhanced rock weathering aims at capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide as inorganic carbon, while potentially stabilizing soil organic carbon. However, the role of soil biota in this process remains underexplored. Earthworms, being key soil engineers, may impact carbon dynamics both when alive, through mineral ingestion and casting activities, and when dead, through microbial processes. Using stable isotope tracing, we investigate how live and dead earthworms affect carbon dynamics during rock weathering. We demonstrate that both living and dead earthworms contributed to carbon capture, albeit through distinct pathways. Live earthworms enhanced the formation of organo-mineral associations via their dejections over time, promoting organic carbon persistence. Dead earthworms boosted microbial abundance and activity, enhancing organo-mineral associations and atmospheric-derived inorganic carbon capture between 60 and 120 days. We show that earthworms influence carbon cycling beyond their lifespan, with contrasting physico-chemical and biological pathways driving carbon capture through rock weathering throughout their life cycle.
