The various sources responded differently to the changes in emissions associated with COVID-19 lockdowns, and the reasons are investigated. While traffic emissions generally decreased, particles formed from reactions of atmospheric gases decreased in some cities but increased in others. 
 Lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to the curtailment of many activities and reduced emissions of primary air pollutants. Here, we applied positive matrix factorisation  to particle size distribution (PSD) data from six monitoring sites (three urban background and three roadside) between four European cities (Helsinki, Leipzig, Budapest, and London) to evaluate how particle number concentrations (PNCs) and their sources changed during the respective 2020 lockdown periods compared to the reference years 2014–2019. A number of common factors were resolved between sites, including nucleation, road traffic semi-volatile fraction (road trafficsvf), road traffic solid fraction (road trafficsf), diffuse urban (wood smoke + aged traffic), ozone-associated secondary aerosol (O3-associated SA), and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA). Nucleation, road traffic, and diffuse urban factors were the largest contributors to mean PNCs during the reference years and respective lockdown periods. However, SIA factors were the largest contributors to particle mass concentrations, irrespective of environment type. Total mean PNCs were lower at two of the urban-background and all roadside sites during lockdown. The response of nucleation and road trafficsvf factors to lockdown restrictions was highly variable, although road trafficsf factors were consistently lower at roadside sites. The responses of diffuse urban factors were largely consistent and were mostly lower at urban-background sites. Secondary aerosols (O3-associated SA and SIA) exhibited extensive reductions in their mean PNCs at all sites. These variegated responses to lockdowns across Europe point to a complex network of sources and aerosol sinks contributing to PSDs.",Alex Rowell;James Brean;David C. S.

We use observations and model simulations of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption plume to examine aerosol–cloud interactions in September 2014. We find a shift to clouds with smaller, more numerous cloud droplets in the first 2 weeks of the eruption. In the third week, the background meteorology and previous conditions experienced by air masses modulate the aerosol perturbation to clouds. 
 Aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) has persisted as the most uncertain aspect of anthropogenic forcing over the industrial period, limiting our ability to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity and to confidently predict 21st century climate change. Aerosol–cloud interactions are the most uncertain component of aerosol ERF. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption acted as a large source of sulfur dioxide, providing an opportunistic experiment for studying aerosol–cloud interactions at a climatically relevant scale. We evaluate the observed aerosol-induced perturbation to marine liquid cloud properties inside the volcanic plume in the first month of the eruption and compare the results to those from UKESM1 (UK Earth System Model). In the first 2 weeks, as expected, we find an in-plume shift to smaller and more numerous cloud droplets in both the observations and the simulations. We find an observed increase in liquid water path (LWP) values inside the plume that is not captured in UKESM1. However, in the third week, the in-plume shift to smaller and more numerous cloud droplets is neither observed nor modelled, and there are discrepancies between the observed and modelled response in the fourth week. An analysis of the model simulations and trajectory modelling reveals that air mass history and background meteorological factors can strongly influence aerosol–cloud interactions between the weeks of our analysis. Overall, our study supports the findings of many previous studies: the aerosol impact on cloud effective radius is significant, with differences in the observed and modelled response for in-cloud LWP.",Amy H.

These models are needed for the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) on the next generation of European polar-orbiting weather satellites, which measures at frequencies up to 664 GHz. Both models can provide a good match to measurements from airborne radiometers and are sufficiently accurate for use with ICI. 
 Accurate gas absorption models at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths are required to make best use of observations from instruments on board the next generation of EUMETSAT polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI), which measures at frequencies up to 664 GHz. In this study, airborne observations of clear-sky scenes between 89 and 664 GHz are used to perform radiative closure calculations for both upward- and downward-looking viewing directions in order to evaluate two state-of-the-art absorption models, both of which are integrated into the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS). Differences of 20 K are seen in some individual comparisons, with the largest discrepancies occurring where the brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the atmospheric water vapour profile. However, these differences are within the expected uncertainty due to the observed water vapour variability, highlighting the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of water vapour when performing such comparisons. The errors can be significantly reduced by averaging across multiple flights, which reduces the impact of uncertainties in individual atmospheric profiles. For upward-looking views, which have the greatest sensitivity to the absorption model, the mean differences between observed and simulated brightness temperatures are generally close to, or within, the estimated spectroscopic uncertainty. For downward-looking views, which more closely match the satellite viewing geometry, the mean differences were generally less than 1.5 K, with the exception of window channels at 89 and 157 GHz, which are significantly influenced by surface properties. These results suggest that both of the absorption models considered are sufficiently accurate for use with ICI.",Stuart Fox;Vinia Mattioli;Emma Turner;Alan Vance;Domenico Cimini;Donatello Gallucci,这篇论文研究了在毫米波和亚毫米波波段大气吸收模型的评估，并使用机载观测数据对两种模型进行了验证。这些模型对于下一代欧洲极地轨道气象卫星上的冰云成像仪（ICI）至关重要，该仪器在高达 664 GHz 的频率上进行测量。论文发现，两种模型都能很好地匹配机载辐射计的测量结果，精度足以用于 ICI。研究重点在于评估大气吸收模型在气象卫星观测中的应用，并通过机载观测数据验证模型的准确性，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。

Using machine learning, it identifies the most influential factors affecting soil DOC levels and maps global patterns. The findings help guide soil management and climate strategies, with the dataset available for further research. 
 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the most active carbon pool in soils, which plays critical roles in soil carbon cycling, plant productivity, and global climate change. An accurate assessment of the quantity of DOC in the soil is essential for the detailed elucidation of ecosystem functions and services. Nevertheless, the global driving factors and distribution of soil DOC remain inadequately quantified due to the scarcity of large-scale data. Here, a comprehensive global database of 12807 soil DOC concentrations derived from 975 target papers in the literature was compiled. Detailed geographic locations, climate, and soil properties were also recorded as predictors of soil DOC. Machine learning techniques were employed to assess the relative importance of various predictors in the determination of soil DOC concentrations, which were subsequently extended for their prediction on a global scale. The worldwide soil DOC concentration spanned a wide range (0.04 to 7859 mg kg-1), averaging 222.78 mg kg-1. The 12 selected variables (including soil properties, month, climate, and ecosystem) explained 65 % of the variance in soil DOC concentrations. Elevation, soil clay, and soil organic carbon were three of the most important predictors. Global soil DOC concentration increased from the equator to the poles. The soil DOC stocks in the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) amounted to 12.17 Pg, with significant variations observed across different continents. These results are instrumental for informing strategies on soil management practices, ecosystem services, and the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, our database can be combined with other carbon pools to explore the total soil carbon turnover and constrain Earth carbon models.

The data are derived from low light imaging data collected nightly by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day / night band (DNB). The form of the structures only becomes apparent when data from one or more years are accumulated. Identifiable structures include fishing grounds, platforms, gas flares, anchorages, and transportation routes. 
 We present the first comprehensive multiyear global mapping of offshore lighting structures derived from low-light imaging satellite observations collected at night. The sensor is the day/night band (DNB) flown as part of the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The product merges two operational nighttime light products: VIIRS boat detection (VBD) data and VIIRS cloud-free nighttime lights (VNL). The two products are spatially complementary, making it possible to fill gaps through a merger. Both product sets have an average DNB radiance layer, and the merger involves preserving the higher of the two average radiances. A wide range of lighting structures are present, from fishing grounds, platforms, anchorages, gas flares, transit routes, and the glow surrounding bright lighting onshore. The richness in the numbers and types of offshore lighting structures traces back to the DNB spike detector at the core of the VBD algorithm. The VNL algorithm uses outlier removal to filter out biomass burning, an essential process for mapping electric lighting onshore. The outlier removal drops about 80 % of the offshore lighting detections. We expect the new product will lead to an improved understanding of fishing grounds, offshore light pollution, and supply chain disruptions at anchorages, thereby aiding in the development of more sustainable and efficient practices.",Christopher D.

The method locally adjusts resolution in regions which are most relevant to modelling, based on the properties of the plasma. The runs testing this method show that adaptive refinement manages to highlight the desired regions with manageable performance overhead. Performance in larger-scale production runs and mitigation of overhead are avenues of further research. 
 Automatically adaptive grid resolution is a common way of improving simulation accuracy while keeping computational efficiency at a manageable level. In space physics, adaptive grid strategies are especially useful as simulation volumes are extreme, while the most accurate physical description is based on electron dynamics and hence requires very small grid cells and time steps. Therefore, many past global simulations encompassing, for example, near-Earth space have made tradeoffs in terms of the physical description and laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) used that require less accurate grid resolutions. Recently, using supercomputers, it has become possible to model the near-Earth space domain with an ion-kinetic hybrid scheme going beyond MHD-based fluid dynamics. These simulations, however, must develop a new adaptive mesh strategy beyond what is used in MHD simulations.We developed an automatically adaptive grid refinement strategy for ion-kinetic hybrid-Vlasov schemes, and we implemented it within the Vlasiator global solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere simulation. This method automatically adapts the resolution of the Vlasiator grid using two indices: one formed as a maximum of dimensionless gradients measuring the rate of spatial change in selected variables and the other derived from the ratio of the current density to the magnetic field density perpendicular to the current. Both these indices can be tuned independently to reach a desired level of refinement and computational load. We test the indices independently and compare the results to a control run using static refinement.The results show that adaptive refinement highlights relevant regions of the simulation domain and keeps the computational effort at a manageable level. We find that the refinement shows some overhead in the rate of cells solved per second. This overhead can be large compared to the control run without adaptive refinement, possibly due to resource utilization, grid complexity, and issues in load balancing. These issues lay out a development roadmap for future optimizations.",Leo Kotipalo;Markus Battarbee;Yann Pfau-Kempf;Minna Palmroth,这篇论文主要研究的是一种名为Vlasiator的全球混合-Vlasov空间等离子体模拟模型的优化方法。该方法通过自适应网格细化技术，根据等离子体的性质在最相关的区域局部调整分辨率，以提高模拟精度。论文重点介绍了这种自适应细化方法的实现和测试结果，并讨论了未来优化的方向。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，主要关注的是空间等离子体模拟，而非大气成分分析或卫星观测。

An imbalance between radical observations and simulations has been identified based on radical closure experiments, a valuable tool for accessing the state-of-the-art chemical mechanisms, demonstrating a deviation between the existing and actual tropospheric mechanisms. In the past decades, researchers have attempted to explain this deviation and proposed numerous radical generation mechanisms. However, these newly proposed unclassical radical generation mechanisms have not been systematically reviewed, and previous radical-related reviews dominantly focus on radical measurement instruments and radical observations in extensive field campaigns. Herein, we overview the unclassical generation mechanisms of radicals, mainly focusing on outlining the methodology and results of radical closure experiments worldwide and systematically introducing the mainstream mechanisms of unclassical radical generation, involving the bimolecular reaction of HO2 and organic peroxy radicals (RO2), RO2 isomerization, halogen chemistry, the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot, epoxide formation mechanism, mechanism of electronically excited NO2 and water, and prompt HO2 formation in aromatic oxidation. Finally, we highlight the existing gaps in the current studies and suggest possible directions for future research.

In this process, carbon loss is controlled by lignin, but the mechanisms of production of CO2 and CH4 during lignin photolysis are ambiguous. In this study, the photomineralization of plant litter and the lignocellulosic component collectively indicate that lignin is a major source of CO2 and CH4 emissions. Characterization and free radical analysis reveal that the production of CO2 is due to the oxidation and ring-opening reaction of the coniferyl alcohol unit, with the subsequent decarboxylation of carboxylic acid as an oxidation product. This reaction involves o-quinone formation by the reactions between O2, superoxide radical (O2·–), and persistent free radicals (PFRs)-bearing lignin. Of this, O2·– contributes to 43.2% of the photogenerated CO2, as a new pathway, derived from the electron transfer from PFRs to O2. Interestingly, photoinduced demethylation of the dimethoxybenzene-type compounds as the photolysis products of lignin results in a never-before-reported CH4 formation chemical route independent of that of O2.

Despite the importance of these lakes, there is increasing concern about the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)─among the most prevalent contaminants of our time─due to the ability of PFAS to bioaccumulate and persist in the environment, as well as to its linkages to detrimental human and animal health effects. In this study, PFAS exposure on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is examined at the molecular level, focusing on the impact of PFAS binding on the alpha (α) and beta (β) estrogen receptors (ERs) using molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations, and structural analysis. ERs are involved in fundamental physiological processes, including reproductive system development, muscle regeneration, and immunity. This study shows that PFAS binds to both the estrogen α and estrogen β receptors, albeit via different binding modes, due to a modification of an amino acid in the binding site as a result of a reorientation of residues in the binding pocket.

As a novel alternative to BPA, 4-hydroxy-4′-isopropoxydiphenylsulfone (BPSIP) is frequently detected in breast milk and placental barrier systems, suggesting potential transmission from the mother to offspring and increased risk of exposure. Gestation and lactation are critical periods for central nervous system development, which are vulnerable to certain environmental pollutants. Herein, we investigated the behavioral impacts and neurobiological effects of early-life exposure to BPSIP (0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) in mice offspring. Behavioral studies indicated that BPSIP exposure induced ASD-like behaviors, including elevated anxiety-related behavior and decreased spatial memory, in both male and female pups. A distinct pattern of reduced social novelty was observed only in female offspring, accompanied by significant alterations in antioxidant levels. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in pathways related to behaviors and neurodevelopment, which were consistent with the observed phenotype. Besides, a decrease in the protein levels of complex IV (COX IV) across all tested populations suggests a profound impact on mitochondrial function, potentially leading to abnormal energy metabolism in individuals with autism. Additionally, changes in synaptic proteins, evidenced by alterations in synapsin 1 (SYN1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) levels in the cerebellum and hippocampus, support the notion of synaptic involvement. These findings suggest that BPSIP may induce sex-specific neurotoxic effects that involve oxidative stress, energy generation, and synaptic plasticity.",Shengnan Zhang;Yitong Zhou;Jiatong Shen;Yumeng Wang;Jun Xia;Chenghan Li;Weiping Liu;Kashif Hayat;Mingrong Qian,该研究探讨了双酚S衍生物BPSIP对小鼠后代的影响，研究发现BPSIP暴露会导致小鼠后代出现自闭症样行为，包括焦虑行为增加、空间记忆能力下降等。研究还发现，BPSIP暴露会影响小鼠后代的抗氧化水平、基因表达和蛋白质水平，并可能导致线粒体功能异常和突触可塑性改变。该研究主要关注的是BPSIP对神经发育的影响，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

This study presents a systematic and intuitive picture of Cu toxicity induced by exogenous acidification in phytoplankton Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We first showed that acidification reduced the algal resistance to environmental Cu stress with a decreased growth rate and increased Cu bioaccumulation. To further investigate this phenomenon, we employed specific fluorescent probes to visualize the intracellular labile Cu pools in different algal cells. Our findings indicated that acidification disrupted the intracellular labile Cu trafficking, leading to a significant increase in labile Cu(I) pools. At the molecular level, Cu toxicity resulted in the inhibition of the Cu(I) import system and activation of the Cu(I) export system in acidic algal cells, likely a response to the imbalance in intracellular labile Cu trafficking. Subcellular analysis revealed that Cu toxicity induced extensive mitochondrial dysfunction and impacted the biogenesis and assembly of the respiratory chain complex in acidic algal cells. Concurrently, we proposed that the activation of polyP synthesis could potentially regulate disrupted intracellular labile Cu trafficking.

An important toxicity pathway is thought to follow oxidative stress from the formation of exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body, a proxy of which is oxidative potential (OP). As redox-active transition metals and organic species are important drivers of OP in urban environments, we investigate how seasonal changes in emission sources, aerosol chemical composition, acidity, and metal dissolution influence OP dynamics. Using a kinetic model of the lung redox chemistry, we predicted ROS (O2•–, H2O2, •OH) formation with input parameters comprising the ambient concentrations of PM2.5, water-soluble Fe and Cu, secondary organic matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone across two years and two urban sites in Canada. Particulate species were the largest contributors to ROS production. Soluble Fe and Cu had their highest and lowest values in summer and winter, and changes in Fe solubility were closely linked to seasonal variations in chemical aging, the acidity of aerosol, and organic ligand levels.

Increased resolution may help simulate realistic tropical cyclone intensification. We examined fully coupled, global storm‐resolving models run at resolutions in the range 28–2.8 km in the atmosphere and 28–5 km in the ocean. Simulated tropical cyclone activity, peak intensity, intensification rate, and horizontal wind structure are all more realistic at a resolution of ∼5 km compared with coarser resolutions. Rapid intensification, which is absent at typical climate model resolutions, is also captured, and exhibits sensitivity to how, and if, deep convection is parameterized. Additionally, the observed decrease in inner‐core horizontal size with increasing intensification rate is captured at storm‐resolving resolution.

This metric generally has a relatively uniform distribution of positive values across the tropics. However, selected land regions are characterized by exceptionally low autocorrelation values. Low values correspond to the dominance of high frequency variance in precipitation, and specifically of high frequency convectively coupled equatorial waves. Consistent with previous work, we show that CMIP6 climate models overestimate the autocorrelation. Global kilometer‐scale models capture the observed autocorrelation when deep convection is explicitly simulated. When a deep convection parameterization is used, though, the autocorrelation increases over land and ocean, suggesting that land surface‐atmosphere interactions are not responsible for the changes in autocorrelation.

Here, we report the magnetic field response of vortex bound states in superconducting topological crystalline insulator SnTe (001) films. Several MZMs were predicted to coexist in a single vortex due to magnetic mirror symmetry.

 Human mutations in neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been linked to high body mass index but not altered dietary patterns1. Here we uncover the mechanism by which NPY in sympathetic neurons2,3 protects from obesity. Imaging of cleared mouse brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT, respectively) established that NPY+ sympathetic axons are a smaller subset that mostly maps to the perivasculature; analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets identified mural cells as the main NPY-responsive cells in adipose tissues. We show that NPY sustains the proliferation of mural cells, which are a source of thermogenic adipocytes in both BAT and WAT4–6. We found that diet-induced obesity leads to neuropathy of NPY+ axons and concomitant depletion of mural cells. This defect was replicated in mice with NPY abrogated from sympathetic neurons. The loss of NPY in sympathetic neurons whitened interscapular BAT, reducing its thermogenic ability and decreasing energy expenditure before the onset of obesity. It also caused adult-onset obesity of mice fed on a regular chow diet and rendered them more susceptible to diet-induced obesity without increasing food consumption.

Distinguishing crude oil imports by their chemical composition, the elasticity of substitution between types is substantially lower than suggested by previous estimates.

Here the authors show that adipocyte oxygen sensing directly boosts brown fat calorie burning, even at warm temperatures. 
 Enhancing thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) function is a promising therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease. However, predominantly thermoneutral modern human living conditions deactivate BAT. We demonstrate that selective adipocyte deficiency of the oxygen-sensor HIF-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD2) gene overcomes BAT dormancy at thermoneutrality. Adipocyte-PHD2-deficient mice maintain higher energy expenditure having greater BAT thermogenic capacity. In human and murine adipocytes, a PHD inhibitor increases Ucp1 levels. In murine brown adipocytes, antagonising the major PHD2 target, hypoxia-inducible factor-(HIF)−2a abolishes Ucp1 that cannot be rescued by PHD inhibition. Mechanistically, PHD2 deficiency leads to HIF2 stabilisation and binding of HIF2 to the Ucp1 promoter, thus enhancing its expression in brown adipocytes. Serum proteomics analysis of 5457 participants in the deeply phenotyped Age, Gene and Environment Study reveal that serum PHD2 associates with increased risk of metabolic disease. Here we show that adipose-PHD2-inhibition is a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease and identify serum PHD2 as a disease biomarker.

 Achieving large-scale electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products with high selectivity using membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers in neutral electrolyte is promising for carbon neutrality. However, the unsatisfactory multicarbon products selectivity and unclear reaction mechanisms in an MEA have hindered its further development.

Here, the authors report a quasi-equilibrium growth method to synthesize inch-scale monolayer α-In2Se3 with high mobility and ferroelectric field-effect transistor performance. 
 Epitaxial growth of two-dimensional (2D) materials with uniform orientation has been previously realized by introducing a small binding energy difference between the two locally most stable orientations. However, this small energy difference can be easily disturbed by uncontrollable dynamics during the growth process, limiting its practical applications. Herein, we propose a quasi-equilibrium growth (QEG) strategy to synthesize inch-scale monolayer α-In2Se3 single crystals, a semiconductor with ferroelectric properties, on fluor-phlogopite substrates. The QEG facilitates the discrimination of small differences in binding energy between the two locally most stable orientations, realizing robust single-orientation epitaxy within a broad growth window. Thus, single-crystal α-In2Se3 film can be epitaxially grown on fluor-phlogopite, the cleavage surface atomic layer of which has the same 3-fold rotational symmetry with α-In2Se3. The resulting crystalline quality enables high electron mobility up to 117.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in α-In2Se3 ferroelectric field-effect transistors, exhibiting reliable nonvolatile memory performance with long retention time and robust cycling endurance. In brief, the developed QEG method provides a route for preparing larger-area single-crystal 2D materials and a promising opportunity for applications of 2D ferroelectric devices and nanoelectronics.

Here, we combine predictions of agricultural suitability under different climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with timber-production maps to show that 240–320 Mha (20–26%) of current forestry land will become more suitable for agriculture by 2100. Forestry land contributes 21–27% of new agricultural productivity frontiers (67–105 Mha) despite only occupying 10% of the surface of the land. Agricultural frontiers in forestry land occur disproportionately in key timber-producing nations (Russia, the USA, Canada and China) and are closer to population centres and existing cropland than frontiers outside forestry land. To minimize crop expansion into forestry land and prevent shifting timber harvests into old-growth tropical and boreal forests to meet timber demand, emissions must be reduced, agricultural efficiency improved and sustainable intensification invested in. Increases in crop and timber production are necessary to meet rising needs. Here the authors predict how current forestry land is likely to face increased competition from agriculture as climate change shifts land-use suitability.",Christopher G.

This study updates current approaches to ecological zoning of the world to ensure that consistent data are provided for such sustainability-related policy and studies. 
 As climate change accelerates, nations are moving towards meeting their nationally determined contributions and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reporting of this from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector relies on data related to land use and management, climate and soil type. Where such data are unavailable, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a set of default factors, based on an extensive literature review of likely GHG emission factors and carbon stock changes disaggregated by the Food and Agriculture Organization’s global ecological zones. As understanding of global ecological zones under environmental change improves, it becomes necessary to reassess such ecological zoning approaches to enable reporting of GHG emissions to support nationally determined contributions and global change studies. Here we propose a globally consistent ecological zoning approach based on Holdridge life zones using climatic data from the Climate Research Unit on a 0.5° grid, which tackles certain limitations found in the existing guidance provided by the IPCC. A set of three global ecological zone maps based on Holdridge life zones were devised using increasing levels of aggregation, which could support sustainability studies of global environmental change, specifically climate change, and be used as a zoning approach by the IPCC.

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a unique remote sensing instrument imaging ocean surface waves in two dimensions with high spatial resolution regardless of sunlight and weather conditions. However, due to the nonlinear imaging process, the ocean wave spectra cannot be retrieved directly from SAR data. The emergence of deep learning (DL) techniques provides a new paradigm for addressing this challenge. In this paper, a deep-learning-based model, called Wave-Spec-CNN, is proposed for retrieving omni-directional ocean wave spectra from SAR data. This model is constructed using approximately 21,000 collocations of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath mode images matched with global in-situ buoy data. The model adapts the convolution neural network (CNN) to accommodate the multi-valued nature of omni-directional ocean wave spectra, enhances performance by integrating a calibration branch and further incorporates physical characteristics into the training process. The results demonstrate consistency with buoy measurements for significant wave height (SWH) in the range of 0.5 m to 6 m, yielding a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 m on the validation dataset, comparable to traditional physical-based methods. In terms of mean wave period (MWP) and peak frequency (PF), the achieved RMSEs are of 1.24 s and 0.03 Hz, respectively. The retrieved omni-directional ocean wave spectra also allow to separate swell and windsea components for respective comparisons with those derived by in-situ buoy data. The RMSEs of respective SWH comparisons are of 0.46 m and 0.42 m. This research represents an initial endeavor into utilizing DL for the long-standing challenge of SAR inversion for ocean wave spectra, as well as providing valuable insights for employing DL in multi-parameter inversion tasks in remote sensing.",Ke Wu;Xiao-Ming Li,这篇论文主要研究的是利用合成孔径雷达（SAR）数据和深度学习技术来反演海面波谱。它探讨了如何利用深度学习模型从SAR数据中提取海面波谱信息，并与实地观测数据进行对比验证。论文的重点在于海洋波浪研究，而非大气环境遥感。

 Urbanization has exerted considerable impacts on urban water systems and ecological environments, yet its effects on local meteorological drought remain under-explored. The primary challenge to local-scale drought analysis is the scarcity of meteorological datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. To address the research gap, we initially proposed a two-step fusion framework, integrating both surface (i.e., gridded data)-surface and point (i.e., in-situ data)-surface fusion. The framework was applied to generate daily precipitation and average/maximum/minimum air temperature at a 1 km resolution through the integration of high-resolution remotely sensed datasets across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China. The final fused data demonstrated excellent performance, achieving a PCC (RMSE) of 0.806 (5.414 mm/day), 0.993 (1.138 °C), 0.987 (1.443 °C), and 0.988 (1.376 °C) for precipitation and average/maximum/minimum air temperature, respectively. A comparison of our fused data with CPC, ERA5-Land, CMFD, CHIRPS, IMERG, and TMPA products confirmed its capability in capturing local-scale meteorological dynamics by improving spatial resolution from 0.1°-0.25° to 1 km. Utilizing these high-resolution datasets, we quantified urbanization's impacts on local drought across 52 major cities in the YRB. We found that urbanization significantly magnified extreme Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and drought severity in 69.2% and 61.5% of these cities, respectively. The effects of urbanization on extreme SPEI were amplified by the increase of urbanization rates, with a slope of −0.24 (p < 0.05). To further examine the spatial patterns of urbanization-induced local drought, we proposed a drought spatial field identification method, utilizing it in three representative urban regions: Chengdu, Wuhan, and the Yangtze River Delta. Our findings revealed that urbanization led to more intense peak drought intensity and average drought severity. In addition, urban drought fields showed lower effective radius, indicating more concentrated drought towards urban regions. While urbanization is projected to continue alongside rapid population growth in the future, the advanced application of remote sensing data and technology in this study not only improves our understanding of urban water resource challenges but also equips urban planners with the necessary data to develop effective drought mitigation strategies.",Shuzhe Huang;Siqi Wang;Jing Chen;Chao Wang;Xiang Zhang;Jiefeng Wu;Chunlong Li;Aminjon Gulakhmadov;Dev Niyogi;Nengcheng Chen,这篇论文主要研究城市化对局部干旱的影响。研究人员利用高分辨率遥感数据（包括卫星数据和地面数据）融合生成1公里分辨率的降水和气温数据，并以此分析城市化对干旱的影响。研究发现，城市化显著加剧了69.2%的城市地区的极端干旱和61.5%的城市地区的干旱严重程度。研究还发现，城市化导致干旱更加集中在城市地区。该研究利用遥感技术分析城市化对局部干旱的影响，为城市规划者提供数据支持，以便制定有效的干旱缓解策略。

 Human-transformed agricultural and aquacultural ponds, collectively referred to as “dike-pond systems”, play a crucial role in ensuring food security but also contribute to the widespread loss of natural wetlands. However, spatially and temporally explicit patterns of dike-pond systems have not been thoroughly documented globally.

 Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) data are of great importance for hydrological research and water resource management. However, products derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) are constrained by the satellite design and variation in processing strategies among different institutions, resulting in multiple suboptimal products. These products not only have a coarse spatial resolution but also suffer from a continuous 11-month gap from July 2017 to May 2018, which represent significant limitations for related research. To address these challenges, the Bayesian-based three-cornered hat (BTCH) method was initially employed to fuse low-uncertainty GRACE-derived TWSA and GWSA products with a coarse resolution (0.5°). Subsequently, based on the fused TWSA/GWSA products and multi-source datasets, a machine learning downscaling framework based on a physically constrained sliding window (MLDF-PCSW) was developed. This framework not only enhanced the spatial resolution of the products but also filled the data gap, ultimately producing a high-resolution water storage anomaly product (HWSA v1.0), a long-term, continuous dataset on a global scale (excluding Greenland and Antarctica; variables: TWSA and GWSA; spatial resolution: 0.05°; temporal resolution: monthly; period: April 2002 to December 2022). The results of uncertainty analysis using the three-cornered hat (TCH) method indicated that the TWSA derived from the Center for Space Research (CSR) exhibited the lowest uncertainty (23.91 mm) of the three original products, and the uncertainty decreased by 35.42% (15.44 mm) after data fusion using the BTCH method. The HWSA v1.0 dataset based on MLDF-PCSW exhibited high correlation coefficients (CCs) (0.999 and 0.999 for TWSA and GWSA, respectively) and a low root mean square error (RMSE) (0.68 mm and 1.24 mm for TWSA and GWSA, respectively) with the original TWSA and GWSA products, while also providing more detailed TWSA and GWSA spatial information. Independent validation for TWSA_DYY based on the water balance method has been done across six basins and the results are great, with the CCs between 0.69 and 0.92. The GWSA from the MLDF-PCSW demonstrated acceptable correspondence with global in-situ groundwater observations, with a mean CC of 0.27. The other four previously released gap-filled TWSA products also exhibited outstanding performance, with the average CC reaching 0.98 for the 11-month gap.

 As one of the most important staple foods globally, rice sustains nearly half of the world's population. Accurate and timely paddy rice mapping is, thus, essential for rice-related policy-making to ensure food security in the context of anthropogenic, environmental and climate changes. However, paddy rice mapping remains a challenging task since it usually has similar spectral characteristics to other land covers. In this research, for the first time, an entirely new approach, called RiceTColour, was proposed for mapping rice fields within the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) colour space based on their unique spectra during the rice transplanting period as observed in remotely sensed imagery. We demonstrate that transplanted rice fields, representing a mixture of soil, water and rice seedlings, consistently exhibit relatively low spectral values in both SWIR and NIR bands across various geographical locations, leading to their unique dark green colours in the false-colour image composed of SWIR, NIR and Red bands. Based upon this, we transformed these three spectral bands into the CIE colour space where paddy rice was found to be readily and completely separated from the other land covers. Straightforward, but specific classification criteria were established within the CIE colour space to differentiate paddy rice from the other land covers. The proposed RiceTColour, thus, represents a new approach for paddy rice identification, that is mapping paddy rice using the CIE colour space based upon the previous underexplored remotely sensed spectra of paddy fields during the transplanting season. The effectiveness of the proposed method was investigated over five rice-planting regions distributed across different geographical regions, characterised by different climates, rice cropping intensities, irrigation schemes and cultural practices. Specifically, the mapping criteria established in a training site (S1) were directly generalised to the other four sites (S2 to S5) for paddy rice mapping. Experimental results demonstrated that the RiceTColour method consistently achieved the most accurate and balanced classifications across all five sites compared with four benchmark comparators: a SAR-based method, an index-based method and two supervised classifier-based methods. In particular, the RiceTColour method performed relatively stable, producing an overall accuracy exceeding 95% in the training site (S1) as well as the four generalised sites (S2 to S5), which is an encouraging result. Such efficient yet stable rice mapping results across various rice-planting regions suggest a very strong generalisation capability of the proposed RiceTColour method. In consideration of the relatively large planting area of paddy rice fields globally, the proposed parameter-free, efficient, and generalisable RiceTColour method, thus, holds great potential for widespread application in various rice-planting areas worldwide.",Huapeng Li;Jujian Huang;Ce Zhang;Xiangyu Ning;Shuqing Zhang;Peter M.

 Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions.",Paul B.

 Effective monitoring of soil and vegetation properties on a global scale is essential for better understanding climate changes, hydrological dynamics, and ecological processes. Passive microwave remote sensing at C-band radio frequency, with long observation period and relatively high penetration capability, has been widely used to retrieve soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (C-VOD). The retrieval process is generally achieved by inversion of the τ-ω radiative transfer model, which depends on crucial parameters such as effective scattering albedo (ω) and soil roughness (HR) for accurate retrievals. Current SM/C-VOD retrieval algorithms, such as the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), predominantly rely on globally-constant ω and HR values, ignoring the inherent sensitivity of those parameters to varying soil conditions and vegetation types. To evaluate the impact of ω and HR variables on SM and C-VOD retrievals and to improve their accuracy, this study proposed and evaluated a novel retrieval approach from AMSR2 C-band observations during 2017–2020 using the C-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (C-MEB) model. We evaluated two new retrieval algorithms, considering either a globally-constant calibration or a land cover-based calibration of ω and HR. As a benchmark for the calibration, we optimized the values of ω and HR by evaluating the retrieved SM against in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and OzNet hydrological monitoring networks. The main originality compared to previous algorithms is that i) it includes a comprehensive calibration exploring the optimal values of ω and HR, applicable globally or tailored to specific land cover; ii) field SM measurements were leveraged to constrain the calibrated value of ω and HR.For the globally-constant calibration, the optimal values of ω = 0.05 and HR = 0.1 were found to yield the best results. For the land cover-based calibration, an inverse relationship between ω/HR and canopy height was observed, with ω ranging from 0.04 to 0.06 and HR ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 for heights between 0 and 30 m. The algorithm employing a land cover-based calibration (INRAE Bordeaux 2, IB2) exhibited better performance than the one utilizing a globally-constant calibration (INRAE Bordeaux 1, IB1) in evaluating retrieved SM against in situ measurements, as well as in evaluating C-VOD vs various vegetation variables including aboveground biomass (AGB), tree cover, canopy height and several optical vegetation indices. Comparison with LPRM suggested that our IB2 C-VOD retrievals present improved performances in terms of both spatial and temporal results with all considered vegetation variables (spatial correlation (R) between various vegetation variables and C-VOD of 0.76–0.83 for IB2 vs 0.69–0.79 for LPRM), and exhibited lower saturation effects when compared with AGB. In addition, the IB2 SM produced lower root mean squared error (RMSE) (0.147 vs 0.217 m3/m3), bias (−0.03 vs 0.09 m3/m3), and ubRMSE (0.066 vs 0.067 m3/m3) when compared with in situ measurements, although it showed a lower R compared to LPRM SM.",Mengjia Wang;Philippe Ciais;Frédéric Frappart;Shengli Tao;Lei Fan;Rui Sun;Xiaojun Li;Xiangzhuo Liu;Huan Wang;Jean-Pierre Wigneron,这篇论文主要研究的是利用AMSR2卫星的C波段微波遥感数据来反演全球植被光学厚度和土壤水分。它提出了一种新的反演算法，并通过与实地测量数据进行比较，评估了算法的精度。论文的重点在于改进土壤水分和植被参数的遥感监测方法，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

 The launch of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in 2015 has resulted in significant achievements in global soil moisture mapping. Nonetheless, spatiotemporal discontinuities in the soil moisture products have arisen due to the limitations of its orbit scanning gap and retrieval algorithms. To address these issues, this paper presents a physics-constrained gap-filling method, PhyFill for short. The PhyFill method employs a partial convolutional neural network technique to explore spatial domain features of the original SMAP soil moisture data. Then, it incorporates variations in soil moisture induced by precipitation events and dry-down events as penalty terms in the loss function, thereby accounting for monotonicity and boundary constraints in the physical processes governing the dynamic fluctuations of soil moisture. The PhyFill model was applied to SMAP soil moisture data, resulting in continuous spatially daily soil moisture data on a global scale. Three validation strategies are employed: visual inspection through global pattern, simulated missing-region validation, and soil moisture validation with in situ measurements. The results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture achieved a higher spatial coverage with satisfactory spatial continuity with neighbouring pixels. The simulated validation of the missing regions revealed that the averaged unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and correlation coefficient (R) were 0.01 m3/m3 and 0.99, respectively versus the gap filled SMAP product. The core validation sites demonstrated that the reconstructed soil moisture data has a consistent ubRMSD compared with the original SMAP soil moisture data (0.04 m3/m3 vs. 0.04 m3/m3).

In 2022, China launched the world's first CO2 monitoring satellite based on laser detection, DQ-1. Equipped with ACDL, it enables accurate detection even under nighttime and high aerosol load conditions, serving as a significant complement to existing optical satellite systems. However, the feasibility of laser detection with narrow swath width for monitoring power plant emissions remains uncertain. This work presents, for the first time, the practical capability of using spaceborne LIDAR to estimate CO2 emissions from power plants. We employ the Gaussian dispersion model as the transport model and quantify emission rates using genetic and trust-region algorithms. Through satellite observations from June to December 2022, we conducted emission estimation experiments for 15 globally distributed power plants. Results indicate that using ACDL's XCO2 yields approximately unbiased estimates (∼2%) of power plant emissions overall, despite a single-overpass uncertainty of 18%. This performance is comparable to OCO-2/3, suggesting consistent benchmarks for different satellite mechanisms in reporting power plant emissions. Consequently, combining their results enhances monitoring of global power plants. We advocate the joint use of diverse CO2 monitoring satellites employing various detection mechanisms to gather a more comprehensive XCO2 dataset, aiming to achieve routine satellite-based verification of power plant emissions.",Ge Han;Yiyang Huang;Tianqi Shi;Hongyuan Zhang;Siwei Li;Haowei Zhang;Weibiao Chen;Jiqiao Liu;Wei Gong,这篇论文研究了利用搭载在DQ-1卫星上的气溶胶和二氧化碳激光雷达（ACDL）来量化发电厂的二氧化碳排放。论文通过对全球15个发电厂的观测数据进行分析，证明了该技术能够准确地估计发电厂的二氧化碳排放量，并与其他卫星观测结果相一致。这项研究表明，利用激光雷达技术进行卫星遥感可以有效地监测发电厂的二氧化碳排放，为实现低碳能源转型提供重要支持。

 P-band (0.3–1 GHz) radiometry shows promise in enhancing the next generation of radiometer missions for global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (VOD) monitoring, particularly in moderately to densely vegetated areas, which remain challenging for current L-band (1.4 GHz) missions such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). However, the superiority of P-band over L-band in this regard has not been experimentally verified, and the quantitative differences remain unexplored. To address this gap, the P-band Radiometer Inferred Soil Moisture (PRISM) tower-based experiment was conducted, pioneering a comprehensive evaluation of P- (0.75 GHz) and L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometry in densely vegetated areas with vegetation water content (VWC) up to 20 kg/m2. The results revealed that P-band VOD was consistently lower than L-band VOD, suggesting reduced vegetation attenuation and thus a higher VWC threshold for reliable soil moisture sensing at P-band. The VWC thresholds for P- and L-band were estimated at 7.7 kg/m2 and 4.0 kg/m2, respectively, suggesting that P-band radiation could go through the vegetation approximately twice as effectively as L-band radiation. Additionally, the Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) was identified as a strong predictor of retrieval performance because it established a good link between retrieval errors and VWC. Regarding VOD retrieval, robust logarithmic relationships (R2 > 0.9) between VOD and VWC were established for both bands within the 0–20 kg/m2 VWC range, challenging the previously assumed linear relationship. Moreover, P-band demonstrated greater retrieval robustness as its dual-polarized TB observations contain more independent information than those of L-band.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) which can be estimated from appropriate measurements of the surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiance. LST varies on a very short time scale and closely depends on the illumination and scan angles considered. To fully exploit LST products, a method for reconstructing the temporal profile and the angular dependence at the same time is proposed here. A combined visible-thermal envelope method (VT-KDTC) is built using kernel-driven (KD) and diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models, referring to the surface structure and thermal factors, respectively. To demonstrate the reliability of the approach, TIR data from the geostationary satellite Himawari 8 are combined with visible and near-infrared (VNIR) data from the polar orbit satellite Sentinel-3A/3B. In addition to satellite observations, a synthetic dataset from the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model is also generated. Considering an anisotropy model in addition to the DTC model leads to a method displaying a better ability to simulate LSTs with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.48 K against the original satellite results, compared to only the DTC model up to 1.44 K. By utilizing the field measurements as a reference, the reconstructed results are improved with a total bias of 0.72K and an RMSE of 2.58 K. Compared to the original results without correction, approximately 41% and 10% decreases are obtained in bias and RMSE, respectively.

 River ice plays a crucial role in hydrology, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems in mid-to-high latitude regions. However, there is a notable gap in the analysis of patterns and trends in river ice phenologies and their influence factors at the river level. In this study, we developed a practical method to identify river ice phenologies by leveraging Landsat observations from 2000 to 2021, and established a comprehensive dataset encompassing 7970 river segments across the entire Northern Hemisphere. Our results revealed that the mean freeze-up date, break-up date, and ice duration for these river segments were October 24, May 4, and 192.1 days, respectively. Notably, 56% of the river segments exhibited a warming trend, with the average freeze-up date delayed by 2.7 days per decade, break-up date advanced by 2.5 days per decade, and ice duration shortened by 5.5 days per decade—nearly five times the documented decrease rate over the past 150 years. Furthermore, high-latitude polar regions and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau demonstrated the most pronounced decreases in ice duration, exceeding 7.0 days per decade on average. We observed a substantial relative contribution, reaching up to 70%, of surface air temperature (SAT) in middle and low latitude regions characterized by relatively high winter temperatures. However, as winter temperatures decrease, the relative influence of SAT diminishes, while the contributions of precipitation, solar radiation, and residuals increase.

 Rock glaciers, unique creeping periglacial landforms, have garnered research interest for their valuable insights into hydrological resources and representing potential geological hazards in the context of climate warming. However, owing to the scarcity of high-spatiotemporal-resolution kinematic observations, the mechanisms driving rock glacier movements remain poorly understood. This study introduces a strategy for estimating three-dimensional (3D) velocities of rock glaciers by combining ascending and descending interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with a surface parallel flow model. We mapped the 3D surface creeping velocities of 1084 rock glaciers in Daxueshan, southwest Tibetan Plateau, from January 2019 to December 2020. Subsequently, we employed the generalized boosted model (GBM), a machine learning approach, to link rock glacier creep to environmental factors. The rock glaciers in Daxueshan exhibited spatially heterogeneous creep, with maximum and average annual velocities of 307.86 mm∙a−1 and 40.37 mm∙a−1, respectively. About 92% of rock glaciers crept with a two-peak seasonal rhythm characterized by “spring acceleration, summer deceleration, autumn acceleration, and winter deceleration”. GBM modeling suggested that precipitation and snowmelt were the predominant environmental factors controlling the kinematics of rock glaciers, with relative importance of 32.6% and 31.7%, respectively. Land surface temperature (LST) was the third significant driver at 17.1% of the relative importance. Slope angle and topographic wetness index (TWI) had the least impact. The modeling also quantitatively revealed the distinct nonlinear responses of rock glacier creep to environmental changes. Rock glaciers initiate acceleration at precipitation and snowmelt levels of about 2 mm, LST close to −2 °C, slope angle and TWI higher than 12° and 4.6, and stabilize when these factors reach certain thresholds. Furthermore, the seasonal variations in rock glacier creeping velocity can be primarily attributed to hydrological changes.

 Managing unregulated dumpsites in urban environments is a pressing issue, but determining their locations presents persistent challenges due to their irregular distribution. Recently, researchers have begun employing aerial view remote sensing imagery coupled with deep learning detection to identify open dumpsites. However, due to interference from scenes with similar visual features in the satellite imagery, the false alarm rate remains high. A model named CascadeDumpNet is proposed by this study, which integrates deep learning and automated machine learning for open dumpsite detection, effectively combining the visual characteristics of open dumpsites with the features of the surrounding environment to eliminate erroneous detection and improve detection precision. Notably, the model is equipped with a novel Contextual Feature Synthesis (CFS) module that was specifically designed to enhance object detection in bird-view remote sensing imagery. This module is adept at leveraging remote sensing contextual information, thereby significantly refining the detection process by considering the broader environmental features of dumpsites. The performance of the model was compared with six advanced object detection architectures to demonstrate its superiority. High-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from the Pléiades satellite, featuring a spatial resolution of 0.5 m, was utilized to analyze the dumpsite distribution in Shenzhen, China. The model was applied to this densely urbanized area, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting open dumpsites within such environments. Additionally, the transferability of the model was verified through successful applications in two other major Chinese cities, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Furthermore, the distribution pattern of dumpsites was analyzed, which revealed that the density of dumpsites is predominantly concentrated in highly urbanized areas, which are characterized by high population densities, and a strong correlation was observed between the locations of these dumpsites and proximities to forests, elevated highways, and industrial zones.

 Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is the main energy source for the Earth's system and a dominant component of the radiation budget. Although many algorithms have been proposed for estimating DSR, most models only consider either the radiative effects of terrain or atmosphere, and no research has considered the conditions of clouds on the mountainside. In this paper, a high-resolution Mountain Radiative Transfer model with Clouds (MRTC) is proposed to characterize the cloud-terrain coupling effects on DSR under different surface positions relative to the clouds. To operate the MRTC, a look-up table is employed to obtain initial radiative parameters. The comparison with Monte-Carlo based radiative transfer indicates that MRTC can be applied to conditions of clouds on the mountainside. And the reliability of MRTC under conditions when clouds are above mountains is also validated against in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 149.9 W/m2, a bias of 28.3 W/m2, and an R2 of 0.74. By using more accurate cloud cover data extracted from All-Sky images, the accuracy of MRTC has improved, with the RMSE decreasing to 115.8 W/m2, and the R2 increasing to 0.8. This suggests that the uncertainty in satellite cloud products significantly contributes to errors in DSR estimations.

 Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter affecting global climate, weather disasters, and marine resources. Acquiring SST data that covers large areas and spans over long periods is one of the most essential tasks for various scientific research. During the past decades, meteorological satellites (e.g., the Himawari 8) have been able to provide large-scale, high-resolution continuous observations (via a number of visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands), but have always been affected by active atmospheric activities (i.e., clouds). A detailed literature review on SST analysis or estimation shows that limitations or challenges associated with the existing tools and the state-of-the-art approaches have not been fully resolved yet. Through integrating the knowledge from interdisciplinary domains, hence, we proposed a physically-informed machine learning approach (i.e., a physically-consistent, virtual-gauge approach in the machine learning framework) to elegantly reconstruct daily SSTs under both cloud and cloud-free areas. By this central idea, we developed the TS-RBFNN (i.e., Temporal-Spatial Radial Basis Function Neural Network) and suggested an adequate procedure (with artificial clouds) for model assessment since the data in the cloudy region was unavailable. A systematic study in terms of model implication (i.e., the meaning of network architecture), model validation (i.e., the performance of learning and generalization), and model applications (i.e., in open ocean and coastal seas with different cloud coverage over the four seasons) was conducted. In particular, a pattern similarity analysis (examining SST distributions for several selected sections) and a daily-based error analysis (presenting the variations and distributions of RMSEs for each season) were carried out to clarify the relationship between varying cloud conditions and model performances (inferenced by sunny areas). Overall, the TS-RBFNN would better perform full SST reconstruction with significant improvement up to 60%, compared to the DINEOF (i.e., Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Function). Currently, the TS-RBFNN model is being implemented into the operational system of Taiwan's Central Weather Administration to provide all-weather SST products. In the near future, a long-term societal impact would be expected as the reconstructed SST data could be broadly employed in various scientific applications.",Chih-Chieh Young;Yu-Chien Cheng;Ming-An Lee;Jun-Hong Wu,这篇论文主要研究利用机器学习方法，通过卫星观测数据重建海表温度（SST），并克服了云层遮挡带来的影响。论文中提到了利用 Himawari 8 等气象卫星获取的可见光、近红外和红外波段数据，并开发了基于时间-空间径向基函数神经网络（TS-RBFNN）的模型。该模型能够在不同云覆盖条件下，对海表温度进行准确重建，并与传统方法相比，重建精度提高了 60%。论文的研究成果可以应用于气候变化研究、海洋资源管理等领域。

 The maximum carboxylation rate of plant leaves (Vcmax) at 25 °C (Vcmax25) is a fundamental parameter in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) to estimate carbon assimilation of C3 biomes. It has been reported that ignoring the seasonal variations in Vcmax25 induces considerable uncertainties in TBMs. Recently, a model was developed to estimate Vcmax25 of C3 biomes mechanistically from climate data based on eco-evolutionary optimality hypotheses, which hypothesized that plants acclimate to the environment to achieve maximum carbon assimilation with minimum related costs. However, uncertainties of this optimality-based model (EEO model) have been found to correlate to leaf nitrogen content, partly due to the lack of parameterization on how the acclimation of Vcmax25 is constrained by photosynthetic nitrogen other than that in RuBisCO. This constraint could be parametrized by remote sensing methods globally. In this study, we developed remote sensing methods to estimate leaf absorptance of radiation based on MODIS LCC (leaf chlorophyll content) data and the ratio of the maximum electron transport rate of plant leaves (Jmax) to Vcmax at 25 °C (rJV25) based on TROPOMI SIF (solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence) data (RS-rJV25). These two parameters contain photosynthetic nitrogen information related to light harvesting, electron transport, and carboxylation, and they were then incorporated into the EEO model to constrain how Vcmax25 acclimates to the environment. The simulated Vcmax25 constrained by MODIS LCC and RS-rJV25 agreed well with seasonal variations in field-measured Vcmax25 at 18 sites (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 13.40 μmol·m−2·s−1), showing better accuracy than the simulation without incorporating leaf absorptance and rJV25 (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 31.59 μmol·m−2·s−1). Our results indicated that variations in leaf absorptance and rJV25 constrained the acclimation of Vcmax25 to the environment and contributed to the variation in Vcmax25 that cannot be fully captured by environmental factors alone in the EEO model. The remote-sensing-based leaf absorptance and rJV25 captured the sensitivity of these two parameters to environmental conditions on the global scale. The influence of leaf absorptance on Vcmax25 was primarily affected by the irradiance level, while rJV25 was determined by the growing season mean temperature. The simulated Vcmax25 had large spatiotemporal variations on the global scale, and the environment drove the variation pattern more greatly than the biome distribution. With reasonably accurate seasonal variations in Vcmax25, this study can help improve the global carbon cycle and leaf trait modelling.",Yihong Liu;Jing M.

 The choice of ice particle model is critical for microwave remote sensing of ice clouds. Using a model-observation closure method, the global applicability of a series of single crystal and aggregate ice particle models is evaluated based on satellite-based microwave measurements from the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) high-frequency channels. The results indicate that the ice water path (IWP) retrievals from radar observations are highly dependent on the ice particle model, with the maximum difference between models exceeding a factor of 13. Although aggregate models generally perform better than single crystals, none of them can be well adapted to retrievals for all types of ice clouds on the global scale. A columnar single crystal works better for low IWP clouds, while a small block aggregate for high IWP. Consequently, a mixing scheme combining both with weighting by IWP is then proposed for global ice cloud measurements. By using this double-model mixing scheme, the simulations can well reproduce simultaneous active and passive microwave observations, regardless of the IWP. Specifically, the differences between CPR radar reflectivity simulations and observations do not exceed 0.1 dBZ, while the mean biases of brightness temperatures on all high-frequency channels of GMI are <1.5 K. This is expected to improve the retrieval accuracy of global ice clouds.",Banghai Wu;Yu Wang;Xiaoye Fan;Shi Liu;Yixiao Fu,该研究论文主要关注利用卫星遥感技术监测全球冰云。研究者通过比较不同冰晶模型对云雷达和微波辐射计观测数据的模拟效果，发现不同模型在不同云类型和冰水路径上的适用性存在差异。为了提高全球冰云监测的准确性，研究者提出了一种混合模型方案，将不同模型根据冰水路径进行加权组合，从而更准确地模拟观测数据。该研究属于大气环境遥感技术领域，利用卫星观测数据和模型模拟来研究冰云的微物理特性，对理解气候变化和天气预报具有重要意义。

 Plant adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf sides have different reflectances and transmittances, and this r-t dorsiventrality has been explored and modeled in several studies. The emitted chlorophyll fluorescence is also not identical when different leaf sides are illuminated; although this f dorsiventrality has already been discovered, its effects on canopy-level fluorescence have not been explored, and there is a lack of models for explaining this phenomenon. This study develops two radiative transfer models, LFD (Leaf chlorophyll Fluorescence with Dorsiventrality) and CFD (Canopy chlorophyll Fluorescence with leaf Dorsiventrality), to model leaf dorsiventrality (including r-t and f dorsiventrality) at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively, and to explore its influence on canopy fluorescence. Evaluation of LFD against the measured spectra revealed that the proposed model accurately simulated leaf fluorescence with an RMSE of 0.056 W/m2/µm/sr, an NRMSE of 3.3%, and an R2 of 0.963.

Here, we report that ex vivo treatment of mouse CD8+T cells with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a stabilizer of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), induced HIF binding to the genes encoding the costimulatory receptors CD81, GITR, OX40, and 4-1BB, leading to increased expression. DMOG treatment increased T cell killing of melanoma cells, which was further augmented by agonist antibodies targeting each costimulatory receptor. In tumor-bearing mice, ACT using T cells treated ex vivo with DMOG and agonist antibodies resulted in decreased tumor growth compared to ACT using control T cells and increased intratumoral markers of CD8+T cells (CD7, CD8A, and CD8B1), natural killer cells (NCR1 and KLRK1), and cytolytic activity (perforin-1 and tumor necrosis factor–α). Costimulatory receptor gene expression was also induced when CD8+T cells were treated with three highly selective HIF stabilizers that are currently in clinical use.",;Yongkang Yang;Shaima Salman;Dominic Dordai;Yajing Lyu;Emmanuel Datan;Daiana Drehmer;Tina Yi-Ting Huang;Yousang Hwang;Gregg L. Semenza,该研究主要关注的是免疫疗法，通过使用药物稳定缺氧诱导因子（HIF）来增强T细胞的抗肿瘤活性。研究中使用了小鼠模型，并测试了DMOG等药物对T细胞的影响，以及其对肿瘤生长的抑制效果。该研究与大气环境遥感技术无关。
