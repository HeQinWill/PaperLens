Management of OPs and DBPs is further hindered by the historical division between microbial and chemical research. This review brings together the current knowledge regarding OPs and DBPs, identifies factors that influence the occurrence of both, and highlights areas where research is needed to better understand their health risks. First, we examine the current understanding of how OPs and DBPs are jointly influenced by physicochemical parameters, source water characteristics, treatment processes including disinfection, and distribution system properties. Temperature, for example, can affect OP and DBP occurrence, where higher temperatures can promote the growth of some OPs, such as Legionella pneumophila, but temperature’s effect on DBPs is species-dependent. Methods for quantifying the risks associated with OPs (quantitative microbial risk assessment) and DBPs (chemical risk assessment) are compared, finding that the numerous assumptions and data gaps associated with each method limit comparability across contaminant types. We highlight the urgent need to fill existing data gaps and develop a more unified risk framework so as to move toward holistic assessment of microbial and chemical risks. This review provides suggestions for future research, highlighting ways that researchers might utilize established practices in OP or DBP studies to further our understanding of the other. For example, analysis of source water organic matter composition, which has advanced our understanding of DBP formation, could be utilized to elucidate how source water characteristics influence OPs. This review bridges the gap between the OP and DBP disciplines, arguing that collaboration between the two is needed to address the pressing challenges facing water systems today."

Nitrogen (N) management not only promotes Nr emission and pollution control but also influences GHG emission sources. Therefore, we constructed a nitrogen–carbon (N–C) coupled model to link N metabolism with GHG emission inventory at the national scale, revealing the contributions of N management for synergistic GHG emission reduction. China was selected as the case study. The results showed that from 2015 to 2020, the N-metabolism system was associated with 1510 Mt carbon dioxide (CO2)eq yr–1 of GHG emissions, including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and C sequestration, accounting for 13.5% of the national level. Adopting N–C coupled strategies could synergistically reduce N-associated GHG emissions by 42.1% (607.8 Mt CO2 eq), suggesting that the Nr–GHG comitigation effects have been considerably underestimated. Specifically, the most effective synergistic strategies were balanced N fertilizer use, manure management, food loss, and waste reduction, and garbage sorting, which may become a priority for future N–C synergistic emission reduction."

Wilson,Coupling of Lipid Peroxidation and Criegee Intermediate Mediated Autoxidation in the Heterogeneous Oxidation of Linoleic Acid Aerosols,"Autoxidation is an established mechanism for the degradation of organic molecules, which is relevant in the atmosphere, combustion processes, the environment, and the rancidification of lipids (commonly known as lipid peroxidation). Autoxidation proceeds via radical chain reactions involving hydroxyl (•OH), peroxy (RO2•), and alkoxy radicals, which are also prominent oxidants in the atmosphere. Recent reports have provided evidence for an alternative autoxidation mechanism driven instead by Criegee intermediates (CIs), which are produced from the reaction of β-hydroxy peroxy radicals (β–OH-RO2•). This work evaluates the contributions of these two mechanisms in the •OH initiated heterogeneous oxidation of linoleic acid (LA) aerosols. Reaction kinetics and product distributions are monitored using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer. To explain the observed kinetics, a kinetic model is developed that incorporates both the conventional peroxidation and alternative CI-mediated autoxidation mechanisms. We observe that the CI-mediated autoxidation pathways enhance the heterogeneous autoxidation rate, while the peroxidation reactions, although present, contributes less to the overall oxidation rate. α-Acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs) are identified as key indicators for bimolecular reactions of CI with LA, highlighting the role of LA as a CI scavenger. Moreover, the measured functionalized LA products with hydroxyl or carbonyl group(s), serve as markers for the peroxidation reactions. In summary, this work presents a quantitative framework to understand the coupled reaction network of •OH, RO2•, β–OH-RO2• radicals, and CI in driving heterogeneous autoxidation, which is crucial for understanding degradation mechanisms of organic molecules in the environment and atmosphere."

However, traditional quantitative structure–activation relationship (QSAR) models often fall short in effectively normalizing and characterizing diverse molecular structures, thereby limiting their predictive accuracy for the removal of various ECs. This study uses embedded molecular structure vectors generated by a graph neural network (GNN), combined with functional group prompts, as inputs to a feedforward neural network. A data set of 28 ECs and 542 data points, representing diverse molecular structures and physiochemical properties, was built to predict the residual rate of ECs (REC) in ozonation oxidation. Compared to traditional QSAR models, the GNN-based molecular structure embedded methods significantly improve prediction accuracy. The resulting KANO–EC model achieved an R2 of 0.97 for REC, demonstrating its ability to capture complex structural features. Moreover, KANO–EC maintains exceptional interpretability, elucidating key functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, aromatic rings, and amines) involved in the oxidation mechanism. This study presents the KANO–EC model as a novel approach for predicting the ozonation removal efficiency of current and potential ECs. The model also provides valuable insights for developing efficient control strategies for ensuring the long-term safety and sustainability of drinking water supplies."

However, the photochemical transformation of PAA in sunlit surface waters has not been previously investigated. For the first time, the photosensitized transformation of PAA was here observed in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)-enriched solutions under simulated solar irradiation. Triplet CDOM (3CDOM*) is here proposed to play a key role in the phototransformation processes. Using triplet model compounds, the reaction rate constant of 3CDOM* with PAA can be estimated to around 1.1 × 108 M–1 s–1. The reaction mechanism of triplet with PAA involves both energy- and electron-transfer. CH3COO• was generated from the reaction between PAA and excited triplets. Furthermore, HO• and organic reactive species (i.e., CH3COOO• and CH3COO•) are involved in the photochemical transformation of PAA in sunlit CDOM-enriched solutions. These reactive species (including HO•, CH3COOO•, and CH3COO•) also play a role in the removal of contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs). Overall, the current study provided new insights into the photochemical transformation of PAA in CDOM-enriched solutions. The solar irradiation of wastewater with PAA enhancement could be a useful and economically beneficial advanced oxidation process for CEC abatement."

While existing technologies prioritize adsorption capacity over regenerative sustainability, we engineered a fluorinated hydrogel with tailored fluorous binding sites to target PFAS via their hydrophobic C–F termini. This design achieved over 90% PFAS removal efficiency in real water matrices (e.g., tap and lake water), at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 μg L–1), with robust resistance to competing background ions and natural organic matter. Selectivity correlated strongly with PFAS chain length (F9 > F12 > F6), driven by stable adsorption configurations (C–F···F–C vs C–H···F–C) and a favorable adsorption energy of −29.06 kcal mol–1. Leveraging controlled noncovalent F···F interactions, the hydrogel enabled efficient desorption (60–80% efficiency using 1% NaCl, 1% NH4Cl, or 0.5% NH4OH–NH4Cl) without structural degradation. Full regeneration (>92% recovery) was achieved with 50% methanol, supporting five reuse cycles with minimal performance decline. In continuous operation, using 1% NaCl achieved a 10-fold PFAS enrichment, while 50% methanol enabled a significantly higher 51-fold enrichment. Both approaches reduced eluent consumption by 20–50% compared to conventional activated carbon and resins. Overall, balancing PFAS adsorption and desorption trade-offs significantly reduces environmental footprint and operational costs, providing a sustainable strategy for PFAS remediation."

Silicone wristbands have been used as effective personal passive sampling tools for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and serve as integrated measures of inhalation and dermal exposures. However, to-date, translating SVOC concentrations in wristbands to estimated doses has been a gap for their application in exposure assessment. Here, we utilized wristbands as proxy measures for skin-surface lipids to calculate estimated daily intakes (EDIs) from the dermal absorption pathway. EDIs were compared to dermal uptake estimates previously calculated from indoor air measurements and hand wipes, which were collected from residents of both polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated and noncontaminated buildings. Wristband-based estimates showed strong agreement with those from air and hand wipes (rs > 0.8, p < 0.0001), particularly for lower chlorinated PCBs, with dermal uptake accounting for a third of exposed residents’ PCB exposure (∑7PCB = 29.2 ng/kg bodyweight/day). All three dermal estimates were significantly associated with serum measurements among the lower chlorinated congeners. Our results demonstrate wristbands’ potential for quantifying personal external exposure, building on their utility for ranking internal dose. This study further presents a method for using wristbands to calculate dermal absorption for personalized exposure assessment."

This study presents direct observations of liquid–liquid phase separation and the morphologies of PM2.5 filter extracts collected from Seoul, Beijing, and Noto during autumn 2023. The PM2.5 samples covered both polluted and clean environments and were predominantly organic-rich. Optical microscopy revealed that real-world samples from these cities underwent phase transitions with changing relative humidity and primarily existed in either two-liquid or three-phase states, while fully homogeneous or nonliquid states were rare. Moreover, a core–shell morphology, consisting of an organic shell and inorganic core, was frequently observed in the PM2.5 samples. Calculations confirmed that the viscosity of the organic shell ranges from ∼101 Pa s in Seoul (liquid-like) to ∼106 Pa s in Beijing (semisolid). As the shell becomes more viscous, the diffusivity of N2O5 decreases, thereby lowering the N2O5 uptake coefficient by 1–3 orders of magnitude and significantly restricting N2O5 uptake. These results highlight the crucial role of aerosol morphology in heterogeneous chemistry, as the organic-rich outer phase can significantly modify the reactive uptake coefficients and gas–particle interactions."

However, conventional wisdom says that the contribution of NO2 reduction on soot to HONO formation is limited due to the rapid deactivation of surface reductive sites in the atmosphere. On the contrary, we show that adsorbed anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), collectively called exogenous VOCs (EVOCs), can persistently promote the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 to HONO on soot. The surface uptake of NO2 driven by H2O, coupled with the hydrogen reduction of NO2 supported by EVOCs on elemental carbon (EC), is proposed to be the key pathway causing the persistent production of HONO. Furthermore, field observation conducted during biomass burning seasons in the North China Plain also showed that the presence of EVOCs promotes HONO production significantly. Our results imply that the continuous adsorption and conversion of EVOCs on soot surfaces may have a remarkable enhancing impact on the persistent conversion of NO2 to HONO in the atmosphere."

The evaluation is conducted over Nordic Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland) since there is uncertainty in climate models' representation of key hydroclimatic variables in high‐latitude regions as they experience accelerated transformation in a changing climate. A 13‐year WRF‐CTSM simulation (2010–2022) is performed using a 10.5 km horizontal grid spacing to assess the model biases in simulating mean, minimum, and maximum 2 m temperature, precipitation, snow cover (snow depth, snow water equivalent, fractional snow‐covered duration), and surface energy balance components. The analysis is based on annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily mean comparisons against openly available observational data sets, comprising regional scale gridded station‐based and satellite‐based data sets, as well as point scale observations from ground stations. The model shows robust agreement with the evaluation data sets across all considered variables. Furthermore, in situ scale conditions in 2 m temperature, precipitation, snow cover variables, and latent heat are captured with considerable precision.

 Alkaline–silicate igneous complexes contain a huge diversity of rock types, ranging from silica-undersaturated (feldspathoid-normative) to silica-oversaturated (quartz-normative) compositions. At present, the controls on the formation of such compositional diversity are poorly quantified. Here we apply thermodynamic models to investigate these controls using a case study of the Blatchford Lake Igneous Complex (Canada), which is compositionally representative of worldwide alkaline–silicate systems. By modelling fractionation of a primitive mafic melt across crustal pressures, we identify a narrow (~0.5 kbar) ‘tipping point’ across which residual melts become silica-rich or alkali-rich when shallower or deeper, respectively. This tipping point is consistently present at mid-crustal pressures (3–5 kbar; ~10–15 km depth) for a range of viable primitive melts, moving to higher pressures within this range for more hydrous and more oxidized melts. Crystallization at these pressures (within barometric estimates for the complex) can therefore generate and explain the vast diversity of observed alkali-rich and silica-rich compositions. A similar tipping point is also present in other modelled mafic igneous systems at mid-crustal conditions, indicating it is a widespread phenomenon. This result implies a key role for mid-crustal mafic staging chambers in generating compositional diversity in alkaline–silicate complexes worldwide.

 The explosive January 2022 Hunga submarine eruption in Tonga injected unprecedented water volumes into the upper atmosphere, generating widespread climatic impacts. However, it ejected anomalously little sulfur compared with other eruptions of similar volume. We explain the missing sulfur with volatile budgets calculated from volcanic ash samples spanning the eruption. We show that magma was stored in a weakly stratified reservoir at 2.1 km to >5.6 km depth. Magma rose within <3 min and fragmented at 400–1,000 m below sea level. This preserves microscale chemical mingling including ~1 wt% contrasts in magmatic water concentrations. The 11-h eruption released a total of 319 Tg of magmatic water, which is <10% of that derived from magmatic seawater interaction. Comparing magmatic and residual glass sulfur concentrations shows a total release of 9.4 TgS, but >93% of this entered the ocean during submarine magma fragmentation. These results raise the concern that satellite SO2 monitoring underestimates the magma output of submarine explosions and they are probably near invisible in ice-core records, despite their climate influence caused by water injection into the upper atmosphere.

 The increasing interest in utilizing three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models with innovative biomaterials to engineer functional tissues arises from the limitations of conventional cell culture methods in accurately reproducing the complex physiological conditions of living organisms. This study presents a strategy for replicating the intricate microenvironment of the intestine by cultivating intestinal cells within bioinspired 3D interfaces that recapitulate the villus-crypt architecture and 3D tissue arrangement of the intestine. Intestinal cells cultured on these biomimetic substrates exhibited phenotypes and differentiation characteristics resembling intestinal-specific cell types, effectively replicating intestinal tissue. Notably, tissue proliferation and differentiation were achieved within 72–120 h—significantly faster than the several weeks required by conventional bioengineered materials, which often pose risks of tissue necrosis or cross-contamination. Additionally, the differentiated cells on these villi-crypts mimicking bio-interfaces exhibit higher production of natural antimicrobial peptides, resulting in reduced pathogenic infection compared to control samples. Furthermore, our method stands out for simplicity in fabrication, eliminating the need for cleanroom procedures and complex microfabrication techniques.

 Precisely regulating protein conformation (folding) for biomanufacturing and biomedicine is of great significance but remains challenging. In this work, we innovate a covalent organic framework (COF)-directed protein refolding strategy to modulate protein conformation by rationally designed covalent organic frameworks with adapted pore structures and customizable microenvironments. The conformation of denatured protein can be efficiently recovered through a simple one-step approach using covalent organic framework treatment in aqueous or buffer solutions. This strategy demonstrates high generality that can be applied to various proteins (for example, lysozyme, glucose oxidase, trypsin, nattokinase, and papain) and diverse covalent organic frameworks. An in-depth investigation of the refolding mechanism reveals that pore size and microenvironments such as hydrophobicity, π-π conjugation, and hydrogen bonding are critical to regulating protein conformation. Furthermore, we use this covalent organic framework platform to build up solid-phase columns for continuous protein recovery and achieved a ~ 100% refolding yield and excellent recycling performance (30 cycles), enabling an integrated process for the extracting and refolding denatured proteins (such as the harvest of protein in inclusion bodies).

Here, the authors report a bimetallic silver–rhenium catalyst that selectively converts cyclic imides to lactams with high efficiency, with close silver–rhenium contact being key to its performance. 
 The rational design of robust nanocatalysts containing the suitable active sites for building relevant organic compounds, such as lactams, is a desired approximation towards the development of a sustainable fine chemistry field. In that sense, the design of a proper nanomaterial able to mediate the selective hydrodeoxygenation of cyclic imides to lactams with high tolerance to the preservation of aromatic rings remains rather unexplored. Here, we show the design of a bimetallic AgRe nanomaterial with notable activity and selectivity to mediate this transformation affording more than 60 lactams from the corresponding imides. Interestingly, in this work we disclose that the optimal AgRe nanocatalyst is constituted by AgReO4 nanoaggregates that undergo an in situ hydrogenative dispersion to form the active centers composed by Ag0 nanoparticles and ReOx species. Deep characterization, together with kinetic and mechanistic studies, have revealed that the intimate Ag-Re contact intrinsic to AgReO4 species is key for the formation of the most active catalytic sites and the proper bimetallic cooperation required for mediating the desired process.

The model is then experimentally validated on a new dataset of 3773 DTIs from a yeast-based screen on 7 human GPCRs. 
 Machine learning has revolutionized drug discovery by enabling the exploration of vast, uncharted chemical spaces essential for discovering novel patentable drugs. Despite the critical role of human G protein-coupled receptors in FDA-approved drugs, exhaustive in-distribution drug-target interaction testing across all pairs of human G protein-coupled receptors and known drugs is rare due to significant economic and technical challenges. This often leaves off-target effects unexplored, which poses a considerable risk to drug safety. In contrast to the traditional focus on out-of-distribution exploration (drug discovery), we introduce a neighborhood-to-prediction model termed Chemical Space Neural Networks that leverages network homophily and training-free graph neural networks with labels as features. We show that Chemical Space Neural Networks’ ability to make accurate predictions strongly correlates with network homophily. Thus, labels as features strongly increase a machine learning model’s capacity to enhance in-distribution prediction accuracy, which we show by integrating labeled data during inference. We validate these advancements in a high-throughput yeast biosensing system (3773 drug-target interactions, 539 compounds, 7 human G protein-coupled receptors) to discover novel drug-target interactions for FDA-approved drugs and to expand the general understanding of how to build reliable predictors to guide experimental verification. This study presents CSNN, a tool leveraging network homophily and training-free graph neural networks with labels as features to predict drug-target-interactions (DTIs). The model is then experimentally validated on a new dataset of 3773 DTIs from a yeast-based screen on 7 human GPCRs."

 One of the grand open problems of modern physics is the unification of Einstein’s general relativity and quantum mechanics. This challenge has been approached by the greatest physicists but there is still no complete theory and experimental evidence remains out of reach. The Newton–Schrödinger equation (NSE) offers insight into this puzzle, as it describes a quantum wavefunction under self-gravity dynamics. Having been studied theoretically for decades, optical experiment of this nonlinear model was demonstrated only in 2015. Although the NSE can be generalized to post-Newtonian gravity approximating general relativity, all experiments simulating nonlinear gravity so far have been limited to Newtonian gravity. Here we present experimental emulation of post-Newtonian dynamics by probing a new physical regime of nonlinearity that mimics larger masses in gravity. We find soliton solutions of the post-Newtonian–Schrödinger equations, distinct from their Newtonian counterparts and demonstrate them experimentally. We observe rich beam evolution requiring previously unconsidered nonlinear terms, thereby opening up new experimental capabilities for simulating wavefunction dynamics in the settings of general relativity.

 Evidence suggests that people are attracted to patterns and regularity. We hypothesized that decision-makers, intending to maximize profit, may be lured by the existence of regularity, even when it does not confer any additional value. An algorithm based on this premise outperformed all other contenders in an international challenge to bias individuals’ preferences. To create the bias, the algorithm allocates rewards in an evolving, yet easily trackable, pattern to one option but not the other. This leads decision-makers to prefer the regular option over the other 2:1, even though this preference proves to be relatively disadvantageous. The results support the idea that humans assign value to regularity and more generally, for the utility of qualitative approaches to human decision-making. They also suggest that models of decision making that are based solely on reward learning may be incomplete.

 Single-cell transcriptome profiling enables unparalleled characterization of the heterogeneous microenvironment of pediatric leukemias. To facilitate comparative analyses and generate pediatric leukemia signatures, we collect, process, and annotate single-cell data comprising over 540,000 cells from 159 different pediatric acute leukemia (myeloid, lymphoid, mixed phenotype lineages) and healthy bone marrow (BM) samples, profiled in our lab and curated from publicly available studies. The analysis identifies a leukemia-enriched signature of nine genes with over-expression in leukemic blast compared to healthy BM cells. This signature is also consistently over-expressed in leukemia samples compared to normal BM in bulk RNA-seq datasets (over 2000 samples). Outcome-based analysis on diagnosis samples using measurable residual disease (MRD) status depicts a significant association of oncogene-induced senescence and g-protein activation pathways with MRD positivity. MRD positivity across pediatric leukemias is also correlated with significant depletion of CD8+ and CD4+ naïve T-cells and M1-macrophages at diagnosis.

 Engineering cell factories that support the production of large quantities of protein therapeutics remains a significant biomanufacturing challenge. The overexpression of secretory proteins causes proteotoxic stress, affecting cell viability and protein productivity. Proteotoxic stress leads to the activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a series of signal transduction pathways regulating protein quality control mechanisms aimed at restoring homeostasis. Sustained UPR activation culminates with the induction of apoptosis. Current strategies for enhancing the production of therapeutic proteins have focused on the deregulated modulation of key components of the UPR. These strategies have resulted in limited and often protein-specific improvements as they may lead to adaptation and cell toxicity and do not account for natural population heterogeneities. We report here feedback-responsive cell factories that sense proteotoxic stress and, in response, modulate the UPR to enhance stress attenuation and delay cell death, addressing the limitations of current strategies. We demonstrate that our cell engineering approach enables dynamic UPR modulation upon proteotoxic stress. The sense-and-respond systems that mediate dynamic UPR modulation enhance the production of the therapeutic enzyme tissue plasminogen activator and the bispecific antibody blinatumomab. Our feedback-responsive cell factories provide an innovative strategy for dynamically adjusting the innate cellular stress response and enhancing therapeutic protein manufacturing.

 The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and European Union-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. Here we use an optimization model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focusing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions and land-use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall.

This work advances their performance, particularly fast cycling lifespan, to an unprecedented level utilizing a hybrid electrolyte. 
 Solid-state sodium (Na) batteries open the opportunity for more sustainable energy storage due to their safety, low cost and high energy density. Inorganic solid electrolytes show notable advantages for such technologies but suffer from poor interfacial compatibility, rendering hybrid solid–liquid electrolytes an alternative. Here we show that the interfacial failure in the hybrid electrolyte system (Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) and 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate) is closely associated with Na vacancies on the surface of NZSP. Asymmetric kinetics of solid and liquid electrolytes lead to the formation of Na vacancies and an unstable environment in the Helmholtz layer, while the organic molecules (propylene carbonate) are energetically favourable towards undesirable dehydrogenation. To eliminate the Na vacancies layer, we designed an ion-anchoring interlayer that serves to minimize the interfacial polarization. The unique O–Na coordination between the interfacial layer and NSZP confers stability to the solid–liquid interface. As demonstrated, the sodium battery with the modified hybrid electrolyte sustains 50,000 cycles with capacity retention of 86.3%. Our work provides a new path for the design of solid-state Na batteries, highlighting their potential for widespread practical applications.

On the other hand, variability in the tropical Pacific, especially the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has also been presented as a major driver of both IOB and IOD. The relative importance of these coupled feedbacks is still debated. Here, we use a Linear Inverse Model (LIM) capable of selectively including or excluding IO-TP coupling to evaluate the relative roles of the IOB and IOD modes on TP variability, and the preferred timescales of those impacts. Our findings reveal a reduction in TP interannual variability (~40%) and a substantial increase in central TP low-frequency variability (>6 years) in the absence of IO coupling. Specifically, both the IOB and IOD contribute significantly to TP interannual variance. IOB dynamics substantially damp central TP low-frequency variability, while the IOD exhibits negligible impacts on the TP at low-frequencies. We further assess the relative importance of internal IO dynamics versus that induced in the IO by the Pacific in shaping tropical Pacific variability. Our findings indicate that internal IO dynamics predominantly impact Pacific interannual variance, while the Pacific’s influence on the IOB, rather than internal IOB dynamics, is the primary factor dampening Pacific low-frequency variance.

 Riverine plumes greatly shape ocean environments and ecosystems. The Changjiang River plume, widely spreading in the Yellow and East China Seas in summer, induces extremely low surface salinity and threatens local aquaculture and fisheries. Passage of tropical cyclones potentially increases surface salinity by stirring upper oceans, yet the extent of cyclones’ effects on the Changjiang River Plume extension and its mechanisms remains less explored.

 Models describing banded iron formation deposition beneath oxygenated Paleoproterozoic marine shelf waters assume that microaerophilic iron-oxidizing microorganisms were significant contributors. However, direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking, and it remains unclear how associated primary organic biomass and biogenic iron oxyhydroxides transformed into organic carbon-poor iron oxide/carbonate-rich bands in banded iron formations. Here we explore in situ modern Zetaproteobacterial iron-oxidizing mats thriving in the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field to develop an empirical model that explains the potential contribution of iron-based metabolisms to deposition of rocks resembling banded iron formations. Petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical data suggest that abundant production of Zetaproteobacterial stalks nucleates and drives spontaneous biotic/abiotic ferrihydrite precipitation in the mats. Subsequent early diagenetic anaerobic microbial oxidation of dead biomass as the mats aged, coupled to microbial reduction of iron oxyhydroxides/oxides, generates ferrous carbonates and mixed valence magnetite.

 Carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal technologies are pivotal for net-zero climate goals, requiring extensive carbon dioxide pipeline expansion across the U.S. However, as this network grows, concerns about safety and environmental justice intensify, due to insufficient regulations that may disproportionately expose marginalized communities to risks. Here, we empirically examine the environmental justice implications of existing and potential pipelines across communities. Using census-tract demographic data and pipeline spatial data, we applied LASSO regression to identify key demographic variables and incorporated them into binary logistic regression models to uncover if the locations of, and disadvantages associated with, carbon dioxide pipelines are equally distributed among different demographics. We find higher-income communities are less likely to host existing pipelines. Proposed pipelines are generally in areas with higher concentrations of Black residents, while areas with higher educational attainment show reduced likelihood. Using the Net Zero America study’s 2030 projection of carbon dioxide pipelines, we observe diminished impacts on higher-income and educated communities, although Black residents are less likely to have a pipeline in this scenario.

 Forest attribute maps relying on remotely sensed data are increasingly required for local decision-making related to the use of forest resources. Such maps always have uncertainty, which can be challenging to quantify. The objective of this work is to introduce the conformal prediction methodology to uncertainty quantification in forest attribute mapping, particularly for the k-NN method. We compare several conformal k-NN procedures for the mapping of total volume, broadleaved volume and Lorey’s height using Sentinel-2 satellite images and airborne laser scanning data. We show that all procedures produce valid prediction intervals in the sense that they contain the true value with the desired probability, for example 90%. We use multiple measures to quantify how well the prediction intervals adapt to the difficulty of prediction in different forest strata. We found that there are multiple methods for k-NN to produce prediction intervals competitive with those produced by conformal quantile regression. These methods include conformal prediction based on the standard deviation or quantiles of the k nearest neighbors with commonly used values of k. We present how to produce a forest attribute map with the proposed conformal prediction intervals. We also show a theoretical coverage guarantee for the jackknife conformal k-NN procedure.

 Remote sensing and artificial intelligence technology have propelled the development of precision agriculture and smart agriculture. Among them, as a crucial economic crop, tobacco has been rarely studied and its large-scale identification task has consistently encountered several challenges. Firstly, tobacco is often inter-cropped with other crops, such as corn. These crops have similar colors and textures, with only minor differences in planting spacing and arrangement. These slight differences become even less observable in remote sensing imagery. Secondly, tobacco growth is a continuous and evolving process, resulting in drastically different characteristics during various growth stages and seasons, which further complicates the task of identification. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no tobacco dataset is accessible to the public, impeding the development of a deep learning (DL) model with optimal performance. Therefore, a Large-scale UAV remote SEnsing Tobacco dataset (LUSET) which is the world’s first tobacco dataset with a total volume of 67GB has been conducted in this paper. 10 large-scale images in the LUSET are accurately annotated with an average resolution of about 20,000 × 20,000 pixels, which can be divided into 7,252 512 × 512 samples1. Then, a dual-branch ConvFlow Transformer is proposed to address tobacco’s rich diversity and high inter-class similarity among different crops. A novel Convolutional Feature-enhanced Multi-Head Self-attention (CF-MHSA) with a location-free design in the ConvFlow Transformer is developed to replace the value matrix in the standard attention with the convolutional multi-scale features, which effectively achieves feature interaction and fusion from the convolutional and transformer branches. The fusion of refined features allows us to better distinguish the texture characteristics of different crops and represent their morphological features during different growth cycles. This addresses the two major challenges in tobacco recognition. Extensive experiments on the UAV tobacco data proved that the strategy of ConvFlow Transformer can be easily achieved in the mainstream Transformers and significantly improve their performance in tobacco identification with a small amount of computation."

In species with a more “closed” system, rates of H+removal and Ca2+uptake are high and exceed the amount of ions required for calcification. This explains the relatively low Mg/Ca of the calcite of this species by dilution of the [Mg2+] in the calcifying fluid. Conversely, in species with a more open system, the H+and Ca2+fluxes are lower, with more seawater exchanged between the environment and calcifying fluid, explaining the relatively high Mg/Ca in these foraminifera. In either of these species, mitochondria were found to be located at the site where the Ca2+/H+exchange takes place and the mitochondrial density aligned with the rate of pumping. These findings highlight the crucial role of transmembrane transporters and mitochondria in foraminifera calcification and explain the species-specific elemental signatures."

Viral escape drives restriction factors to evolve rapidly at virus-binding interfaces to regain defense. Here, we explore how antiviral proteins balance restricting many viruses with evolving specificity against individual viruses. Human MxA uses its rapidly evolving loop L4 as the specificity determinant for orthomyxoviruses such as thogotovirus (THOV) and influenza (IAV). Previous combinatorial mutagenesis of rapidly evolving residues in human MxA loop L4 identified THOV “super-restrictors” and suggested an antiviral breadth-specificity trade-off. Using a modified combinatorial mutagenesis strategy, we find super-restrictor MxA variants specific to H5N1 IAV. A single L4 residue underlies the MxA breadth-specificity trade-off. However, rare “generalist” super-restrictors or a heterozygous combination of more common “specialist” super-restrictors can overcome the breadth-specificity trade-off. Our findings suggest that at least two strategies enable restriction factors such as MxA to increase their restriction of diverse viruses to overcome breadth-specificity trade-offs, which might be pervasive in host-virus conflicts."

In contrast, the circumglobal teleconnection, which historically dominated the continental-scale Eurasian heatwave occurrences, has shown no discernible trend amid global warming. Consequently, this emerging pattern signifies a radical shift in Eurasian heatwave-drought climatologies. The mechanism involves Rossby wave propagation linked to warming sea surface temperatures in the Northwestern Atlantic and enhanced Sahel precipitation, both amplified recently by overlapping effects of anthropogenic warming and natural variability.

However, decoding ITH in a noninvasive and comprehensive manner remains a notable challenge. In this study involving 851 patients from five centers, we developed a noninvasive prognostic classification for ITH using radiomics based on multisequence MRI, termed radiomics ITH (RITH) phenotypes. The RITH phenotypes highly correlated with prognosis and pathological ITH. In addition, through an integrated multi-omics analysis, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying RITH, notably enhancing its biological interpretability. Specifically, high-RITH tumors demonstrated an enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblasts and activation of extracellular matrix remodeling. Our approach facilitates the noninvasive refined classification of ITH using radiomics and multi-omics, paving the way for tailored treatment strategies in HCC. Extracellular matrix-receptor interaction could be a potential therapeutic target in patients with high-RITH tumors. Given the routine use of radiologic imaging in oncology, our methodology ignites versatile framework for broader application to other solid tumors."

Present treatments are mostly symptomatic and cause side effects due to systemic distribution; thus, targeted kidney drug delivery is desired. Transmembrane kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1) is expressed at low levels in normal kidneys but markedly up-regulated following injury, making it an ideal marker/target for injured kidneys. Here, assisted by AlphaFold, we constructed a library of 1885 peptides that target the extracellular Ig V domain of KIM1 based on interacting fragments from 47 potential KIM1 binding proteins followed by systemic optimization according to their binding energies with KIM1. Experimental validation of top candidates (TKP 1-5) demonstrated that TKP 4 efficiently targeted injured renal cells/kidneys, with its specificity demonstrated in KIM1 knockout cells/mice. TKP 4–decorating liposomes were loaded with nystatin, a renal-protective compound with systemic side effects, and efficiently targeted injured mouse kidneys and alleviated AKI. This work establishes a virtual platform to screen/identify drug delivery candidates with broad research/therapeutic potentials."

However, the underlying mechanism that coordinates the UFMylation and RQC pathways remains elusive. Structural analysis of ER-RQC intermediates revealed concomitant binding and direct interaction of the UFMylation and RQC machineries on the 60S. In the presence of an arrested peptidyl–transfer RNA, the RQC factor NEMF and the UFM1 E3 ligase (E3UFM1) form a direct interaction via the UFL1 subunit of E3UFM1, and UFL1 adopts a conformation distinct from that previously observed for posttermination 60S. While this concomitant binding occurs on translocon-bound 60S, LTN1 recruitment and arrest peptide degradation require UFMylation-dependent 60Sdissociation from the translocon. These data reveal a mechanism by which the UFMylation cycle orchestrates ER-RQC."

However, complex iPSC-NK (iNK) manufacturing challenges clinical use. Here, we identified LiPSC-GR1.1 as a superior iPSC line for iNK production. By engineering LiPSC-GR1.1 with a mesothelin (MSLN)–targeting CAR and interleukin-15 (IL-15), we achieved robust differentiation of iPSCs into mature activated iNK cells with enhanced tumor killing efficacy, superior tumor homing, and vigorous proliferation. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β)–producing tumor cells up-regulated major histocompatibility complex molecules and down-regulated MSLN post–CAR-IL-15 iNK treatment. Tumor-infiltrating CAR-IL-15 iNK cells exhibited high levels of CAR, IL-15, and NK-activating receptors, negligible checkpoint exhaustion markers, and extremely low levels of NK suppressive factorsCISH,TGFBR2, andBATF, enabling them to sustain activation, metabolic fitness, and effective tumor killing within TGF-β–rich hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Overall, we developed MSLN.CAR-IL-15–engineered GR1.1-iNK therapy with enhanced antitumor efficacy for solid tumor treatment."

Red blood cell (RBC) hitchhiking, a strategy in which nanoparticles are nonspecifically adsorbed to RBCs prior to administration, has been used to modulate nanoparticle biodistribution, enabling enrichment in organs immediately downstream from the site of vascular infusion. We find that scarcely investigated cellular determinants—namely, storage duration, membrane stiffness, and membrane-bound sialic acid quantity—substantially affect PACE nanoparticle adsorption efficiency. Following development of an optimized adsorption protocol, RBC hitchhiking was shown to enhance PACE nanoparticle cargo delivery to pulmonary tissue while also increasing exposure to other assayed organs. These findings inform future RBC hitchhiking study design, implicate cellular variables as potential obstacles or boons to clinical translation, and demonstrate the delivery of nucleic acids using this strategy with the PACE nanoparticle platform."

A promising solution is data compaction through contour extraction, visualizing only the outlines of objects while eliminating superfluous backgrounds. Here, we introduce an in-sensor multilevel image adjustment method using adjustable synaptic phototransistors, enabling the capture of well-defined images with optimal brightness and contrast suitable for achieving high-clarity contour extraction. This is enabled by emulating dopamine-mediated neuronal excitability regulation mechanisms. Electrostatic gating effect either facilitates or inhibits time-dependent photocurrent accumulation, adjusting photo-responses to varying lighting conditions. Through excitatory and inhibitory modes, the adjustable synaptic phototransistor enhances visibility of dim and bright regions, respectively, facilitating distinct contour extraction and high-accuracy semantic segmentation. Evaluations using road images demonstrate improvement of both object detection accuracy and intersection over union, and compression of data volume."

Here, we report on a device concept for infrared detection using organic thermoelectrics coupled to an infrared absorption film for heat generation. These short wavelength infrared (SWIR) detectors show an excellent area normalized responsivity of over 109milliampere per watt per square meter at 1 V, two to three orders of magnitude higher than the conjugated polymer SWIR detector reported in the literature and typical organic photodetectors in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range. Moreover, the devices show a fast switch-on time with an estimated 3-decibel frequency of over 610 kilohertz, making the device suitable for a wide range of applications. However, the specific detectivity of the current device concept is limited to 104Jones. We discuss strategies for improving the specific detectivities of these detectors with technology computer-aided design simulations."
