Numerical modeling is critical in understanding the nature of various dynamic deformation processes. This article introduces a newly developed open-source package, CitcomSVE-3.0, which efficiently solves the viscoelastic deformation of planetary bodies.

 Earth and other terrestrial and icy planetary bodies deform viscoelastically under various forces. Numerical modeling plays a critical role in understanding the nature of various dynamic deformation processes. This article introduces a newly developed open-source package, CitcomSVE-3.0, which efficiently solves the viscoelastic deformation of planetary bodies. Based on its predecessor, CitcomSVE-2.1, CitcomSVE-3.0 is updated to account for three-dimensional elastic compressibility and depth-dependent density, which are particularly important in modeling horizontal displacement for viscoelastic deformation. We benchmark CitcomSVE-3.0 against a semi-analytical code for two types of loading problems: (1) single harmonic loads on the surface or as a tidal force and (2) the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) problem with a realistic ice sheet loading history (ICE-6G_D) and an updated version of sea level equations. The benchmark results presented here demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this package. CitcomSVE-3.0 shows second-order accuracy in terms of spatial resolution. For typical GIA modeling with a 122 kyr glaciation–deglaciation history, a surface horizontal resolution of ∼50 km, and a time increment of 125 years, this takes ∼3 h on 384 CPU cores to complete, with displacement rate errors of less than 5 %."

Ford,Dimensionless Parameters Define Criteria for Optimal Flow Velocity in Enhancing Chemotactic Response toward Residual Contaminants in Porous Media,"Chemotactic bacteria may overcome challenges posed by nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants of low solubility in groundwater and limited bioavailability in tight pores by preferentially migrating to NAPL sources. We explored the transport of chemotactic bacteria to NAPL ganglia at varying pore water velocities in a dual-permeability microfluidic device and using computer-simulated solutions of transport equations. In our experiments, bacteria exhibited a chemotactic response toward NAPL ganglia at the junctures of low- and high-permeability regions (i.e., micropockets), and the extent of retention initially increased with velocity and then decreased at the highest velocity. A dimensional analysis revealed that maximum accumulations occurred at moderate values of the Péclet number Pec=vmdpχo ∼10 in our system. We also found that accumulation dynamics in micropockets can be represented by a logistic equation incorporating convection and chemotaxis time scales τf=Livf and τche=la2χo, respectively. By analyzing seven literature studies on chemotaxis, we identified an exposure time scale to chemicals τexp=dpvf that was useful for evaluating the chemotaxis efficiency. Our study provided unique insights into the effect of fluid flow on chemotaxis in porous media by demonstrating that increasing the fluid velocity to some extent can promote chemotaxis. The dimensionless parameters inform the design of efficient bioremediation strategies for contaminated porous media."

It is highly relevant for climate projections to represent the ice formation in these clouds. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the sources of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) that enable primary ice formation. Here, we report polysaccharides produced by four different aquatic eukaryotic microorganisms (Thraustochytrium striatum, Tausonia pullulans, Naganishia diffluens, Penicillium chrysogenum) as responsible ice-nucleating macromolecules (INMs) in these samples originating from the marine biosphere. By deriving a classical nucleation theory-based parametrization of these polysaccharidic INMs and applying it to global model simulations, a comparison to currently available marine atmospheric INP observations demonstrates a 44% contribution of polysaccharides to the total INPs of marine origin within −15 to −20 °C. The results highlight the relevance of biological INMs as part of the INP population in remote marine regions."

A systematic approach is used from the field of prospective life-cycle assessment, which is based on systems thinking, to develop scenarios for the Austrian building stock that consider life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The influential parameters of the model are identified; their interactions are classified; quantitative future assumptions are adopted; and five scenario narratives are created. A maximum emission reduction of 90% from 2023 to 2050 is revealed. In comparison, leaving current policies in place would lead to a trajectory that reduces emissions by only 66%. Three additional scenarios achieve emission reductions between 84 and 86% by 2050, which may be compatible with the 2 °C carbon budget using an equal-per-capita approach. These scenarios represent different societal choices based on ambitious sufficiency (e.g., behavioral change), technological measures (e.g., a change in the industry), or both, with less effort from all actors. To ensure that Austria contributes to staying within the remaining carbon budget, policy makers are urged to systematically and quickly incorporate sufficiency into their policies and enable the necessary investments in carbon dioxide removal technologies."

Hower;Heileen Hsu-Kim,Predictive Assessment of the Chemical Composition of Coal Ash in Reserve at U.S. Disposal Sites,"In the United States, more than 2 Gt of coal combustion residuals (i.e., coal ash) are stored in hundreds of disposal units. Recent federal regulations mandate the closure or retrofitting of most coal ash impoundments, presenting significant challenges for waste management. These regulatory pressures also present opportunities to reuse coal ash. However, the quality and quantity of discarded coal ash across the U.S. are not well known, even though this information is crucial for spurring its reuse for conventional and new material applications. This study describes a predictive model for the major element composition of coal ash in reserve at disposal sites of major U.S. coal-fired power plants. This model was constructed from coal purchase records of 705 power stations from 1973 to 2022 and was trained on coal ash composition data, showing that coal ash elemental composition is strongly associated with the source of feedstock coal. The model showed regional shifts in the major element contents of ash produced by power plants in the last 50 years, particularly for calcium and iron (expressed as %CaO and %Fe2O3), as power stations changed their source of coal over this time frame. Our approach enables an estimation of chemical composition for ash stored in waste impoundments at individual power stations. Such information can help to delineate the regional market resource potential of supplementary cements for concrete and other material innovations that would utilize coal ash harvested from disposal sites across the U.S."

Their foraging behaviors are essential to colony sustainability. Sublethal exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids can significantly disrupt these behaviors, in particular pollen foraging. We investigated the effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honeybee foraging, at both individual and colony levels, by integrating field experiments with artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring technology and mechanistic simulations using the BEEHAVE model. Our results replicated previous findings, which showed that imidacloprid selectively reduces pollen foraging at the colony level, with minimal impact on nectar foraging. Individually marked exposed honeybees exhibited prolonged pollen foraging trips, reduced pollen foraging frequency, and instances of drifting pollen foraging trips, likely due to impaired cognitive functions and altered metabolism. These behavioral changes at the individual level corroborated the previous model predictions derived from BEEHAVE, which highlights the value of combining experimental and simulation approaches to disentangle underlying mechanisms through which sublethal effects on individual foragers scale up to impact colony dynamics. Our findings have implications for future pesticide risk assessment, as we provide a robust feeding study design for evaluating pesticide effects on honeybee colonies and foraging in real landscapes, which could improve the realism of higher-tier ecological risk assessment."

A key aspect of this process is the accurate measurement of critical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, current spectroscopic methods struggle with accurately and consistently measuring COD in large-scale, complex water environments due to an insufficient understanding of water spectra and limited generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce the physicochemical-informed spectral Transformer (PIST) model, combined with ultraviolet–visible-shortwave-near-infrared (UV–vis-SWNIR) spectroscopy for water quality sensing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to combine Transformer with spectroscopy for water quality sensing. PIST integrates a physicochemical-informed block to incorporate existing physical and chemical information into the spectral encoding for domain adaptation, along with a feature embedding block for comprehensive spectral features extraction. We validated PIST using an actual surface water spectral data set with extensive geographic coverage including the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. PIST demonstrated notable performance in COD sensing within complex water environments, achieving an impressive R2 value of 0.9008 and reducing root mean squared error (RMSE) by 45.20% and 29.38% compared to benchmark models such as support vector regression (SVR) and convolutional neural network (CNN). These results emphasize PIST’s accuracy and generalizability, marking a significant advancement in multidisciplinary approaches that combine spectroscopy with deep learning for rapid water quality sensing."

Ren;Robert E. Todd,Springtime Warming by Ocean Advection in the Gulf Stream,The Gulf Stream transports heat from the tropics poleward and is an integral part of how the planet redistributes heat. Studies of the variability of the Gulf Stream have suggested that the seasonal cycle of ocean mixed layer heat content in the Gulf Stream may be driven by the local net atmospheric heat flux or by oceanic advection of heat in the strong western boundary current. Here we use sustained underwater glider observations of the Gulf Stream from 80° ${}^{\circ}$W to 67° ${}^{\circ}$W during 2015–2023 to show that oceanic advection heats the ocean mixed layer in spring when the upper ocean switches from cooling to warming. Estimated terms of the mixed layer temperature budget demonstrate that the net atmospheric heat flux cools the upper ocean in all seasons except summer and that mixed layer warming in spring is due to ocean advection of heat from farther south.

However, determining the high‐degree gravity field, essential for understanding small‐scale atmospheric dynamics, is challenging due to the limited spatial coverage of Cassini's periapses. To overcome this limitation, we employed Slepian functions, orthogonal within a bounded domain, to represent Saturn's localized high‐degree gravity field. Focusing on latitudes from 32°S to 32°N, we estimated Slepian coefficients that represent short‐scale latitudinal gravity variations. The reconstructed wind profile that explains low‐degree harmonics can also reproduce these high‐degree variations, assuming Saturn's atmosphere is, to first order, in thermal wind balance. Our findings suggest that small‐scale winds may extend to depths between 7,000 km and 9,000 km, providing strong evidence that Saturn's zonal flows are oriented along coaxial cylinders, rotating at different angular velocities."

Previous studies of urban warming signals and asymmetries remain a subject of debate. Here we comprehensively assess urban‐induced warmings by investigating meteorological temperatures on 2,370 stations in China during 1980–2022. There are noticeable urban‐induced annual warming biases and contributions ranging from 0.016 to 0.251°C decade−1 and 0.3%–72.4%, primarily due to spatiotemporal heterogeneities and the criteria defining urban sites. Rapid urbanization tends to exacerbate diurnal and seasonal warming asymmetries, resulting in shrinking temperature differentials associated with urbanized areas and urbanization chronosequences. This study underscores that the specific definition of urban areas matters for warming biases in magnitude and complex nonlinear urbanization imprint on warming asymmetries."

Here we report a gradual disappearance of the cross‐seasonal ENSO‐TPUW teleconnection since the early‐2000s, with correlation decreasing from 0.75 to near zero. Before the early‐2000s, the anomalous western North Pacific (WNP) anticyclone (WNPAC) induced by ENSO can last from winter to summer under the maintenance of Indo‐western Pacific surface seawater temperature gradient (IWPSSTG), prompting the WNP subtropical high to expand and strengthen toward South Asia, attracting the Tibet Plateau subtropical high southward, thereby causing the subtropical westerly jet to move southward and forming a cross‐seasonal ENSO‐TPUW teleconnection. However, given the prominent tropical WNP warming since the early‐2000s, the early‐summer outage of IWPSSTG and WNPAC disrupts the ENSO‐TPUW chain.

The magnetic field at the shock ramp has a large gradient, where upstream electrons and ions are separated due to their different gyro‐radius. This charge separation induces a sub‐ion scale electric field at the shock ramp. The electric drift of electrons in this field can induce an electron shear flow, resulting in the excitation of Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability and the generation of electron vortices. These vortices further cause charge separation at their centers, resulting in a large electrostatic field. The electrons trapped in these vortices can gain energy from the parallel component of the electric field, which eventually leads to field‐aligned electron beams.

Seneviratne,Spectral Decomposition and Signal Separation of Climate Responses to Land Cover Changes,"While large‐scale afforestation and reforestation are heavily discussed as strategies for nature‐based climate change mitigation and adaptation, massive deforestation is ongoing. Such widespread land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) do not only alter the global climate through biomass carbon uptake or release but also through biogeophysical (BGP) processes related to changes in surface roughness, evaporation, transpiration, and albedo. These BGP effects act as local forcing to land‐atmosphere interactions and lead to in situ climate responses. Caused by advection and spatio‐temporal land‐atmosphere‐ocean interaction, they also generate non‐local climate responses that occur remotely from the LULCC. How the non‐local partition of climate response signals emerges at different spatial scales than its forcing is still object of ongoing research. Here, we present a spectral perspective on climate responses to LULCC forcing that aids in achieving systematic understanding. We introduce spectral decomposition of forcing and response fields into a sum of signals with different wavelengths based on spherical harmonics to compare the two fields across spatial scales. Building on this approach, we develop a novel tool called SCISSOR, a Spectral ClImate Signal SeparatOR to define the cross‐scale response signal from the difference of response and forcing spectra. The cross‐scale signal of BGP‐driven temperature response to deforestation strongly resembles the non‐local signal as estimated by the established moving window regression and checkerboard interpolation. We show the utility of spectral methods for model intercomparison and assess their potential for future studies aiming to understand the complex interaction between climate and land surface changes."

Clarifying the representativeness scale of meteorological stations promotes further research on global warming. The study improved the method used to obtain representativeness scale through spatial heterogeneity. The root mean square error instead of standard deviation was used to derive spatial heterogeneity, which represents the degree of dispersion of all pixels within the region to station point observations. The new method provided a more logical representativeness scale with a temporal series to investigate its variability and trend. The satellite land surface temperature retrievals at 1‐km resolution was used to calculate spatial heterogeneity in the commonly used grid scale (∼1°), and thus, representativeness scale can be calculated with a certain threshold (0.5°C and 1.0°C). This study focuses on nighttime for the similarity between surface temperature and air temperature because both are controlled by surface longwave radiative cooling during the nighttime. The national mean representativeness scale is ∼7 km (0.5°C threshold) and ∼16 km (1°C threshold). Meteorological stations in the western China showed higher spatial heterogeneity than eastern China. From 2001 to 2021, the representativeness scale of meteorological stations in China showed decreasing trends. The inhomogeneous warming caused by urbanization around station increased spatial heterogeneity and decreased representativeness. The conclusions derived here is only suitable for nighttime and the representativeness scale of air temperature was expected much higher during daytime due to turbulent exchange."

However, ground observation stations are sparsely and unevenly distributed in Antarctica, and reanalysis and satellite data often exhibit errors, making it challenging to accurately monitor surface albedo. This study integrates nine automatic weather station data along PANDA transect, ERA5‐Land reanalysis, and MCD43C3 product, utilizing a dual‐layer stacking ensemble approach that incorporates various machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The results indicate that stacking model achieves the best accuracy along the 1,200 km PANDA transect from Zhongshan Station to Dome A, demonstrating high correlation (Corr = 0.939) and low error metrics (MSE = 0.004, MAE = 0.047, RMSE = 0.064). Additionally, optimal models were developed individually for each station, which provided accurate daily albedo predictions from 2004 through 2023 for nine stations in East Antarctica. Compared to albedo products such as ERA5‐Land (Bias = 0.1217) and MCD43C3 (Bias = 0.0591), the data set constructed demonstrates higher accuracy with a Bias of 0.0041, underscoring the superior generalization of the machine learning models.

This study analyzed the seasonal variations of CO over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using surface and satellite observations, focusing on the impact of transport processes on the three‐dimensional distribution of CO across the TP and surrounding regions. Unlike regions with significant surface emissions, the TP exhibited opposing seasonal patterns and a negative correlation between surface CO and CO total columns (COTC). Surface CO peaked in winter/spring, while COTC peaked in summer, due to different contributions of transport processes at various altitudes. CO from tropical biomass burning was transported up and north by the Hadley circulation, increasing CO concentrations with altitude over the TP, except for winter, when CO stayed uniform within the troposphere, indicating seasonal variations in transport. During winter/spring, downdrafts transported high CO concentrations to the lower troposphere, where it was efficiently removed by strong winter westerlies. In summer/autumn, strong convection lifted surface CO from India and Southeast Asia into the upper troposphere over the TP. These findings indicated that high COTC over the TP and other regions influenced by similar circulations should not be misinterpreted as surface air pollution. Furthermore, using low CO as an indicator of stratospheric intrusion as in current studies might be unsuitable for tropical/subtropical regions where CO was elevated near the tropopause. Future research should further explore these transport mechanisms and their broader implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate dynamics over the TP."

The western region (WNC) serves as a positive precipitation anomaly center, contrasting with the eastern region (ENC) as a negative anomaly center. This precipitation disparity is largely due to contrasting dynamic and moisture conditions between these regions, influenced by a quasi‐barotropic anomalous cyclonic circulation over Central Asia and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Mongolia. Further analysis reveals that land and oceanic processes are pivotal in modulating this precipitation pattern. Specifically, soil moisture anomalies over Eurasia and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific are critical. In August, Eurasian soil moisture anomalies influence the local thermal processes, leading to eastward‐propagating Rossby wave circulations. Simultaneously, SST anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific initiate an anomalous meridional Pacific‐Japan (PJ) wave train. These circulation anomalies induce opposing conditions that promote precipitation in WNC and suppress it in ENC, thus establishing the observed out‐of‐phase precipitation pattern. In our study, Eurasian soil moisture and Pacific SST anomalies contribute approximately 44.9% and 21.2%, respectively, to the linear variance of precipitation pattern, collectively accounting for around 54.8% of the observed variation. Further investigation is required to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon."

Here, the authors report a synthesis of (hetero)aryl sulfoximines via copper-catalysed coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides and sulfenamides. 
 The (hetero)aryl sulfoximines are important structures for developing bioactive molecules, whose synthesis relies on oxidation of (hetero)aryl sulfilimines. However, asymmetric approaches for assembling (hetero)aryl sulfilimines are still rare. Here we show that combination of CuI and NOBIN-derived amide ligands offers an effective catalytic system for enantioselective coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with sulfenamides. A large number of functional groups and heterocycles are tolerated under the coupling conditions, providing a powerful approach for diverse synthesis of enantioenriched (hetero)aryl sulfilimines. The efficiency of the coupling reaction is highly dependent on the electronic nature of (hetero)aryl iodides and sulfenamides. Both (hetero)aryl- and some bulky alkyl-substituted sulfenamides give excellent enantioselectivities, while sulfenamides with smaller alkyl substituents lead to the formation of the (hetero)aryl sulfilimines with moderate enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that proper steric repulsions in the transition states of the intramolecular SNAr reaction are crucial for achieving desirable enantioselectivity.

 Harnessing the power of immune system to treat cancer has become a core clinical approach. However, rewiring of intrinsic circuitry by genomic alterations enables tumor cells to escape immune surveillance, leading to therapeutic failure. Uncovering the molecular basis of how tumor mutations induce therapeutic resistance may guide the development of intervention approaches to advance precision immunotherapy. Here we report the identification of the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1)-Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP)- Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) dynamic complex as a molecular determinant for immune response of LKB1-mut lung cancer cells. LKB1 alteration exposes a critical dependency of lung cancer cells on IAP for their immune resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of IAP re-establishes JAK1-regulated Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) expression and DNA sensing signaling, enhances cytotoxic immune cell infiltration, and augmentes immune-dependent anti-tumor activity in an LKB1-mutant immune-competent mouse model. Thus, IAP-JAK1-targeted strategies, like IAP inhibitors, may offer a promising therapeutic approach to restore the responsiveness of immunologically-cold LKB1-mutant tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors or STING-directed therapies.

 Countries are urged to advance the energy transition in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, yet the appropriate pathway remains unclear. Using a provincial-level, hourly-dispatched power system model of China that incorporates intertemporal decisions on early retirement and carbon capture retrofitting, our study reveals that for coal-rich but gas-poor economies, repositioning coal power from a baseload resource to a flexibility provider can accelerate net-zero transition of the power system in three aspects. First, when achieving the same emissions reduction target, it mitigates stranded assets by decreasing the average lifespan loss of coal power by 7.9-9.6 years and enhancing the long-term competitiveness of retrofitted coal power. Second, it enables the integration of an additional 194-245 gigawatts of variable renewables by 2030 under the same carbon emissions reduction trajectory. Third, it reduces China’s power system transition costs by approximately 176 billion U.S. Dollars, particularly in the face of costly gas power and energy storage technologies. These robust findings underscore the need for appropriate policies to incentivize the flexible dispatch, orderly retirement, and carbon capture retrofitting of coal power, thereby accelerating the decarbonization of China’s power system.

 Here are described the dilution-driven gel-sol-gel-sol transitions in aromatic hydrotrope/zwitterionic surfactant bi-component aqueous mixtures. Long and entangled wormlike micelles (WLMs) of concentrated erucyl dimethyl amidopropyl betaine (EAPB) solutions sequentially transform into hexagonal liquid crystal phase (H1), highly concentrated spherical micelles (HCSMs), and finally hexagonal close packed micellar phase (HCP) upon gradual introducing an aromatic hydrotrope, sodium salicylate (NaSal). The HCP then successively converts into HCSMs, WLMs, and spherical micelles (SMs) upon further dilution with water, corresponding to a gel-sol-gel-sol transition. This dilution-induced HCSMs to WLMs transition results in an interesting thickening process, which is caused by a slow kinetic process, from the agglomeration and recombination of SMs to long and rigid WLMs via the intermediately formed rodlike micelles. In this work, the sustained adjustment of the competitive self-sorting and co-assembly between hydrotropes and surfactants by dilution was identified, benefitting the creation and application of WLMs fluids with switchable viscosity.

 High-quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra can be rapidly acquired by combining non-uniform sampling techniques (NUS) with reconstruction algorithms. However, current deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods focus only on single-domain reconstruction (time or frequency domain), leading to drawbacks like peak loss and artifact peaks and ultimately failing to achieve optimal performance. Moreover, the lack of fully sampled spectra makes it difficult, even impossible, to determine the quality of reconstructed spectra, presenting challenges in the practical applications of NUS. In this study, a joint time-frequency domain deep learning network, referred to as JTF-Net, is proposed. It effectively combines time domain and frequency domain features, exhibiting better reconstruction performance on protein spectra across various dimensions compared to traditional algorithms and single-domain DL methods. In addition, the reference-free quality assessment metric, denoted as REconstruction QUalIty assuRancE Ratio (REQUIRER), is proposed base on an established quality space in the field of NMR spectral reconstruction. The metric is capable of evaluating the quality of reconstructed NMR spectra without the fully sampled spectra, making it more suitable for practical applications.

Multivariable analysis and the second online survey for patients with heightened regret confirm that postoperative lower thyroid cancer-specific quality of life (QoL) (scar and psychology) (75.5%) is the most common factor for heightened regret of thyroidectomy, followed by preoperative understanding of disease [not at all] (15.0%), presentation of complications (3.8%) and other factors (5.7%).

 The pursuit of advanced battery chemistries with enhanced energy density necessitates the exploration of new materials, a process intricately tied to synthesis science. Despite the promise of O3-type sodium oxygen anionic redox cathodes as high-capacity materials, their development has been severely hindered by a lack of understanding regarding synthetic mechanisms. Here, we elucidate the pivotal role of atmospheric conditions, particularly oxygen content, in the synthesis of such materials by synchronizing multiple operando characterization techniques to monitor changes in both solid and gaseous components. Utilizing the O3-Na[Li1/3Mn2/3]O2 system as a model, we demonstrate that a low oxygen environment is essential and the reaction is highly complex as evidenced by multiple oxygen uptake and release processes, resulting in numerous intermediates. This behavior contrasts sharply with Na-Mn-O and Li-Mn-O ternary systems which show less significant oxygen dynamics, underscoring the unique reaction mechanism within the Na-Li-Mn-O system. We further adopt a dynamic controlled atmosphere approach to modulate oxygen concentration and demonstrate successful synthesis of Ti-substituted NaLi1/3Mn2/3-xTixO2 materials, all exhibiting capacities surpassing 190 mAh g-1.

 Polar skyrmions are topologically nontrivial polarization textures that demonstrate exotic physical phenomena and novel memory applications. Thus far, these textures have primarily been reported in oxide-ferroelectric-based epitaxial heterostructures because their stabilization requires an elastic energy penalty from the epitaxial strains. Here, without the epitaxial-strain engineering, we discover polar skyrmion bubbles in stand-alone van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 crystal through the combination of piezoelectric force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and phase-field simulations. In a thick CuInP2S6 flake of over −100 nm, skyrmion bubbles feature an elliptical hedgehog-like state with center-divergent or center-convergent configurations. Progressively thinning the flake thickness to −8 nm allows a topological transition from elliptical to circular skyrmionic patterns. Interestingly, the skyrmions can be switched with the change in helicity by probe-applied electrical and mechanical stimuli, which is distinct from the creation and annihilation of other reported skyrmions. Both theoretical and experimental data proves that the formation and thickness-dependence of skyrmion textures primarily stem from charge-related energy penalty. This work opens up a new material system (i.e., two-dimensional layered ferroionic materials) for exploring uncharted polar-topology physics and prospective neuromorphic devices.

 Detecting strike-slip tectonics using thermochronology is challenging because the complex relative motion between fault blocks often does not substantially displace the vertical stratigraphy provided by thermochronological ages. Here we investigate the strike-slip tectonics in the Yangtze Block, South China, based on an original conceptual model and the zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) analysis of 17 sandstone samples. We exploit as a marker the northwestward trend of progressively decreasing ZHe ages generated by Mesozoic northwestward shortening. The ZHe age trend is broken by evident steps, which are also found in other published thermochronological datasets. We interpret these age steps as marking a previously undetected Late Cretaceous left-lateral strike-slip fault which intersects with prior deformation-propagation direction. Our approach to detect strike-slip faults confirms a major change in the subduction direction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath Eurasia during the Late Cretaceous, and can find applications to other regions where thermochronological ages define suitable dipping markers.

 While air pollution from most U.S. sources has decreased, emissions from wildland fires have risen. Here, we use an integrated assessment model to estimate that wildfire and prescribed burn smoke caused $200 billion in health damages in 2017, associated with 20,000 premature deaths. Nearly half of this damage came from wildfires, predominantly in the West, with the remainder from prescribed burns, mostly in the Southeast.

 Coral bleaching events from thermal stress are increasing globally in duration, frequency, and intensity. While bleaching can cause mortality, some corals survive, reacquire symbionts, and recover. We experimentally bleached Montipora capitata to examine molecular and physiological differences between corals that recover (resilient) and those that die (susceptible). Corals were collected and monitored for eight months post-bleaching to identify genets with long-term resilience. Using an integrated systems-biology approach that included quantitative proteomics, 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the coral microbiome, total coral lipids, symbiont community composition and density, we explored molecular-level mechanisms of tolerance in corals pre- and post-bleaching. Prior to thermal stress, resilient corals have a more diverse microbiome and abundant proteins essential for carbon acquisition, symbiont retention, and pathogen resistance. Protein signatures of susceptible corals showed early symbiont rejection and utilized urea for carbon and nitrogen. Our results reveal molecular factors for surviving bleaching events and identify diagnostic protein biomarkers for reef management and restoration.

 Peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) represent one of the world’s largest reservoirs of soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but their future stability is uncertain. This study utilizes high-resolution multi-core records of C and N contents, stable isotopes, and infrared spectroscopy to reconstruct water table depths and their impacts on C and N accumulation and decomposition over the past 2.7 kyr in a slope peatland from the central QTP. Our paleo records reveal that increased decomposition in the surface oxic layer has led to decreased C and N accumulation rates over the last millennium, primarily due to water-table drawdown driven by climate warming and drying. Supporting evidence from nearby records suggests that this trend of surface drying may be widespread across QTP peatlands. Despite this, QTP peatlands retain some of the highest 1-m C and N densities globally, with values of 54.1 ± 18.9 kg C m-2 and 3.2 ± 1.5 kg N m-2. These findings highlight the vulnerability of substantial C and N reservoirs and sequestration capabilities in QTP peatlands to continued water table declines in a warming and drying climate.

 Snow cover can significantly alter the energy fluxes that take part on the surface energy balance (SEB), which subsequently affects surface air temperature. However, studies of the influence of snow cover on the SEB are scarce due to limited observational data and usually constrained to high altitudes or mountainous areas. In this study, the SEB is analysed under two differentiated land surface conditions: with and without snow cover, for a non-mountainous region in the midlatitudes. This is done in order to analyse the physical processes leading to one of the most extreme and disruptive cold waves of the present century in Spain. The cold wave took place in January 2021 after historical snowstorm Filomena left widespread snowfall amounts of 30–50 cm in the interior of Spain. By means of analysis of in-situ observational data from a micrometeorological tower and synoptic fields, we determine the contribution of synoptic and microscale processes to the extremely cold surface air temperatures recorded. The SEB analysis reveals the decisive role of snow cover in the cold wave. Surface albedo increased from 20 % to 80 %, leading to a 60 % decrease in the surface net radiative flux. Together with weak turbulence conditions due to weak synoptic forcing, this allowed extraordinarily low surface air temperatures. Thus, this event stands out from the typical pattern leading to cold waves in this region, characterised by cold air advection. This study highlights the importance of having observational data of micrometeorological variables, which have proven very insightful into the physical mechanisms contributing to the cold wave."

 Based on multiple datasets, the spring rainy season onset (RSO) date over southern China is objectively determined and validated, and the relationship between RSO and tropical Pacific SST is then explored. The RSO date is defined as the time when the cumulative precipitation departure over southern China reaches its minimum value, with a climatological onset date of March 14 and a standard deviation of 22 days. The RSO is closely linked to the sudden changes in atmospheric circulations and abrupt emergence of rainfall and convection, displaying strong interannual variability. An early RSO is characterized by an increase in rainfall during February and March, and is associated with a zonal sea surface temperature (SST) dipole in the tropical Pacific. This is because the concurrent cooler SST in the tropical Western Pacific triggers lower-tropospheric southwesterly wind anomalies over the western North Pacific through Matsuno-Gill-type Rossby wave response. These wind anomalies then enhance water vapor transport and warm advection towards southern China, which, in turn, fosters anomalous upward motion combined with vorticity advection. Such anomalous ascending motion is favorable for the increased precipitation and the advanced RSO over southern China."

Several ASD mouse models (Scn2a+/−,Fmr1−/−,Cdkl5−/−) exhibit impaired spatial learning, with these deficits often attributed to hippocampal dysfunction. However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wideScn2areduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen inScn2a+/−mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediatedScn2areduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits inScn2a+/−mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments inFmr1andCdkl5knockout mice. Thus, in several genetic models of ASD, PRC abnormalities may disrupt hippocampal function to impair learning and memory."
