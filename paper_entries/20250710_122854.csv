Biomass burning was identified to be the primary source of these aromatic compounds, particularly for PAHs. Phenol and nitrobenzene are two main primary precursors for 4NP, with phenol showing lower reaction barriers. P-Cresol was identified as the primary precursor for the formation of 4-methyl-5-nitrocatechol. 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs), and nitrophenols (NPs) are essential aromatic compounds that significantly affect both climate and human health. However, their sources and formation mechanisms, particularly for NPs, remain poorly understood. This study determined the concentration profiles and the main formation mechanisms of these substance classes in PM2.5 from Dongying, based on field observations and quantum chemical calculations. The daily concentrations of ∑13PAHs during heating were more than twice higher compared to those before the heating period. Benzo(b)fluoranthene was identified as the primary PAHs species. The average concentration of ∑8OPAHs reached 351 ng m−3, with significantly increased concentrations observed during the heating season (15 November–6 December 2021) wherein 1-Naphthaldehyde (1-NapA) emerged as the most prevalent OPAH species. Concentrations of ∑9NPs increased approximately 1.2 times during the heating, with 4-methyl-5-nitrocatechol (4M5NC) having the highest concentration. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis identified biomass burning to be the primary source of these aromatic compounds, particularly for PAHs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that phenol and nitrobenzene are two main primary precursors for 4-nitrophenol, with phenol showing lower reaction barriers, and P-Cresol was identified as the primary precursor for the formation of 4M5NC. This study provides the first detailed investigation of the sources and formation mechanisms of aromatic compounds in the atmosphere of petrochemical cities, using Dongying in the Yellow River Delta as a representative case study. This investigation may provide fundamental insights and important guidance for reducing emissions of aromatic compounds in similar atmospheric environments."

Simulations of the high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) were evaluated using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and satellite measurements. This work highlights gaps in current models, like missing sources of key organic compounds and inaccuracies in emission inventories, emphasizing the importance of improving chemical and dynamical processes in atmospheric modelling for budget estimates in tropical regions. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) act as precursors to ozone and secondary organic aerosols, which have significant health and environmental impacts. They can also reduce the atmospheric oxidative capacity. However, their budget remains poorly quantified, especially over remote areas such as the tropical oceans. Here, we present high-resolution simulations of atmospheric composition over Réunion Island, located in the Indian Ocean, using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The coexistence and spatial heterogeneity of anthropogenic and biogenic emission sources in this region present a valuable but challenging test of the model performance. The WRF-Chem model is evaluated against several observational datasets, including proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) measurements of VOCs and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) at the Maïdo Observatory, Réunion Island (2160 m above sea level), in January and July 2019, representing austral summer and winter, respectively, and capturing the seasonal extremes for the region. While the primary goal of our study is to gain a better understanding of the (O)VOC budget at remote tropical latitudes, important model refinements have been made to improve the model performance, including the implementation of high-resolution anthropogenic and biogenic isoprene emissions, updates to the chemical mechanism, and adjustments to the boundary conditions. These refinements are supported by comparisons with PTR-MS data as well as with meteorological measurements at Maïdo; in situ NOx and O3 measurements from the air quality Atmo-Réunion network; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of O3, CO, ethane, and several OVOCs, also at Maïdo; and satellite retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).TROPOMI NO2 data suggest that anthropogenic emissions, particularly from power plants near Le Port, dominate NOx levels over the island. Both TROPOMI and in situ surface NO2 comparisons are used to adjust the power plant emissions at Le Port. Surface ozone concentrations are overestimated by ∼6 ppbv on average, likely due to the neglect of halogen chemistry in the model, though other factors may also contribute. While modelled NO2 over oceans is too low in summer when the lightning source is excluded, including this source results in model overestimations, as corroborated by comparisons with upper tropospheric NO2 mixing ratios derived from TROPOMI using the cloud-slicing technique (Marais et al., 2021). The model generally succeeds in reproducing the PTR-MS isoprene and its oxidation products (Iox), except for a moderate underestimation (∼30 %) of noontime isoprene concentrations, and modelled concentration peaks near dawn and dusk, which are not seen in the observations. The ratio of Iox to isoprene (0.8 at noon in January) is fairly well reproduced by the model. The methanol and monoterpenes observations both suggest overestimations of their biogenic emissions, by factors of about 2 and 5, respectively. Acetaldehyde anthropogenic emissions are likely strongly overestimated, due to the lumping of higher aldehydes into this compound. Without this lumping, the modelled acetaldehyde would be underestimated by almost one order of magnitude, suggesting the existence of a large missing source, likely photochemical. The comparisons suggest the existence of a biogenic source of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), equivalent to about 3 % of isoprene emissions, likely associated with the dry deposition and conversion of key isoprene oxidation products to MEK. A strong model underestimation of the PTR-MS signal at mass 61 is also found, by a factor of 3–5 during daytime, consistent with previously reported missing sources of acetic and peracetic acid."
10.5194/acp-25-6881-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了热带西太平洋地区空气从对流层向平流层上升的现象，重点关注了“冷阱”效应。研究利用激光雷达和无线电探空仪观测以及轨迹模拟，分析了冬季和夏季空气质量的垂直运动模式。冬季，空气上升并因低温而干燥，进入平流层；夏季，空气在云形成后倾向于下沉。该过程影响平流层的水汽含量，进而影响温室效应和气候。研究结果强调了冷阱在驱动空气质量传输和水汽转化中的重要作用，与大气环境遥感技术，特别是大气成分分析密切相关。,"['water vapor', 'stratosphere', 'troposphere', 'lidar', 'radiosonde', 'cirrus clouds', 'atmospheric composition', 'UTLS (upper troposphere and lower stratosphere)']",Xiaoyu Sun;Katrin Müller;Mathias Palm;Christoph Ritter;Denghui Ji;Tim Balthasar Röpke;Justus Notholt,Evidence of tropospheric uplift into the stratosphere via the tropical western Pacific cold trap,"We studied how air moves from the lower atmosphere to the stratosphere over the tropical western Pacific. Using observations and air tracking, we found that, in winter, air ascends and cold temperatures freeze water out, drying it before it enters the stratosphere. In summer, air tends to sink after cloud formation. This process affects water vapor amounts in the stratosphere, influencing the greenhouse effect and climate. 
 Understanding air mass sources and transport pathways in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) is crucial for determining the origins of atmospheric constituents in the stratosphere. This study uses lidar and balloon observations in Koror, Palau, and trajectory simulations to study the upward transport pathway over the TWP in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). During Northern Hemisphere winter, the region experiences the highest relative humidity and the lowest temperatures (<185 K) at 16–18 km, and is called the “cold trap.”  These conditions lead to water vapor condensation, forming thin cirrus clouds, which can be measured as an indicator of the ascent of air masses. A representative example from December 2018 shows a subvisible cirrus cloud layer (optical depth, <0.03) measured by lidar coinciding with high supersaturation observed by radiosonde. Trajectories initiated from the cloud layers confirm that air masses primarily ascend slowly from the troposphere into the stratosphere  during Northern Hemisphere winter. In contrast, lidar measurements show similar cloud layers during a summer case (August 2022) with warmer temperatures and drier conditions, where air descends after cloud formation, as indicated by the trajectory results. For all cirrus clouds observed in December and August, 46 % of air masses rise above 380 K after cloud formation in December, compared with only 5 % in August, possibly influenced by the Asian summer monsoon. These findings underscore the importance of the cold trap in driving air mass transport and water vapor transformations in the UTLS."

The observed H2O2 showed distinct diurnal variations influenced by photochemical reactions. A box model revealed that H2O2 is primarily produced by HO2 recombination and removed mainly via particle uptake. Reductions in NOx, PM2.5, and alkanes raised H2O2 levels, while cutting alkenes, aromatics, CO, and HONO lowered them. A dual strategy focusing on VOC and NOx control is essential to reduce both H2O2 and ozone pollution. 
 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key atmospheric oxidant, crucial for oxidation capacity and sulfate production. However, its chemistry remains understudied compared to ozone (O3), limiting our understanding of photochemical pollution. In summer 2016, atmospheric peroxides and trace gases were measured at a rural site in the North China Plain. H2O2 was the dominant peroxide (0.62 ± 0.80 ppb), constituting 69 % of total peroxides. It exhibited diurnal variation similar to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and O3, indicating photochemical production. The O3/H2O2 ratio was higher on high-particle days, suggesting that H2O2 uptake by particles reduces its concentration. A box model with default gas-phase chemistry overestimated H2O2 by a factor of 2.7, and including particle uptake of H2O2 (uptake coefficient of 6 × 10−4) improved agreement with observations, although we note that this value carries some uncertainty related to the assumed HO2 uptake coefficient.HO2 recombination contributed 91 % of H2O2 production, with a peak rate of 1 ppb h−1. Major removal pathways included particle uptake (69 %), dry deposition (25 %), OH reaction (4 %), and photolysis (2 %). Relative incremental reactivity (RIR) analysis showed that reducing NOx, PM2.5, and alkanes increased H2O2, while reducing alkenes, aromatics, CO, and HONO decreased it, with alkenes having the strongest effect. H2O2/NOz ratios (>0.15 in 82 % of cases) indicated that O3 formation was in a transition and NOx-sensitive regime, emphasizing the need for further volatile organic compound (VOC) and NOx reductions to mitigate both H2O2 and O3 pollution. These findings improve our understanding of H2O2 chemistry and provide insights into the mitigation of photochemical pollution in rural North China."

Thomason;Terry Deshler,Producing aerosol size distributions consistent with optical particle counter measurements using space-based measurements of aerosol extinction coefficient,"We use balloon-borne measurements of aerosol size distribution (ASD) made by the University of Wyoming (UW) to derive distributions which are representative of the ASDs that underlie measurements made by the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II). A simple single-mode log-normal distribution has in the past been used to derive ASD from SAGE II data; here we derive bimodal log-normal distributions, reproducing median aerosol properties measured by UW. 
 Stratospheric aerosol has been observed by several long-lived observational systems. These include the University of Wyoming series of balloon-borne optical particle counters (OPCs) (1971–2020) and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) series of instruments, particularly SAGE II (1984–2005). Inferences of aerosol surface area density (SAD) and volume density are straightforward using data from OPCs. Conversely, many numerical methods to infer size distributions and SAD have been applied to SAGE II observations, but all are limited by the restricted number of independent wavelengths of the SAGE optical measurements. We have developed a new method that uses OPC observations to constrain SAGE II inferences of aerosol properties. We start by noting that, whatever the details of the underlying size distribution, the SAGE II-measured aerosol extinction coefficient ratio (525–1020 nm) must reflect the shape of the underlying aerosol size distribution for particles that dominate the extinction coefficient values (roughly radii from 0.1 to 0.5 µm). Since this extinction ratio can be easily calculated from OPC measurements, we use the OPC size distribution measurements, across a broad range of aerosol levels from background to highly volcanic, to compute the associated 525–1020 nm extinction coefficient ratios for each measurement. We then sort the OPC measurements by these ratios (across a range of roughly 1–6) into discrete ratio bins and derive mean bimodal log-normal size distributions for each bin using a particle swarm optimization. These fits can be applied to SAGE II observations without the need for further retrieval calculations, effectively producing an OPC-like product consisting of the six bimodal parameters for all SAGE II observations. This method successfully captures the median behavior of the OPC inferences of bulk parameters like aerosol surface area and volume densities, although we also observe a significant altitude dependence particularly in the lower stratosphere. In addition, there are occasional deviations of SAD from the fit behavior by as large as a factor of 10 for individual OPC measurements of SAD, primarily due to variations in small-radii particle number density (roughly smaller than about 0.15 µm). The presence of such particles is effectively invisible to extinction coefficient measurements such as those by SAGE II."

SmHOLIMO is designed to specifically measure small cloud droplets with diameters > 3.7 μm. This way we retrieve accurate cloud droplet size distributions, which are crucial to understand the evolution and governing microphysical processes of a cloud. Results of a field study are compared to co-located measurements of a second holographic imager, microwave radiometer, and cloud radar. 
 The microstructure of liquid and mixed-phase clouds is characterized by the cloud droplet size distribution (CDSD), which influences the cloud evolution and its interaction with radiation. However, state-of-the-art cloud probes still face challenges because they require either platforms that move at constant speed or inlets that can directly alter the actual CDSD. Therefore, precise and accurate in situ measurements of CDSDs, especially of cloud droplets smaller than 6 µm, are still lacking. This can lead to uncertainties in the microphysics and thus in weather and climate models, which are based on parameterizations often derived from these measurements.We present a new in situ instrument, the Small Holographic Imager for Microscopic Objects (SmHOLIMO), specifically designed to measure a broad spectrum of the CDSDs, i.e., from 3.7 to ≈100 µm, with a sample volume rate of 2.5 cm3 s−1. Thereby, SmHOLIMO pushes the resolution limit towards the limits seen with forward-scattering probes, while still maintaining the advantages of open-path holography, i.e., a well-defined sample volume (operation at variable wind speed); no need for an inlet; independence of particle size, phase, refractive index, and shape; and the potential of spatial analyses. After calibrating SmHOLIMO in the laboratory, the instrument was deployed in the field, on a tethered balloon system, probing a dissipating low stratus. We demonstrate its ability to measure the cloud microphysical properties at high spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, we compare the SmHOLIMO observations to those of another holographic imager (resolution: 6 µm) and to co-located remote sensing measurements. We unequivocally show the importance of SmHOLIMO's skills to capture the lower tail of the CDSD, which significantly affects the derived quantities of cloud droplet mean diameter (up to 1.6 times smaller), number concentration (up to 4 times higher), and cloud optical depth (up to 2.7 times higher). SmHOLIMO's high-resolution in situ data of cloud droplets will help us to better interpret observations and to refine the representation of clouds in climate and weather models."

Because aquatic plants like hydrophyte natantia can effectively remove pollutants via photosynthesis-powered rhizoextraction and phytotransformation, they are widely applied in outdoor water purification; however, their performance in degrading recalcitrant PPCPs remains inefficient. Here, we develop a synthetic hydrophyte that mimics the main features of a natural hydrophyte: photosynthesis (leaves), pollutant degradation (stem), and pollutant extraction (root). CoOx/Mo:BiVO4/Pd artificial leaves photosynthesize hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is subsequently activated in the FeOCl artificial stem, generating powerful hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that rapidly degrade pollutants extracted by the poly(vinylidene fluoride) artificial root. The synthetic hydrophyte demonstrates remarkable degradation rates of 85.0–99.5% for multiple recalcitrant PPCP pollutants within 8 h, which are typically resistant to phytoremediation. In outdoor tests, the pollutant removal efficiency of the synthetic hydrophyte surpassed those of Hydrocotyle verticillata and Canna indica by 8.6–16.1-fold. Moreover, synthetic hydrophytes exhibit distinct advantages of high versatility under various pH, temperature, and water matrix conditions. The promising sunlight-driven water purification achieved by the synthetic hydrophyte sheds light on a new approach for achieving both efficient and sustainable removal of recalcitrant PPCPs that are increasingly detected in natural waters."

Microplastic particles are known to serve as a vector for the transport of microbes (fungi and bacteria) to new environments, threatening biodiversity. Robust biofilm formation makes fungi candidates for collecting and remediating environmental microplastics. However, fungal-microplastic colonization mechanisms have not yet been explored. In this work, we aim to understand which fungal molecules mediate microplastic binding. We examine the common fungal genus Aspergillus, which we found binds microplastics tightly, removing particles from suspension. Upon inoculation of Aspergilli with microplastic particles, up to 3.85 ± 1.48 g of microplastics were flocculated per gram of dry fungal biomass; this phenomenon was observed across various plastics ranging in size from 0.05 to 5 mm. Gene knockouts revealed that hydrophobins drive microplastic-fungi binding, evidenced by a decrease in flocculation relative to that of wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus. Moreover, purified hydrophobins flocculated microplastics independently of the fungus, validating their ability to bind to microplastics. Our work elucidates a role for hydrophobins in fungal colonization of microplastics and highlights a target for mitigating the harm of microplastics through engineered fungal-microplastic interactions."

In this study, we found that parental exposure to BPS at environmental doses induced lipid accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans from one-generational parent (P0) to two-generational offspring (F2), even in the absence of BPS exposure in offspring. Mechanistically, BPS-induced transgenerational lipid accumulation was due to the activation of lipogenic genes (fat-5 and fat-7, encoding delta-9 desaturases) and the associated transcriptional regulators (sbp-1 and mdt-15). Knockdown of methyltransferase wdr-5.1 reversed  BPS-induced transgenerational inheritance via inhibiting histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Interestingly, germline-specific wdr-5.1/H3K4me3, rather than intestinal, was identified as being responsible for transgenerational inheritance.

Traditional risk assessments focus exclusively on single Cd contamination and total dietary intake, neglecting the interactions between them and the digestion and adsorption processes in the human body. This study established a novel benefit–risk-value (BRV) criterion to assess coexposure effects. Besides, we compared existing single-element risk assessment criteria and evaluated changes in risk before and after the incorporation of bioaccessibility using in vitro simulation. Rice constituted the major exposure source for Cd, whereas Se intake primarily relied on meat and rice. Integrating bioaccessibility with traditional risk assessment criteria significantly reduced the health risks associated with Cd exposure, while revealing notable Se deficiency in adults and seniors. Different from traditional models, BRV analysis indicated that children were safe from Cd and Se exposure, whereas adults and the seniors suffered from Se deficiency. As a biomarker, hair further validated the feasibility of the new standard. Correlation analysis demonstrates an age-dependent decline in the molar ratio of Se to Cd in hair samples.

Using experimental evolution with copper selection and subsequent relaxation, we investigated how density-dependent processes interact with contaminant stress in shaping adaptive responses of the freshwater zooplankton Ceriodaphnia cornuta. Elevated population densities significantly accelerated adaptive evolution to copper, as evidenced by increased population growth rates and reduced plasticity under stress. These changes were accompanied by shifts in multilocus genotype composition, indicating selection for copper-tolerant genotypes. Copper-adapted populations retained their fitness advantage after the stressor was removed, likely due to the fixation of tolerance alleles with low fitness costs and the canalization of adaptive traits through reduced plasticity. Our findings show that population density not only alters the speed of evolution but also shapes the evolutionary pathway and persistence of adaptive change. By integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives, this study underscores the importance of density-dependent selection in mediating species responses to anthropogenic stressors."

The challenges of low mass transfer in sediments and the recalcitrance of NACs to degradation limit the effectiveness of conventional bioremediation techniques. This study demonstrates the potential of alternating current (AC)-driven bioredox cycling to overcome these barriers by coupling in situ reduction-oxidation processes. We report the successful application of AC stimulation in achieving the mineralization of nitrobenzene (NB) while elucidating its role in modulating bioredox dynamics, electron transfer, and electromicrobiome function. Sine-wave AC stimulation achieved an 87.7% reduction of NB and 90.3% mineralization of its intermediates. The AC stimulation promoted robust biofilm formation, enhanced bidirectional electrocatalytic activity, and increased microbial biomass. It also enriched a diverse microbial consortium capable of reducing NB, oxidizing aromatic intermediates, and facilitating electron transfer, as indicated by the upregulation of key enzymatic genes through multiomics analyses. Carbon metabolites from catechol meta-cleavage further supported nitro-reduction and sustained microbial viability. Compared to DC processes, AC-driven bioredox cycling reduced energy consumption by 16.8% in the remediation of NB-contaminated sediments.

Rigid wall columns are widely used to study MP transport in soil. However, they are limited in their ability to control boundary conditions and prevent sidewall leakage in studying low-permeability soils. Flexible wall permeameters (FWPs), commonly used for measuring soil permeability, offer more precise control of confining pressure and leakage, making them a promising alternative that remains under-explored. This study evaluates FWPs for MP transport through mass-balance experiments to assess the extent to which the artificial retention of MP by FWP may interfere with testing and reduce its validity. Tests are conducted under different FWP components, pressure gradients, ionic strengths of solution, and MP sizes and concentrations. Results show baseline mass recoveries greater than 80% but declining for larger MPs (5 μm) and high ionic strengths. Agglomeration and filtration by filter paper were the primary causes of retention. Overall, FWPs proved effective for studying MP transport for particles of ≤1 μm at ionic strengths smaller than 0.03 M, with near-complete recovery achieved when avoiding filter papers. In addition, MP flow-through experiments conducted on sandy and bentonite clay soil samples confirmed FWP suitability as a soil column. Finally, guidance for its effective utilization for MP soil transport studies was provided."

K isotopes, therefore, have the potential to trace anthropogenic processes. Huguangyan Maar Lake (HML), a hydrologically enclosed lake, provides an ideal setting to preserve the historical records of anthropogenic activities. This study investigated the K contents and isotopic compositions (δ41K) in recent HML sediments to trace catchment K cycling and human impacts over the past 120 years in southern China. Results show that leachate K (Kleachate) is influenced by coal combustion, while residue K (Kresidue) is mainly derived from bedrock erosion. Prior to 1950 C.E., the HML catchment experienced minimal human disturbance, as indicated by stable K contents and δ41K values. Between 1950 and 2000 C.E., increasing Kresidue contents suggest intensified catchment erosion due to human activities following the founding of the People’s Republic of China, though direct anthropogenic inputs remained limited. After 2000 C.E., fluctuations and decreasing δ41Kleachate values reflect varying air pollution from anthropogenic activities such as coal combustion and vehicle emissions associated with industrialization and subsequent environmental policies. This study highlights the possibility of K isotopes as a novel tracer of anthropogenic influence on the K geochemical cycle."

To respond, we require tools to design and monitor the effectiveness of policies aimed at tackling plastic pollution. However, a key question remains unanswered: “What is the relationship between plastic accumulated in the environment and the plastic ingestion by wildlife?” To address this, we evaluated the relationship between plastic accumulated in the environment and plastic ingested by the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), at regional and local scales. We found a decoupling between plastic in the environment and plastic ingestion at regional and local scale. However, we found a strong relationship when evaluating flexible plastics, where an increase of 1 item/m2 on the beach may lead to a more than 100-fold increase in plastic ingestion. A common finding across both scales is the negative correlation between the turtle size and the number of items of plastic ingested by green turtles. Taking advantage of the present results on Chelonia mydas in Brazilian waters, our work highlights the importance of species’ ecology and environmental plastic abundance for informative monitoring through bioindicator species."

While this plaque has been implicated in soil organic carbon (SOC) transformation, its specific role in regulating SOC mineralization is still insufficiently understood. In this study, we hypothesize that Fe plaque induces the generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which disrupt the “enzyme latch” mechanism and promote CO2 emissions. The results showed that seedlings with Fe plaque showed a 150% higher •OH concentration, 50% higher laccase activity, 25% higher SOC mineralization rate, and 20% lower phenolic concentration in comparison to those without Fe plaque. These effects disappeared when a •OH scavenger was applied or oxygen availability was reduced. Moreover, the exogenous addition of Fe(II) in Fe plaque-free soils reproduced the increases in •OH, laccase activity, and SOC mineralization, confirming the role of Fe-driven •OH production. These findings demonstrate that Fe plaque-induced •OH simultaneously disrupts phenolic inhibition and accelerates SOC mineralization. This study identifies a previously underappreciated oxidative mechanism by which Fe plaque destabilizes SOC in paddy soils and highlights the role of mineral–radical interactions in controlling carbon turnover."

While their hazards could be mediated through biotransformation pathways of detoxification and/or bioactivation and associated metabolites, the biotransformation of these tire-derived contaminants in soil organisms, key environmental compartments directly exposed to tire wear, remains unexplored. In this work, we investigated the biotransformation of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q in soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We identified 9 transformation products (TPs) of 6PPD and 26 of 6PPD-Q using suspect and nontargeted screening methods, providing the first comprehensive metabolic profile of these contaminants in soil nematodes. Novel in vivo metabolites including phosphorylated and monohydroxy phosphorylated 6PPD-Q were first discovered, revealing unique metabolic pathways of these contaminants in C. elegans compared to other eukaryotes. Kinetic profiling delineates heterogeneous temporal patterns among TPs, with specific derivatives showing progressive accumulation over the exposure duration. Notably, isomers such as dihydroxy 6PPD-Q exhibit distinct substitution-site-dependent dynamics. Furthermore, in silico toxicity prediction indicated that certain TPs exhibited earthworm toxicity comparable to 6PPD-Q, implying potential contributions to the discernible adverse effects observed in C. elegans.

Widely used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods fail to capture large fractions of total organofluorine in environmental samples, confounding the assessment of fluorinated contamination. Fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F-NMR) is an inclusive method for total and class-based organofluorine analysis. Here, we apply 19F-NMR to 31 effluent, surface water, and foam samples collected at 13 potential organofluorine point sources or source regions and compare the results to targeted LC-MS/MS for 34 or 64 PFASs.

While effect-directed analysis (EDA) combined with nontarget screening (NTS) is promising, its large-scale application has been limited by time-consuming workflows. Here, we developed an event-driven taxonomy (EDT)-Screening strategy to effectively identify and semiquantify nontarget bioactive contaminants in sediment, taking aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity as an example. To accelerate EDA and NTS workflows, this strategy integrated fractionation, bioassay, identification, and quantification into a single step by embedding two novel effect-based spectral libraries into LC-HRMS screening templates. The event driver (ED) library was assembled from data-mined AhR-active compounds, and the event driver ion (EDION) library contained effect-related fragment ions predicted by deep learning. Compared to conventional databases (e.g., ChemSpider), the AhR-ED library improved identification accuracy with a more complete AhR-agonist list and fewer false positives, while the AhR-EDION library uncovered additional AhR agonists, particularly industrial intermediates and transformation products often missed due to limited prior knowledge. With the multimodal learning-based semiquantitative module, the EDT-Screening strategy increased the explained bioactivity contribution from 7.1% to 82%, significantly expanding the detections of “unknown unknowns”.

Traditionally, OSs have been primarily linked to the particle phase with their presence in the gas phase remaining largely undetected. This study provides compelling observational evidence of a continuously present gas-phase OS, glycolic acid sulfate (GAS), in an urban atmosphere using advanced mass spectrometry techniques. GAS concentrations exhibited distinct seasonal and diurnal patterns, peaking in summer with maximum levels of 4.6 × 104 cm–3 observed around midday, indicating a photochemical origin. Thermal desorption profile analysis revealed GAS as an extremely low-volatility organic compound, suggesting preferential aerosol partitioning. Remarkably, the observed gas-phase fraction of GAS exceeded predictions based on gas-particle equilibrium theory by 5–7 orders of magnitude, strongly suggesting the existence of a distinct source from gas-phase chemistry. We propose a potential formation mechanism involving the reaction between the SO3 radical and glycolic acid (GA), which correlates nearly linearly with GAS production rates, suggesting a near-collision-limited rate constant (kfield ≈ 2.2 × 10–10 cm3 s–1).

We investigated the carbonation products of enstatite (MgSiO3) to assess its efficiency in sequestering CO2 for safe and permanent storage as carbonate minerals. This was accomplished by conducting variable temperature carbonation reactions with samples of differing crystallinities and surface chemistries. Reaction progress was monitored utilizing in situ X-ray diffraction, and the presence of carbonate products was confirmed using additional techniques, such as thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry. Our results show that crystalline enstatite produces small amounts of the anhydrous form of MgCO3 (magnesite), while amorphous MgSiO3, which was used to simulate mafic glass, more readily converts to the hydrated/hydroxylated hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O]. These results, supplemented with dynamic vapor sorption experiments, suggest that surface properties play a significant role in the pathway and degree of carbonation.

We show the reduction of many indoor pollutants in a combination of real indoor environment and atmospheric chamber experiments, including O3, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and other oxidized VOCs. We observed an increase in the concentrations of more reduced VOCs with catalyst use. We demonstrate that over 24 weeks of continuous operation, the clean air delivery rate of the catalyst for O3 pollution declined linearly by 20%.

Conversely, annual inventories submitted by operators often exclude emissions from failure events and unregulated sources, leading to incomplete emission estimates. This study introduces a novel methodology that utilizes the Mechanistic Air Emissions Simulator (MAES) to integrate two highly variable estimation methods: inventory and aerial methods. The proposed methodology identifies and characterizes failure events with site-specific information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of inventory programs through the so-called measurement-informed inventories (MIIs). Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of carefully comparing instantaneous emission measurements from aerial surveys with annual average emissions reported in inventories, as they have distinct timeframes. Colorado State University (CSU) collaborated with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) to utilize this approach to enhance reported emissions from the upstream sector in Colorado Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin. This initiative is part of Colorado's Upstream greenhouse gas (GHG) Intensity Program, a regulatory initiative that requires oil and gas (O&G) operators to monitor, report, and reduce GHG emissions. The goal was to incorporate measured emissions from failure events conducted by Carbon Mapper (CM) in the simulations to derive a multiplier that rectifies for potential omissions of emissions from abnormal conditions within the O&G sector. To simplify the simulation process, prototypical sites were defined in conjunction with operators and are used to represent groups of O&G facilities in the basin with similar configuration. The outcomes of this work indicate that inventories are likely underestimating total emissions, as an additional 16.4% of total emissions from abnormal events is estimated for the basin. This estimate may represent a lower bound, as the survey technologys detection limit may exclude most CH4 emission events below 50 kg/h."

This “upwelling—H2O—Ox—T90” link propagates upward and poleward via dynamic transports. Temperatures at ∼20°S/N near 80 km (T80), dominated by adiabatic cooling, serve as an indicator of tropical upwelling. Notably, mid‐to‐high‐latitude T90 is positively correlated with low‐latitude T80 in both hemispheres, and the interannual variability of H2O, O3, and T90 exhibits remarkable interhemispheric symmetry.

Several observed extreme rainfall (ER) events are accompanied by high GrIS surface melt. However, their role in surface energy budgets and the associated physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we employ a surface energy balance (SEB) model to quantify the relative contributions of energy terms to surface melt energy (Qm) during ER events at QAS_L and QAS_U stations in southern GrIS. We further investigate the energy anomalies in terms of synoptic‐scale atmospheric conditions during ER events lasting three or more days (ER+3d). Our results indicate that during ER+3d events, nonradiative energy contributes 54% of Qm at QAS_L, near the ice sheet margin, with turbulent fluxes serving as the primary energy source. In contrast, at QAS_U, closer to the equilibrium line, Qm remains dominated by radiative energy, accounting for 61% of Qm. The contribution of rainfall heat flux remains small, at approximately 4% at QAS_L and 2% at QAS_U. Rainfall‐related atmospheric conditions trigger positive anomalies in turbulent fluxes and net radiation, due to strengthened cloud radiative forcing and increased turbulence scales in the near surface, which collectively contribute to high surface melt during ER+3d events. Therefore, the increased rainfall events have the potential to exacerbate surface mass loss by adding excess radiative and turbulent energy inputs in the future."

 Deep Convective Systems (DCSs) reaching scales of 100–1000 km play a pivotal role as the primary precipitation source in the tropics. Those systems can have large cloud shields, and thus not only affect severe precipitation patterns but also play a crucial part in modulating the tropical radiation budget. Understanding the complex factors that control how these systems grow and how they will behave in a warming climate remain fundamental challenges. Research efforts have been directed, on one hand, towards understanding the environmental control on these systems, and on the other hand, towards exploring the internal potential of systems to develop and self-aggregate in idealized simulations. However, we still lack understanding on the relative role of the environment and internal feedbacks on DCS mature size and why. The novel high-resolution global SAM simulation from the DYAMOND project, combined with the TOOCAN Lagrangian tracking of DCSs and machine learning tools, offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore this question. We find that a system’s growth rate during the first 2 h of development predicts its final size with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.65. Beyond this period, growth rate emerges as the strongest predictor. However, in the early stages, additional factors–such as ice water path heterogeneity, migration distance, interactions with neighboring systems, and deep shear–play a more significant role. Our study quantitatively assesses the relative influence of internal versus external factors on the mature cloud shield size. Our results show that system-intrinsic properties exert a stronger influence than environmental conditions, suggesting that the initial environment does not strictly constrain final system size, particularly for larger systems where internal dynamics dominate."

 The ongoing energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is increasing the demand for materials, particularly metals. As fossil fuel infrastructure, such as refineries, tankers, pipelines, and ships, is phased out, this obsolete infrastructure could serve as an urban mine, supplying secondary materials like steel, aluminium, and copper. However, the extent to which these materials can meet future needs remains unclear and is often overlooked. Here we develop the global dynamic fossil fuel material model to quantify material stocks embedded in fossil fuel infrastructure and project secondary material availability through 2050 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2) baseline and 2-degree Celsius (2D) scenarios. Our findings indicate that material demand for new infrastructure continues to grow under the baseline scenario and exceeds recoverable volumes.

 In July 2021, a cut-off low-pressure system brought extreme rainfall to Western Europe, leading to flooding that caused loss of life and infrastructure damage. Here, we use ensemble boosting to investigate alternative storylines of the event, given the observed dynamical situation. Using a fully coupled free-running climate model, we identify atmospheric flow analogues of the 2021 event in an initial-condition large ensemble. These analogues are re-initialised with slightly perturbed atmospheric initial conditions to generate physically plausible alternative storylines. The storylines are used to investigate how a potentially worse event could have unfolded given the same large-scale dynamics. We identify rainfall events with longer persistence and larger extent, yet the observed event appears to be towards the upper end of what is plausible in the current climate. Such storylines can be used to prepare for possible future events, helping society to imagine dangerous, but plausible, scenarios.

 Integrating of carbon capture, utilization, and storage with poverty alleviation strategies presents an innovative and sustainable development paradigm. Regional poverty, often exacerbated by challenging geographical conditions, can be transformed into opportunities for carbon storage development, promoting energy and economic rebalancing while avoiding poverty and resource traps. By introducing an evaluation index grounded in Sustainable Development Goals and technical requirements, we achieve a harmonious balance between potential and economic development. Techno-economic analysis in coal plant renovation and oil field projects demonstrates this project triggers a 7.70% growth in local gross domestic product per capita, and a decrease of 4.85% in local carbon dioxide emissions. Construction costs in impoverished regions can be over 20% lower than in more affluent areas for projects of the same scale because of cheaper labor and lower transportation and storage costs, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of pursuing poverty alleviation through carbon capture, utilization, and storage in China. This paper also emphasized the carbon storage demand in future’s energy transition of China. The status of policy implementation underscored the significant potential of carbon capture, utilization, and storage in contributing to poverty alleviation in the world’s largest carbon emitter and developing country, potentially serving as a critical testbed globally.

 Disentangling pathogen infection signals in plants is critical for understanding the physiological processes that underlie the complex host-pathogen interactions and predicting impending disease outbreak. The rapid progression of rice blast lesions, caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, and its imperceptible disease-related symptoms during the asymptomatic stages render real-time detection and visualization challenging. Efforts to reveal pre-visual disease symptoms are of both broad concern and significant interest but remain challenging, as subtle disease signals are often obscured or diluted by other factors at asymptomatic stage. We introduce an imaging spectroscopy-based purification methodology that isolates the disease signals revealed by spectral unmixing on a pixel basis without considering the complex pathogen-induced physiological variations. With multi-temporal proximal hyperspectral imagery, our method captured the transition of disease lesions from asymptomatic to severely symptomatic stages, and successfully distinguished the subtle pathogen-induced signals with few false alarms as early as three days (two days after inoculation, DAI 2) before visual lesions became apparent (DAI 5). The lesion prediction results were confirmed by extensive in vivo visual inspections. Remarkably, we demonstrated that spatially aggregating the isolated disease signals improved the accuracy of pre-visual RB identification to a remarkable level up to 93 % (F1-score = 0.91), enabling unprecedented visualization of potential lesions in a narrow time window of pathogen infection. Although limitations remain regarding model validation and scalability for broader applications, this method represents a significant advancement in early disease forecasting across spectral and spatial domains, and offers new opportunities for high-throughput screening of susceptible varieties in next-generation plant resilience phenotyping."

 Recent advancements in satellites, such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) have improved the spatial resolution of atmospheric chemical products, enabling more accurate estimation of atmospheric chemical concentrations. However, these satellites still face coverage limitations, posing challenges for monitoring atmospheric chemistry over large spatiotemporal scales. We propose a novel deep-learning model, GM-ESR-ResNet, which uses advanced super-resolution reconstruction for the coarse-resolution OMI data, supported by geo-meteorological covariates, to enhance the spatiotemporal coverage of high-resolution NO₂ columns from the original TROPOMI product. The results indicate that GM-ESR-ResNet significantly outperforms interpolation methods and traditional machine-learning models (which did not incorporate OMI NO₂ columns in prior studies) for spatiotemporal imputation of TROPOMI NO₂ data. The model enhances spatial coverage (imputation ratio = 30 %, correlation r = 0.82 vs. r = 0.42) with superior temporal transferability (MAPE of historical application 0.28 vs. 0.29). Additionally, the enhanced high-resolution NO₂ columns lead to more accurate surface NO₂ estimates than TROPOMI-based results, showing an increase in R2 (0.856 vs. 0.871) and a 6 % reduction in RMSE. Furthermore, GM-ESR-ResNet, using OMI satellite data, successfully generates high-resolution NO₂ columns from 2015 to 2022, even in the absence of TROPOMI data. This enhancement improves the capture of strong spatial gradients in surface NO₂ concentrations and effectively addresses grid-to-point mismatch issues that previously led to substantial overestimations (by 11–30 %) in downwind and rural areas in the original coarse-resolution retrievals. Our study demonstrates the significant potential of super-resolution models in satellite retrievals, which is essential for aligning high-resolution column data with ground-based measurements."

 This paper presents an algorithm for mapping tree height from L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar measurements. The proposed tree height retrieval algorithm integrates dual-polarimetric (HH, HV) backscatter and interferometric coherence time series using a model-based approach. Physics-based models relate radar backscatter and interferometric temporal coherence to forest properties and capture the varying environmental conditions over time. These models are calibrated using lidar measurements, and then jointly inverted to retrieve vegetation height at the pixel level. The algorithm is evaluated using a time series of 6 dual-polarimetric ALOS-2 acquisitions over the Lenoir Landing (AL) site, supported by high-resolution lidar data, weather measurements, and the land cover map from the National Land Cover Database. Over the study area, temporal coherence alone proves reliable for estimating forest height, with varying performance depending on vegetation height and class. Comparison with lidar-derived tree height confirms that integrating multi-temporal interferometric coherence and backscatter significantly improves the estimation performance compared to using backscatter time series alone. In particular, incorporating interferometric coherence extends the dynamic range of the estimated tree heights, overcoming the saturation of backscatter signals for tall vegetation. The algorithm is applicable to repeated radar acquisitions collected within a narrow orbital tube and represents an opportunity to map forest properties with upcoming and future low-frequency radar missions."

 Current deep learning-based remote sensing methods for photovoltaic (PV) power stations identification primarily focus on inland high-irradiance areas, but exhibit significant limitations in accurately delineating boundary of multi-scale PV power stations in coastal regions. This challenge arises due to frequent cloud and fog coverage in coastal areas, leading to spectral confusion in optical images and complicating accurate PV extraction. To address this issue, this study proposes SolarSegNet, a multimodal semantic segmentation network integrating Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral images (MSI) data. SolarSegNet consists of three modules: The adaptive depth separable (ADS) module for local detailed feature extraction, the global-local awareness block (GLAB) for capturing global context, and the adaptive high-frequency awareness block (AHFAB) to mitigate cloud interference. Experiments comparing ten multi-source data combinations indicated that the visible-spectral index-SAR scheme performed optimally. Training and comparative experiments on the newly constructed PV benchmark dataset demonstrated that SolarSegNet significantly improved segmentation accuracy (with IoU, Precision, and Recall enhanced by 1.49%, 0.89%, and 0.90%, respectively) and reduced computational complexity (with parameters decreased by 165.5M and FLOPS reduced by 77.52G). Furthermore, PV regions mapping from 2019 to 2024 reveals continuous growth and a pronounced north-to-south expansion along China’s coast. By 2024, the installed area reached 983.70 km2, marking a 47.20% year-on-year increase.

 Residential wood combustion is a major contributor to wintertime air pollution, releasing high concentrations of fine particulate matter and altering aerosol optical properties. Understanding the optical characteristics of wood-burning aerosols is crucial for improving air quality monitoring and refining atmospheric models. In this study, we examined the aerosol optical characteristics in Tirana, Albania, using Polly lidar observations at 532 nm during 2022–2023. For the first time, a lidar campaign was conducted in Albania, enabling long-term profiling of aerosol optical properties up to the tropopause. Our results indicate a dominant contribution of residential wood burning to winter air pollution by measuring exceptionally high extinction-to-backscatter ratios (lidar ratios) within the planetary boundary layer. Significant contributions from controlled biomass burning were identified in winter, with lidar ratios around 100 ± 20 sr measured predominantly in December and January. We analyzed lidar ratios during winter and spring and retrieved intensive and extensive optical properties for selected cases. Lidar-derived particle mass concentration of the emissions ranged from 20–80 μg m−3 in the lowermost heavily polluted smoke layer with a vertical depth of usually 200 to 300 m.

 Vertical wind shear frequently occurs in complex terrain (basin and sloped terrain). However, compared with thermodynamic (temperature inversion) variables, the modulation of dynamic (wind shear) variables on air pollution is poorly understood due to scarce in-situ observations at complex terrain. In order to reveal the issues, we conducted the first collaborative field experiment of Boundary-Layer Meteorology and Pollution at western Sichuan Basin (BLMP-SCB) at a rural site from December 2018 to January 2019. A clockwise turning of the wind with the height was more frequent, especially for the rotation smaller than 20 degrees, which corresponded to the heavy air pollution near the ground surface. The surface heavy air pollution was jointly influenced by both low-level wind-directional shear and speed shear above that layer, especially the configuration of southeasterly winds below 1.0 km above sea level (regional transport) and increased southwesterly winds with height above the height (subsidence motion). The elevated wind-directional shear enhanced mechanical turbulence to transport downwards secondary pollutants to upper atmospheric boundary layer from the higher layer of air. The increased wind speed with height more easily triggered subsidence motion to trap more pollutants inside the basin. The work was helpful for fully understanding the role of meteorological variables in the formation and development of heavy air pollution at complex terrain, which will be favorable for making targeted pollution prevention and control measures at complex terrain."

 Climate change has intensified extreme droughts and strong winds in arid and semi-arid regions, accelerating soil wind erosion, dust emissions, and related environmental problems. Wind is the primary driver of soil wind erosion, with both speed and cumulative duration determining the intensity of the erosion process. Accurately characterizing regional wind speed and its cumulative duration is therefore essential for understanding the spatial distribution of soil wind erosion. Previous studies have mainly relied on weather station observations; however, their limited coverage, low temporal resolution and uneven spatial distribution have introduced significant uncertainties in regional assessments. To address these limitations, long-term reanalysis wind speed datasets have been developed, though their accuracy still needs further evaluation. In this paper, wind speed data from weather stations and from the ERA5-Land reanalysis product in the wind erosion region of northern China were collected to develop a predictive model for cumulative wind speed hours above the 5 m/s threshold, based on the XGBoost method combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The results showed that, compared to the cumulative wind speed hours derived from the ERA5-Land product, the model predictions more closely aligned with corresponding weather station measurements. Across different months, the explained variance for cumulative wind speed hours in the test set increased from an initial range of 10–53 % to 60–75 %, accompanied by reductions in mean absolute error (MAE) by 0.15–0.67 h and root mean square error (RMSE) by 1.11–2.14 h. The model also performed well in both cross-time and cross-location applications, explaining 72 % of the variation in cumulative wind speed hours in the validation set. This outperformed the ERA5-Land product, which accounted for only 59 % of the variation, and significantly reduced the associated prediction errors. The constructed XGBoost model was further used to simulate the cumulative wind speed hours in the study region in 2020. Its spatial simulation accuracy was comparable to that of the ordinary kriging method, with superior performance in capturing spatial variation in areas with sparse weather station coverage. The results provide reliable data on the cumulative wind speed duration required for large-scale soil wind erosion prediction and related environmental research."

 Autumn in Korea, following the peak rainy season in summer, is of a great importance as it coincides with the intensive harvesting of crops and fruits. Hence, autumn rainfall critically affects agricultural production in Korea. This study shows the emergence of new rainfall peaks in autumn, leading to potentially significant agricultural damages. In the monthly period from September 10 to October 10, the total rainfall in the recent period (150 mm for 1998–2023) has increased by 44 mm compared to the previous period (106 mm for 1979–1997), averaged over 61 stations. Heavy rainfall days (≥ 100 mm day−1) have also occurred more frequently. The most plausible mechanism for these changes is the delayed retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high in autumn which results in westward shift of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and increased number of days on which Korea is affected by TCs. In addition, rising sea surface temperatures (0.5–1.0°C) in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea appear to be related to increased TC-induced heavy rainfall in Korea. Enhanced low-level moisture transports from these warm oceanic areas toward Korea, combined with upper-level wind divergence, are likely to have intensified the conditions for the TC-induced heavy rainfall.

Rodriguez,Sensing of extracellular l-proline availability by the integrated stress response determines the outcome of cell competition,"Cell competition is a conserved fitness quality control that eliminates cells that are less fit than their neighbors. How winner cells induce the elimination of losers is poorly understood. We tackle this question by studying the onset of embryonic differentiation in mice, where cell competition eliminates 35% of embryonic cells. These loser cells have mitochondrial dysfunction, which we show causes amino acid deprivation and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), a pathway essential for their survival. We demonstrate thatl-proline is a key amino acid sensed by the ISR and that proline represses the ISR and drives their elimination. These results indicate that cell competition acts as a previously unidentified tissue-sparing mechanism, regulated by the availability of extracellular amino acids, that allows for the elimination of dysfunctional cells when amino acids are plentiful but ensures their survival in nutrient-poor environments."

However, animals also learn to predict cues with no intrinsic value or biological relevance to ongoing behavior, and it is unclear whether such latent learning also relies on dopaminergic prediction errors. Here, we tested this by recording dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and dorsomedial striatum while rats executed a sensory preconditioning task that incorporated both types of learning. We found that dopamine release in both regions correlated with errors in predicting value-neutral cues during latent learning and with errors in predicting reward during reward-based conditioning. Moreover, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens reflected inferred value in the probe test, supported by orbitofrontal cortex activity. Our findings show that dopamine signals prediction errors about both valued and neutral stimuli, consistent with its operation as a general teaching signal that supports learning across different informational domains."

Using a structural-asymmetric semiconductor metasurface incorporating [110] InGaP nanoresonators, we realize continuous tuning of polarization entanglement from partially entangled states to a Bell state by adjusting the pump wavelength. We also observe pronounced spatial anti-correlations and theoretically confirm that this approach can extend to tailor hyperentanglement.

Compared with single cells, CTC clusters present enhanced metastatic potential, greater survival in the bloodstream and increased resistance to microenvironment. Mechanistically, the Src/FN1 pathway is centrally activated in clusters, promoting intercellular cohesion and protecting against immune clearance and stress in circulation. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with the clinical inhibitor KX2-391 disrupted clustering, impaired CTC survival, and reduced metastasis in preclinical models. Our findings identify the Src/FN1 pathway as a key vulnerability in CTC cluster–driven metastasis, suggesting that Src inhibitors are promising therapeutic strategies to disrupt clustering and improve outcomes in patients with metastatic lung cancer."

Transient absorption measurements reveal that the optical power efficiency of the laser is limited by the relatively short gain lifetime of NCs (160 ps), which nevertheless can be enhanced to 4.2% by implementing a double-pulse excitation scheme. Deep-red liquid lasing from CsPbI3nanocrystals has also been achieved, suggesting the feasibility to develop perovskite liquid lasers that are seamlessly tunable across the whole visible spectrum."

Vince,NLRP3 inflammasome–driven hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis occurs independent of IL-1β and IL-18 and is targetable by BET inhibitors,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. Its high mortality rate reflects limited therapeutic options and a poor understanding of disease-causing signaling. We show that the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for increased mortality in a model of secondary HLH (sHLH). Unexpectedly, neither deletion of the NLRP3-activated pyroptotic effector GSDMD nor combined deletion of the inflammasome-activated cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 conferred strong protection from sHLH. Instead, co-deletion of GSDMD and caspase-8–activated GSDME limited sHLH-driven lethality, demonstrating redundancy in the pyroptotic machinery required to induce sHLH. We also found that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors prevent NLRP3-driven pyroptosis, which acted by blocking inflammasome priming. BET inhibitors prevented increased NLRP3 levels in diseased tissue, limited the production of sHLH-associated IL-1β, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor, and protected from sHLH pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting NLRP3 could limit sHLH and identify clinically relevant bromodomain-selective BET inhibitors capable of eliminating NLRP3-driven pyroptosis and the sHLH cytokine storm."

Understanding the local adaptations and their vulnerabilities to climate change are imperative for developing conservation measures. Here, we combined a multidisciplinary approach to determine the local adaptations of an endemic and near-threatened primate, aiming to reveal its potential to cope with future climate change. Results suggest that climatic fluctuations played an important role in shaping its demographic trajectory and genetic structure. In addition, Tibetan macaques have experienced a severe bottleneck in the recent past, with highly deleterious mutations partially removed, but moderately deleterious mutations accumulating. The severe bottleneck and lower genetic diversity may have reduced their potential to adapt to environmental change, which will compromise long-term viability. Furthermore, we found that the eastern group exhibited higher genomic offsets and loss of suitable habitat in response to climate change. Overall, we emphasize the importance of integrating population genomics and environmental data to predict the adaptation of post-bottleneck populations to rapid climate change."

However, the current approaches to structured sound often have restrictions on the multiplexing capacity of generating sound vortices and lack of dynamic manipulation over them. Here, we unveil an approach to generating structured acoustic waves and achieving remote dynamic control based on the proposed concept of topological-charge (TC) multiplexed metasurface (TCMM). We demonstrate that the TCMM can serve as an efficient device to yield structured sound field with multiple spatial vortex singularities, whose features and physics are entirely determined by the TCs encoded in it. These degrees of freedom can be tuned independently, enabling the dynamic remote control of multiple acoustic vortices and leading to the precise control over their motion. Our findings provide different insights into the generation and control over sound vortices and establish a powerful platform for engineering structured acoustic waves."

Adult muscle cells are large and chain thousands of sarcomeres into long periodic myofibrils that attach to the skeleton. During development, muscle cells must increase in length to maintain the mechanical connection to the growing skeleton. How muscles add new sarcomeres to facilitate muscle growth is unknown. Using live imaging and high-throughput image analysis, we have now tracked the sarcomere components during the developmental growth ofDrosophilamuscle and found that individual sarcomeres divide along the myofibril tension axis into daughter sarcomeres. This way, new sarcomeres can be inserted into contractile and mechanically intact myofibrils. We propose that sarcomere division is triggered by tension and local sarcomere damage originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions. Sarcomere divisions repair damaged sarcomeres, ensure their mechanical integrity, and synchronize sarcomere addition with skeletal growth during animal development."

Recently discovered shatter cones in 3.47-billion-year-old (Ga) rocks reveal that it is also the site of an ancient meteorite impact. Initial reports claimed that the impact occurred at 3.47 Ga and produced a ≥100–kilometer (km) crater; we show that these age and size estimates are inaccurate. Shatter cones are radially oriented over a 6.5-km–diameter area, defining a 16-km–wide structure. Shatter cones postdate regional structures and occur in younger overlying rocks, providing unambiguous evidence that the impact occurred after ~2.7 Ga. We also report the first shocked mineral from this site, the high-pressure TiO2polymorph TiO2-II (srilankite). We provisionally name this feature the Miralga impact structure. The 3.47 Ga hydrothermally altered basalts at Miralga are the oldest known shocked terrestrial rocks, highlighting the site’s analog potential for impacts into biosignature-bearing Archean greenstones and the Martian surface."

Here, we introduce a pressure-driven microinjection (PMI) strategy for the robust and versatile delivery of functional species against biological barriers. With the benefits of elastic porous coating, this strategy enables the capillary suction of drug solutions, localized delivery, and ultrafast penetration through biological barriers by gentle pressure treatment. The penetration capacity is demonstrated by an unprecedented depth (~150 micrometers) of bovine serum albumin (66.4 kilodaltons) across aortic vessels under pressing for only 60 seconds. This spongy coating-based PMI technique can be integrated with medical balloon devices, offering endoluminal treatment within blood vessels, tracheas, and intestines. The in vivo evaluation indicated efficient trans-vascular delivery of 4-octyl itaconate, markedly reducing neointima hyperplasia.

From this outbreak, we have sequenced 2955 complete A(H5N1) viral genomes from samples collected in Canada and, in conjunction with previously published data, performed multifaceted phylodynamic analyses. These analyses reveal extensive diversification of A(H5N1) viruses via reassortment with low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses.

MERS E conducts K+ions with a unitary conductance of 113 picosiemens, fivefold larger than the conductance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 E. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that the MERS E transmembrane domain forms a five-helix bundle that spans the lipid bilayer. The amino-terminal helical interface features multiple interacting phenylalanine (Phe) residues and an asparagine (Asn), whereas the carboxyl-terminal channel pore contains Phe33. Mutation of Phe17abolished K+conductance, whereas mutations of Phe33and Asn15suppressed most channel activity.

Blood Pb was measured during pregnancy (second and third trimesters) and at 4 to 6 years of age. A nonlinear modified power function was used to predict the forgetting rates on the DMTS task, using separate models for prenatal and childhood Pb. Higher childhood Pb [median (interquartile range), 1.7 (1.3) (μg/dl)] was associated with a faster rate of forgetting (β = −0.05; 95% confidence interval: −0.09, −0.01).

Alternatively, wearable devices can provide objective health measurements for continuous recovery monitoring, potentially enabling earlier complication detection in the hospital or community. This study examined biorhythm-based metrics (circadian and ultradian rhythms, derived from the daily activity and heart rate patterns recorded by a consumer wearable) and their relationship to postoperative recovery in children with and without complications. Wearables were given to 103 children for 21 days immediately after appendectomy, and biorhythm metrics were extracted from per-minute data. A machine-learned model using these metrics retrospectively predicted postoperative complications up to 3 days before formal diagnosis with 91% sensitivity and 74% specificity. Our findings suggest that wearable-derived biorhythms offer a promising, unobtrusive method for evaluating postoperative recovery. This approach has broad clinical implications for pediatric health monitoring across various care settings."

Here, we show that rare earth element (REE) isotopes in fine-grained calcium-aluminum–rich inclusions (CAIs) display anomalies stemming from incomplete mixing ofr-,s-, andp-process nucleosynthesis. The data points define two correlations, which are best explained by mixing between three isotopic reservoirs in two successive stages, one of which involved a variable admixture of ap-process component.

Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods.

Their reconfigurable design allows navigation through complex and constrained biomimetic environments, including obstacle negotiation and stair climbing with record speed at the submillimeter scale. We also developed a molecular dynamics–based computational platform that predicts PMDM assembly and motion. PMDMs demonstrated precise, programmable cargo delivery (e.g., drugs and cells) with postdelivery retrieval. These results establish a physical and in silico foundation for future microrobot design and represent a key step toward clinical translation."
