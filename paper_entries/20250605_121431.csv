Christopher,"An investigation of the impact of Canadian wildfires on US air quality using model, satellite, and ground measurements","Canadian wildfires in August 2018 significantly increased surface air pollution across the United States (US) – by up to 69 % in some areas. Using model, satellite, and ground measurements, the study highlights how weather patterns and long-range smoke transport drive pollution. The northwestern US was most affected by Canadian wildfire smoke, while the northeastern US experienced the least impact. These findings indicate the growing concern that wildfire smoke poses to air quality across the US. 
 Canadian wildfires transport large concentrations of particulate matter into the US, leading to various effects on the surface temperature, the radiation balance, and visibility and exacerbating pollution-related respiratory conditions. Using a combination of surface, satellite, and numerical models, this study quantifies the increase in surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the continental US due to long-range transported smoke from Canadian wildfires during a wildfire episode from 9–25 August 2018. As a widely used indicator of surface pollution levels, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) can provide crucial information on columnar pollution mass. However, the daily spatial coverage of satellite AOD is restricted due to cloud cover. In order to quantify the daily changes in surface pollution, we fill in the AOD gaps by utilizing simulated 10 km spatial resolution AOD from a chemistry transport model (CTM). Meteorological variables influencing smoke transport were also integrated alongside the gap-filled AOD product to estimate surface PM2.5 using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and random forest (RF) models. The model with better performance was subsequently applied to quantify PM2.5 changes due to Canadian wildfires. To isolate the impact of Canadian wildfires, we calculate the surface PM2.5 ratio with and without Canadian fire sources by conducting two CTM simulations: one with Canadian wildfire emissions enabled and another with these emissions turned off. Our results show that Canadian wildfires caused a significant increase in surface PM2.5, contributing up to 28 µg m−3 (a 69 % increase) across different US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regions during the August 2018 wildfire event."

The diurnal variation, spatial distribution, and emission hotspots were analyzed with clustering and hotspot analysis, showing unique fine-scale variation characteristics of on-road vehicle emissions. Future scenario analysis demonstrates remarkable benefits of electrification on emission reduction. 
 On-road vehicle emissions play a crucial role in affecting fine-scale air quality and exposure equity in traffic-dense urban areas. They vary largely on both spatial and temporal scales due to the complex distribution patterns of vehicle types and traffic conditions. With the deployment of traffic cameras and big data approaches, we established a bottom-up model that employed interpolation to obtain a spatially continuous on-road vehicle emission mapping for the main urban area of Jinan, revealing fine-scale gradients and emission hotspots intuitively. The results show that the hourly average emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and fine particulate matters from on-road vehicles in urban Jinan were 345.2, 789.7, 69.5, and 5.4 kg, respectively. The emission intensity varied largely with a factor of up to 3 within 1 km on the same road segment. The unique patterns of road vehicle emissions within the urban area were further examined through time series clustering and hotspot analysis. When spatial hotspots coincided with peak hours, emissions were significantly enhanced, making them key targets for traffic pollution control. Based on the established emission model, we predicted that the benefits of vehicle electrification in reducing vehicle emissions could reach 40 %–80 %. Overall, this work provides new methods for developing a high-resolution vehicle emission inventory in urban areas and offers detailed and accurate emission data and fine spatiotemporal variation patterns in urban Jinan, which are of great importance for air pollution control, traffic management, policy-making, and public awareness enhancement."
10.5194/acp-25-5557-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了雷电活动产生的氮氧化物（LNOx）对大气化学成分的影响，特别是基于雷电闪频与氮氧化物生成量之间的反比关系，在气候化学模型中进行模拟。研究结果表明，较弱的雷暴产生更多的LNOx，导致对流层中低层NOx混合比增加，而高层则减少。这进而影响了臭氧、一氧化碳、HOx、硝酸和过氧硝酸的混合比。该研究利用卫星NO2测量数据，改进了LNOx的参数化方法，并评估了其对全球尺度对流层臭氧的影响，以及对甲烷和一氧化碳寿命的微小降低。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是通过卫星观测数据来验证和改进大气化学模型，从而更好地理解和预测大气成分的变化。,"['atmospheric composition', 'nitrogen oxides (NOx)', 'ozone (O3)', 'lightning-produced nitrogen oxides (LNOx)', 'satellite-based NO2 measurements', 'climate-chemistry model', 'tropospheric ozone', 'methane lifetime', 'carbon monoxide lifetime']",Francisco J. Pérez-Invernón;Francisco J. Gordillo-Vázquez;Heidi Huntrieser;Patrick Jöckel;Eric J. Bucsela,Sensitivity of climate–chemistry model simulated atmospheric composition to the application of an inverse relationship between NOx emission and lightning flash frequency,"Lightning plays a significant role in tropospheric chemistry by producing substantial amounts of nitrogen oxides. According to recent estimates, thunderstorms that produce a higher lightning frequency rate also produce less nitrogen oxide per flash. We implemented the dependency of nitrogen oxide production per flash on lightning flash frequency in a chemical atmospheric model. 
 Lightning-produced nitrogen oxides (LNOx = LNO + LNO2) are an important source of upper-tropospheric ozone. Typical parameterizations of LNOx in climate–chemistry models introduce a constant amount of NOx per flash or per flash type. However, recent satellite-based NO2 measurements suggest that the production of LNOx per flash depends on the lightning flash frequency. In this study, we implement a new parameterization of LNOx production per flash based on the lightning flash frequency in a climate–chemistry model to investigate the upper-limit implications for the chemical composition of the atmosphere. We find that a larger production of LNOx in weak thunderstorms leads to a larger mixing ratio of NOx in the lower and middle troposphere, as well as to a lower mixing ratio of NOx in the upper troposphere. The mixing ratios of O3, CO, HOx, HNO3, and HNO4 in the troposphere are influenced by the simulated changes in LNOx. Our findings indicate a larger release of nitrogen oxides from lightning in the lower and middle atmosphere, producing a slightly better agreement with the measurements of tropospheric ozone at a global scale. In turn, we obtain a small decrease in the lifetime of methane and carbon monoxide, ranging between 0.7 % and 3.4 %."

Cziczo,Ice-nucleating properties of glassy  organic and organosulfate aerosol,"Atmospheric ice formation is initiated by particulate matter suspended in air and has profound impacts on Earth's climate. This study focuses on examining the effectiveness of ice formation by a subset of particles composed of organic matter and sulfate. We used experiments and computer modeling to obtain the result that these particles are not effective ice-nucleating particles, suggesting that molecular structure is important for ice formation on these types of particles. 
 The role of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in atmospheric ice nucleation is not well understood, limiting accurate predictions of aerosol indirect effects in global climate simulations. This article details experiments performed to characterize the ice-nucleating properties of proxy SOA.  Experimental techniques in conditioning aerosol to glass transition temperatures (Tg) as low as −70 °C using a pre-cooling unit are described. Ice nucleation measurements of proxy organosulfates (i.e., methyl, ethyl, and dodecyl sulfates) and citric acid were performed using the SPectrometer for ice nucleation (SPIN), operating at conditions relevant to upper-tropospheric cirrus temperatures (−45 °C, −40 °C, −35 °C) and ice saturation ratios (1.0<Sice<1.6). Methyl, ethyl, and dodecyl sulfates did not nucleate ice, despite dodecyl sulfate possessing a Tg higher than ambient temperature. Citric acid nucleated ice heterogeneously at −45 and −40 °C (1.2<Sice<1.4) but required pre-cooling temperatures of −70 °C, notably colder than the lowest published Tg. A kinetic flux model was used to numerically estimate water diffusion timescales to verify experimental observations and predict aerosol phase state. Diffusion modeling showed rapid liquefaction of glassy methyl and ethyl sulfates due to high hygroscopicity, preventing heterogeneous ice nucleation. The modeling results suggest that citric acid nucleated ice heterogeneously via deposition freezing or immersion freezing after surface liquefaction. We conclude that Tg alone is not sufficient for predicting heterogeneous ice formation for proxy SOA using the SPIN."

The aim is to provide the aerosol research community with technical details and practical guidance for establishing an in situ aerosol observational site. The paper also discusses the importance of combining in situ and remote sensing measurements for a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric processes. 
 This paper describes the aerosol in situ laboratory at the CNR-IMAA (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale) Atmospheric Observatory (CIAO) in southern Italy, outlining its configuration and detailing each instrument and sampling line. CIAO has been collecting observations of atmospheric components since 2000. Initially, the activities revolved around aerosol lidar; radiosounding and cloud remote sensing observations were added over the years and made CIAO a leading atmospheric observatory in the Mediterranean region. In 2018, a significant upgrade was started to enhance the observational capability of the observatory by adding aerosol in situ instruments, with the objective to push new research boundaries for aerosol particle characterization and multi-instrument combined approaches. Here, we describe each technical implementation step for building up an extensive aerosol in situ laboratory compliant with ACTRIS (Aerosol, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure) standard operating procedures. Starting from scratch, the long path was initiated in 2018 with the design of the laboratory in terms of instruments, container layout, inlets, and sampling lines, as well as required time and interactions with experts in the field. Reporting on all the details regarding the final solutions implemented at CIAO, this paper will be, for new aerosol in situ laboratories, a practical guide for the implementation of the aerosol in situ observational site."

This methodology considers the interference of atmospheric temperature, humidity, and surface temperature with sulfur dioxide detection and retrieval, laying the groundwork for developing a more accurate and flexible volcanic sulfur dioxide retrieval algorithm under different atmospheric conditions. 
 The Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Type II (HIRAS-II) aboard the Fengyun 3E (FY-3E) satellite provides valuable data on the vertical distribution of atmospheric states. However, effectively extracting quantitative atmospheric information from the observations is challenging due to the large number of hyperspectral sensor channels, inter-channel correlations, associated observational errors, and susceptibility of the results to influence by trace gases. This study explores the potential of FY-3E/HIRAS-II in atmospheric loadings of SO2 from volcanic eruptions. A methodology for selecting SO2-sensitive channels from the large number of hyperspectral channels recorded by FY-3E/HIRAS-II is presented. The methodology allows for the selection of SO2-sensitive channels that contain similar information on variations in atmospheric temperature and water vapor for minimizing the influence of atmospheric water vapor and temperature on SO2. A sensitivity study shows that the difference in brightness temperature between the experimentally selected SO2-sensitive channels and the background channels' efficiency removes interference signals from surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, and water vapor during SO2 detection and inversion. A positive difference between near-surface atmospheric temperature and surface temperature enables the infrared band to capture more SO2 information in the lower and middle layers. The efficiency of FY-3E/HIRAS-II SO2-sensitive channels in quantitatively monitoring volcanic SO2 is demonstrated using data from the 29 April 2024 eruption of Mount Ruang in Indonesia. Using FY-3E/HIRAS-II measurements, the spatial distribution and qualitative information of volcanic SO2 is easily observed. The channel selection can significantly enhance the computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of SO2 detection and retrieval, despite the large volume of data."

Baier;Kathryn McKain;Dan Smale,Advancing CH4 and N2O retrieval strategies for NDACC/IRWG FTIR observations with the support of airborne in situ measurements,"This study evaluates retrieval strategies for CH4 and N2O using high-resolution FTIR observations from Boulder, Colorado. By comparing results with independent AirCore and aircraft in situ measurements, the analysis validates retrieval accuracy and quantifies uncertainties. The findings highlight the benefits of updated spectroscopy and improved a priori profiles and highlight consistent agreement with in situ data. 
 Atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are potent greenhouse gases with significant impacts on climate change. Accurate measurement of their atmospheric abundance is essential for understanding their sources, sinks, and the impact of human activities on the atmosphere. Ground-based high-resolution Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) observations, employed by collaborative international initiatives like the Infrared Working Group (IRWG) within the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), play a vital role in retrieving the atmospheric amounts of these gases. Network-wide consistent data products rely on consistent observations and retrievals. Recent developments in spectroscopy, a priori data, and retrieval software and techniques underscore the necessity to revisit the current retrieval strategies for all NDACC/IRWG species. This study investigates various retrieval strategies of CH4 and N2O utilizing high-resolution FTIR observations in Boulder, Colorado, and compares them with unique airborne in situ measurements. The initial focus is on characterizing retrieval differences across spectroscopy databases. While it is challenging to identify the best retrievals purely based on spectroscopy, as they produce similar outcomes, notable differences in profile shapes and magnitudes underscore the importance of independent validation. Specifically, when multiyear independent nearby AirCore and aircraft in situ profile measurements are used to evaluate vertical distributions and biases in partial columns, they reveal excellent agreement in relative differences with FTIR retrievals and thereby strengthen confidence in the assessment. The final optimized retrievals for CH4 and N2O are presented, incorporating quantitative fitting results and comparisons of vertical profiles as well as partial and total columns. We find that employing a priori profiles using the latest simulations of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) enhances accuracy relative to in situ profiles. While the HITRAN 2020 spectroscopic database is effective for N2O, ATM 2020 provides better results for CH4, with a slight improvement observed when paired with the water vapor line list from the German Aerospace Center (DLR); however, this improvement may be site-dependent. Regarding regularization, both first-order Tikhonov and optimal estimation produce comparable outcomes, as long as the fitted profile degrees of freedom remain between 2 and 2.5. Correspondingly, profile result comparisons yield biases of −0.08 ± 0.38 % and 0.89 ± 0.28 % for tropospheric and stratospheric layers of CH4 relative to AirCore, respectively, whereas they yield a bias of 0.39 ± 0.42 % for aircraft comparisons in the troposphere. For N2O, the bias in the troposphere using aircraft measurements  is approximately 0.18 ± 0.2 %. Uncertainty budgets combining random and systematic sources are provided. Random errors, mainly stemming from temperature profile uncertainties and measurement noise,  dominate in the troposphere for both gases, with a retrieval random error of 0.5 %. Systematic errors primarily arise from HITRAN-based spectral line parameters, predominantly the line intensity and air-broadened half-width. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of atmospheric composition and will support the improvement of a harmonized approach for all IRWG/NDACC sites."

Worthington;Dai Yamazaki;Xiao Zhang;Michele Thieme,Mapping the world's inland surface waters: an upgrade to the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD v2),"The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) version 2 distinguishes a total of 33 non-overlapping wetland classes, providing a static map of the world’s inland surface waters. It contains cell fractions of wetland extents per class at a grid cell resolution of ~500 m. The total combined extent of all classes including all inland and coastal waterbodies and wetlands of all inundation frequencies – that is, the maximum extent – covers 18.2 × 106 km2, equivalent to 13.4 % of total global land area. 
 In recognition of the importance of inland waters, numerous datasets mapping their extents, types, or changes have been created using sources ranging from historical wetland maps to real-time satellite remote sensing. However, differences in definitions and methods have led to spatial and typological inconsistencies among individual data sources, confounding their complementary use and integration. The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), published in 2004, with its globally seamless depiction of 12 major vegetated and non-vegetated wetland classes at 1 km grid cell resolution, has emerged over the last few decades as a foundational reference map that has advanced research and conservation planning addressing freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions, land surface processes, hydrology, and human health. Here, we present a new iteration of this map, termed GLWD version 2, generated by harmonizing the latest ground- and satellite-based data products into one single database. Following the same design principle as its predecessor, GLWD v2 aims to avoid double counting of overlapping surface water features while differentiating between natural and non-natural lakes, rivers of multiple sizes, and several other wetland types. The classification of GLWD v2 incorporates information on seasonality (i.e., permanent vs. intermittent vs. ephemeral); inundation vs. saturation (i.e., flooding vs. waterlogged soils), vegetation cover (e.g., forested swamps vs. non-forested marshes), salinity (e.g., salt pans), natural vs. non-natural origins (e.g., rice paddies), and stratification of landscape position and water source (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine, coastal/marine). GLWD v2 represents 33 wetland classes and – including all intermittent classes – depicts a maximum of 18.2 ×106 km2 of wetlands (13.4 % of the global land area excluding Antarctica). The spatial extent of each class is provided as the fractional coverage within each grid cell at a resolution of 15 arcsec (approximately 500 m at the Equator), with cell fractions derived from input data at resolutions as small as 10 m. The upgraded GLWD v2 offers an improved representation of inland surface water extents and their classification for contemporary conditions (∼ 1984–2020). Despite being a static map, it includes classes that denote intrinsic temporal dynamics. GLWD v2 is designed to facilitate large-scale hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical, and conservation applications, aiming to support the study and protection of wetland ecosystems around the world. The GLWD v2 database is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28519994 (Lehner et al., 2025)."

Treat,An expert survey on chamber measurement techniques and data handling procedures for methane fluxes,"Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, but we do not fully understand how much is released from natural sources like wetlands. To measure methane over large areas, many measurements are needed, often from small chambers that are placed on the ground. However, different researchers use different measurement setups, making it hard to combine data. We surveyed 36 researchers about their methods, summarized the responses, and identified ways to make the data more comparable. 
 Methane is an important greenhouse gas, but the magnitude of global emissions from natural sources remains highly uncertain. To estimate methane emissions on large spatial scales, methane flux data sets from field measurements collected and processed by many different researchers must be combined. One common method for obtaining in situ methane flux measurements is flux chambers. We hypothesize that considerable uncertainty might be introduced into data synthesis products derived from chamber measurements due to the variety of measurement setups and data processing and quality control approaches used within the chamber flux community. Existing guidelines on chamber measurements promote more standardized measurement and data processing techniques, but, to our knowledge, so far, no study has investigated which methods are actually used within the chamber flux community. Therefore, we aimed to identify the key discrepancies between the measurement and data handling procedures implemented for chamber methane fluxes by different researchers.We conducted an expert survey to collect information on why, where, and how scientists conduct chamber-based methane flux measurements and how they handle the resulting data. We received 36 responses from researchers in North America, Europe, and Asia, which revealed that 80 % of respondents have adopted multi-gas analyzers to obtain high-frequency (< 1 Hz) methane concentration measurements over a total chamber closure time of, typically, between 2 and 5 min. Most but not all of the respondents use recommended chamber designs, including features such as airtight sealing, fans, and a pressure vent. We presented a standardized set of methane concentration time series recorded during chamber measurements and derived CH4 flux estimates based on the processing and quality control approaches suggested by the survey participants. The responses showed broad disagreement among the experts concerning the processes that they consider to be responsible for non-linear methane concentration increases. Furthermore, there was a tendency to discard low or negative CH4 fluxes. Based on the expert responses, we estimated a variability of 28 %, introduced by different researchers deciding differently on discarding vs. accepting a measurement when processing a representative data set of chamber measurements. Different researchers choosing different time periods within the same measurement for flux calculation caused an additional variability of 17 %. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the processes causing the patterns in CH4 concentrations visible from high-resolution analyzers, as well as the need for standardized data handling procedures in future chamber methane flux measurements. This is highly important to reliably quantify methane fluxes all over the world.The survey results, as well as the questionnaire, are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.971695 (Jentzsch et al., 2024b)."

Using machine learning methods that combine multiple models, we produced accurate maps showing livestock distribution across seasons. This helps track seasonal changes in grazing and supports better land use, animal health, and climate-related planning. 
 Understanding the spatial-temporal distribution of grazing livestock is crucial for assessing livestock system sustainability, managing animal diseases, mitigating climate change risks, and controlling greenhouse gas emissions. In China, grazing ruminants are predominantly distributed across vast grasslands in semi-humid and alpine regions. However, existing gridded livestock distribution datasets fail to distinguish between grazing and other livestock production systems and do not simultaneously account for long-term and seasonal dynamics. This study introduces CLRD-GLPS, a comprehensive dataset mapping China's ruminant livestock distribution in grazing livestock production systems from 2000 to 2021. Our approach addresses limitations in existing datasets by integrating interpretable machine learning methods to segment grazing livestock from total livestock populations and generate seasonal grazing pastures with dynamic grazing suitability masks. We developed a stacking-based ensemble methodology that enhances predictive performance while providing insights into distribution mechanisms. The stacking ensemble models demonstrate robust performance through 5-fold cross-validation, with R² values ranging from 0.909 to 0.967 for cattle and 0.874 to 0.914 for sheep and goats. Validation results demonstrated the high accuracy of CLRD-GLPS across multiple spatial scales. At the county level, it strongly agreed with census data, effectively capturing grazing livestock distribution. City-level validation confirmed strong agreement (R² = 0.691–0.881), while grid-level validation using independent observations yielded R² = 0.79, further confirming the accuracy of fine-resolution predictions.

It evaluates the performance of the dataset, against in-situ snow depth observations. This dataset is found to perform well in most environments, with challenges at high elevation and some coastal areas. Assessing the quality of this dataset is necessary in order to use it as a baseline to infer future changes of extreme snow loads under climate change. 
 Large snow load events are a major hazard for both human societies, in particular buildings and transport safety, and natural ecosystems. National and European frameworks provide guidelines and standards in order to take into account extreme snow load hazard in infrastructure design. However, there is a lack of reference data for their implementation. This is even more challenging in the context of climate change, which modifies the frequency and intensity of major snow load events. In the context of the Framework Partnership Agreement on Copernicus User Uptake, we have developed a pan-European extreme value analysis of annual snow load maximum based on the Mountain Tourism Meteorological and Snow Indicators (MTMSI) dataset available on the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This dataset includes reanalysis data, based on the UERRA (Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses) reanalysis and snow cover simulations, and past and future climate projections based on regional climate simulations. Here we describe the evaluation of the MTMSI reanalysis component in terms of annual snow depth maxima against multiple in-situ observation datasets. Results are provided at the NUTS-3 (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques) scale used in MTMSI, for multiple elevations, over a large area stretching from the European Alps to the Scandinavian countries. We highlight satisfactory skills of MTMSI annual snow depth maxima on most NUTS-3, based on the Kling-Gupta Efficiency metric, correlation, and bias scores. We identify some areas where MTMSI does not adequately portray in-situ observation of snow depth maxima, located in the Alps, and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Croatia. This study thus provides background information for assessing the relevance of this pan-European dataset in terms of annual snow depth maxima, relevant for annual snow mass and snow load maxima based on complementary information based on snow cover model output.

Over two decades, these restored lands captured 21.77 million metric tons of carbon, Grasslands contributed over 80 % of this carbon storage, highlighting their critical role in climate mitigation. 
 The soil organic carbon pool is a crucial component of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key role in regulating the carbon cycle and mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. To combat soil degradation and enhance soil organic carbon sequestration on the Loess Plateau, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) has been implemented. Accurately quantifying carbon capture and storage (CCS) resulting from farmland retirement is essential for informing land use management. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of retired farmlands on the Loess Plateau was analyzed using Landsat imagery from 1999 to 2021. To assess the effects of the length of farmland retirement, climate, soil properties, elevation, and other factors on CCS, climate-zone-specific linear regression models were developed based on field-sampled soil data. These models were then used to map the dataset of CCS across the retired farmlands. Results indicate that a total of 39,065 km2 of farmland was retired over the past two decades, with 45.61 % converted to grasslands, 29.75 % to shrublands, and 24.64 % to forestlands. The length of farmland retirement showed a significant positive correlation with CCS, and distinct models were developed for different climatic zones to achieve high-resolution (30 m) CCS mapping. The total CCS from retired farmland on the Loess Plateau was estimated at 21.77 Tg in carbon equivalent according to the dataset, with grasslands contributing 81.10 %, followed by forestlands (11.16 %) and shrublands (7.74 %)."

This dataset is filtered and optimized for agricultural applications and meets the operational needs of the systems for early warning, and crop yield forecasting. We have generated a VIIRS-FPAR timeseries, corrected over the MODIS-FPAR data, to guaranty timeseries continuity beyond 2030, thanks to the future VIIRS missions. Data are freely available. 
 Climate change and extreme weather events pose challenges to food security, emphasizing the need for reliable and timely monitoring of crop and rangeland conditions. For this purpose, long-term consistent Earth Observation datasets on vegetation conditions are typically used in early warning and crop yield forecast systems. However, the near-real-time (NRT) production of high quality datasets and the need to guarantee long-term records present various challenges. To address these, we present a NRT global dataset of Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) at 500 m resolution, optimized for agricultural applications. Our dataset combines MODIS-FPAR (Collection 6.1) and VIIRS-FPAR (Collection 2) data, ensuring continuity from 2000 to well beyond 2030. We applied a robust filtering approach based on the Whittaker smoother to produce reliable FPAR estimates in NRT, accounting for sparse and irregular spaced observations due to cloud cover. The dataset is composed of two 10-day filtered timeseries: 1) MODIS-FPAR for 2000 to 2023, being the reference dataset, and 2) intercalibrated VIIRS-FPAR for 2018 onward. While several methods can effectively smooth and gap-fill FPAR data (i.e., using observations before and after the estimation date), our method is designed for optimal filtering in NRT (i.e., using only prior observations). Our approach yields six successive estimates of the same FPAR data point with increasing quality: a inital estimate immediately after the 10-day reference period, four subsequent estimates every 10 days using new observations, and a final consolidated estimate 90 days later. The implemented filtering ingests the available FPAR observations and their original quality assessment (QA) layers. To avoid unrealistic extrapolation when observations are sparse, we impose constraints, season and location specific, to FPAR estimates. We then intercalibrated the VIIRS-FPAR with the MODIS-FPAR filtered timeseries, using a mean difference correction approach, to ensure consistency between both series. This paper describes the filtering and intercalibration method used, the quality assessment of resulting timeseries, and details the obtained products and the corresponding QA layers. The NRT FPAR dataset is publicly available through the Joint Research Centre Data Catalogue, https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/1aac79d8-0d68-4f1c-a40f-b6e362264e50 (Seguini et al., 2025)."

Here we present IMI version 2.0 with vastly expanded capabilities. These updates enable a wider range of scientific and stakeholder applications from individual basin to global scales with continuous emissions monitoring. 
 Satellite observations of atmospheric methane are a powerful resource for quantifying methane emissions over any region worldwide. The inverse methods needed to infer emissions from these observations require a high level of scientific and technical expertise as well as access to large computational and data processing resources. The Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) is an open-access cloud computing tool designed for researchers and non-expert users to obtain total sector-resolved methane emissions worldwide at up to 0.25°×0.3125° (≈25×25km2) resolution by analytical inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations with closed-form error characterization. Here we describe IMI version 2.0 with vastly expanded capabilities relative to the original version. Major developments include (i) a new blended TROPOMI+GOSAT dataset for higher data quality, (ii) order-of-magnitude speed-up in Jacobian matrix construction, (iii) improved error characterization through use of super-observations, (iv) improved methods for initial and boundary conditions, (v) adaptive spatial resolution linked to observational information content, (vi) incorporation of point source observations in state vector construction, (vii) option to optimize tropospheric OH (main methane sink), (viii) global inversion capability, (ix) Kalman filter option for continuous monitoring of emissions, (x) updated default prior emission inventories, (xi) option for lognormal error probability density functions to characterize emissions, (xii) additional output visualization (sectoral emissions, temporal variability), and (xiii) containerization to facilitate download to local computing facilities and operation as part of the US GHG Center.

Here we collected published data and found that the study region for MPs in bivalves was spread across the globe, reporting approximately 40,000 bivalves and comprising 102 species in 22 families. A linear positive correlation was obtained between average MP abundance (items/individual) and average shell length of bivalves, while a negative exponential relationship between average MP abundance (items/g) and average shell length of bivalves was found. This suggested that larger bivalves tend to contain more MPs (items/individual), but MP abundance (items/g) tends to be lower in larger bivalves. It was conservatively estimated that the annual dietary intake of MPs of bivalves from global 21 countries reached 6.39 × 1012 MPs in 2022. Besides, the study found that the soft tissue wet weight of bivalves is an available parameter to estimate the abundance of MPs in bivalves from markets and aquafarms.

Developing energy-efficient and sustainable desalination methods is crucial to addressing the global water crisis. In recent years, hydrogel-based desalination has emerged as a promising approach due to the excellent water absorption capacity and stimuli-responsive properties of hydrogels. However, conventional dewatering methods for recovering water from hydrogels often suffer from low efficiency and poor stability. To address these challenges, a novel approach using ammonia gas to dewater poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) hydrogels was investigated, achieving significantly higher dewatering rates (up to 110 gH2O/ghydrogel/h), among the highest reported, with water production rates ranging from 600 to 1140 LH2O/kghydrogel/day and an average salt rejection of around 60% for both synthetic and real seawater water. The process also demonstrated excellent stability, maintaining a consistent performance over 100 cycles. This technology shows great potential for desalinating brackish water for agricultural irrigation or integration with reverse osmosis systems for seawater desalination, significantly reducing energy consumption and capital costs.

However, the existing toxicokinetic modeling for dietary uptake of PFAS is limited. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to diet-borne PFAS with diverse structures for 3 days, followed by a 12 day depuration. The PFAS levels in zebrafish were monitored and predicted by toxicokinetic models. The experimental results showed intermittent feeding caused a peak PFAS level during feeding intervals. A two-compartment model considering intermittent feeding can accurately describe the dietary uptake kinetics of PFAS and provide a robust estimation of assimilation efficiency. The extent of PFAS level fluctuation is determined by the elimination rate constant in the whole body. Subsequently, a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model considering intermittent dietary uptake was developed to predict the internal body burden and tissue distribution of PFAS in zebrafish. The incorporation of intermittent feeding into the PBTK model significantly enhanced the model performance and provided PFAS level estimates within a factor of 2 for most of the experimental measurements during exposure. This study underscores the significant influence of intermittent dietary uptake on the internal body burden of PFAS in fish and advocates for its integration within the toxicokinetic model framework."

However, the specific bacteria involved in the biodegradation of arsenosugars released from the marine algae remains unknown. Our current work aims to identify bacteria linked to organoarsenical degradation under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In this study, red alga Pyropia haitanensis was degraded under anaerobic and aerobic conditions for 28 days after being incubated in seawater with or without 1 μM arsenite under aerobic conditions for 5 days. The compositions of the bacterial community, total arsenic, and arsenic species were analyzed. Both total arsenic and arsenolipids were released from the algae more rapidly under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. After 28 days of aerobic incubation, the predominant arsenic species inside the algae were phosphate arsenosugars (89.1%), while dimethylarsonic acid (83.8%) was the major species under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, the analysis of the bacterial community structure revealed that different bacteria were enriched under anaerobic (Pseudoalteromonas) and aerobic conditions (Pir4_lineage). Pseudoalteromonas sp. C71 isolated from seawater was used to degrade arsenosugars. The results showed that Pseudoalteromonas sp.

Here, we examine biogeochemical factors regulating wood degradation in saturated woodchip beds, with a focus on the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) in generating oxidative activity that can enhance wood decomposition. Woodchips from a 10-year-old WBR were characterized with bulk techniques and a novel combination of μX-ray scattering, μXRF, and μXANES to visualize the depletion of crystalline cellulose as a proxy for wood degradation. Woodchips from upstream portions of the reactor exhibited the greatest degradation, probably due to greater DO exposure, and degradation was localized to a 100 to 200 μm thick surface layer that was also associated with higher concentrations of Fe and Mn. Greater degradation was associated with faster nitrate removal. μXANES analysis of Fe and Mn in the surface layer indicated the presence of a microenvironment in which oxygenation reactions of Fe(II) and Mn(II) could contribute to the formation of reactive oxidants involved in the degradation of lignocellulose. Our results provide new insight into biogeochemical properties that influence wood decomposition in WBRs at both micro- and macroscales and how these wood degradation processes are coupled with denitrification."

However, deciphering the complex drivers of metal allometry is difficult because size and age often confound each other. In this study, we took advantage of a natural experiment provided by populations of oysters of known ages that exhibited substantial size variation within the same age cohorts.

Our results indicate that bioaccumulation efficiency primarily drives the allometric patterns of metal concentrations with age exerting a more pronounced influence than size. Older oysters showed a diminished bioaccumulation capacity, leading to negative correlations between the metal concentration and size.

A recently developed plume regression technique is further enhanced to calculate highly disaggregated emission factors for a wide range of vehicle classes. The data reveal a strong improvement in the emissions performance for NOx from passenger cars on going from laboratory to on-road testing. However, for emissions of PN and BC, disaggregation by vehicle manufacturers for diesel passenger cars highlights anomalously high emissions from some manufacturers. Emissions from one manufacturer, which predate on-road testing, are up to a factor of 4 higher than the average of other manufacturers and are among those being scrutinized in several European countries through enhanced periodic technical inspections (PTI) that for the first time considered PN. Near-road concentration source apportionment reveals a broader range of vehicle types contributing to PN and BC compared to NOx.

Results show that the reaction rates in Na2SO4 droplets increased by 25-fold as the particle radius decreased from ∼40 to ∼4 μm. An even higher enhancement of ∼100 times was observed in NaCl and NaI particles, likely due to the NO2–halide interactions. The enhancement in NaBr particles, however, was comparable to that in Na2SO4 particles. Kinetic modeling results illustrate that the accelerated reactions are due to ∼6 orders of magnitude enhancement factor (EF) of surface reaction rates over bulk-phase reaction rates. Compared to Na2SO4 particles, the surface reaction rates increase by factors of 2.3, 1.5, and 4.4 in NaCl, NaBr, and NaI particles, respectively. Under ambient conditions, EFs can increase by up to 108, corresponding to the ambient nitrate production rates of >1 μg m–3 h–1.

Mitigating I-THMs remains challenging due to the complex interactions among water quality parameters, disinfectants, and iodine sources, compounded by the difficulty of predicting their formation under varying treatment conditions. This study leverages a data set of 1534 samples from published studies to predict I-THM formation using machine learning (ML). Among five evaluated ensemble models, CatBoost Regression achieved the best performance. Incorporating domain-specific features (iodine/DOC and oxidant/DOC ratios) improved model accuracy and interpretability. Recursive feature elimination revealed that nearly half of the features could be excluded without compromising performance, simplifying model development and reducing experimental effort, an advantage often overlooked in prior research. Feature analysis identified key predictors and mitigation strategies, including minimizing iodine and bromide concentrations, reducing iodine/DOC, UV254 and SUVA levels, and optimizing chlorine dose. The model further enabled rapid identification of the optimal chlorine dose to minimize I-THMs using incremental and Bayesian optimization. Achieving an R2 of 0.67 on an external validation data set, the model demonstrated strong generalizability. This study establishes ML as a powerful tool for predicting and mitigating I-THMs, offering actionable strategies for safer drinking water treatment."

Prather,Calibrating the Tropospheric Air and Ozone Mass,"We divide the atmosphere into distinct spheres based on their physical, chemical, and dynamical traits. In deriving chemical budgets and climate trends, which differ across spheres, we need clearly defined boundaries. Our primary spheres are the troposphere and stratosphere (∼99.9% by mass), and the boundary between them is the tropopause. Every global climate‐weather model has one or more methods to calculate the lapse rate tropopause, but these involve subjective choices and are known to fail near the sub‐tropical jets and polar regions. Age‐of‐air tracers clock the effective time‐distance from the tropopause, allowing unambiguous separation of stratosphere from troposphere in the chaotic jet regions. We apply a global model with synthetic tracer e90 (90‐day e‐folding), focusing on ozone and temperature structures about the tropopause using ozone sonde and satellite observations. We calibrate an observation‐consistent tropopause for e90 using tropics‐plus‐midlatitudes and then apply it globally to calculate total tropospheric air‐mass and tropopause ozone values. The tropopause mixing barrier for the current UCI CTM is identified by a transition in the vertical transport gradient to stratospheric values of 15 days km−1, corresponding to an e90 tropopause at 81 ± 2 ppb with a global tropospheric air mass of 82.2 ± 0.3%. The best e90 tropopause based on sonde pressures is 70–80 ppb; but that for ozone is 80–90 ppb, implying that the CTM tropopause ozone values are too large. This approach of calibrating an age‐of‐air tropopause can be readily applied to other models and possibly used with observed age‐of‐air tracers like sulfur hexafluoride."

Previous characterizations of the drydown patterns assume a static linear relationship between water‐limited transpiration and available moisture. However, ecohydrological studies show that vegetation exhibits a spectrum of responses to water availability, suggesting that soil moisture loss functions may be nonlinear. To represent these dynamics, we introduce a nonlinearity parameter to the loss function. Our analysis shows that the nonlinear loss model improves the characterization of the satellite‐observed soil moisture drydowns. Globally, functional responses of drydowns are dominated by convex nonlinearity, showing less ecosystem water loss in dry soils than the linear loss function predicts. We find distinct degrees of nonlinearity among different vegetation types; areas with non‐woody vegetation more frequently exhibit a concave nonlinearity, the signature of aggressive water‐use strategies. We propose the nonlinear loss function as a continuous and dynamic framework to represent vegetation water‐use under changing water availability."

The results reveal a notable negative correlation between the abundance of brGDGT‐IIIa and grain size, indicating the non‐negligible influence of soil‐derived brGDGTs on temperature. Using the grain size‐brGDGT‐IIIa relationship, we assessed the contribution of soil‐derived brGDGTs and corrected the temperature accordingly. The results reveal a ∼6°C warming from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 23–20 kyr) to the mid‐Holocene (∼8–6 kyr), punctuated by several millennial‐scale events, including Heinrich event 1 (H1; 16.5–15 kyr), the Bølling‐Allerød (B/A; 15–12.8 kyr), and the Younger Dryas (YD; ∼12.8–11 kyr), with H1 being the coldest interval. The δDwax records show that H1 was the driest interval, with a drier LGM and YD and a wet B/A and early‐ to mid‐Holocene. Furthermore, the δDwax records display a pattern of variation similar to the interhemispheric temperature gradient, indicating that the intensity of this gradient is the primary factor controlling the ISM precipitation.

As a robust climate indicator, lake ice phenology responds sensitively to these changes. Beyond climate conditions, lake ice is also influenced by lake properties, which have also been changing rapidly. However, their impact on lake ice has been understudied due to limited data. Therefore, we used Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 brightness temperature data and daily air temperature data to obtain the ice phenology for 182 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau from September 2012 to August 2022. Using this new data set, we examined the impacts of climate change and lake expansion on lake ice dynamics and their future changes. Our findings indicated that lake ice phenology on the Tibetan Plateau was strongly influenced by multiple factors. Freeze‐up dates were primarily affected by lake properties such as latitude, volume, and area, whereas break‐up dates were dominated by air temperature. Using random forest regression, we projected future declines in lake ice under the SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios. Additionally, lake expansion could further delay freeze‐up dates. By the end of this century, freeze‐up dates are expected to be delayed by 3–11 days, while break‐up dates could advance by 2–20 days, depending on the climate scenario.

The LCC over the TPLG in the summer of 1979–2020 exhibited a sudden shift of increased interdecadal variation in 1995. The abnormal increases in evaporation and whole‐layer specific humidity, and the abnormal convergence of 400 hpa water vapor flux, led to an increase in water vapor over the TPLG, which increased the LCC. The water vapor budget shows that the increase is the most significant along the southern boundary. The cyclonic circulation anomaly in the southwest of the TPLG can transport water vapor to the region. The southerly wind and upward wind anomalies in the south favored water vapor transport through the climbing effect. The water vapor budget at the eastern boundary of the TPLG had the highest correlation coefficient with LCC on the interdecadal scale. The anticyclonic circulation anomaly over Lake Baikal inhibited the outflow of water vapor across the eastern boundary. The anticyclonic circulation was associated with the Rossby wave train. The interdecadal warming of sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean‐Black Seas played roles in the maintenance of the Rossby waves. The Rossby wave train propagated upward and eastward from the low layer to 200 hpa in the positive anomaly area of the Rossby wave source.

This study integrates historical restoration trends with future climate scenarios to quantify the spatial patterns and aboveground carbon (AGC) storage potential of natural forest restoration in China, addressing key knowledge gaps. We first examined the relationship between natural forest restoration patterns in China and climatic factors, revealing that the Mean Diurnal Range was the most positively correlated factor influencing restoration, while the Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter had the most substantial negative impact. Based on future climate scenarios (SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5, SSP3‐7.0, and SSP5‐8.5), we predicted potential regions for natural forest restoration and estimated their AGC storage potential.

Here, we used a quantitative and spatial analytical approach to assess the changes of urban greenspace (UG) and examine the equity of changes in ES supply and demand across demographic and socioeconomic groups in Beijing and NYC between 2010 and 2017. Results showed that previously existing green space and its expansion were unevenly distributed across districts. High‐income districts in NYC had high green cover and experienced the highest increase of UG, in contrast to high green cover in areas with low population density and the greatest increase of UG in high‐income areas for Beijing, respectively. The inequitable distribution of UG resulted in a high level of mismatch in supply demand of ES, revealing a pattern of distributional ecological injustice within city. We also found more ecological supply was provided in the areas having less vulnerability, indicating that social vulnerability remained in a lower greenspace exposure after greening implementation in both cities.

Accurately predicting mosquito abundance and dispersion remains a challenge. Complex interactions between mosquito dynamics and various environmental factors, notably hydrology, contribute to this challenge. Existing models typically focus on precipitation and temperature and often overlook further impacts of hydrological variables within mosquito modeling. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence‐based model for mosquito dynamics, explicitly accounting for different hydrological variables, such as precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow. Using Toronto, Canada, as a case study, we identified causal relationships between changes in mosquito populations, hydrological factors, vegetation (e.g., leaf area index), and climate variables (e.g., daylight length, precipitation, and temperature). We embedded these relationships into a Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network Model capable of accurately detecting mosquito dynamics across annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales. The LSTM is able to explain, on average, approximately 40% of the variance in the observed mosquito abundance data. Using the calibrated model, we predicted that the summer season mosquito abundance would increase by ∼16% and ∼19% under an intermediate greenhouse emission scenario, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2–4.5, and a high greenhouse emission scenario, SSP5‐8.5, respectively.

By applying an incremental linear regression model and Machine Learning models, we infer that health‐related QoL and functioning are strongly negatively related to the psychological burden from those being affected by the flooding. This includes how often they think about the traumatic event. Home owners were found to have worse QoL and functioning than tenants. Household income and the status of repair/reconstruction of flood damages—in specific, insurance benefits, private donation and satisfactory claims compensation are associated with high health‐related QoL and functioning.

 Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality1–10. Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 bce. Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology11, not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems.

We first construct a simple variational circuit that prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics by means of a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen11,12. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a new set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.

 Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere1,2. Until now, CO2 and CH4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration3–6. Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4. Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year−1, similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models. Using a global database of the radiocarbon content of rivers combining new and published measurements, isotopic mass balance suggests that about 60% of river CO2 emissions are derived from millennial or older carbon sources."

 Drought is one of the most common and complex natural hazards affecting the environment, economies and populations globally1–4. However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends4–6, and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901–2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy offers a promising approach against cancer1–3. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA–CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.

 Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm1–5. However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited6–9. Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes.

 Cancer cell plasticity enables the acquisition of new phenotypic features and is implicated as a major driver of metastatic progression1,2. Metastasis occurs mostly in the absence of additional genetic alterations3–5, which suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are important6. However, they remain poorly defined. Here we identify the chromatin-remodelling enzyme ATRX as a key regulator of colonic lineage fidelity and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Atrx loss promotes tumour invasion and metastasis, concomitant with a loss of colonic epithelial identity and the emergence of highly plastic mesenchymal and squamous-like cell states. Combined analysis of chromatin accessibility and enhancer mapping identified impairment of activity of the colonic lineage-specifying transcription factor HNF4A as a key mediator of these observed phenotypes. We identify squamous-like cells in human patient samples and a squamous-like expression signature that correlates with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis. Collectively, our study defines the epigenetic maintenance of colonic epithelial identity by ATRX and HNF4A as suppressors of lineage plasticity and metastasis in colorectal cancer. The chromatin-remodelling enzyme ATRX and the transcription factor HNF4A are identified as pivotal regulators of colonic epithelial identity, with roles in metastasis in colorectal cancer."

 Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed-matter systems. Recently, this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons1 and phonons2, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits2,3. In principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB cm−1 level for phononic waveguides, whether topological4–7 or not8–19. Here we combine advanced dissipation engineering20—in particular, the recently introduced method of soft clamping21—with the concept of valley-Hall topological insulators for phonons22–26. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses due to dissipation of 3 dB km−1 at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. The low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in topological phononic waveguides, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120° bend with a 99.99% probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. Our work will inspire new research directions on ultralow-loss phononic waveguides and will provide a clean bosonic system for investigating topological protection and non-Hermitian topological physics. A substantial reduction of losses in a phononic waveguide can be achieved by soft clamping, through which phonons can be guided through very sharp turns with losses accounting for less than one phonon in a million."

 To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behaviour can be learned through reinforcement learning1, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents2–5 and at characterizing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain6–8. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single timescale, known as the discount factor. Here we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopaminergic neurons in mice performing two behavioural tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks, suggesting that it is a cell-specific property. Together, our results provide a new paradigm for understanding functional heterogeneity in dopaminergic neurons and a mechanistic basis for the empirical observation that humans and animals use non-exponential discounts in many situations9–12, and open new avenues for the design of more-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms. Individual dopaminergic neurons encode future rewards over distinct temporal horizons."

 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space around the brain drains to lymph nodes in the neck, but the connections and regulation have been challenging to identify1–24. Here we used fluorescent tracers in Prox1–GFP lymphatic reporter mice to map the pathway of CSF outflow through lymphatics to superficial cervical lymph nodes. CSF entered initial lymphatics in the meninges at the skull base and continued through extracranial periorbital, olfactory, nasopharyngeal and hard palate lymphatics, and then through smooth muscle-covered superficial cervical lymphatics to submandibular lymph nodes. Tracer studies in adult mice revealed that a substantial amount of total CSF outflow to the neck drained to superficial cervical lymph nodes. However, aged mice had fewer lymphatics in the nasal mucosa and hard palate and reduced CSF outflow to cervical lymph nodes. Superficial cervical lymphatics in aged mice had increased endothelial cell expression of Nos3, encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but had less eNOS protein and impaired nitric oxide signalling. Manipulation of superficial cervical lymphatics through intact skin by a force-regulated mechanical device doubled CSF outflow and corrected drainage impairment in aged mice. This manipulation increased CSF outflow by compressing superficial cervical lymphatics while having little effect on their normal spontaneous contractions. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of superficial cervical lymphatics for CSF outflow and the potential for reversing CSF drainage impairment by non-invasive mechanical stimulation. The outflow pathway of cerebrospinal fluid into lymph nodes in the neck and how non-invasive mechanical stimulation can enhance drainage and restore impaired outflow in aged mice are explored."

 North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature patterns profoundly influence global and regional climate across all timescales, from synoptic1 to seasonal2–4, decadal5, multidecadal6,7 and beyond8,9. During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation10,11. Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen. Atmospheric reanalyses combined with ocean observations and model simulations show that the extreme 2023 North Atlantic heatwave was primarily driven by anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling mixed layers, with a smaller contribution from clearer skies."

 Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is the most common somatic alteration in men and is associated with higher mortality from epithelial cancers1–3. In tumours, epithelial LOY is also associated with poor survival4–7. This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality.

 Microangiopathy is a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the acute and chronic complications of the disease1. Endotheliopathy and dysregulated blood coagulation are prominent in COVID-19 and are considered to be major causes of microvascular obstruction1,2. Here we demonstrate extensive endothelial cell (EC) death in the microvasculature of COVID-19 organs. Notably, EC death was not associated with fibrin formation or platelet deposition, but was linked to microvascular red blood cell (RBC) haemolysis. Importantly, this RBC microangiopathy was associated with ischaemia–reperfusion injury, and was prominent in the microvasculature of humans with myocardial infarction, gut ischaemia, stroke, and septic and cardiogenic shock. Mechanistically, ischaemia induced MLKL-dependent EC necroptosis and complement-dependent RBC haemolysis. Deposition of haemolysed RBC membranes at sites of EC death resulted in the development of a previously unrecognized haemostatic mechanism preventing microvascular bleeding. Exaggeration of this haemolytic response promoted RBC aggregation and microvascular obstruction. Genetic deletion of Mlkl from ECs decreased RBC haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and reduced ischaemic organ injury. Our studies demonstrate the existence of a RBC haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs, functioning independently of platelets and fibrin. Therapeutic targeting of this haemolytic process may reduce microvascular obstruction in COVID-19, and other major human diseases associated with organ ischaemia.

 Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are used in many applications in the global energy transition, including for lightweighting aircraft and vehicles and in wind turbine blades, shipping containers and gas storage vessels1–4. Given the high cost and energy-intensive manufacture of CFRPs5–7, recycling strategies are needed that recover intact carbon fibres and the epoxy-amine resin components. Here we show that acetic acid efficiently depolymerizes both aliphatic and aromatic epoxy-amine thermosets used in CFRPs to recoverable monomers, yielding pristine carbon fibres. Deconstruction of materials from multiple sectors demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, providing clean fibres from 2 h reactions. The optimal conditions were scaled to 80.0 g of post-consumer CFRPs, and demonstrative composites were fabricated from the recycled carbon fibres, which were recycled two more times, maintaining their strength throughout. Process modelling and techno-economic analysis, with feedstock cost informed by wind turbine blade waste generation8, indicates this method is cost effective, with a minimum selling price of US$1.50 per kg for recycled carbon fibres whereas life cycle assessment shows process greenhouse gas emissions around 99% lower than virgin carbon fibre production. Overall, this approach could enable recycling of industrial CFRPs as it provides clean, mechanically viable recycled carbon fibres and recoverable resin monomers from the thermoset.

 RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters1–7. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)8–11 and elongation complex (EC)12–16 have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4–13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6–13). Together with KMnO4 footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC–EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA–DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC–EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation–elongation transition for an RNA polymerase.

 Chromatin remodellers are pivotal in the regulation of nucleosome dynamics in cells, and they are important for chromatin packaging, transcription, replication and DNA repair1. Here we show that the human chromatin remodeller SMARCAD1 exhibits a substrate preference for subnucleosomal particles over the canonical nucleosome. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of SMARCAD1 bound to the nucleosome and hexasome provide mechanistic insights into the substrate selectivity. SMARCAD1 binds to the hexasome through multiple family-specific elements that are essential for the functions in vitro and in cells. The enzyme binds to the canonical nucleosome in an inactive conformation, which accounts for its diminished activity towards the nucleosome. Notably, the histone chaperone FACT complex acts synergistically with H2A–H2B to promote the activity of SMARCAD1 in nucleosome remodelling. Together, our findings reveal an avenue for chromatin regulation, whereby subnucleosomes are remodelled through an ATP-dependent process.

 Lactobacillus displacement from the vaginal microbiome associates with adverse health outcomes and is linked to increased risk of preterm birth. Glycans mediate bacterial adhesion events involved in colonisation and infection. Using customised glycan microarrays, we establish glycan interaction profiles of vaginal bacteria implicated in reproductive health. Glycan binding signatures of the opportunistic pathogens Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus agalactiae to oligomannose N-glycans, galactose-terminating glycans and hyaluronic acid, respectively are highly distinct from Lactobacillus commensals. Binding to sulphated glycosaminoglycans by vaginal bacteria is pH dependent, as is binding to neutral and sialic acid-terminating glycans by F. nucleatum. Adhesion of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, S. agalactiae and F. nucleatum to vaginal epithelial cells is partially mediated by chondroitin sulphate. S. agalactiae binding to chondroitin sulphate C oligosaccharides is inhibited by L. crispatus.

 The design and control of atomic-scale spin structures constitute major challenges for spin-based quantum technology platforms, including quantum dots, color centers, and molecular spins. Here, we showcase a strategy for designing the quantum properties of molecular spin qubits by combining tip-assisted on-surface assembly with electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM): We fabricate magnetic dimer complexes that consist of an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule and an organometallic half-sandwich complex formed by the FePc ligand and an attached iron atom, Fe(C6H6). The total complex forms a mixed-spin (1/2,1) quantum ferrimagnet with a well-separated correlated ground state doublet, which we utilize for coherent control. As a result of the correlation, the quantum ferrimagnet shows an improved spin lifetime ( > 1.5 μs) as it is partially protected against inelastic electron scattering. Lastly, the ferrimagnet units also enable intermolecular coupling, that can be used to realize both ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic structures. Thus, quantum ferrimagnets provide a versatile platform to improve coherent control in general and to study complex magnetic interactions. Molecular complexes can function as spin qubits, and like other qubit architectures, making molecular spin qubits more resilient against interactions is vital for their use.

 Single-shot terahertz (THz) spectroscopy probes sub-picosecond, non-repetitive events by combining the advantages of laser absorption with phase-sensitive interferometry. However, its usage as a quantitative tool is hindered by the chirp penalty of the spectral encoding scheme, where a narrow probe bandwidth distorts THz signals, limiting the bandwidth and spectral resolution of THz measurements. In this work, we introduce Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS), a method that leverages a broadband supercontinuum probe to overcome these challenges. SETS is shown to increase the usable bandwidth from 1.5 to 2.3 THz (based on the chirped pulse width and supercontinuum bandwidth), reduce signal distortion by 50%, and mitigate null frequencies. Experiments on argon plasma and water vapor, supported by modeling, show SETS enables simultaneous measurement of electron density, collision frequency, and absorption spectra. By mitigating core limitations of single-shot diagnostics, SETS offers a scalable path for quantitative, high-resolution measurements in dynamic, reactive media.

Here, the authors use piezoelectric materials as mechanochemical redox catalysts with 9-phenyl-dihydroacridine as a sacrificial electron donor, enabling efficient consecutive electron transfer. 
 Mechanical-force-induced redox catalysis has emerged as a green and expeditous approach in synthetic chemistry, relying on single-electron transfer from polarized piezoelectric materials to substrates initiated by mechanical agitation. However, the piezoelectric potential generated can sometimes be insufficient to activate the electron transfer process, similar to the limitations observed in photocatalytic reactions. In this work, we introduce a catalytic strategy employing a consecutive mechanical-force-induced electron transfer (ConMET) strategy. This strategy uses piezoelectric materials as mechanochemical redox catalysts with 9-phenyl-dihydroacridine as a sacrificial electron donor, enabling efficient consecutive electron transfer. Our method effectively reduces aryl iodides, bromides, and even electron-rich aryl chlorides, which possess reduction potentials as high as −2.8 V (vs. SCE), leading to the formation of aryl radicals. Ultimately, this strategy facilitates anti-Markovnikov hydroarylation of alkenes and dehalogenative deuteration of aromatic halides under mild conditions.

 Infancy is a critical window for the colonization of gut microbiome. However, xenobiotic impacts on gut microbiome development in early life remain poorly understood. Here, we recruit 146 mother-infant pairs and collect stool samples at 3, 6, and 12 months after delivery for amplicon sequencing (N = 353), metagenomics (N = 65), and metabolomics (N = 198). Trace elements in maternal hair samples (N = 119) affect diversity and composition of the infant gut microbiome. Shannon diversity in 3 month-old infants is correlated positively with selenium and negatively with copper, and relative abundance of Bifidobacterium increases under high exposure to aluminum and manganese. During the first year of life, infants and their paired mothers have distinct microbial diversity and composition, and their bacterial community structures gradually approach. here are 56 differential metabolites between the first and second visit and 515 differential metabolites between the second and third visit. The typical profile of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) significantly differs between infants and their mothers.

 Mitophagy, the selective autophagic elimination of mitochondria, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality and cell homeostasis. Impairment of mitophagy flux, a process involving multiple sequential intermediates, is implicated in the onset of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Screening mitophagy inducers, particularly understanding their impact on mitophagic intermediates, is crucial for neurodegenerative disease treatment. However, existing techniques do not allow simultaneous visualization of distinct mitophagic intermediates in live cells. Here, we introduce an artificial intelligence-assisted fluorescence microscopic system (AI-FM) that enables the uninterrupted recognition and quantification of key mitophagic intermediates by extracting mitochondrial pH and morphological features. Using AI-FM, we identify a potential mitophagy modulator, Y040-7904, which enhances mitophagy by promoting mitochondria transport to autophagosomes and the fusion of autophagosomes with autolysosomes. Y040-7904 also reduces amyloid-β pathologies in both in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer’s disease.

 Embryonic tissues undergo coordinated flows during avian gastrulation to establish the body plan. Here, we elucidate how the interplay between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues affects the chick embryo’s size and shape. These two distinct geometric changes are each associated with dynamic curves across which trajectories separate (kinematic repellers). Through physical modeling and experimental manipulations of both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, we selectively eliminate either or both repellers in model and experiments, revealing their mechanistic origins. We find that embryo size is affected by the competition between extraembryonic epiboly and embryonic myosin-driven contraction—which persists when mesoderm induction is blocked. Instead, the characteristic shape change from circular to pear-shaped arises from myosin-driven cell intercalations in the mesendoderm, irrespective of epiboly. These findings elucidate modular mechanisms controlling avian gastrulation flows and provide a mechanistic basis for the independent control of embryo size and shape during development.

 Identifying crops with novel and climate resilience traits is imperative to ensure food security. Without a basic understanding of the genomes and genomic diversity of these crops they will remain underutilised or could even become lost. Kersting’s groundnut [Macrotyloma geocarpum (Harms) Maréchal & Baudet] is one such crop, regarded as a useful, drought tolerant and sometimes valuable legume.

Four candidate genes involved in pathways relating to pigments or flavonoids are revealed.

 Adhesives are ubiquitous in industries and daily life. However, conventional fossil-derived adhesives pose substantial health and environmental risks during manufacturing and utilization. The development of nontoxic high-performance adhesives from renewable feedstocks is therefore highly desired but remains technically challenging. Here we report a high-performing hot-melt adhesive—glue that is applied in a hot molten state—derived from a byproduct of the pulp industry, xylan, a type of hemicellulose. Under optimal conditions, the lap-shear strength between wood chips can reach approximately 30 MPa, surpassing that of classic epoxy resins and far exceeding that of a commercial hot-melt adhesive (ethylene vinyl acetate). Furthermore, the xylan hot-melt adhesive exhibits excellent reusability for multiple applications, retaining more than 100% of its original adhesion strength even after ten reuse cycles. Toxicity tests show good biocompatibility for xylan hot-melt adhesive. Overall, this work provides useful insights into the design of high-performance, reusable, bio-based adhesives for enhanced sustainability.

 The responses of the western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclone (TC) genesis and associated large-scale atmospheric environment to varying CO2 pathways are investigated using an idealized CO2 removal experiment. In the experiment, CO2 concentration is first increased at the rate of 1% year−1 until quadrupled and then decreased at the same rate until it reaches the initial level. Our results indicate asymmetric changes in WNP peak-season (July–September) TC genesis between CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down periods, showing a significant reduction of TC genesis over the Philippine Sea and landfalling TCs in East Asia when the CO2 concentration is reduced. Such TC activity changes are attributed to the development of WNP anticyclonic circulation in the ramp-down period, in association with an El Niño-like delayed response in sea surface temperature. This asymmetric response of WNP TC activities to symmetric CO2 pathway may provide a reference for regional TC disaster prevention and preparations under mitigation conditions."

The analysis included 265,076 pneumonia and/or tracheitis cases among schoolchildren in Jiangsu Province, China. We observed significant urban–rural disparities and spatial clustering in air pollution and temperature variation. Cumulative exposure to all pollutants was positively associated with increased risk of illness-related absences, with stronger effects observed in urban schools and during low-temperature conditions overall. Boys showed higher initial sensitivity to air pollution, while girls exhibited greater vulnerability after 10–14 days. Notably, urban children were most affected by combined exposures to low temperature-high pollution, whereas rural children experienced greater combined risks under high-temperature conditions.

 Seasonal vertical migration of large lipid-rich copepods is often described as a mass descent of animals when primary production ceases, with important implications for mesopelagic food webs and global carbon sequestration. This view ignores the existence of surface-resident individuals, but here we show that non-migrants can form a substantial part of the populations of polar migrant species. In the Central Arctic Ocean, the biomass-dominant Calanus hyperboreus was evenly distributed throughout the water column from November 2019 to March 2020, with ~20% of subadults and adult females remaining in the upper 200 m and ~41% migrating to 1000–2000 m. These vertical positions aligned with differences in the copepods’ cholesterol content, which can enhance the tissue density at higher temperatures. Gonad development and the vertical distribution of their offspring indicate that both non-migrant and migrant females contribute to the population recruitment. We reinterpret copepod seasonal migration as a bet-hedging strategy that balances nutritional benefits near the surface with survival benefits at depth, and thereby contributes to the species’ resilience under climatic change.

 The export of organic carbon from terrestrial ecosystems by erosion may play a central role in balancing the geological carbon cycle and Earth’s climate over millennial timescales. However, constraints on organic carbon yields have come from sampling modern rivers that don’t capture variation over decades to millennia driven by changing hydroclimate and erosion during extreme events. Here we use volumetric reconstructions of lake sedimentary fills to generate timeseries of sediment and organic carbon yields from two catchments draining the Southern Alps, New Zealand over the last millennium. The reconstructed yields indicate that earthquake-induced landslides significantly increase sediment and organic carbon yields, contributing to pulsed export that accounts for ~40% of the total. Between extreme events, organic carbon export increased twofold during centuries with a wetter reconstructed climate. Our findings suggest that the link between hydroclimate and organic carbon export may act as a negative feedback in the longer-term carbon cycle.

 Trans-boundary black carbon aerosols from South Asia profoundly affects the climate and cryosphere of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the integration effects of black carbon on radiative forcing and precipitation, as well as on solid water storage remain to a large extent unknow. This study presents the systematic assessment of both direct melting and indirect precipitation mass supply effects on glaciers for the 2007-2016 period. Key findings reveal that South Asian black carbon deposition reduced glacial albedo, increasing melt by 7.5%, while black carbon-induced precipitation reduction caused an additional 6.1% mass loss. Combined, these effects drove 33.7% solid water storage decreases in the Himalayas. The excess ice-loss poses a critical threat to water resource for downstream population centers in Indus and Ganges-Brahmaputra exorheic basins, with reductions of approximately 18.9% and 25.7%, respectively.

 Urban thermal anisotropy poses significant challenges for accurately retrieving land surface temperature (LST) in urban environments using wide-swath polar orbiters. Existing physical and kernel-driven models often require detailed urban structural and property information or rely on simultaneous multi-angle LST observations, limiting their applicability for normalizing directional LSTs across diverse urban settings worldwide. Here we propose a UNIversal, easy-To-usE Data-driven (UNITED) method for angular normalization of directional LSTs across global cities, integrating advanced machine learning techniques with multi-source remote sensing and reanalysis data. We applied this method to normalize directional urban LSTs from all available wide-swath polar orbiters (Aqua MODIS, Terra MODIS, Suomi-NPP VIIRS) on Google Earth Engine, leveraging their full archives of multi-angle observations (2003–2024 for MODIS and 2012–2024 for VIIRS). The method's high accuracy in normalizing these three products was rigorously validated using quasi-simultaneous, near-nadir LSTs from various satellite platforms (e.g., Landsat) across tens of millions of urban pixels worldwide under diverse spatial, temporal, and angular conditions. For example, for Aqua MODIS observations with viewing zenith angle exceeding ±55°, angular normalization reduces the root mean square error and bias relative to nadir VIIRS LSTs (used as the reference) from 5.71 °C and −4.92 °C to 2.43 °C and −0.40 °C, respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of the UNITED method in harmonizing directional urban LSTs.

 In September 2023, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) released the TanDEM-X 30 m Edited DEM (TDX30) and DEM Change Map (DCM). Although the improved resolution has garnered interest within the scientific community, the presence of artefacts—such as discontinuous terrain representation, abnormal values, and extensive noise—remains underreported in the literature. Artefact regions are typically small, but terrain analysis results within these regions are fundamentally incorrect, necessitating attention. Moreover, the quality mask provided by DLR cannot accurately reflect the extent of artefacts. To address this limitation, a novel artefact detection framework integrating multiple terrain features was proposed. Specifically, twelve terrain features (including slope, roughness, second-order derivatives, etc.) were selected for their ability to discriminate artefacts, and a CatBoost model is implemented for artefact detection. The proposed method was tested in the Loess Plateau. Contrary to expectations, over the Loess Plateau, the higher-resolution TDX30 resulted in a nearly 80 % increase in artefact areas compared to the TanDEM-X 90 m DEM (TDX90) (from 195.84 km2 to 355.21 km2), highlighting a quality degradation issue associated with resolution enhancement. However, the artefact area of TDX30DCM (i.e., DCM-updated TDX30) was reduced to 162.63 km2, demonstrating a significant suppressive effect. A fundamental relationship between artefacts and satellite observation geometry was identified: artefact occurrence frequency was notably higher on east–west slopes compared to north–south slopes, with concentrations in the 35°∼55° slope range, corresponding to TanDEM-X’s polar orbit and right-looking observation mode. Validation results demonstrated strong detection accuracy of the proposed method across each DEM: 96.84 % for TDX90, 98.44 % for TDX30, and 97.18 % for TDX30DCM. This study establishes a scalable artefact detection framework and offers significant scientific and practical value for facilizing the quality improvement of global DEM products."

 Vegetation resilience is crucial for understanding the self-repair and adaptive capacity of regional ecosystems. Opencast coal mine dumps, typical targets for ecological restoration, exhibit highly unstable vegetation ecosystems after restoration, making them prone to state shifts. However, existing studies have limitations in capturing vegetation resilience characteristics and its climatic driving mechanisms. This study addresses these deficiencies by focusing on the Pingzhuang West Opencast Coal Mine dumps, utilizing Critical Slowing Down (CSD) theory and long-term Landsat remote sensing data from 2008 to 2024. We propose ’MultiRes’, a pixel-level (30 m) method to calculate vegetation resilience. Unlike traditional fixed-window approaches, MultiRes offers adaptive window sizes with a wide range of stability. We analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation resilience after restoration, evaluated the effectiveness of vegetation restoration, and quantitatively assessed the impact of key climatic drivers across different phases. Results reveal that: (1) After restoration, vegetation resilience at each dump experienced three phases: initial enhancement, decline, and renewed enhancement. (2) Vegetation resilience improved significantly compared to the initial fragile ecosystem, with over 88 % of the area showing improvement, especially at Taipingdi, where the enhancement rate reached 99.85 %. (3) The influence of key climatic drivers remained consistent within each dump across all phases, particularly in the first and third phases. Areas dominated by a single climatic driver generally showed more significant changes than those influenced by combined drivers. These findings demonstrate that vegetation resilience captures stage-specific ecological patterns that NDVI alone cannot detect, thereby supporting adaptive restoration and climate-informed management in mining environments."

 Deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) is a rock mass wasting process featuring a slow movement rate at the mountain scale. In Taiwan, DSGSD has often been reported in the slate belt of Taiwan’s backbone Range because of the inherent cleavage characteristic. When a slate slope undergoes the DSGSD process, it can accumulate large deformation displacements and transform into a rockslide. In this circumstance, the slope movement could change from the cleavage orientation-dominated to the downslope direction, such as in the famous case of the Lushan North Slope. A critical issue for Taiwan’s authority in dealing with hazards associated with DSGSD is the efficient identification of hidden active DSGSD within the wide mountainous area for further detailed investigation/monitoring. This study aims to detect DSGSDs and zonate the present-day slope activity at the regional scale. Based on the Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technique, we propose a hot-spot-like DSGSD mapping and zonation approach. The analysis was applied to Sentinel-1 radar data acquired in ascending and descending orbits between 2018 and 2020 centered on the Chingjing region, Taiwan. Combined with LiDAR terrain data and optical images, we recognized five DSGSD domains with higher deformation kinematics, which include a site that has yet to be investigated/monitored as DSGSD by relevant government agencies. In addition, we calculated the decomposed displacement vectors from two acquisition MT-InSAR data to establish each domain’s geometrical and kinematical model. Combined with borehole interpretation, inclinometer data, and simplified mechanical simulation, the models characterize the present-day moving phenomena and driving mechanisms for the observed DSGSDs. Overall, the MT-InSAR technique can aid the region-wide hazard assessment for the DSGSD in slate slopes regarding mapping and zonation. The results also highlight the potential of InSAR-assisted observation for understanding short-term movement kinematics and formulating a site-specific monitoring strategy."

 The study of drought and precipitation evolution due to global warming has garnered significant attention from the scientific community in recent years. The Loess Plateau (LP), a typical dryland agricultural area, has its agricultural development influenced by precipitation. However, given its location in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, the complex terrain, and the severe lack of rain gauges, the region faces challenges in accurate precipitation measurement. Multi-satellite precipitation products (MPPs), with their wide coverage and high resolution, can potentially address this deficiency, making it crucial to assess their applicability on the LP. This study evaluates the results of the inversion of LP precipitation changes by MPPs, the factors influencing the precipitation changes, and the dynamical mechanisms affecting LP precipitation evolution. The findings indicate that the CPC is the most suitable product for inverting daily precipitation on the LP, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.774 between CPC and observations, and the highest Probability of Detection of 0.667. This is attributed to the stable data sources and excellent algorithms used by CPC. Furthermore, the LP has exhibited a significant upward trend in precipitation since 2000, with the thermal term playing a significant role in the humidification of the LP. The analysis suggests that global warming increases atmospheric moisture content, and enhanced westerly jet and near-surface easterly anomalies transport warm, humid air from the North Atlantic and the eastern China Sea into the LP. Clarifying the precipitation trends and dynamics in the LP can provide valuable policy support for agricultural development."

 Optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are two of the most widely used remote sensing data sources, providing complementary but structurally consistent information. This complementarity has inspired significant research on their fusion. However, due to the huge difference in image representation between optical and SAR data, this difference will lead to inaccurate information expression when using the same structure to extract features, resulting in poor performance in classification tasks. Therefore, in the feature extraction stage, we analyze the respective advantageous features of optical and SAR images and propose a heterogeneous dual-branch network framework. Our framework exploits the rich local features of optical images and the global structural features of SAR images by using CNN and VMamba as their respective feature extractors. This heterogeneous feature extraction strategy effectively captures the complementary features of different modalities and provides a solid foundation for subsequent feature fusion. Second, in the feature fusion stage, we introduce a global-local dynamic gating fusion module. The use of multi-scale feature extraction and self-attention mechanism ensures comprehensive feature capture, while the dynamic gating mechanism enhances the integration of cross-modal complementary information. Finally, our method achieves excellent performance on medium and high-resolution datasets, showing robustness and adaptability at different resolutions. Notably, it significantly improves the overall classification accuracy while maintaining the accuracy of individual categories. For challenging categories such as roads, our method achieves significant improvements of about 15%."

Better performance and further applications are expected from emerging hollow-core fibers (HCFs) in which light propagates through a central void. Such propagation eliminates most of the light-glass interaction responsible for most of the transmission impairments in current optical fibers. However, impairments resulting from glass elongation that make the phase and the propagation time of guided light change with external temperature remain even in HCFs. Here, we demonstrate an HCF made from an ultralow expansion glass that exhibits a three orders of magnitude lower coefficient of thermal delay than traditional fibers. This performance, added to the other unique properties of HCFs, opens the door to ultrastable fiber–based applications."

Each ENT is coincident with its host-galaxy nucleus and exhibits a smooth (<10% excess variability), luminous (2 × 1045to 7 × 1045erg per second), and long-lived (>150 days) flare. ENTs are extremely rare (≥1 × 10–3cubic gigaparsec per year) compared to any other known class of transients. They are at least twice as energetic (0.5 × 1053to 2.5 × 1053erg) as any other known transient, ruling out supernova origins. Instead, the high peak luminosities, long flare timescales, and immense radiated energies of the ENTs are most consistent with the tidal disruption of high-mass (≳3M⊙) stars by massive (≳108M⊙) supermassive black holes (SMBHs). ENTs will be visible to high redshifts (z~ 4 to 6) in upcoming surveys, providing an avenue to study the high-mass end of the SMBH mass distribution, complementing recent studies of actively accreting SMBHs at high redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope."

Notably, lower expression of BCAA catabolism genes is strongly associated with worsened survival in ccRCC. Suppression of BCAA catabolism promotes expression of SNAIL1, a central mediator of aggressive phenotypes including migration and invasion.

We uncovered a long noncoding RNA Lrhcn1 that controls Hcn1 transcription and regulates ensemble activity of Htr2c neurons, and this regulation motivates social investigation.

While splenic FRCs are thought to support antiviral T cell responses, their role remains unclear. Here, we found that ablation of splenic FRCs impaired virus-specific CD8+T cell responses during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed that FRCs promote CD8+T cell clustering with type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) in the T cell zone before migration to the infected marginal zone. Without FRCs, T cells instead clustered with cDC1 and virus-infected cells in the marginal zone, leading to suboptimal priming. Mechanistically, FRCs coordinated early viral replication and the inflammatory milieu for optimal DC activation, and an intact FRC network was crucial for generating effector T cells and maintaining protective memory T cells. Thus, splenic FRCs provide essential lymphoid niches for antiviral T cell responses."

While membranes can decarbonize H2/CO2separation, their moderate H2/CO2selectivity requires secondary H2purification by pressure swing adsorption. Here, we report hyperselective carbon molecular sieve hollow fiber membranes showing H2/CO2selectivity exceeding 7000 under mixture permeation at 150°C, which is almost 30 times higher than the most selective nonmetallic membrane reported in the literature. The membrane is able to maintain an ultrahigh H2/CO2selectivity over 1400 under mixture permeation at 400°C. Pore structure characterization suggests that highly refined ultramicropores are responsible for effectively discriminating the closely sized H2and CO2molecules in the hyperselective carbon molecular sieve membrane.

Here, we evaluated whether low-dose radiation delivered by radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), known to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibitors, can synergize with CRISPR-edited GD2TRAC-CAR T cells to improve outcomes in neuroblastoma. We found that in the localized model of neuroblastoma, low-dose radiation delivered by177Lu-NM600, an alkylphosphocholine mimetic RPT agent, followed 9 days later by GD2TRAC-CAR T cells led to complete tumor regression. Irradiation of neuroblastoma before GD2TRAC-CAR T cells enhanced the release by CAR T cells of perforin, granzyme B, tumor necrosis factor–α, and interleukin-7 while abrogating transforming growth factor–β1. Low-dose RPT up-regulated the death receptor Fas on neuroblastoma, potentially enabling CAR-independent killing. This suggests that low-dose RPT can enhance suboptimal CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors.

Nevertheless, the fundamental, molecular-level mechanisms governing ion selectivity are still not fully understood. This study explores ion selectivity in polyamide desalination membranes, focusing on the partitioning and diffusion mechanisms of co-ions and counterions. Our experimental and molecular simulation results reveal that electrostatic interactions play a key role in impeding co-ion partitioning while enhancing their diffusion. The results further suggest that ion selectivity is predominantly controlled by the partitioning step, particularly the selective partitioning of co-ions. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on ion partitioning at the water-membrane interface to improve membrane ion-ion selectivity. In addition, our results point out to a trade-off between partitioning and diffusion, requiring careful tuning of these processes.

In this work, we investigate the mechanism of air fluorescence from excited neutralN2molecules by carrier-envelope phase–stabilized sub–4 femtosecond pulses. Our results show that fluorescence fromN2+ions reaches a maximum with cosine-like pulses, while fluorescence from excited neutralN2molecules peaks with sine-like pulses. In addition, by scanning the chirp of the driving pulse, we find that ionic fluorescence is maximized with chirp-free pulses, whereas neutral fluorescence favors negatively chirped pulses.

Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster relaxation in Au/CuS (690 femtoseconds) compared to CuS heterostructures (929 femtoseconds). Moreover, nonlinear absorption measurements provide evidence for harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer between the narrow Au and broad, tunable CuS plasmon resonances.

Herein, we expand the Bouligand-type structure family by synergistically considering structural design and compositional regulation and highlight a double-twisted Bouligand structure with gradient composition (DT-Bou-G) for enhancing impact resistance under a wide range of loading velocities. As one demonstration, the DT-Bou-G structural material was fabricated by multimaterial fused deposition with stiff polylactic acid and soft thermoplastic polyurethane as raw materials. Experimental investigations show its superior impact-resistant capability under multiple loading velocities (0.5 millimeters per minute, 2.1 meters per second, 4.3 meters per second, and 120 meters per second). Finite element simulations further prove the mechanical result and reveal the underlying mechanisms. The DT-Bou-G structure will inspire the design of engineering protective materials capable of withstanding complex working conditions."

Chen;Yuan Liu,Inhibition of virally induced TFEB proteasomal degradation as a host-centric therapeutic approach for coronaviral infection,"The endolysosomal pathway plays an evolutionarily conserved role in pathogen clearance, and viruses have evolved complex mechanisms to evade this host defense system. Here, we describe a previously unidentified aspect of coronaviral infection, whereby the master transcriptional activator of lysosomal homeostasis—TFEB—is targeted for proteasomal-mediated degradation upon viral infection. Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased small interfering RNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. We derive a series of novel small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit virus-induced TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad antiviral activities including attenuating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in two animal models. Together, these results delineate a virally triggered pathway that impairs lysosomal homeostasis in the host. Small molecule E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF7 inhibitors that restore lysosomal function represent a novel class of host-directed, antiviral therapies useful for current and potentially future coronaviral variants."

Despite their severe impacts, their atmospheric drivers and future trends remain unclear. Using a 160-year documentary record, historical reanalysis datasets, and statistical modeling, we examine the climatic and hydrological controls of ice-jam floods in the lower Yellow River, one of the world’s most flood-prone rivers. Our findings show that ice-jam floods are strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric teleconnections, including the Arctic Oscillation, Siberian High, and Ural Blocking, which regulate regional thermal contrasts and cold-air intrusions. Over the past century, ice-jam flood frequency has declined, with hot spots shifting toward the river estuary due to weakening upstream-to-downstream temperature gradients under climate warming. Projections using bias-corrected CMIP6 multimodel ensemble indicate a continued decline in ice-jam flood occurrences by 2100. Our study bridges historical and future perspectives, emphasizing the need for adaptive flood management as climate change shifts hydrological risks worldwide."

While stimulation of vagal efferent neurons is known to reduce maladaptive host responses during endotoxemia, only selective vagal afferent neuron stimulation inhibited TLR7-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment to the lung. These anti-inflammatory actions are dependent on adrenal gland–derived epinephrine, as adrenalectomy or inhibition of epinephrine production eliminated the protection afforded by VNS. Selective afferent VNS induced activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of neuronal activity in this brain region that controls peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity rendered VNS ineffective. Activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is critical for innate immune cell suppression, as the anti-inflammatory effects of VNS were eliminated in β2AR knockout mice and with pharmacological inhibition of the β2AR. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified neuroimmune circuit elicited by VNS that can control acute lung inflammation."

Numerous LRRK2-selective type I kinase inhibitors have been developed, and some have entered clinical trials. Here, to our knowledge, we present the first type II kinase inhibitors that target LRRK2. Targeting the inactive conformation of LRRK2 is functionally distinct from targeting the active-like conformation using type I inhibitors. We designed these inhibitors with a combinatorial chemistry approach fusing selective LRRK2 type I and promiscuous type II inhibitors using iterative cycles of synthesis supported by structural biology and activity testing. Our lead compounds are selective and potent toward both LRRK2 and LRRK1, a close relative of LRRK2. Through cellular assays, cryo–electron microscopy structural analysis, and in vitro motility assays, we show that our inhibitors stabilize the open, inactive LRRK2 kinase conformation. These new conformation-specific compounds will be invaluable as tools to study LRRK2’s function and regulation and expand the potential therapeutic options for PD."

Despite a growing understanding of molecular networks from genomic data, describing how changing phytoplankton physiology affects biogeochemical processes remains elusive. Here, we embed genome-scale models within a state-of-the-art ESM to deliver an integrated understanding of how gradients of nutrients modulate the molecular physiology of various plankton. In particular, when applied toProchlorococcus, we find that glycogen and lipid management can be interpreted in terms of acclimation to different environments. Generalized to other phytoplankton such as the diatomThalassiosira, we estimate the production of 39 metabolites that constitute hot spots of dissolved organic carbon described by their amount of carbon produced and their diversity of associated metabolites in ESMs. This modeling approach shows how genome scale–enabled ESMs have the potential to advance our understanding of microbial ecosystem functioning in ocean biogeochemical processes."

Observations reveal a sharp PL peak, indicative of single-photon emission, with doublet peaks from hybridized spin–state excitons. Notably, magnetic brightening of the PL peak was detected at a low magnetic field (<1 tesla), and the dynamics of hybridized-state excitons under magnetic fields indicated field-induced state mixing, explaining the magnetic brightening.

Adolescence is considered a critical period for maturation of excitation-inhibition ratio. This has primarily been observed in animal studies. However, there is limited human in vivo evidence for maturation of excitation-inhibition ratio at the individual level. Here, we developed an individualized in vivo marker of regional excitation-inhibition ratio in human adolescents, estimated using large-scale simulations of biophysical network models fitted to resting-state functional imaging data from both cross-sectional (n= 752) and longitudinal (n= 149) cohorts. In both datasets, we found a widespread decrease in excitation-inhibition ratio in association areas, paralleled by an increase or lack of change in sensorimotor areas. This developmental pattern was aligned with multiscale markers of sensorimotor-association differentiation. Although our main findings were robust across alternative modeling configurations, we observed local variations, highlighting the importance of methodological choices for future studies."

This cooling, known as the North Atlantic cold blob, has been hypothesized to arise from reduced poleward oceanic heat transport associated with a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Here, by diagnosing historical simulations from multiple coupled climate models, we find that ocean heat transport is not the only pathway through which the AMOC modulates sea surface temperature variability. A weakened AMOC is also associated with colder, drier lower atmospheric conditions, which lead to a reduction in surface warming expected from increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases by reducing downward clear-sky longwave radiation at the surface. This radiative pathway and the oceanic processes contribute equally to the North Atlantic cold blob. These results highlight the importance of the AMOC’s impact on atmospheric properties and their radiative effects."
