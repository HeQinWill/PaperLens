Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036–2065) and far future (2066–2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet."

Samset;Camilla W. Stjern;Manoj Joshi;Laura J. Wilcox;Robert J. Allen;Wei Hua;Shuanglin Li,Physical processes influencing the Asian climate due to black carbon emission over East Asia and South Asia,"Black carbon (BC) aerosol is emitted from the incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. We found that Asian BC leads to strong local cooling and drying. Reductions in precipitation primarily depend on the thermodynamic effects due to solar radiation absorption by BC. The combined thermodynamic and dynamic effects shape the spatial pattern of precipitation responses to Asian BC. These results help us further understand the impact of emissions of anthropogenic aerosols on Asian climate. 
 Many studies have shown that black carbon (BC) aerosols over Asia have significant impacts on regional climate but with large diversities in the intensity, spatial distribution, and physical mechanism of regional responses. In this study, we utilized a set of systematic regional aerosol perturbations (SyRAPs) using a reduced-complexity climate model, FORTE2 (Fast Ocean Rapid Troposphere Experiment version 2), to investigate responses of the Asian climate to BC aerosols over East Asia only, South Asia only, and both regions at once and to thoroughly examine related physical processes. Results show that regional BC aerosols lead to strong surface cooling, air temperature warming in the low-level troposphere, and drying over the perturbed areas, with seasonal differences in magnitude and spatial distribution. Atmospheric energy budget analysis suggests that reductions in local precipitation primarily depend on the substantial local atmospheric heating due to shortwave absorption by BC. Increases in dry-static-energy (DSE) flux divergence partly offset the reduced precipitation over North China in summer and most of China and India in the other three seasons. Decreases in DSE flux divergence lead to a stronger reduction in precipitation over South China and central India in summer. Changes in DSE flux divergence are mainly due to vertical motions driven by diabatic heating in the middle and lower troposphere. BC perturbations also exert non-local climate impacts through the changes in DSE flux divergence. This study provides a full chain of physical processes of the local climate responses to the Asian BC increases and gives some insights to better understand the uncertainties in model responses."

Since the above instruments are widely deployed in China, we believe this method has broad application prospects for the improvement of the boundary layer parameterization scheme in numerical forecast models. 
 The accurate wind field observation of the tropical cyclone (TC) boundary layer is of great significance in improving the TC track and intensity forecasting. To investigate the vertical structure of TC boundary layer during the landfall process of Super Typhoon Doksuri, three kinds of instruments, including the coherent Doppler lidar (CDL), radar wind profiler (RWP) and automatic weather station (AWS), are deployed at two sites in Xiamen, Fujian province. The data fusion method is developed to obtain the complete wind speed profiles covering the whole atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) based on the above instruments. The wind speeds in the near-field blind zones of CDL observation are interpolated by combining the AWS measurements at 10 m. The CDL provides high-temporal- and high-spatial-resolution wind speed profiles from tens of meters to its highest detection height. The wind speeds above the highest detection height of the CDL are supplemented with the RWP measurements. The hourly mean wind speed profiles are compared with traditional models. Generally, the wind speed profiles fit well with the power law in the lower part of the ABL before wind speed changes rapidly. However, it would cause a large error (up to 73 %) to describe the exact wind speed profiles with the power law during and after the typhoon's passage, especially when the wind speed is almost constant with height or when wind shear exists. Then, fine structures and evolutionary processes of the wind field in the ABL during the typhoon landfall are investigated. In addition, the wind field distribution and wind speed variation with distance from the typhoon center are statistically analyzed. The joint wind field measurements of CDL, RWP and AWS have the broad application prospects on the dynamics study of the TC boundary layer and the improvement of the boundary layer parameterization scheme in numerical forecast models."

Here, we present a novel method to derive IWC and SR from W-band cloud radar observations, considering the degree of riming. We also investigate the use of the liquid water path (LWP) as a proxy for the occurrence of riming. LWP is easier to measure, so that the method can be applied to both ground-based and space-based instruments. 
 Accurate measurements of snowfall in mid-latitudes and high latitudes are particularly important because snow provides a vital freshwater source and impacts glacier mass balances as well as surface albedo. However, ice water content (IWC) and snowfall rates (SRs) are hard to measure due to their high spatial variability and the remoteness of polar regions. In this study, we present novel ice water content–equivalent radar reflectivity (IWC–Ze) and snowfall rate–equivalent radar reflectivity (SR–Ze) relations for 40° slanted and vertically pointing W-band radar. The relations are derived from joint in situ snowfall and remote sensing (W-band radar and radiometer) data from the SAIL site (Colorado, USA) and validated for sites in Hyytiälä (Finland), Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard), and Eriswil (Switzerland). In addition, gauge measurements from SAIL and Hyytiälä are used as an independent reference for validation. We show the dependence of IWC–Ze and SR–Ze on riming, which we utilize to reduce the spread in the IWC–Ze and SR–Ze spaces. Normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs) are below 25 % for IWC>0.1 g m−3. For SR, the NRMSE is below 70 % over the whole SR range. We also present relations using liquid water path as a proxy for the occurrence of riming, which can be applied to both ground-based and space-borne radar–radiometer instruments. The latter is demonstrated using the example of the proposed ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate mission WIVERN. With this approach, NRMSEs are below 75 % for IWC>0.1 g m−3 and below 80 % for SR>0.2 mm h−1."

Burrows;Hartmut Bösch,A study of measurement scenarios for the future CO2M mission: avoidance of detector saturation and the impact on XCO2 retrievals,"Optical detectors have a maximum signal (saturation). Exceedance means that the measurement has to be discarded. We investigate where saturation will occur for the future European satellite mission dedicated to CO2 monitoring (CO2M) and strategies to avoid saturation. Saturation impacts coverage and precision, both of which are important for estimation of local CO2 emissions. We find that taking two pictures per sampling should be sufficient to avoid saturation for CO2M, with some impact on CO2 precision. 
 The direct and indirect release of carbon dioxide (CO2) by human activities into the atmosphere has been the main driver of anthropogenic climate change since the industrial revolution. The Paris Agreement from 2015 requires regular country-based reports of greenhouse gas emissions. Inverse modeling of observed concentrations of greenhouse gases is one important approach to verify  reported emissions. The future constellation of Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) satellites is dedicated to greenhouse gas measurements with high spectral and spatial resolution and wide coverage. The requirements for the performance of the instruments and retrieval algorithms for the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) are stringent in order to identify, assess and monitor CO2 emissions from space. In this study, we analyze the impact of avoiding detector saturation on the precision and spatial coverage of XCO2. We use the Fast atmOspheric traCe gAs retrievaL (FOCAL) algorithm, which has been selected to be one of the operational greenhouse gas retrieval algorithms to be implemented within the CO2M ground segment. In order to avoid saturation, the number of read-outs per sampling time can be increased and the signals can be co-added on board, which we refer to as “temporal oversampling” in this study. We use a subsampled 1-year dataset of simulated radiances to define the temporal oversampling factors (OSFs) that are sufficient to avoid detector saturation and then apply the defined OSF combinations globally. We find that OSFs larger than 1 will lead to a significant decrease in the number of saturated observations, with some impact on the median XCO2 precision, concluding that OSFs larger than 1 should be considered for the satellite mission. These results are based on simulated radiances. Consequently, the real impact on  precision should be analyzed in more detail during the commissioning phase of the satellite."

Our study introduces updated datasets tracking changes in natural gas supply, usage, and transmission within the EU27&amp;UK. We discovered that Europe adapted to losing Russian gas by increasing LNG (liquefied natural gas) imports and shifting to renewables. Our insights could shape future energy policies and climate research. 
 The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia triggered a significant energy crisis in the EU27 (27 EU member countries) and UK (hereafter EU27&UK), leading to profound changes in their natural gas supply, transmission, and consumption dynamics. To analyze those pattern shifts, we first update our natural gas supply dataset, EUGasSC, with daily country- and sector-specific supply sources. We then provide a newly constructed daily intra-EU (European Union) natural gas transmission dataset, EUGasNet, with specified supply sources utilizing the ENTSOG (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas) and EUGasSC data. To further understand the economic and climatic impacts, we finally developed EUGasImpact, a daily dataset with sector-specific driving factors of consumption changes based on change attribution models using multiple open datasets. Those datasets are available on the Zenodo platform: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11175364 (Zhou et al., 2024). On the supply side, Russian gas supply to the EU27&UK was cut by 87.8 % (976.8 TW h per winter) during the post-invasion winters compared to the previous winters. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports became the largest gas supply source, rising from 20.7 % to 37.5 % of the total gas supply. Our intra-EU gas transmission analysis showed that the gas transmission network was adjusted to mitigate the large gas shortfalls in Germany and distribute LNG arrivals. Total gas consumption fell by 19.0 %, which was driven by (1) consumer behavioral changes in household heating (contributed to 29 % of the total reduction; the following numbers are also percentage contributions to the total reduction); (2) drops in industrial production (25 %); (3) heating drops due to the warmer winter temperatures (11 %); (4) shifts towards renewable electricity including wind, solar, and hydro (10 %); (5) a decline in gas-powered electricity generation (9 %); (6) adoption of energy-efficient heat pumps for industrial gas heating (4 %); (7) shifts towards non-renewable electricity including coal, oil, and nuclear (1 %); and (8) other unmodeled factors (11 %). We evaluated the benefits and costs associated with these pattern changes and discussed whether these changes would potentially lead to long-term structural changes in the EU energy dynamics. Our datasets and these insights can provide valuable perspectives for understanding the consequences of this energy crisis and the challenges to future energy security in the EU."

We present a workflow to simulate geologically reasonable 3D seismic volumes with diverse paleochannels, generating a large-scale labeled dataset. Field applications demonstrate its effectiveness. The dataset and codes are publicly available to support future research. 
 Identifying paleochannels in 3D seismic volumes (seismic paleochannel interpretation) is essential for georesource development and offering insights into paleoclimate conditions.  However,  it remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task.  Deep learning has shown great promise in automating seismic paleochannel interpretation with high efficiency and accuracy,  as demonstrated in similar image segmentation tasks in computer vision (CV). Yet,  unlike the CV domain,  seismic exploration lacks a comprehensive labeled dataset for paleochannels,  significantly hindering the development,  application,  and evaluation of deep learning methods in this field.  Manual labeling of paleochannels in 3D seismic volumes is tedious and subjective,  potentially leading to mislabeling that degrades deep learning model's performance.  To address this,  we propose a workflow to generate a synthetic seismic dataset,  cigChannel,  consisting of 1600 seismic volumes with over 10 000 labeled paleochannels.  Each volume has a size of 256×256×256 samples. This is the largest dataset to date for seismic paleochannel interpretation,  featuring geologically reasonable seismic volumes with accurately labeled meandering channels,  tributary channel networks,  and submarine canyons.  A convolutional neural network (simplified from U-Net) trained on this dataset achieves F1 scores of 0.52, 0.73, and 0.63 in identifying meandering channels,  tributary channel networks,  and submarine canyons in three field seismic volumes,  respectively.  However,  the synthetic seismic volumes in the cigChannel dataset still lack the variability and realism of field seismic data,  potentially affecting the deep learning model's generalizability.  To facilitate further research,  we publicly release the dataset (Wang et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10791151),  data generation codes, and trained U-Net model (Wang, 2024, https://github.com/wanggy-1/cigChannel, last access: 5 July 2025),  aiming to advance deep learning approaches for seismic paleochannel interpretation."

We also discuss gaps and propose improved metadata schemes for expanding the living MADLIB collection. 
 Marine debris is a ubiquitous and growing threat to environmental and human health. Efforts to monitor and mitigate marine debris pollution face many challenges. A primary limitation is the absence of standardized methodologies for monitoring capabilities due to the complex and diverse physical and chemical properties of marine debris. Variabilities include object size, apparent color, polymer type, weathering, and aqueous state. Despite the challenges in object characteristics, advances in remote sensing methods are showing promise for detecting marine debris across local to global scales. Algorithms are needed to link remotely sensed observations with relevant characteristics of marine debris to fully realize this potential. Although more optical measurements of marine debris reflectance are becoming available for algorithm development, inconsistencies in data curation remains an obstacle. Variations in data processing and inconsistent metadata hinder efforts to develop robust, generalizable algorithms for marine debris detection. To address this, we present the well-curated MArine Debris hyperspectral reference Library collection (MADLib) containing 24889 spectra from 3032 samples. All optical measurements are available in open access via https://doi.org/10.4121/059551d3-2383-4e20-af2d-011c9a59d3ac (Ohall et al., 2025). MADLib demonstrates the importance of open-science and open-access datasets, as it compiles and harmonizes spectral data collected from publicly accessible datasets and individual research projects. Consistent methods were applied for data standardization, quality assurance, and integration. We also propose a robust protocol for generating metadata tailored to marine debris and ocean color remote sensing applications. MADLib possesses spectra of a wide range of marine debris materials including different polymer types, color, size, weathering, and aqueous states. Here, we analyze the metadata associated with the spectra to identify sampling gaps and propose considerations for future work. By providing open-access and standardized data, MADLib is expected to support the development of robust marine debris detection algorithms."

 Understanding the impact of climate change on thermohaline dynamics in the western Mediterranean Sea is essential for assessing shifts in regional circulation and water mass formation. This study analyzes data from twelve summer oceanographic surveys conducted between 2009 and 2022 along the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian continental shelf. Results reveal a decadal-scale warming and salinification of both surface and intermediate layers, leading to enhanced water column stratification. On the northern Sicilian shelf, AtlanticWater exhibited a salinity increase of +0.02 yr−1 and a potential temperature rise of +0.40 °C yr−1 between 2011 and 2022, driven by sustained surface warming and advection of Ionian Surface Water from the eastern Mediterranean. This warmer and saltier water mass also affected intermediate depths, modifying vertical density gradients. The influence of Ionian Surface Water peaked around 2016, coinciding with the progressive warming of Tyrrhenian Intermediate Water due to the absence of strong winter cooling after 2014. These hydrographic changes are linked to the Adriatic–Ionian Bimodal Oscillating System and the transition of the Northern Ionian Gyre from a cyclonic to an anticyclonic state, which modulates the inflow of intermediate waters through the Sicily and Messina Straits. On the Ligurian shelf, Western Intermediate Water showed moderate warming (+0.06 °C yr−1) until 2017, followed by cooling, and a salinity increase until 2019. These findings underscore the importance of inter-basin connectivity and the need for integrated monitoring and modeling to understand and anticipate climate-driven variability in the Mediterranean Sea."

The new Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission model calculates the emission spectrum and its variability with an unprecedented accuracy. Relying on a large spectroscopic data set from astronomical spectrographs and theoretical molecular/atomic data, this model is valuable for airglow research and astronomical observatories. 
 Below about 2.3 µm, the nighttime emission of the Earth's atmosphere is dominated by non-thermal radiation. Excluding aurorae, the emission is caused by chemical reaction chains that are driven by the daytime photolysis and photoionisation of constituents of the middle and upper atmosphere by hard ultraviolet photons from the Sun. As this airglow can outshine even scattered moonlight in the near-infrared regime, the understanding of the Earth's night-sky brightness requires good knowledge of the complex airglow emission spectrum and its variability. However, airglow modelling is very challenging, as it would require atomic and molecular parameters, rate coefficients for chemical reactions, and knowledge of the complex dynamics at the emission heights with a level of detail that is difficult to achieve. In part, even the chemical reaction pathways remain unclear. Hence, the comprehensive characterisation of airglow emission requires large data sets of empirical data. For fixed locations, this can be best achieved by archived spectra of large astronomical telescopes with wide wavelength coverage, high spectral resolving power, and good temporal sampling. Using 10 years of data from the X-shooter echelle spectrograph in the wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 µm and additional data from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile, we have succeeded in building a comprehensive spectroscopic airglow model for this low-latitude site with consideration of theoretical data from the HITRAN database for molecules and from different sources for atoms. The Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission (PALACE) model comprises nine chemical species, 26 541 emission lines, and three unresolved continuum components. Moreover, there are climatologies of relative intensity, solar cycle effect, and residual variability with respect to local time and day of year for 23 variability classes. Spectra can be calculated with a stand-alone code for different conditions, including optional atmospheric absorption and scattering. In comparison to the observed X-shooter spectra, PALACE shows convincing agreement and is significantly better than the previous, widely used airglow model for Cerro Paranal."

Richardson,"Formation of Eight Classes of DBPs from Chlorine, Chloramine, and Ozone: Mechanisms and Formation Pathways","Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are formed during drinking water treatment from the reaction of chemical disinfectants with natural organic matter (NOM), anthropogenic contaminants, and inorganic bromide and iodide. DBPs are of public concern due to their carcinogenic and genotoxic effects and adverse effects observed in many epidemiologic studies. Formation mechanisms have been studied in order to identify precursors, reaction intermediates, and reaction kinetics and to predict new classes of DBPs. By understanding formation mechanisms, steps can be taken to remove DBP precursors and adjust treatment conditions to minimize DBP formation. This paper presents a critical review of formation mechanisms for eight classes of DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloketones (HKs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), haloacetamides (HAMs), halonitromethanes (HNMs), and nitrosamines (NAs) from the popular disinfectants chlorine, chloramine, and ozone. Important precursors in the formation of many of these DBPs include phenolic, β-dicarbonyl, and oxopentadioic acid groups found in humic NOM species. Likewise, amino acids are also precursors for several classes of DBPs. HANs can form by chloramination of aldehydes, and HAMs can form from the hydrolysis of HANs. HNMs can form by the oxidation/halogenation of amines as well as by nitration and halogenation of humic substances in the presence of nitrite. Preozonation followed by chlorine or chloramine can significantly increase HNM formation.

Strengthening the Cl desorption and promoting rapid deep oxidation of reaction intermediates, thereby cutting off the interaction between Cl and reaction intermediates, is an effective strategy to prevent the formation of polychlorinated byproducts. Herein, a CuSO4/TiO2 catalyst with dual-reaction channels was developed for 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) oxidation, featuring S═O–H sites for Cl desorption and Cu–O–S sites for intermediate oxidation. It achieved 90% conversion at 251 °C, with reaction rates 8.3 and 11.0 times higher than those of SO42–/TiO2 and CuO/TiO2, respectively. The hybridization of Cu 3d–O 2p enhanced electron transfer of O → Cu, accelerating 1,2-DCE oxidation via the C═C–OH → – COO/C═O → CO pathway. Meanwhile, the Cl species generated after C–Cl dissociation combined with S═O–H and desorbed in the form of HCl, avoiding Cl binding to intermediates and thus inhibiting the generation of CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, CH2ClCHCl2, and CCl2CCl2. Notably, the S═O–H species as a dynamic H transfer site could capture the H of the activated intermediates after being consumed by the Cl species during the reaction, restoring the S═O–H structure and achieving stable desorption of Cl species. This study highlights the previously overlooked matching of chlorine desorption with the intermediate oxidation process, offering a highly efficient solution for CVOC purification."

Whereas the equatorward auroral undulation (EAU) has been frequently observed and well known, the poleward auroral undulation (PAU) has never been observed yet. Both EAU and PAU were found in the N2 LBHL (165–180 nm, mostly due to electron precipitation) and Lyman α 121.6 nm (due to proton precipitation) images acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft. The spatial amplitude and wavelength of the PAU reached ∼900 km. During the PAU crossing, DMSP observed both precipitating electrons and ions (protons) and a plasma drift up to ∼5,000 m/s with a strong shear. Simultaneous ground‐based all‐sky imaging at South Pole captured the dynamic behavior of the PAU that propagated in an anti‐sunward direction at a phase speed of ∼250 m/s. The solar wind conditions during the PAU were a high solar wind speed (∼700 km/s), an intense southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF, approximately −40 nT), and a high density (37 cm−3).

These banded structures were previously attributed to bounce resonance between particles and standing Alfvén waves generated by moon‐magnetospheric interactions. Here, we show that this explanation is inconsistent with key observational features, and propose an alternative interpretation: the bands are remote signatures of particle absorption at the moons. In this scenario, whether a particle encounters the moon before reaching Juno depends on the number of bounce cycles it undergoes within a fixed drift segment determined by the moon‐spacecraft separation. Therefore, the absorption bands are expected to appear at discrete, equally‐spaced velocities. This is largely consistent with the observations, though discrepancies remain, possibly due to spacecraft charging and/or finite data resolution. This finding improves our understanding of moon‐plasma interactions and may help constrain Jovian magnetospheric models."

Here, the authors identify neural crest-specific and somite-specific splicing complexes that confer distinct susceptibility to splicing perturbation. 
 How the ubiquitously expressed splicing factors specifically regulate neural crest (NC) development and enhance their vulnerability to splicing perturbations remain poorly understood. Here, we show that NC-specific DLC1, partnering with SF3B1-PHF5A splicing complex, are crucial for determining avian trunk NC cell fate by regulating the splicing of NC specifiers SOX9 and SNAI2 pre-mRNAs rather than their upstream regulators BMP4, WNT1, and PAX7. Mechanistically, SF3B1-PHF5A binds to the intronic branch site (BS) sequences of all factors, while DLC1 interacts with a specific motif near the BS sequences of SOX9 and SNAI2, thereby determining their functional specificity in NC specification. Moreover, DLC1 increases NC cells’ vulnerability to splicing modulator pladienolide B (PB) by reducing the binding capacity of the SF3B1-PHF5A splicing complex to the shorter length of both SOX9 intron 2 and SNAI2 intron 1, which possess weaker polypyrimidine tract 3’ of the BS sequence, resulting in intron retention and loss of NC progenitors. Conversely, somite specific SLU7-SF3B1-PHF5A splicing complex regulates SOX9 and SNAI2 expression and imparts resistance to PB. Our data reveal the cell-type specific splicing complexes with distinct vulnerabilities to PB, highlighting the critical role of the DLC1-SF3B1-PHF5A in determining trunk NC cell fate and enhancing its susceptibility to splicing perturbation.

 The impact of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies on the global climate system has received considerable attention in recent decades. Observations and model simulations indicate that winter Arctic SIC anomalies in the Greenland-Barents Seas significantly influence on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, whether this influence is symmetric remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the influence of SIC anomalies on the subsequent ENSO is asymmetric. An increase in SIC significantly affects the development of El Niño, whereas a decrease in SIC has only a weak influence on La Niña. Specifically, a winter SIC increase in the Greenland-Barents Seas induces deep Arctic cooling, which triggers an atmospheric wave train propagating to the subtropical North Pacific. The associated subtropical cyclonic anomaly leads to North Pacific Meridional Mode-like sea surface temperature (SST) warming in spring, which extends to the tropical Pacific via the wind-evaporation-SST feedback in the following summer and subsequently enhances El Niño development by tropical air-sea interaction processes. In contrast, a winter SIC decrease is accompanied by shallow Arctic warming, which is insufficient to generate an atmospheric wave train to modify the subtropical North Pacific oceanic and atmospheric states, and thus has a weak influence on the La Niña development. Further analysis suggests that the asymmetric impacts of Arctic sea ice anomalies on subtropical North Pacific air-sea conditions and ENSO events may also be partly due to differences in the atmospheric mean state between high and low SIC years. This study highlights the asymmetric impact of Arctic SIC anomalies on ENSO and tropical climate, emphasizing the need to consider these asymmetries when assessing global climate responses to Arctic sea ice variability."

 Understanding the processes controlling the fate of carbon dioxide in deep saline aquifers is critical for safe large-scale carbon storage. We describe an experimental model for the dissolution of capillary-trapped carbon dioxide. Our experiment involves a two-layer porous medium: the upper layer contains glass beads, saturated salt solution and salt powder, which is an analogue of the capillary-trapped carbon dioxide, while the lower layer contains glass beads and unsaturated solution. Convective fingers develop as fluid is exchanged between the layers. The rising fingers are arrested once they dissolve sufficient salt to become saturated, while the descending fingers gradually increase the salinity of the lower layer fluid. We develop a model of the finger motion and the non-linear dissolution process, which agrees with the experiments.

 The Paris Agreement legally commits the international community to keep anthropogenic global warming well below 2.0 °C, while efforts shall be made to hold the 1.5 °C-line. Under climate business as usual, however, the transgression of those lines will happen in the next few decades, causing major adaptation challenges. Fully-fledged Earth System Models are usually employed for concrete overshoot-timing projections, yet they are not only computationally expensive, but their internal variability is model dependent, which may significantly distort (and invalidate) their projections. Here we present, as an alternative, a purely data-driven approach based on the persistence properties of the observed global temperatures. We quantify, in a probabilistic way, the natural variability that must be superimposed on the anthropogenic trends in order to retrieve the observed warming behavior. When assuming that the anthropogenic warming continues at the current rate, we actually arrive at comparable overshoot timing estimates as the Earth System Models and provide an explanation for this finding. Since the two approaches are independent, they support each other strongly and highlight the need for an effective overshoot management. The timing of overshooting Paris climate targets under current warming rates aligns with projections from Earth System Models, according to data-driven approach that quantifies natural variability using the persistence properties of observed global temperatures."

 Long-term river discharge time series are essential for assessing water availability, seasonal variability, and the impacts of climate change. However, in-situ data do not ensure continuity and large-scale availability, as they are constrained by the limitations of monitoring networks, which are affected by high maintenance costs, geopolitical factors, and the remoteness of many river basins. Satellite remote sensing offers a valuable alternative, with multispectral data providing information on river discharge dynamics. Nevertheless, also satellite data suffer discontinuity, being periodically decommissioned and substituted by sensors with different characteristics.This study applies and refines the Calibration-Measurement (CM) approach across 54 river sites worldwide, using 10 different multispectral satellite products from 8 satellite sensors to examine long time series of data. The methodology optimizes the selection of reflectance indices based on local hydrological conditions, evaluating the best procedure to obtain river discharge proxies according to the specific flow regimes and climatic condition. Multi-mission data are then combined to improve temporal coverage and accuracy, obtaining long-term timeseries of river discharge proxies. A new uncalibrated procedure is also introduced to extract river discharge information in sites with decommissioned stations or to obtain the CM proxies in ungauged basins.Results demonstrate that integrating multiple satellite sources substantially improves river discharge estimation, due to factor such as the superior performance of high-resolution sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) over coarse-resolution datasets (e.g. MODIS) in narrow rivers, and the complementary value of MODIS finer temporal resolution. The proposed merging approach enhances data consistency and reduces gaps while maintaining good performance values, while the uncalibrated method proves effective in many cases but remains challenging for frozen rivers, cloud-prone regions and areas with a low ratio between river width and satellite sensor spatial resolution. Specifically, after the application of a Cumulative Distribution Function Merging (CDF) matching to obtain river discharge estimates from CM proxies, the average and maximum value of Spearman's correlation for the calibrated approaches are respectively 0.78 and 0.92 whereas for uncalibrated approach are 0.55 and 0.89; in terms of Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) the average and maximum value are 0.41 and 0.85 for calibrated approach and 0.29 and 0.8 for the uncalibrated one.These findings highlight the potential of multi-sensor approaches for global river discharge monitoring and lay the groundwork for future operational applications."

 The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential parameter for assessing vegetation growth. LAI derived from optical data can suffer from gaps caused by cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) presents a solution with its all-weather observation capability. To address these issues, this study proposes a new deep learning approach for reconstructing time series LAI using SAR and optical data in two steps. Firstly, the two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (2D CNN-Transformer) is applied to bridge SAR and optical data. Secondly, the 2D CNN-Transformer predicted LAI and the Sentinel-2 LAI are input into the Enhanced Deep Convolutional Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion (EDCSTFN) model to further improve the accuracy. The novelty lies in a two-step framework combining a 2D CNN-Transformer for spatiotemporal feature extraction and a deep learning fusion algorithm refining accurate LAI reconstruction. Results showed that the 2D CNN-Transformer achieved a higher accuracy (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.38 m2/m2) in establishing a relationship between SAR and optical data, compared to 1D CNN, 2D CNN-LSTM, and 1D CNN-Transformer. In the second step, the EDCSTFN reconstructed LAI achieved the highest accuracy of an R2 of 0.81 and an RMSE of 0.22 m2/m2, with an average R2 of 0.61 and RMSE of 0.37 m2/m2 across croplands and forests in millions of pixels, further improving the accuracy based on the first step. The approach effectively fills gaps in spatial details and achieves a more continuous spatial distribution. The proposed approach demonstrates good generalizability in millions of pixels under frequent cloud cover and complex surface conditions and provides a new strategy for the fusion of optical and SAR data."

 Fresno, California, has some of the worst air quality in the United States, with PM2.5 exposure contributing to increased asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits. This study assesses the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and asthma ED visits in Fresno from 2005 to 2015, with a focus on vulnerable populations, including children, racial minorities, and those living in commercial areas. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to analyze the impact of PM2.5 on asthma ED visits. Data on ED visits were sourced from California's Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), and air pollution data from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS). Statistical models were adjusted for meteorological variables and additional pollutants (NO2, CO, and SO2). The study identified 7778 asthma-related ED visits. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with an increase in ED visits (Lag 0–14, OR = 1.135) during the cold season (November–February) when concentrations of PM2.5 were the highest. Stratified analyses showed elevated risks for individuals in commercial areas, females, and Hispanic and Black populations. Children aged 2–5 years were particularly vulnerable, while older adults showed lower sensitivity. The dose responses analysis found that PM2.5 exposure of 9 μg/m3 or higher for a 14 day period significantly increased the risk of asthma-related ED visits during the cold season. PM2.5 exposure during the cold season significantly increases asthma ED visits, particularly among vulnerable populations that live in commercial areas. These findings highlight the need for targeted public health measures to mitigate the effects of PM2.5 in high-risk communities."

 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), a key secondary pollutant, plays a vital role in atmospheric chemistry and photochemical smog formation. In this study, PAN concentrations were measured at an urban site during the peak photochemical pollution period in June 2022. The study examined PAN's production, loss processes, regional transport, and sensitivity to precursors within the context of photochemical pollution events. Two distinct photochemical pollution episodes were identified, with average PAN concentrations of 1.4 ± 0.7 ppbv and 0.9 ± 0.5 ppbv in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively, both exceeding those on clean days (0.8 ± 0.4 ppbv). The diurnal variation of PAN exhibited a typical unimodal pattern, indicating enhanced photochemical activity during pollution episodes. Conditional probability analysis revealed that peak concentrations of ozone (O3) and PAN predominantly originated from the north-to-east sector, whereas nitrous acid maxima occurred near the observation site under low wind speeds. PAN thermal decomposition was more pronounced on clean days, resulting in a shorter atmospheric lifetime compared to pollution events. Observation-based model simulations further demonstrated that PAN production and loss rates were significantly higher during pollution episodes than on clean days. Temperature emerged as a key factor driving PAN's diurnal pattern. Additionally, relative incremental reactivity analysis indicated that PAN formation was highly sensitive to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly alkenes. This study provides valuable insights into PAN behavior under severe photochemical pollution conditions, contributing to a better understanding of urban air quality and photochemical smog formation mechanisms."

 BackgroundThere are limited studies of children's long-term health impacts from landscape fire smoke emissions, despite the increasing threat of these events. This study investigates long-term hospital utilisation following the Hazelwood mine fire (Feb–March 2014), in a cohort of children exposed during infancy.MethodsBirth records of all children born in the Latrobe Valley, Australia, and aged under two during the fire (n = 1788), were linked to emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a five-year period immediately following the event. Associations between modelled terciles of fire-specific particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and presentations/admissions, for all causes as well as for specific diagnostic groupings (respiratory, infectious, allergic), were assessed using a recurrent events survival analysis approach.ResultsChildren with medium (HR 1.16, 95 %CI 1.06–1.28) or high exposure (HR 1.11, 95 %CI 1.01–1.21) had higher rates of overall presentations to the ED than those with low exposure. Children with medium exposure still had marginally higher rates of presentation to the ED, after exclusion of diagnoses unlikely to have a clinical connection to smoke (HR 1.13, 95 %CI 1.00–1.27).ConclusionsWe observed an increase during a five-year period in overall ED presentations in children with higher exposure to smoke during infancy, although these results were attenuated after adjusting for the distance between the residential area and the hospital. Conversely, increases found in presentations for respiratory and infectious conditions in the year following the fire, were no longer apparent when investigated over a five-year period."

 This study reports the accuracy and uncertainty of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals for the dark target (DT) algorithm over Africa. Three AOD products from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) VIIRS were evaluated against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations during the period from 2018 to 2023. The validation results indicate that all three products show good validation accuracy in northern Africa, with a slight underestimation in southern Africa. However, it is worth noting that a severe systematic underestimation was observed for all three products in western Africa. Although the correlation coefficients (R) between these three products and the AERONET observations in western Africa are all greater than 0.9, they exhibit significant negative mean biases (MB) of less than −0.18 and root mean square errors (RMSE) exceeding 0.25. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of error dependence was conducted to explore the underlying causes of this underestimation in this region. The analysis reveals that the aerosol model assumptions and surface reflectance estimation in the DT algorithm jointly lead to this underestimation. Specifically, the underestimation is more pronounced under conditions of strongly absorbing aerosols and sparse vegetation surfaces with high reflectance. Additionally, it was found that as the scattering angle (SCA) increases, the degree of AOD underestimation also intensifies. These results provide critical insights to guide the ongoing refinement of the DT algorithm in western Africa."

 This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3D) adaptive lightning progressing stochastic model (ALPSM) that incorporates the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to enable a compatible simulation of large-domain intracloud discharges and near-ground lightning leader attachment processes. A new self-consistent charge neutrality maintenance algorithm is proposed, which considers the internal electric field of the lightning channel and ensures synchronized adjustments of the channel potential with the ambient potential. The model successfully reproduces the reported leader connection scenarios during the negative cloud-to-ground (−CG) lightning attachment process and analyzes the spatiotemporal evolutionary process of leader propagation and channel potential variation. The simulation results reveal a series of interesting phenomena in leader propagation before grounding: initial bidirectional vertical propagation during channel potential rapidly adjusting from the initial value to the average of the positive and negative charge regions; horizontal multibranch propagation within charge regions where the most concentrated height of horizontal propagation corresponds to the vertical electric field zero-crossing points; and downward negative leader vertical propagation during the rapidly increasing channel potential period. The ALPSM model advances the lightning stochastic model simulation owing to the charge neutrality constraint and adaptive mesh refinement in large three-dimensional domains, which provides a further method for the lightning attachment process simulation."
