10.1088/1748-9326/ae0504,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注北极地区极端降水事件的时空变化，以及海冰减少和大气河流增强对其的影响。虽然研究使用了像MERRA-2这样的再分析数据，这些数据可能部分来源于卫星观测，但其核心内容并非直接关于大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。论文侧重于气候变化背景下北极降水的气候学分析，而非遥感技术的应用或开发。,"['Precipitation', 'Sea Ice', 'Atmospheric Rivers', 'Reanalysis Data']",Shang Geng;Yetang Wang;Qingli Wu;Zhaosheng Zhai;Weiming Ma;Shugui Hou;Wansong Zong,Arctic extreme precipitation changes from 1980 to 2022 in response to sea ice decline and enhanced atmospheric rivers,"Arctic extreme precipitation (EP) broadly impacts permafrost degradation, glacier and snow cover changes, and ice sheet mass balance as well as ecosystems. However, investigation of EP spatiotemporal variations over the Arctic remains challenging, and their primary drivers are still poorly understood. Performance estimation of three state-of-the-art reanalysis products (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA-5), and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2)) against gauge-based precipitation observations reveals that MERRA-2 outperforms other reanalysis for Arctic EP changes. Based on MERRA-2 data, both annual EP amount and occurrence days averaged over the Arctic show statistically significant positive trends during 1980–2022 (3.37 ± 1.03 mm dec−1 and 0.42 ± 0.17 d dec−1, respectively), with the most pronounced increase in the autumn. Spatial heterogeneity in annual and seasonal EP trends is found across the Arctic, with the largest positive annual trends of 30 mm dec−1 over the Bering Sea and the Denmark Strait. The significant EP increase is closely associated with intensified atmospheric rivers (ARs) and widespread decline in sea ice concentration (SIC). Specially, SIC and ARs are responsible for 12% and 50% of Arctic EP inter-annual variance, respectively, while ARs directly contribute 28.3% of the total annual EP amounts. These findings explain the mechanistic controls on Arctic EP, providing critical insights for projecting polar weather and climate extremes and their impacts on the Arctic environment."

This fine-scale heterogeneity plays a key role in carbon dynamics yet capturing it—particularly in relation to green leaf phenology (GLP)—is challenging with traditional remote sensing methods. To address this, we developed a smartphone-based methodology and community-science project called the PeatPic Project. We gathered over 3700 photographs from 27 sites across 10 countries in 2021 and 2022, representing different peatland types (bog, fen, and swamp), at 1–2 week intervals. We calculated GLP metrics, such as the data of the start of the season and end of the season, based on the red-blue-green bands from these photographs. We found that GLP metrics varied significantly across peatland types and dominant vegetation communities. Notably, peak greenness at bog sites occurring approximately 10 days later in the year compared to fen sites. Furthermore, variables relation to peatland/vegetation type and energy balance were key predictors of peatland GLP. The PeatPic Project’s readily available methodology offers low-cost opportunities for further research into peatland phenology, enabling the calculation of additional phenological indices and integration with other data types. By refining our understanding of peatland GLP, we can improve predictive C modelling and better assess the impacts of future changes on these important ecosystems."

However, changes in extreme wildfire regimes and their consequential impact on carbon emissions and burned area (BA) remain unclear. Our results indicate that extreme wildfires in northern Eurasia exhibit a latitudinal shift in intensity and frequency during 2003–2023. Within the historically fire-prone latitude band of approximately 50° N–60° N, a declining trend is observed in both intensity and frequency of extreme wildfires. Conversely, a northward shift of high-intensity extreme wildfires brings unprecedented carbon emissions and BAs to high-latitude regions that are rich in forest carbon storage and permafrost. Although extreme wildfires account for only 10% of all fire events, they contribute to over 30% of total wildfire carbon emissions and BAs across most regions of northern Eurasia."

Both production- and consumer-level efforts can mitigate Nr loads and inputs. However, only independent evaluations of these efforts have been performed thus far, and the lack of comprehensive evaluations has hindered further reductions in Nr loads and inputs. Therefore, in this study, we applied the food nitrogen footprint to a subtropical island in Japan and evaluated both direct (on-island) and indirect (overseas-related, imported food/feed production) Nr loads and inputs within the food system. The following scenarios were developed: shifting diets toward grains and legumes in imported food, halving food loss and using the remainder as concentrate feed, and replacing chemical fertilizers with cattle manure produced on the island. Altering the composition of imported food, reducing food loss by half, and utilizing the remaining portion as feed effectively reduced the indirect Nr load, while using cattle manure reduced the direct Nr load. Implementing these measures in combination reduced the direct and indirect Nr loads by 15.4% and 30.9% and the direct and indirect Nr inputs by 19.8% and 18.8%, respectively. Therefore, it is essential to implement consumer and production efforts simultaneously rather than independently to optimize the global nitrogen cycle."

Utilizing spectral clustering method to classify the daily heatwave circulation over East Asia (EA) from 1979 to 2022, this study identifies three distinct heatwave hotspots in eastern China (P1; 22%), Mongolia (P2; 47%), and northwestern EA (P3; 31%), each of which has its own unique upper-level trough and ridge structures. The formation of heatwave hotspots is associated with the tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies, which are characterized by the westward extension and enhancement of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (P1), a strong ridge over Mongolia (P2), and anomalous anticyclones over northwestern and northeast EA (P3). These anomalous anticyclones lead to decreased cloud cover and atmospheric descent, influenced by specific quasi-barotropic teleconnection wave patterns in the mid-latitudes. The quantitative attribution results from the climate feedback response analysis indicate that the cloud, water vapor, and atmospheric dynamics constitute significant heat-generating mechanisms. Cloud changes provide the largest positive contribution (P1: 7.8 K, P2: 1.6 K, and P3: 1.9 K) to the formation of all three types of heatwaves through the shortwave radiation effect. Changes in atmospheric dynamics result in temperature increases of 2.7 K, 0.5 K, and 0.9 K in P1, P2, and P3, respectively. Atmospheric dynamics of P1 are primarily attributed to adiabatic warming, while both adiabatic and horizontal advection positively influence P2 and P3. Moreover, surface processes generally have compensatory cooling effects on the overall temperature anomalies associated with heatwaves. The findings of this study yield valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of extreme heat events in EA, offering scientific support for disaster prevention and mitigation."

We present a novel interdisciplinary framework to quantify and spatially evaluate the value and fate of coastal wetlands in the context of sea level rise (SLR) and future land use (FLU) plans. We apply our framework in New Bern, NC, USA, where we project changes in nitrogen removal ecosystem services provided by wetlands and undeveloped open spaces during heavy rainfall events under current sea levels and with 0.15–1.5 m (0.5–5 ft) of SLR. These landscapes currently provide $90 000 USD worth of nitrogen removal ecosystem services annually. Areas currently designated for conservation are especially valuable, contributing 53% of annual services despite making up only 13% of New Bern’s total land area (107 km2). We show that these Conservation designations are expected to lose over 60% of their wetlands with 0.90 m (3 ft) of SLR, reducing New Bern’s expected annual benefit by 56%. Wetland migration to higher elevations is inhibited largely by existing urban development, though we locate potential wetland migration corridors that extend into Developed and Urban Transition FLU designations. Application of our framework can help to maintain ecosystem services and reduce the pressures of coastal squeeze across changing coastal landscapes."

Here, by examining the multi-model projections under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios, we show that achieving carbon neutrality by the 2050s shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 1-1.9 can reduce global population exposure (PE) to hot temperature extremes—defined as person-days exceeding the 30 year return value of annual maximum daily maximum temperature—by 98%, compared to the scenario of continued regional rivalry in carbon emissions (SSP3-7.0). It is also up to 7% more effective than achieving carbon neutrality by the 2070s (SSP1-2.6), with this additional benefit driven primarily by significant reductions in urban PE, 4–9 times greater than those in rural PE. The effects of earlier carbon neutrality are particularly greater in developing continents, such as Africa, Asia, and South America, than in developed continents, thereby helping to reduce the regional inequality in climate risks. This result underscores the urgency of pursuing earlier carbon neutrality to reduce climate risks, especially in developing continents."

Interpretation of 31 cities in China based on local climate zones,"Urbanization has dramatically reshaped the urban landscape and intensified the urban heat island (UHI) effect in recent decades. This study investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of UHI across 31 major Chinese cities from 2000 to 2020, using the local climate zone (LCZ) framework, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer-derived land surface temperature (LST), and machine learning models. Existing research has found significant differences in the level of UHI variation among different cities, but few studies attributing it from the perspective of urban morphology changes. We quantify urbanization processes through nine LCZ-derived indicators and assess their influence on daytime and nighttime UHI in summer. Results show that UHI intensity increased in 80.6% of cities during the day and in 77.4% at night, with over half experiencing statistically significant intensification (p < 0.05). Daytime UHI was stronger in southern cities (mean: 3.12 ∘C), while nighttime UHI was more prominent in northern regions (mean: 1.86 ∘C). Urban expansion (UE) and vegetation reduction were identified as the primary contributors to UHI intensification, with random forest and Shapley Additive exPlans analyses indicating that UE accounted for up to 28.3% of UHI variance. Functional transformation of urban areas showed mixed thermal effects, with stronger nighttime impact. High-rise (LCZ4) and mid-rise (LCZ5) building expansions were particularly linked to elevated LST. Moreover, three land use indices exhibited significant correlations with UHI trends, especially in cities with significant UHI growth. This study provides a comprehensive attribution analysis of UHI dynamics at the national scale, offering empirical evidence to guide sustainable urban planning and climate-adaptive city design."

We observed marked differences in adaptive mobility responses across geographic regions with varying levels of historical hurricane exposure. Milton primarily impacted coastal areas with frequent hurricane exposure and prompted sharp increases in out-region travel prior to landfall and sustained elevated mobility in the post-disaster period. In contrast, Helene affected mostly inland areas, where mobility changes were modest and largely within natural variation. Within Helene-affected regions, coastal counties showed stronger mobility responses than inland counties. Our findings underscore the need for tailoring disaster preparedness and response strategies to the specific characteristics of affected populations."

Previously, such assessments were mainly conducted through simple statistical analyses and water resource models, which apply minimal observational data on socioeconomic factors. Here, we present a data-driven method to evaluate water scarcity, and reveal the interplaying mechanisms between its key driving factors. We selected Beijing as a case study for its complex human–water system representative of other megacities. We collected annual parameters from government’s statistics and yearbooks during 2000–2021 and designed a system dynamics (SD) framework to characterize the key human–water coupling components. The framework was then used to project water demand and supply changes under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (2024–2050) using meteorological forcing from CMIP6. Results show that the SD framework performs reasonably in reproducing historical water supply and demand variability, showing continuously mitigated water scarcity severity due to government efforts to constrain agricultural and industrial water demand. Future projections indicate that water scarcity severity will be gradually mitigated until 2030, particularly under SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 scenarios. After 2030, water scarcity is intensified across all scenarios except for SSP5. This is associated with increased (decreased) sectoral water demand, together with reduced (increased) total water supply under each scenario. Sensitivity analyses, by keeping key parameters constant, highlight the distinct roles of climatological and socioeconomic factors in shaping the timing and variability of water scarcity, and offer valuable policy implications. The SD framework in this study has unique strength in simulating the temporal evolutions of sectoral water demands and their complex interactions, and thus can improve the realism of water demand estimation, which is essential for water resource modeling and assessment studies."

The results also strongly suggest that improvement and harmonization of the representation of land use in these models would serve the community in their future development efforts. 
 This study analyzes ozone (O3) dry deposition fluxes and velocities (Vd) from 12 regional-scale simulations that were performed over North America and Europe in Phase 4 of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII4). AQMEII4 collected grid-aggregated and land-use-specific (LU-specific) O3 Vd and effective conductances and fluxes for the four major dry deposition pathways. Consistent with recent findings in the AQMEII4 point model intercomparison study, analysis of the grid-aggregated fields shows that grid models with a similar Vd can exhibit significant differences in the absolute and relative contributions of the different depositional pathways. Analysis of LU-specific Vd and effective conductances reveals a general increase in model spread compared to grid-aggregated values. This indicates that an analysis of only grid-aggregated deposition diagnostics can mask process-specific differences that exist between schemes. An analysis of AQMEII4 LU distributions across models revealed substantial differences in the spatial patterns and abundance of certain LU categories over both domains, especially for non-forest partially vegetated categories such as agricultural areas, shrubland, and grassland. We demonstrate that these differences can significantly contribute to or even drive differences in LU-specific dry deposition fluxes which can increase the variability in model predictions of ozone. Two recommendations for future deposition-focused modeling studies emerging from the AQMEII4 analyses presented here are to (1) routinely generate diagnostic outputs to advance a process-based understanding of modeled deposition and support impact analyses and (2) recognize the importance of documenting and analyzing the representation of LU across models and work towards harmonizing this aspect when using air quality grid models and model ensembles for deposition analyses."

We show that lake bed dust can raise PM10 to 637.5 μg m-³ and exceed non-carcinogenic (HQ = 4.13) and Cr carcinogenic  (approx. 2.10 × 10−⁶)  risk thresholds, posing growing health threats. 
 Many lakes worldwide are shrinking rapidly due to climate change and human activities. Pollutants accumulated in dried lake bed sediments may be released into the atmosphere as dust aerosols. However, whether lake bed dust carries sufficient toxic materials and exceeds threshold atmospheric concentrations to pose a significant health risk is currently unknown. Recently, Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, the largest lakes in east China, experienced record-breaking droughts, with 99 % and 88 % areas exposed to the air. Here, we demonstrate, through field sampling, laboratory simulations, and model validation, that lake bed dust from these lakes could contribute maximum daily PM10 concentrations up to 637.5 µg m−3. This study provides new evidence, which we show, that the dust generated from lake beds exceeded regional thresholds for short-term non-carcinogenic risk (HQ = 4.13) and Cr carcinogenic risk (≈2.10 × 10−6). These findings also suggest that lake bed dust could have a greater impact on human health as climate change leads to more extreme drought conditions in the future."

Platt,Efficient use of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model for atmospheric inversions using satellite observations of column mixing ratios,"Satellite remote sensing of atmospheric mixing ratios of greenhouse gases (GHGs) can provide information on their emissions. This study presents a novel method to use atmospheric mixing ratios observed by satellites with a Lagrangian model of atmospheric transport to estimate GHG emissions. This method can reduce model errors resulting from how an observation is represented by an atmospheric model, thereby helping to reduce the errors in the GHG emissions derived. 
 Satellite instruments for measuring atmospheric column mixing ratios have improved significantly over the past couple of decades, with increases in pixel resolution and accuracy. As a result, satellite observations are being increasingly used in atmospheric inversions to improve estimates of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly CO2 and CH4, and to constrain regional and national emission budgets. However, in order to make use of the increasing resolution in inversions, the atmospheric transport models used need to be able to represent the observations at these finer resolutions. Here, we present a new and computationally efficient methodology to model satellite column average mixing ratios with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) and calculate the Jacobian matrices describing the relationship between surface fluxes of GHGs and atmospheric column average mixing ratios, as needed in inversions. The development will enable a more accurate representation of satellite observations (especially high-resolution ones) via the use of LPDMs and, thus, help improve the accuracy of emission estimates obtained by atmospheric inversions. We present a case study using this methodology in the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) LPDM and the FLEXINVERT inversion framework to estimate CH4 fluxes over Siberia using column average mixing ratios of CH4 (XCH4) from the TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) instrument aboard the Sentinel-5P satellite.

The effect of aerosol ionic strength (IS) on HMS formation was quantified; it first rises with increasing IS and then peaks at 4 mol kg−1 before declining. Given the IS range of marine (2–6) and urban (6–20 mol kg−1) aerosols and the clearly negative correlation between humidity and IS, moderate IS levels in humid conditions may notably boost ambient HMS formation. 
 Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) has emerged as a critical organosulfur species in ambient aerosols, yet the impact of aerosol properties, particularly ionic strength (IS), on the formation of HMS remains uncertain. Here, HMS levels in wintertime in urban Nanjing, China, were quantified at 0.30 ± 0.10 µg m−3, where the contribution of in-cloud formation probably carries minor significance, due to the barrier resulting from stable stratification. Elevated HMS concentrations were recorded during a Nanjing haze event, resulting from enhanced HMS formation rates, which can be largely attributed to reduced ISs on hazy days, as IS-dependent enhancement of HMS formation increased with decreasing IS within the continental IS range (6–20 mol kg−1). This arises from the fact that elevated IS can boost HMS formation rate constants but also hinder the solubility of HMS precursor (SO2) and its further dissociation. Consequently, the IS-dependent enhancement initially rose with increasing IS, peaking at 4 mol kg−1, before declining. Additionally, for the first time, particulate HMS levels in marine atmospheres (Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea) were quantified, at 0.05 ± 0.01 µg m−3. Lower ISs (2.0–6.0 mol kg−1) observed for marine aerosols exhibited more pronounced enhancements in HMS formation; this can render the aerosol-phase HMS formation a process comparable to that in cloud/fog droplets in marine environments. Furthermore, the study highlights the significant impact of ambient humidity on aerosol IS (R = −0.89), suggesting the integration of ionic strength in chemical models to better represent particulate sulfur chemistry, particularly in humid environments."

We establish a computational strategy to rapidly predict acid-catalyzed hydrolysis kinetics of organic hydroperoxides, an aerosol constituent with high abundance. The kinetic parameters can be integrated into atmospheric models to improve simulations of the global hydrogen peroxide budget and secondary organic aerosol production. 
 Organic hydroperoxides (ROOHs) are key components of atmospheric aerosols. Determining the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants (kA) of ROOHs is crucial for assessing their atmospheric fate and environmental impacts. However, available kA values are limited due to the difficulty in obtaining authentic ROOH standards. Herein, we addressed this limitation by developing a computational strategy and probing the structure–activity relationship of kA values. We screened the protonated water cluster (H+(H2O)n) model, a critical prerequisite for density functional theory (DFT) calculations of kA, by comparing experimental kA values of four ROOHs with DFT-calculated values using H+(H2O)n (n=1, 2, 3, 4) models. Results show that the H+(H2O)2 model reliably predicts kA values with DFT method. Further investigation of 53 additional ROOHs including 45 model compounds and 8 atmospherically relevant species reveals that substituents at the Cα (the carbon atom directly bonded to the -OOH group) site, including -NH2, -N(CH3)2, –OH, –OCH3, –CH = CH2, –SH, and –PH2, can facilitate acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Notably, the –NH2 and –N(CH3)2 substituents exhibit stronger facilitating effect than the well-documented -OH and –OCH3 substituents. Additionally, we clarified that not all nitrogen- or oxygen-containing substituents equally enhance kA, as their efficacy depends on the substituents attached to the O or N atoms. This study provides a reliable computational strategy and essential guidelines for predicting kA values of ROOHs, enabling more accurate simulations in atmospheric chemistry models."

Our analysis revealed that activity growth, technology advancements, and policy-driven emission controls were key driving forces of NMVOC emission changes, but their roles were different across sectors and regions. 
 Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) play a crucial role in tropospheric atmospheric chemistry. Developing accurate NMVOC emission inventories is essential for chemical transport modeling and pollution mitigation. While global NMVOC emissions have been estimated in several inventories, representing the impacts of technology evolution on NMVOC emission dynamics remains challenging. Here, we developed a technology-based global NMVOC emission inventory (MEIC-global-NMVOC) under the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory model for Climate and air pollution research (MEIC) framework to better represent NMVOC emission evolution and drivers. We compiled spatially and temporally full-coverage and consistent activity rates from multiple sources using data fusion and reconstruction approaches. Next, we estimated the evolution of technology distributions and emission control measures by data-driven and policy-driven technology turnover models. The dynamics of global anthropogenic NMVOC emissions during 1970–2020 were presented by sector, fuel type, and product, highlighting activity growth and technology development as key drivers. In developing regions, emission growth was driven by surges in activity rates but curbed by advanced combustion technologies, improved vehicle standards, and substitution of solvent-borne paints. In developed regions, besides the mitigation measures above, emission control technologies substantially reduced fugitive emissions from energy production and emissions from solvent use, driven by policies such as the U.S. New Source Performance Standards and European Union Directives. Despite large uncertainties, MEIC-global-NMVOC emission estimates were generally comparable with other emission inventories at aggregated level for global or regional totals, but remarkable sectoral differences remained. The MEIC-global-NMVOC emission inventory offers a new database for atmospheric chemistry and pollution mitigation research."

 While the rise in global ocean temperature continues its course, reaching 1.45±0.12 °C above pre-industrial level according to the World Meteorological Organization in 2023, marine heatwave frequencies and intensities increase. Consequently, coral reef ecosystems, which are among the most vulnerable environments, are strongly impacted by dystrophic events and corals experiencing increasing frequencies of bleaching events. That has devastating consequences for the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) that strongly rely on these ecosystems. In situ observation remains the best alternative for providing accurate characterization of long-term trends and extremes in these shallow environments.

These in situ temperature time series are unique in several ways: in the length of some historical stations dating back to 1958 for the oldest, thus providing more than 65 years of daily data; in the number of countries sampled (16 PICTs); and in the variety of coral ecosystems monitored (from atolls to high islands and from barrier reefs' external slopes to shallow and narrow lagoons). Measurement devices have evolved over the years to provide increasingly precise and frequent observations, so the ReefTEMPS network was endorsed as a French National Observation Service in 2020, a label ensuring quality-controlled and open-access data of long-term observations. All stations are publicly available in ASCII or formatted NetCDF files either in the ReefTEMPS dedicated information system, which also allows for a quick visualization of time series, or on the SEANOE marine data platform. All links and accesses to these temperature time series are provided herein. The longevity of these temperature time series allows for diagnosing long-term trends, highlighting the influence of multiple processes on temperature dynamics (e.g. internal waves, cyclones, seasonal, and climate modes) and documenting the time evolution of extreme events.

HYPER-P improves accuracy, especially in areas with few rain gauges. This dataset supports scientists and decision-makers in understanding and managing water resources more effectively. 
 Accurate precipitation estimates are essential for a wide range of applications, including climate research (Pendergrass et al., 2017), water resource management (Camici et al., 2024; Fischer and Knutti, 2016; Kucera et al., 2013), agriculture (Beck et al., 2021; Ru et al., 2022), and natural hazard assessment (Serrano et al.,5 2010,Maggioni and Massari, 2018, Peiro et al., 2024; Smith et al., 2023).

HYPER-P is derived by downscaling and merging multiple data sources, including remote sensing products from Top-Down (TD) and Bottom-Up (BU) approaches, reanalysis datasets, and gridded in situ observations. The downscaling leverages on CHELSA climatology data (Karger et al., 2017), while the merging is obtained through a weighted average approach informed by Triple Collocation Analysis.Four merged products were developed based on multiple combinations of satellite products, observation and reanalysis datasets. The evaluation of these products was conducted through high-resolution validation in three Mediterranean regions with dense observational networks and coarse-resolution validation across Europe and a portion of North Africa. Results indicate that the combination of TD and BU satellite approaches enhance precipitation estimates, with merged products outperforming the parent datasets, especially in regions with sparse gauge coverage. The inclusion of ERA5-Land (Hersbach et al., 2020; Muñoz Sabater, 2019) further improves accuracy over areas characterized by complex topography. The merging of satellite products, particularly the one including ERA5-Land, shows overall strong performance, although challenges remain in validating precipitation estimates where ground observations are limited.

Secondly, the daily variation characteristics of Tm and its relationships with geographical situations were investigated. Finally, a hybrid-grid global Tm model considering the time-varying vertical adjustment rate (NGGTm) was developed. 
 The atmospheric weighted mean temperature (Tm) is a key parameter in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) water vapour retrieval and can convert the zenith wet delay (ZWD) into precipitable water vapour (PWV). However, there are some shortcomings in the existing Tm models, such as the detailed time-varying vertical adjustment rate not being considered. In addition, the spatiotemporal characteristics of Tm need to be further refined. Therefore, we developed a new global high-precision and high-spatiotemporal-resolution Tm model considering time-varying vertical adjustment rate using the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) atmospheric reanalysis data. Firstly, a new global grid Tm vertical adjustment rate model (NGGTm-H) was developed using the sliding-window algorithm. Secondly, the daily variation characteristics of Tm and its relationships with geographical situations were investigated. Finally, a new global hybrid-grid Tm model (NGGTm) considering time-varying vertical adjustment rate was developed.

The results show that taking the surface gridded Tm data of ERA5 as reference values, the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) value calculated by the NGGTm model was 2.84 K, which was lower with 0.50, 0.18 and 0.06 K than those of the Bevis, GPT3-5 and GPT3-1 models, respectively. Meanwhile, taking the Tm from the radiosonde stations as the reference values, the mean bias and RMSE of the NGGTm model were 0.10 and 3.30 K, respectively, which exhibit the best accuracy and stability among the Bevis, GPT3-5 and GPT3-1 models."

They naturally occur in steep creeks and are a threat to local communities. Scientists have turned to numerical models to better understand how they behave. We investigate the accuracy of a numerical model that relies on modelling the debris flow as a mixture of a granular phase and a fluid phase. We focus on a demonstration of the capacity of the model to reliably represent the behaviour of the flow at different scales. 
 This paper investigates the accuracy of a solid–fluid model using the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) software DualSPHysics v5.2 coupled with ProjectChrono for viscous debris flow modelling. It focuses on different validation steps of the method, both for pure fluid and a mixture of fluid and boulders, to build the reliability of the model in order to prepare for the simulation of a simplified debris flow. First, velocity profiles, the free-surface shape and the velocity of surges of a viscous fluid are validated against well-documented experimental data. This is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the few validations of the SPH approach for very viscous flows near the creeping threshold (Re ≈ 1). Second, the influence on the macroscopic viscosity of the introduction of granular elements in a viscous fluid is studied against a semiempirical formula. Finally, the method is applied to simplified 2D debris flow surges with field-like features. Surges modelled in this paper are composed of a viscous Newtonian fluid and polydisperse boulders. The flow of surges of different concentrations is studied, and Froude numbers of real field measurements are retrieved. Such complex models are shown to be relevant to the study of debris flow dynamics."

Unlike other models, it uses measurable plant traits such as height, leaf thinness, and root structure as inputs, rather than hard-to-measure physiological species data. This allows the simulation of many species. The model tracks daily changes in above- and below-ground biomass, plant height, and soil water. 
 Temperate semi-natural grassland plant communities are expected to shift under global change, mainly due to land use and climate change. However, the interaction of different drivers on diversity and the influence of diversity on the provision of ecosystem services are not fully understood. To synthesize the knowledge of grassland dynamics and to be able to predict community shifts under different land-use and climate change scenarios, we developed the GrasslandTraitSim.jl model. In contrast to previously published grassland models, we link morphological plant traits to species-specific processes via transfer functions, thus avoiding a large number of species-specific parameters that are difficult to measure and calibrate. This allows any number of species to be simulated based on a list of commonly measured traits: specific leaf area, maximum height, leaf nitrogen per leaf mass, leaf biomass per plant biomass, above-ground biomass per plant biomass, root surface area per below-ground biomass, and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization rate. For each species, the dynamics of the above- and below-ground biomass and its height are simulated with a daily time step. While the soil water content is simulated dynamically, the nutrient dynamics are kept simple, assuming that the nutrient availability depends on total soil nitrogen, yearly fertilization with nitrogen and the total plant biomass. We present a model description – which is complemented by online documentation with tutorials, flow charts, and interactive graphics – and calibrate and validate the model with two different datasets. We show that the model replicates the seasonal dynamics of productivity for experimental sites of the grass species Lolium perenne across Europe satisfactorily well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate the productivity and functional composition of grassland sites with different numbers of mowing events and grazing intensity in three regions in Germany. Therefore, the GrasslandTraitSim.jl model is presented as a useful tool for predicting the plant biomass production and plant functional composition of temperate grasslands in response to management under climate change."

Comparing the accuracy of the DP3 model to that of previous models and the Null model (average observed date of leaf coloring) suggests that leaf coloring data are noisy, which is why observation protocols and methods should be revised. 
 Leaf senescence ends the growing season of deciduous trees, affecting the amount of atmospheric CO2 sequestered by forests. Therefore, some climate models integrate projected leaf senescence dates to simulate the carbon cycle. Here, we developed a process-oriented model of leaf senescence (the “DP3 model”) by testing 34 formulations of the leaf development process based on the latest findings on the regulation of leaf aging and senescence. The period between leaf unfolding and leaf senescence was separated into the subsequent young, mature, and old leaf phases, with particular reactions to leaf aging and cold stress, photoperiod stress, and dry stress. The DP3 model simulates daily rates of aging and stress to predict dates of transition from young to mature to old leaf, senescence induction dates, and leaf senescence dates. This allows new hypotheses regarding the regulation of leaf senescence to be tested. For example, the DP3 model predicted an earlier onset of senescence in warmer conditions, likely due to earlier leaf unfolding (aging) and increased cold and dry stress in spring, together with longer-lasting senescence, likely due to the later accumulation of photoperiod stress relative to leaf development and decreased cold stress in summer and fall, which can be validated through experiments and in situ observations. The DP3 model and compared previous models were equally accurate but less accurate than the Null model (average senescence date observed in the calibration sample). This lower accuracy of the DP3 and compared models is likely due to noise in the visually observed leaf senescence data, which blurs the signal of the leaf senescence process, and to incorrect model formulations. The model errors were similarly affected by climate conditions and location among compared models (including the Null model) and varied mostly due to the leaf senescence data. Noisy leaf senescence data likely force the models to resort to the mean observation, impeding inferences from accuracy-based model comparisons about the leaf senescence process. This calls for revised observation protocols and methods that measure rather than estimate different senescence stages, such as senescence induction and 50 % of the leaves having changed color, e.g., based on greenness, involving digital cameras and automated image assessment."

The new model overcomes the difficulty related to combining these regimes and enables for particularly simple and reliable numerical implementation, which delivers regularized solutions that are insensitive to mesh resolution. We describe algorithmic details and demonstrate the applications to a number of relevant strain localization problems. 
 Rocks break if shear stresses exceed their strength. It is therefore important for typical geoscientific applications to take shear failure mechanism and the subsequent development of mode-II shear bands or faults into account. Many existing codes incorporate non-associated Drucker-Prager or Mohr-Coulomb plasticity models to simulate this behavior. Yet, when effective mean stress becomes extensional, for example when fluid pressure becomes large, the dominant failure mode changes to a mode-I (opening) mode, which initiates plastic volumetric deformation. It is rather difficult to represent both failure modes in numerical models in a self-consistent manner, while also accounting for the nonlinear visco-elastic host rock rheology, which varies from being nearly incompressible in the mantle to being compressible in surface-near regions. Here, we present a simple plasticity model that is designed to overcome these difficulties. We employ a combination of a linearized Drucker-Prager shear failure envelope with a circular tensile cap function in way that ensures continuity and smoothness of both yield surface and flow potential in the entire stress space. A Perzyna-type viscoplastic regularization ensures that the resulting localization zones are mesh-insensitive. To deal with the near incompressibility condition, a mixed two-field finite element formulation is employed. The local nonlinear iterations at the integration-point level are used to determine the stress increments. The global Newton-Raphson iterations are applied to solve the discretized momentum and continuity residual equations. The presented plasticity model is implemented in an open-source 2D unstructured finite element code GeoTech2D. The results of several typical test cases that range from crustal scale deformation to the propagation of fluid-induced tensile failure zones demonstrate rapid convergence. The robustness of the solution scheme is enhanced by the adaptive time stepping algorithm."

Here, the authors report a method for digital fabrication of slippery objects with solid-liquid composite interfaces and geometric design freedom. 
 The primary challenge in creating controllable liquid-based materials lies in managing the structural complexities and multiscale interfaces that govern solid, liquid, and gas phase interactions. Current fabrication methods for liquid-infused surfaces lack topological flexibility, limiting them to planar and simple-patterned structures. Conversely, digitally fabricating slippery architectural materials marks a significant shift towards scalable microprinting of complex, topologically slippery designs. This paper introduces a method for digitally fabricating slippery objects with solid–liquid composite interfaces and geometric design freedom. The slippery architecture has been demonstrated through digital printing of photopolymerization-induced multiphase materials and photoinduced grafting, enabling precise control over structural topologies and slippery properties of infused liquids. This versatile platform facilitates the fabrication of structures at multiple scales, enhancing liquid manipulation, droplet evaporation, and biomedical microfluidic chip design. These methods advance beyond conventional techniques, showcasing the potential of architected slippery surfaces with controlled structural scales. Control of liquid-based materials is important for developing materials based on these, but topological flexibility is limited.

Here, we present a Digital Colony Picker (DCP), an AI-powered platform for automated, high-throughput screening and export of microbial clones based on growth and metabolic phenotypes at single-cell resolution, without agar or physical contact. Using a microfluidic chip comprising 16,000 addressable picoliter-scale microchambers, individual cells are compartmentalized, dynamically monitored by AI-driven image analysis, and selectively exported via laser-induced bubble technique. Applied to Zymomonas mobilis, DCP enabled en masse screening and identified a mutant with 19.7% increased lactate production and 77.0% enhanced growth under 30 g/L lactate stress. This phenotype was linked to overexpression of ZMOp39x027, a canonical outer membrane autotransporter that promotes lactate transport and cell proliferation under stress. DCP provides a multi-modal phenotyping solution with spatiotemporal precision and scalable throughput, offering a generalizable strategy for accelerated strain engineering and functional gene discovery.

Here, the authors elucidate the molecular basis of ATG16L1 interactions with FIP200 and ATG8 family proteins, showing that the interaction of ATG16L1 with FIP200 is indispensable for the effective autophagic flux. 
 Macroautophagy maintains cellular and organismal homeostasis, and entails de novo synthesis of double-membrane autophagosome. The effective formation of autophagosome requires the recruitment of the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L1 complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure by relevant ATG16L1-binding autophagic factors including FIP200. However, the molecular mechanism governing the specific interaction of ATG16L1 with FIP200 remains elusive. Here, we uncover that ATG16L1 contains a FIP200-interacting region (FIR), which not only can directly bind FIP200 Claw domain, but also can serve as an atypical ATG8-interacting motif to selectively recognize mammalian ATG8 family proteins (ATG8s). We determine the high-resolution crystal structures of ATG16L1 FIR in complex with FIP200 Claw and GABARAPL1, respectively, and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the interactions of ATG16L1 with FIP200 and ATG8s. To distinguish the precise contribution of FIP200 from ATG8s for binding to ATG16L1 FIR in autophagy, we develop a ATG16L1 mutant that can exclusively interact with ATG8s but not FIP200. Finally, using relevant cell-based functional assays, we demonstrate that the interaction of ATG16L1 with FIP200 is indispensable for the effective autophagic flux. In conclusion, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interactions of ATG16L1 with FIP200 and ATG8s, and are valuable for further understanding the function of ATG16L1 in autophagy. ATG16L1 is a key autophagic protein.

Here, the authors report the powdery mildew resistance locus derived from wild emmer wheat is conferred by the combined effect of two complementary nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat genes. 
 Powdery mildew is a devastating disease that affects wheat yield and quality globally. Here, we identify a powdery mildew resistance locus MlIW39 from wild emmer wheat through map-based cloning, mutagenesis, and stable genetic transformation. Unlike many other cloned Pm genes, the MlIW39-mediated resistance is conferred by the combined effect of two complementary nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes, encoding a canonical coiled-coil (CC) type NLR protein (MlIW39-R1) and an atypical NLR protein (MlIW39-R2) with an unknown domain (CC-like), respectively. Overexpression of the NLR pair induces cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, whereas MlIW39-R1 or MlIW39-R2 alone does not. The MlIW39-R1 and MlIW39-R2 proteins physically interact with each other. MlIW39-R1 and MlIW39-R2 likely originate independently and become neighborly located during evolution. Our findings shed light on the significance of NLR pairs in plant immunity and can facilitate wheat disease-resistance breeding using the developed MlIW39 introgression lines and functional marker.

Campbell,LARGE1 processively polymerizes length-controlled matriglycan on prodystroglycan,"LARGE1 glycosyltransferase synthesizes matriglycan (xylose-glucuronate)n on dystroglycan, and short matriglycan can cause neuromuscular disorders. Authors show that LARGE1 processively polymerizes matriglycan of defined length on prodystroglycan. 
 Matriglycan is a linear glycan (xylose-β1,3-glucuronate)n, which binds proteins in the extracellular matrix that contain laminin-globular domains and Lassa Fever Virus. It is indispensable for neuromuscular function. Matriglycan of insufficient length can cause muscular dystrophy with abnormal brain and eye development. LARGE1 (Like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1) uniquely synthesizes matriglycan on dystroglycan. The mechanism of matriglycan synthesis is not obvious from cryo-EM reconstructions of LARGE1. However, by reconstituting activity in vitro on recombinant prodystroglycan we show that the presence of the dystroglycan N-terminal domain (DGN), phosphorylated core M3, and a xylose-glucuronate primer are necessary for matriglycan polymerization by LARGE1. By introducing active site mutations, we demonstrate that LARGE1 processively polymerizes matriglycan on prodystroglycan, with its length regulated by the dystroglycan prodomain, DGN. Our enzymatic analysis of LARGE1 uncovers the mechanism of matriglycan synthesis on dystroglycan, which can form the basis for therapeutic strategies to treat matriglycan-deficient neuromuscular disorders and arenaviral infections. LARGE1 glycosyltransferase synthesizes matriglycan (xylose-glucuronate)n on dystroglycan, and short matriglycan can cause neuromuscular disorders.

Here, Weber and colleagues identify cellular mechanisms and candidate genes that shape vertebral proportion. 
 Limbs and vertebrae elongate by endochondral ossification, but local growth control is highly modular such that not all bones are the same length. Compared to limbs, which have a different evolutionary and developmental origin, far less is known about how individual vertebrae establish proportion. Using the jerboa and mouse tail skeletons, we find that cell number is a common driver of limb and vertebral proportion in both species. However, chondrocyte hypertrophy, which is a major driver of proportion in all mammal limbs, is limited to the extreme disproportionate growth of jerboa mid-tail vertebrae. The genes associated with differential growth in the vertebral skeleton overlap significantly, but not substantially, with genes associated with limb proportion. Among shared candidates, loss of Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 3 in mice causes disproportionate elongation of the proximal and mid-tail vertebrae, in addition to the proximal limb. Our findings therefore, reveal cellular processes that tune the growth of individual vertebrae while also identifying natriuretic peptide signaling among genetic control mechanisms that shape the entire skeleton.

Here the authors show that this effect will weaken with future glacier retreat, leading to a recoupling of temperatures from the 2030s onwards. 
 Recent studies have argued that air temperatures over many mountain glaciers are decoupled from their surroundings, leading to a local cooling which could slow down melting. Here we use a compilation of on-glacier meteorological observations to assess the extent to which this relationship changes under warming. Statistical modelling of the potential temperature decoupling of the world’s mountain glaciers indicates that currently glacier boundary layers warm ~0.83 °C on average for every degree of ambient temperature rise. Future projections under shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) climate scenarios SSP 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5 indicate that decoupling, and thus relative cooling over glaciers, is maximized during the 2020s and 2030s, before widespread glacier retreat acts to recouple above-glacier air temperatures with its surroundings. This nonlinear feedback will lead to an increased sensitivity to warming from midcentury, with glaciers losing their capacity to affect the local climate and cool themselves. It has been argued that air temperatures over mountain glaciers are decoupled from surrounding warming, which could slow down melting. Here the authors show that this effect will weaken with future glacier retreat, leading to a recoupling of temperatures from the 2030s onwards."

The authors show that the timing of emissions reductions drives the uncertainties during the twenty-first century, but geophysical uncertainties become more important with time, especially under optimistic scenarios. 
 Uncertainty in future CO2 emissions and the geophysical response to emissions drives variability in future sea-level rise. However, the relative contributions of emissions and geophysical dynamics (for example, Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) tipping points) to future sea-level projections are not well understood. Here we disentangle their relative importance by propagating an ensemble of CO2 emissions trajectories through a calibrated carbon cycle–climate–sea-level model chain. Without negative emissions, the CO2 emissions trajectory, particularly the timing of when emissions are reduced, becomes the primary driver of sea-level variability between 2065 and 2075. Accelerated AIS melting greatly influences the sensitivity of global mean sea-level rise to time-averaged and integrated temperature changes. The most important geophysical uncertainties associated with the risk of exceeding sea-level thresholds are the threshold corresponding to accelerated AIS melting and equilibrium climate sensitivity. Our results highlight the need for both adaptation and rapid decarbonization to manage the risks posed by SLR. Unclear emissions and ice-sheet processes drive uncertainties in future sea-level rise.

 Spectral nudging (SN) is an effective numerical technique that prevents the background field from deviating excessively from the boundary conditions in regional climate modeling. This study investigates the effectiveness of SN in convection-permitting model simulations of three typical events of warm-season extreme precipitation in South Korea. The case studies show that SN improves extreme precipitation simulations by keeping synoptic circulations more consistent with observations. Trajectory analysis also shows that SN influences the moisture transport and local ascent that trigger extreme precipitation. However, the extent of the improvement depends on the synoptic condition and the domain size. The influence of SN generally increases with increasing domain size, especially for events driven by the developing upper-level trough with strong baroclinic instability compared to those influenced by surface processes. SN is also found to be more effective in events whose dominant wave scales fall between the domain size and the cut-off wavelength used for SN. Based on a series of sensitivity experiments, it is proposed that the most effective configuration for simulating extreme precipitation events is to apply SN to a domain approximately 3000 km wide."

 Global warming is transforming High Arctic ecosystems, yet the effects of northward vegetation expansion on soil microbial functions remain unclear. A four-year field experiment in northern Greenland was conducted to study these impacts. We investigate how plant litter affects the active layer and thawing permafrost soils by transplanting the latter from deeper soil layers and supplementing active layer soils with Arctic shrub litter. Litter amendment altered the soils’ functional potential, including the enrichment of genes linked to ion and lipid transport, metabolism and secondary metabolite production, ultimately enhancing microbial growth and respiration. Significant alterations were observed in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling genes, marked by an enhancement of CAZymes related to the breakdown of specific C substrates such as cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, murein and chitin. Litter amendment also shifted the microbial N-cycling potential towards increased N mineralization and assimilation of organic and inorganic N, suggesting an increased incorporation of N into microbial biomass. Without litter amendment, few C- and N-metabolism pathways changed, mainly affecting auxiliary activities and lignin breakdown due to permafrost thawing. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring High Arctic vegetation expansion, as it may impact C degradation and greenhouse gas emissions more than permafrost thaw alone.

 The impact of rapid climate change on civilizations is of global concern. The Western Zhou (1045–771 BC) was ancient China’s third dynasty and one of the most powerful empires of its time. After a 274-year reign, the dynasty collapsed, accompanied by significant population migration. Various factors have been proposed to explain its fall, while the role of climate change has been largely ignored. Here we present well-dated, high-resolution stalagmite records from Northeast and Southeast China, along with other paleoclimatic and archaeological evidence, to demonstrate the critical role of the 2.8 ka climatic event in the dynasty’s collapse and subsequent migration. Our results indicate a “north dry–south wet” dipolar pattern in the Chinese monsoon region during this event. The drought and cold severely affected the Western Zhou core areas and exacerbated invasions by northern nomads, contributing to its collapse. The resulting environmental stresses and conflicts likely triggered substantial southward migration.

 Ecosystem structure and biophysical processes mediate biological responses to climate changes, but few studies have examined impacts of this dynamic among upper trophic levels. We investigated ecosystem differences in how diverse seabird populations across the northern hemisphere have responded to changes in regional mixed layer temperature and water column stratification. Using 138 time series of breeding productivity over the past half-century, we show that seabird reproductive productivity has declined in the Arctic and North Atlantic but not in the Pacific during a period of ubiquitous mixed layer warming and regionally-variable stratification trends. Models of breeding productivity and ocean drivers show that seabird responses to climate change vary by ecosystem. Additionally, ecosystems in which seabirds exhibit detectibly declining productivity tend to have lower overall diet diversity across seabird species. These findings emphasize the importance of ecosystem processes and structure in determining the vulnerability of marine predators to climate change.

 Urban functional zones (UFZs) are well-planned spatial units characterized by distinct socioeconomic activities and composite land uses, such as residential areas, industrial zones, and blue-green spaces. Fine-grained UFZ mapping has played an increasingly crucial role in supporting targeted urban renewal and transformation of development mode in megacities, facilitating spatial structure optimization to enhance urban livability and sustainability. Prior UFZ mapping methods that focus on two-dimensional (2D) features of point of interest and multi-spectral imagery, pay little attention to three-dimensional (3D) features of building height and digital surface model, mostly with the absence or underutilization of emerging nighttime light imagery. Given the availability of high-quality day-night spectral signatures provided by the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) in a single sensor observing mode, it has become possible to effectively perform UFZ mapping with day-night feature enhancement. In this study, we proposed a progressive and cross-scale deep fusion architecture for generating UFZ maps at the block scale, enhancing spectral and spatial information through sequential refinement—from feature representation and relationship extraction to context modeling. To verify the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method, experiments were conducted in two Chinese megacities with distinct UFZ landscapes. Results demonstrated that the medium-resolution SDGSAT-1 imagery could be used as a reliable data source for deriving day-night features, enabling the generation of fine-grained UFZ maps when combined with 2D—3D features from other geospatial big data. Cross-method comparisons also showed that this approach could significantly improve both semantic segmentation and topological interpretation across different UFZ types. Notably, our method could not only achieve acceptable levels of mapping performance (overall accuracy > 0.91 and average F1-score > 0.91), but also realize the accurate extraction of purer UFZ blocks with a small sample size (training-testing ratio = 1:4), further indicating considerable potential in large-scale UFZ mapping.

 In seasonally cold ecosystems, ecological processes and biotic communities are strongly influenced by winter conditions. Climate change is affecting these conditions, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, as temperatures during the cold season continue to warm and alter patterns of frozen ground and snow cover. Yet, the current understanding of the ecological impacts of these changes is limited. A fundamental first step in addressing this knowledge gap is to quantify winter conditions with ecologically meaningful indices across large areas and at spatiotemporal resolutions relevant to on-the-ground management. Here, our goal was to combine Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (L8S2) data to derive three 30-m indices of winter conditions (winter habitat indices or WHIs): snow season length, percentage of days of frozen ground without snow, and snow cover variability, for the contiguous United States. We assessed the accuracy of the L8S2 WHIs using a nationwide network of meteorological stations and examined their error rates by land cover type, elevation, and the number of cloud-free observations available for each index calculation. Last, we compared the spatial patterns and errors in the L8S2 WHIs with those in WHIs derived from coarse-resolution MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery (500 m). We found that all three L8S2 WHIs accurately characterized winter conditions on the ground. They also had very similar accuracy and spatial patterns as the MODIS WHIs, despite having a lower imaging frequency and the lack of extensively validated snow cover products akin to those from MODIS. The accuracies of the WHIs were generally highest in mountainous areas of the western US and in vegetated areas, and they were lowest in parts of the midwestern and eastern US where cloud-free observations were less frequent, and in developed and barren areas. Having more cloud-free observations improved the accuracy of the WHIs, especially snow season length. Owing to their higher resolution, the L8S2 WHIs detected far more spatial detail than those from MODIS, particularly in topographically complex regions where winter conditions are highly heterogeneous over short distances. Our results demonstrate that 30-m WHIs derived from L8S2 data accurately capture winter conditions across the contiguous US, with accuracies that rival those from MODIS. Thus, the L8S2 WHIs offer exciting opportunities for ecological applications at a 30-m resolution across large spatial scales."

 Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are widespread environmental contaminants used primarily as flame retardants and plasticizers, yet their fate remains poorly understood. This study comprehensively examined OPEs in indoor and outdoor air in urban environments, focusing on concentrations, seasonal patterns, and health risks. Seventeen OPEs, including aryl, alkyl, and chlorinated types, were analyzed in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the gas phase over a year-long sampling campaign. Outdoor gas phase OPE concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 2.68 ng/m3, while particulate concentrations varied from 0.07 to 0.49 ng/m3. Indoor gas phase concentrations were higher, ranging from 0.13 to 7.84 ng/m3, and particulate concentrations from 0.08 to 1.26 ng/m3. Chlorinated OPEs dominated the gas phase, whereas alkyl OPEs were more prevalent in the particulate phase. Seasonal variations revealed elevated OPE levels in spring and summer, attributed primarily to increased volatilization and marine-derived air masses, whereas winter concentrations were the lowest and occasionally linked to long-range transport from northeastern China. Diurnal measurements indicated that indoor gas phase OPE concentrations were higher during daytime, coinciding with increased human activities and elevated indoor temperatures. Principal component analysis suggested local industrial emissions and regional transport from Southeast Asia and Northeast China as key sources. Estimated daily intake (EDI) values for children exceeded those for adults, indicating greater vulnerability.

 BackgroundKala Sanghian Drain, Punjab, India, receives the chemicals from the leather industries, motor bearings industries, electroplating industries, and textile industries situated on its side. This drain becomes a source of physiological disturbance, such as skin diseases, respiratory problems, peripheral neuropathy, and neurotic symptoms in the community living near it. These become a bed of carcinogenic and mutagenic agents, too.MethodsTo analyze the presence of toxic volatile organic compounds in the industrial effluent of Kala Sanghian Drain, gas chromatography equipped with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ-MS/MS) was used. The four sites along the length of the drain, having a hub of industries, were chosen for the collection of samples. The samples were collected in triplicate.ResultsEleven volatile organic compounds have been detected from four sites (LO, LD, FD, and BD) of the Kala Sanghian Drain (KSD). The identified volatile organic compounds were 1, 3, 5-Trimethylbenzene, p-isopropyltoluene, bromobenzene, cumene, ethylbenzene, carbon tetrachloride, cis-1, 2-dichloroethene, heptane, dichloromethane, 1, 1, 1-trichloroethane, and tetrachloromethane. The most frequently occurring volatile organic compounds across the sites were heptane, dichloromethane, and cis-1, 2-dichloroethene. The highest number of volatile organic compounds was observed in Site 3 (FD) with eight organic compounds. Heptane was identified with the highest total concentration of 619.3 ng/ml. On the contrary, cumene was present with the lowest concentration of 10.11 ng/ml. The identified volatile organic compounds belong to the benzene series, chlorinated hydrocarbons, chlorinated benzene, and alkane.Public health relevanceIndustrialization and urbanization are colossal sources of pollutants in the environment, especially in water bodies. The highly polluted drains of developing countries are impairing the normal parameters of the water bodies. At the study site, where the hazardous chemicals are released into the drain, there is no air monitoring. These toxic compounds not only become a hazard for the residents but also manipulate the aquatic life and the agriculture sector. The Sutlej River and the ocean are the next destinations for this outflow. In this sense, it affects aquatic and human life worldwide, either directly or indirectly. Our research emphasizes how important environmental monitoring is to preserving human life."

The modelling system employed, ‘AQREAN’, comprises a well-validated air quality forecast model together with a bias correction post-processing system. This combines model values with pollutant observations to give an improved estimate (termed a ‘reanalysis’) of hourly average pollution levels for the whole UK on a 0.1° grid. The system is described, together with key model input datasets and the verification procedure used to quality assure the dataset. As part of this verification, statistics summarising the level of uncertainty in the data are presented. The final dataset is described in detail. In addition to the concentrations of the air quality pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2 and SO2) it includes many additional chemical and physical quantities, plus key meteorological parameters. An initial analysis of the dataset is presented, describing long-term trends in air pollution, along with the frequency and intensity of poor air quality episodes.

 Microplastics (MPs) are a significant environmental pollutant, and the indoor environment serves as both a source and a medium for human exposure to these particles. The influence of different MP shapes on health risks, particularly concerning intestinal absorption, remains poorly understood. This study investigated MPs in indoor dustfall, with an emphasis on shape-dependent characteristics and risks. Dustfall samples from urban residences were analyzed using density separation, microscopy, and micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μ-FTIR). Our findings showed that the dustfall MPs consisted of fragmented, fibrous, and spherical shapes, with fragmented MPs accounting for 31 % of the total. Due to their larger specific surface area (SSA), fragmented MPs exhibited a higher absorption capacity. A health risk model for human intestinal absorption of MPs in indoor dustfall was developed, revealing that fragmented MPs contributed the highest absorption rate (0.0289), followed by spherical MPs (0.0136) and fibers (0.0088). Indoor surveys further indicated that practices such as choosing low-emission wall materials, increasing ventilation, and using air purifiers can reduce indoor MP levels.

 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), the substitute for chlorofluorocarbons, are regulated under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. China is considered an emission hot region of HCFCs; however, observations and emission estimates are insufficient, with the need of higher sensitivities of new observations to constrain emissions beyond 2021. To better quantify China's HCFC emissions, we build a new atmospheric site named Changdao (CHD), which is more sensitive to emissions in northern China than previously-used sites. Using these measurements, we provide the most recent emission estimates for China in 2022: 150 ± 13 Gg yr−1 for HCFC-22, 31 ± 2.5 Gg yr−1 for HCFC-141b, and 8.8 ± 0.8 Gg yr−1 for HCFC-142b.

 This study investigates the interdecadal variability of the leading mode of summer persistent extreme precipitation (PEP) over Southwest China (SWC) and its associated mechanisms using observational diagnostics and numerical simulations. The leading mode of summer SWC PEP exhibits a north-south dipole pattern, with a shift from a north-negative–south-positive pattern to a north-positive–south-negative pattern around 2003. An anomalous cyclone over Northeast to North China and an anticyclone over southern China in the lower troposphere trigger the PEP pattern by inducing moisture convergence (divergence) over northern (southern) SWC. Meanwhile, the Rossby wave train along the subtropical westerly jet over Eurasia provides favorable dynamic conditions for the dipole pattern. The moisture budget diagnostics indicate the importance of the interaction between dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the formation of north-south difference in SWC PEP variability. Such atmospheric circulation anomalies are closely related to southern European soil moisture, Barents-Kara Sea (BKS) sea ice concentration (SIC) and thermal feedback over the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). On one hand, reduced summer soil moisture over southern Europe enhances the meridional temperature gradient and atmospheric baroclinicity to its north, intensifying synoptic-scale transient eddy activity. The resulting transient eddy forcing favors the development of a quasi-barotropic positive geopotential height anomaly over Europe, which subsequently favors the formation of the eastward-propagating wave train that modulates the anomalous circulation associated with SWC PEP. On the other hand, the summer BKS SIC reduction weakens the meridional temperature gradient over the mid-to-high latitude Eurasia, inducing local anomalous easterlies and promoting the formation of the above-mentioned European positive geopotential height anomaly and Rossby wave train. In addition, the thermal feedback over the eastern TP triggered by the Rossby wave train, reinforces the anomalous atmospheric pattern that favors the dipole PEP over SWC."

 The Three-North Region is pivotal to desertification control in China. Based on the CN05.1 gridded dataset and ERA5 reanalysis data, this study analyzes the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of temperature, extreme temperature events, and land-atmosphere coupling strength in the Three-North Region from 1961 to 2022. Results show since 1961, the Three-North Region of China has experienced a significant warming trend, with an average temperature increase rate of approximately 0.28 °C per decade, notably higher than the contemporaneous global average of around 0.15 °C per decade. The frequency of extreme high-temperature events has markedly increased, leading to a continuous narrowing of the diurnal temperature range. Notably, the land-atmosphere coupling strength, as indicated by the π index, has exhibited a persistent upward trend, which are closely associated with regional warming and the occurrence of extreme heat events. These changes in climate are closely linked to anomalies in atmospheric circulation patterns, which have intensified low-level moisture flux divergence, reduced surface latent heat fluxes, and enhanced sensible heat fluxes. The land-atmosphere interaction has triggered a strong local positive feedback mechanism, further amplifying regional warming and the frequency of extreme temperature events. Overall, land-atmosphere coupling has emerged as a critical driver of climate warming and the intensification of extreme heat events in the Three-North Region, warranting heightened attention in future research. Our findings may provide new perspectives for assessing extreme weather risks in the Three-North Region. The increasingly significant role of enhanced land-atmosphere coupling strength in intensifying extreme weather events also provides valuable insights for other regions."

 In February 2022, a high load of aerosols released into the atmosphere from biomass burning areas recorded in the Northern South America Region significantly impacted the air quality in several cities of Colombia, including the Aburrá Valley, a major urban area in the Tropical Andes. Based on extensive surface and vertical measurements of meteorological variables and pollutant concentrations provided by the Early Warning System of Medellín and the Aburrá Valley - SIATA, we examined the physical factors behind the inflow of polluted air masses. The research focuses on the role of wind, buoyancy and wind shear on the horizontal and vertical transport of pollutants. A holistic analysis of the dynamic and thermal structure of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) is presented, supported by surface in-situ observations of pollutant concentrations, turbulent fluxes, and vertical profiles of several variables recorded before, during, and after the aerosol inflow. This severe air pollution event resulted in an increase in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by more than 115 % during the night, with average daily concentrations surpassing the maximum allowable concentration for PM2.5 set by Colombian air quality regulations. The results show that during the event, atmospheric pollutants entered during the nighttime from the north and moved southward along the valley axis, driven by a strong channelized airflow at 250 m above the surface and with an average speed of 3.8 m/s. According to high-resolution forecasts with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, the nocturnal airflow was consistent with anomalous northeasterly winds toward the valley. The low-level wind channeled by the valley's topography generated significant mechanical turbulence through vertical wind shear, which considerably increased the vertical momentum fluxes and turbulent kinetic energy within the surface layer. The associated vertical mixing contributed to the downward transport of pollutants, increasing near-surface concentrations of biomass-associated black carbon and PM2.5, superpassing 40 % in relative contribution and reaching up to 60 μgm−3, respectively. Overall, the case study offers new perspectives and improves our understanding of the turbulent mixing and its role in the vertical transport of pollutants through the boundary layer within complex terrain in a tropical setting."

 A possible mechanism of tornado generation is associated with the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability. The supercooled cloud-air mixture near the axis starts to descend and, due to the super adiabatic temperature gradient, the overheated near-surface air mass rises. The complete system of equations for full model includes equations for the stream function, for the azimuthal velocity component, and for the change in density. The refined model considers rotating convection within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The simplest model uses a separate equation for the stream function and can be applied to the initial stage of vortex generation. Within the framework of the simplest model, an analytical solution is combined from 8 linear dependencies by height. Rotation increases due to the conservation of angular momentum. Within the framework of the refined model, some unidirectional differential rotation arises, but it depends on boundary conditions (can be local). The full model studies the tornado development as rotating convection from the very beginning to the quasi-stationary stage. Velocity components increase in a coordinated manner. Two cases are considered: a single whirlwind and a two-eyed tornado. Radial flows converge towards the central part of the tornado near the earth surface, and there is an outflow from the “wall” to the axis and to the periphery near the top of the tornado. The maximum vertical velocity component is achieved at a certain radial distance at a certain height. The maximum azimuthal velocity component is achieved in the tornado “wall”. Tornado generation criteria are discussed."

 The Megacity of Jakarta and its surrounding regions have been currently more vulnerable to severe floods due to extreme rainfall. In this study, the contributions of multiple drivers of regional climate phenomena to extreme rainfall seasonally are examined using a single index of 80 percentile of seasonal maximum of daily rainfall during each event and climatology based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Climate Extreme Index (CEI). The multi-drivers investigated in this study include cold surges (CS), cross-equatorial northerly surges (CENS), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). We used daily rainfall datasets of 7 meteorological stations representing varying topography from lowland on the coast to mountain areas during 1985–2021 (37 years). Results show that the climatology of rainfall is significantly associated with CEI during CENS in the wet season Dec-to-Feb (DJF) (r = 0.8). Meanwhile, in the dry season Jun-to-Aug (JJA), the rainfall is more related to CEI during the negative IOD and La Niña (r = 0.9). Over the lowland, the rainfall intensity ≥ CEI during CENS has a stronger variation in DJF than in any other season. The second peak of CEI is notably found over the transitional area between lowlands and mountains (Dramaga Station) during Mar-to-May (MAM), JJA, and Sep-to-Nov (SON). This implies the important role of the transitional region in changes of extreme rainfall which has not been exposed previously. The large-scale drivers have induced extreme rainfall intensity in DJF for most stations. In MAM, JJA, and SON, the contribution of CEI is the largest in areas over the south near the mountainous regions."
