10.1088/1748-9326/adf23c,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注全球变暖背景下，日变化云循环（DCC）的变化及其对气候的影响。通过分析13年的卫星观测数据，发现DCC具有增温效应。低云的重心位置从白天向夜晚移动，增强了夜间的增温效应，减少了太阳辐射的反射；而高云则表现出相反的趋势。研究表明，随着全球平均气温升高，DCCRE预计将继续增强气候变暖。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它依赖于卫星观测来研究云的特性和辐射效应，从而理解气候变化。,"['satellite observations', 'cloud radiative effects', 'diurnal cloud cycle', 'climate warming', 'low clouds', 'high clouds']",Tingting Chen;Jinming Ge;Chi Zhang;Yanyan Wu;Qingyu Mu;Xinyi Han;Jing Su;Xiaoyu Hu;Zeen Zhu,Shifts in diurnal cycles of low and high clouds warm the climate: evidence from decadal satellite observations,"Anticipated changes in the diurnal cloud cycle (DCC) under global warming carry significant implications for future climate predictions. However, there is a notable dearth of studies specifically focusing on DCC shifts. Here, we establish a connection between DCC and its radiative effects (DCCRE), revealing that the DCC has tended to warm the climate over the past 13 years. We found that the centroid position determines the warming or cooling effect of DCCRE, while the magnitude of the amplitude influences its strength. As global mean temperature (GMT) rises, low cloud centroid tends to shift from daytime to nighttime, enhancing nighttime warming effects and diminishing solar radiation reflection. Conversely, high clouds exhibit the opposite, reducing nighttime warming effects and displaying stronger DCCRE compared to low clouds. For each 1 °C increase in GMT, the total cloud DCCRE is expected to rise by 2.90 W m−2, mainly driven by low clouds contributing to an increase of 1.85 W m−2. This suggests that DCCRE may continue to warm the climate as GMT rises. These results indicate that the changes in DCC are significant for understanding climate variability. However, it should be noted that these findings are based on short-term regression analysis and further research is needed to determine whether they are related to long-term responses."

In the United States (US), the National Weather Service (NWS) issues alerts ahead of forecast periods of extreme heat. However, the behavioral impact of official heat alerts remains poorly understood at actionable scales, and their real-world effectiveness has been difficult to quantify. We used anonymized, county-level Google search data on the proportion of searches classified into eight heat-associated categories, aggregated daily across 2581 US counties from May to September 2023. We implemented a time-stratified case-crossover method using conditional Poisson models to quantify the association between the proportion of heat-related internet searches and (a) daily maximum temperature and (b) NWS heat alerts, adjusting for same-day county-specific temperature percentiles. We further evaluated how associations varied spatially and temporally within the season. Across all counties, searches for heat stroke/exhaustion were 3.60 (95% CI, 3.38–3.85) times higher when comparing the 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures to the 1st percentile. Air-conditioning searches were 2.47 (2.43–2.51) times higher. Exposure–response curves rose steeply above the 80th percentile except for public swimming and cooling center queries. On heat alert days, heat-related searches were 1.27 (1.26, 1.28) times higher relative to matched non-alert days. Results varied by region. However, effect modification was pronounced: early-summer alerts (May–June) elicited stronger responses than late-summer alerts (July–September) in all heat-related search categories except cooling centers. Our findings suggest that heat alerts trigger meaningful, real-time behavioral responses during heatwaves, particularly in early summer and historically cooler regions. High-resolution internet search data offer a promising tool for evaluating public engagement with risk communication and can provide local officials guidance for further optimizing messaging strategies."

In this paper, we examine future rice production failure risks across India by integrating down-scaled climate projections with machine learning models that capture complex crop-climate interactions. First, we identify key drivers of historical crop failures and demonstrate the critical role of monthly weather variability. We then use our historically-trained ML models to project future production failure risk across India, linking spatial changes in failure risk with projected future weather distributions and exploratory scenarios of changes in irrigation access. Our findings indicate that district-level risks of rice production failures in India are projected to increase (26% average) under future climate change across all shared socioeconomic pathways in the near (2025–2054) and far (2055–2084) future. Our analysis demonstrates that expanding irrigation access could play a vital role in mitigating these risks, with substantial risk reductions observed in high-vulnerability regions. These insights provide actionable information for policymakers aiming to enhance agricultural resilience, identifying priority areas where adaptive measures, particularly irrigation improvements, can most effectively reduce vulnerability to climate-driven production risks."

However, there is limited research that quantifies the extent of anticipated CC impacts across Canadian watersheds with active mining. This paper aims to fill that gap by assessing CC impacts on key hydroclimatic variables important for Canada’s mine water management. Baseline conditions were established for six key variables: annual precipitation, 24 h intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) precipitation, 10 d extreme precipitation, annual mean temperature, hydrologic drought index like Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI), and annual snow depth. Date sources included Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Future CC projections were generated using ECCC’s transformation equation for 24 h IDF precipitation, the quantile delta mapping (QDM) method for 10 d extreme precipitation, and downscaled, bias corrected CMIP5 ensemble projections for the remaining variables. The assessment considered two greenhouse emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and three future timeframes (2020s, 2050s, 2080s). The study reveals projected temperature increases within the case study watersheds of 2.4 °C–3.5 °C by the 2050s and 3 °C–7 °C by the 2080s under median or 50th percentile (p50) conditions. Annual precipitation is expected to rise by 11%–16% (2050s) and 15%–28% (2080s), with more intense shorter-duration events under p50 conditions. For example, the current 100 year 24 h IDF storm is expected to occur more frequently, decreasing to a 27–49 year return period by the 2050s and a 10–40 year return period by the 2080s. Annual average snow depth is projected to decline by 21%–73% (2050s) and 24%–89% (2080s) under p50 conditions. These findings highlights that water management in Canada’s mining regions is set to face escalating hydrological changes under a changing climate. Effective management strategies are therefore essential to prevent intensified environmental and social risks."

Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is being considered to enhance the ocean’s capacity as an atmospheric carbon sink. It is widely recognised that responsible development and deployment of marine-based CDR requires effective engagement with local stakeholders. This article considers how stakeholders could actively participate in OAE, enhancing their agency and identifying pathways to incorporate their skills and knowledge into research and deployment activities. Adopting a place-based approach in Tasmania, Australia, we interviewed 23 participants and asked them how they might contribute to future OAE activities in/around this island state. Participants saw themselves contributing to one or more activity-based themes: knowledge creation, regulatory oversight, safeguarding values, and/or stakeholder networking. While some responses were predictable (i.e. government representatives adopting regulatory roles), others were unexpected, highlighting the importance of proactively engaging with stakeholders. Several participants identified the need for further support to effectively perform their roles, including expert advice and access to resources. Capacity assessments can evaluate the ability of local stakeholders to play an active role in OAE activities and thus inform strategies to bolster capacity through learning and infrastructure development. We recommend integrating capacity assessments into OAE/marine CDR stakeholder engagement strategies. Further research is needed to develop and implement capacity assessments for OAE and other marine CDR approaches."

Scholars have been calling for techno-ecological synergies that minimizing unintended environmental consequences; however, empirical evidence is largely missing in the existing literature. Taking the world’s largest photovoltaic (PV) power plant as a demonstration, combining remote sensing images with field data, we actively used the spatiotemporal dynamic analysis, gross ecosystem products accounting method and statistical analysis methods to show techno-ecological synergies for electricity generation and ecological recovery. Specifically, our analyses reveal that (1) PV panels reduced surface albedo. The albedo of three broad spectral bands decreased by >15% in PV area; (2) comparing to areas between and outside the PV areas, areas under the PV panels enhanced vegetation cover by 61.86% (absolute coverage of 38.22%) and 131.80% (absolute coverage of 56.86%), unit area above-ground biomass by 133.71% (119 g) and 235.48% (146 g), and plant height by 31.02% (17.36 cm) and 45.58% (22.96 cm), respectively. Nevertheless, PV panels exerted a negative impact on soil organic matter but did not significantly affect other soil and vegetation indicators (i.e. soil water content, vegetation nitrogen content, and vegetation biodiversity, etc); and (3) PV panels improved ecosystem services. Specifically, from 2010 to 2020, among the four ecosystem regulating services, carbon sequestration and oxygen release increased by 178.46% (70.92 t km−2 and 51.58 t km−2), sand fixation by 13.76% (3920.19 t km−2), and soil retention by 4.16% (467.02 t km−2), respectively. Our study demonstrates a potentially sustainable mode in desert areas that supports vertical multiple land uses, improves the surface ecological environment while harnesses solar energy. With better understanding and management of the coupled human-natural energy systems, including the light allocation between PV panels, the selection of appropriate vegetation types beneath panels, and effective management, it is promising that there will be more techno-ecological synergies worldwide."

Previous studies have discussed whether such multimodality is evidence of alternative stable states, which would indicate that tropical forests may irreversibly transition to a savanna-like state when deforestation and climate forcing reach a tipping point. However, doubts have been raised regarding this interpretation. Alternative hypotheses invoke heterogeneous environmental conditions related to soil properties, climate parameters beyond MAP, or human activity. Here, we explore the possibility that the influence of multiple environmental parameters can create multimodality in monostable systems when projected onto one dimension. We show that this situation can indeed occur, even if the system’s only equilibrium state depends monotonically on the parameters, and even if the parameter values have Gaussian distributions. Such a situation would imply that tree cover may respond linearly to forcing, without any abrupt behavior, regardless of multiple peaks in the tree cover distribution. However, when considering ecologically more realistic parameterizations of tree cover, as used in process-based vegetation models, we find that multiple tree cover modes are more difficult to obtain in the absence of alternative stable states. The reason is that environmental conditions do not affect tree cover directly and independently from each other, but indirectly by affecting tree productivity and mortality. Consequently, a coexistence of forest and savanna in these models is only possible when imposing environmental parameters that are bimodal themselves. Motivated by this finding, we analyze the observed distribution of several relevant environmental parameters in South America, and find that none of them suggests a multi-modal tree cover distribution. Our results hence emphasize that possible tipping dynamics are a concern, but also call for improved estimates of tropical tree cover distribution and the role of fire-vegetation interactions."

Here we show this feasibility using neural general circulation model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can generate 100 simulation days in ∼8 min with a single graphics processing unit while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July–November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990–2023 (r = ∼0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observed sub-basin TC tracks (p < 0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) (p < 0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions."

Spatiotemporal evidence from Chinese cities,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a critical enabler of climate mitigation. However, its spatial and temporal impacts remain insufficiently understood. Using balanced panel data from 279 Chinese cities (2006–2019), this study examines how AI (measured by robot adoption) affects carbon emission intensity. We apply the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model to uncover heterogeneous impacts. The results indicate that AI significantly reduces carbon emission intensity, thus contributing to climate mitigation. Nonetheless, the magnitude of this effect varies substantially across cities. The mitigation benefits are more pronounced in cities with limited natural resources, those located within the five major economic zones, and non-traditional industrial centers. These patterns reflect the presence of a ‘natural resource curse’ in resource-rich cities and a ‘social resource blessing’ in socially advantaged regions. The GTWR results further reveal pronounced spatial disparities, with eastern cities experiencing greater reductions in carbon intensity than those in the west. Over time, this spatial imbalance has been narrowing, indicating a gradual convergence in AI’s climate mitigation effects. These findings underscore the importance for regionally differentiated AI development strategies and policy interventions to reduce spatial inequities in mitigation capacity. The study provides robust empirical evidence from China, offering new insights into AI’s potential to support equitable and effective climate action on a global scale."

In this study, the spring precursors of Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño are investigated using a multivariable linear inverse model that incorporates sea surface temperature (SST), zonal wind stress (Taux), and thermocline depth. The results reveal distinct precursors for the two event types: EP El Niño events are preceded by westerly wind anomalies centered east of the dateline, along with widespread thermocline deepening across the CP and EP, indicating the dominance of the subsurface processes. These westerly wind anomalies excite downwelling equatorial Kelvin waves, which propagate eastward and deepen the thermocline in the EP, subsequently inducing positive SST anomalies (SSTAs). In contrast, the precursors of CP El Niño are characterized by westward-displaced Taux anomalies, together with SSTAs extending westward along the equator and southwestward from the Baja California toward the equator, reflecting the leading role of surface ocean-atmosphere feedback in the early development stage. Among the three variables examined, Taux consistently emerges as the influential precursor for both event types, with the zonal displacement of spring westerly anomalies critically modulating the location and intensity of subsequent SST amplification and ultimately determining the type of El Niño that develops. This study systematically compares the spring precursors of CP and EP El Niño events and highlights the diagnostic importance of Taux anomalies, providing new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying ENSO diversity."

These two forms of access are deeply interconnected: for instance, cropland ownership often determines who can access and control groundwater. Due to data challenges, however, few studies have quantified groundwater access inequality in the same ways that land ownership has been quantified. Similarly, the regional scale of most analyses to date limits our understanding of factors that shape and modify these interconnections. Our study aims to address this gap by constructing a novel geospatial dataset by matching groundwater wells with cropland parcels across California’s Central Valley. We quantify the magnitude and spatial patterns of groundwater and cropland inequality and examine how it scales with land ownership, crop types, and surface water access. Our results indicate substantial inequality in both groundwater access and land ownership, with the top decile of well owners possessing 46.4% of the region’s total well capacity. These well owners are more likely to allocate groundwater to high-revenue, water-intensive perennials such as almonds and walnuts. Furthermore, large landholders tend to have far more wells, deeper and higher-capacity wells, and greater access to surface water resources. However, we observe consistently wider inequality in land ownership than water access, and larger landowners possess less well depth and capacity per hectare.

Hartogensis,The spatiotemporal evolution of atmospheric boundary layers over a thermally heterogeneous landscape,"Using observations and high-resolution turbulence modeling, we examine the influence of irrigation-driven surface heterogeneity on the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). We use a multi-scale approach for characterizing surface heterogeneity to explore how its influence on the ABL within a grid cell would change with higher-resolution models. We find that the height of the ABL is variable across short distances and that the surface heterogeneity is felt least strongly in the middle of the ABL. 
 We study the diurnal variability in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) across spatial scales (between ∼100 m and ∼10 km) of irrigation-driven surface heterogeneity in the semi-arid landscape of the 2021 Land surface Interactions with the Atmosphere over the Iberian Semi-arid Environment (LIAISE) experiment on the northeastern Iberian Peninsula. We combine observational analysis with explicit simulation of the ABL using observationally driven large-eddy simulation (LES) to better understand the physical mechanisms controlling ABL dynamics in heterogeneous regions. Our choice of spatial scales represents current and future single grid cells of global models, demonstrating how the sources and magnitude of subgrid-scale heterogeneity vary with model resolution.There is an observed positive buoyancy flux over the irrigated fields driven primarily by moisture fluxes, whereas, over the non-irrigated fields, there is a classical buoyancy profile driven by the surface sensible heat flux. The surface heterogeneity is felt most strongly near the surface; however, at approximately 1000 m above the surface, there appears to be a blending zone of mean scalars (i.e., potential temperature and specific humidity), indicating that the heterogeneity mixes into a new mean state of the atmosphere. There is a stable internal boundary layer (IBL; as defined as the first stable layer in individual radiosonde potential temperature profiles) up to approximately 500 m over the irrigated area. Taking advantage of the spatiotemporal extent of LES results, we perform spectral analyses to find that the ABL height had an integral length scale of ∼800 m matching that of the imposed surface fluxes. Between the irrigated and non-irrigated areas, there is an adjustment of the ABL as it crosses the boundary up to 500 m upwind of the boundary. We observe a variable-dependent blending zone between scales in the middle of the ABL, but it is limited by the entrainment zone effectively introducing another source of heterogeneity driven by upper-atmosphere conditions."

Compared with the insignificant difference in decomposed Xn-DBPs, the average number of additionally formed Xn-DBPs for AA was significantly lower than that for SS (31 ± 18 versus 67 ± 35) at their optimum doses. The decomposition and additional formation caused by three reductive quenchers on the characterization of Xn-DBPs and their precursors followed the order: AA < STS < SS. Moreover, TMB was recommended to quench residual chlorine for one hour at the quencher-to-residual chlorine molar ratio of 2.00 because of its advantages in avoiding the decomposition of redox-sensitive Xn-DBPs and additional formation of Xn-DBPs by ESI(−)-FT-ICR MS, while exhibiting insignificant impacts on the overall molecular characteristics of DOM.

Notably, UV-328, UV-329, UV-234, and UV-P occur at elevated concentrations, with air and dust being the most contaminated media (even reaching levels ng/g to μg/g dw). Toxicological studies demonstrate that BUVs induce multifaceted biotoxicity, including endocrine toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Endocrine toxicity is the most extensively characterized effect. Moreover, BUVs disrupt critical human physiological processes and impair plant photosynthesis. Biotoxicity is mediated through molecular mechanisms: AHR pathway, ER/ERR activation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis. Among the BUVs, toxic mechanisms of UV-P, UV-234, UV-329, and UV-326 have been studied comprehensively. Notably, UV-P shows the highest estrogenic activity. While current environmental risks are assessed as low to moderate, future ecological disturbances are plausible due to intensifying anthropogenic pressures or bioaccumulation.

The results show that in summer and equinoxes, the peak midday auroral intensity enhances by 11%–19% from non‐favorable conditions, when ϕ $\phi $ favors tail lobe reconnection in each hemisphere. Larger absolute and relative difference also occurred in the polar cap, especially in summer. We propose that these ϕ $\phi $ effects contribute to stronger midday auroral intensity due to lobe reconnection, which are associated with special Bx polarities (i.e., Bx < 0 and Bx > 0 in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively). In addition, when favorable ϕ $\phi $ (or Bx) condition occurs in one hemisphere, we find no evident midday aurora enhancement in the conjugate hemisphere in statistics.

Further analysis reveals that relative humidity and wind speed exert opposing influences on raindrop microphysical processes, with coalescence favored in humid monsoon environments and breakup intensified within typhoon outer rainbands. By incorporating empirical relationships between these two environmental factors and microphysical processes, we derive observational constraints that significantly reduce biases in near‐surface rainfall estimates.

In general, the seasonal trends in both concentrations and isotopic composition of NO3− are weaker at GWS than at ZS. The seasonal variations in δ15N‐NO3− at both sites suggest shifts in the main sources of NO3−. During the light period (October–April), δ15N‐NO3− is significantly lower at ZS than at GWS, indicating a primary origin of NO3− from snow nitrogen oxides emissions driven by NO3− photolysis. In contrast, midlatitude tropospheric transport and oceanic emissions of alkyl nitrates may play a prominent role at GWS. In the dark period (May–September), stratospheric inputs persist for a shorter time at GWS than at ZS, resulting in lower δ15N‐NO3− at GWS. Oxygen isotopes (δ18O and Δ17O) in precipitation NO3− are also higher during the dark period than during the light period at both sites. In the light period, NO3− production is mainly influenced by hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals at GWS, resulting in lower δ18O‐ and Δ17O‐NO3− values than at ZS, where ozone (O3) plays a more important role in NO3− formation. In the dark period, significantly higher oxygen isotopic values of NO3− at ZS than at GWS suggest the more important role of O3, especially stratospheric O3, on NO3− production at ZS.

In this study, we performed regional simulations to evaluate the effects of 3‐dimensional spatially distributed SHPs (3D SHPs) on Noah‐MP‐simulated hydrological fluxes. The simulations were conducted at a 3‐hourly and 0.1° resolution from 1981 to 2018 over mainland China. Compared with the default lookup table soil parameters, the use of 3D SHPs enhanced not only the accuracy of the simulated runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) but also the ability of Noah‐MP to reliably characterize the spatial patterns and vertical interactions of soil moisture in various climate zones. Moreover, 3D SHPs increase the mean Kling‐Gupta efficiency (KGE) for runoff (from 0.32 to 0.67) and ET (from 0.65 to 0.74) and decrease the mean root mean square error (RMSE) (from 0.067 to 0.037) for surface soil moisture (SSM) in these climate zones.

Early warning is crucial for disaster risk management about HW onsets. Land surface conditions are key to HW onsets. However, few studies have investigated which specific land surface features are more likely to cause HW onsets. Here, we investigate this issue by exploring the land surface conditions more favorable for HW onsets over the Yangtze River Valley using the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameters (CNOP‐P) approach. The numerical results indicate that CNOP‐P type land surface conditions are the most favorable for HW onsets compared to random types. Surface energy partitioning is primarily influenced by CNOP‐P type surface conditions, which lead to more energy release in the form of sensible heat fluxes. Vegetation is a key factor influencing HW occurrence, as it significantly affects surface energy partitioning by regulating vegetation transpiration. In addition, individual results also show that soil evaporation processes also have an important role in HW onsets. More importantly, the increase in shortwave radiative fluxes due to reduced cloudiness and increased 500 hPa geopotential height provide more favorable conditions for HW onsets. Compared to CNOP‐P type conditions, RP type conditions have less influence on surface energy, moisture, and atmospheric circulation, making it difficult to create conditions conducive to HW onsets.

We find an annual average of four ISACs impacting the Arctic: 52.3% form in mid‐latitude regions, and 90.9% reach peak intensity after intruding into the polar region. The frequency of ISACs show no significant trend from 1980 to 2022, whereas the duration of ISACs maintaining extreme intensity in the polar region increases significantly by 2.7 hr per decade. Before peak development phase, the ISACs develop similarly to mid‐latitude cyclones. Upper‐level warm temperature advection, mid‐level positive vorticity advection and diabatic heating (DIA) collectively enhance near‐surface vorticity. Adiabatic cooling throughout the troposphere induced by strong upward motion acts as a counterforce. During their intersection with upper‐level tropopause polar vortices (TPVs), ISACs exhibit a more pronounced and sustained vertical structure than that of mid‐latitude cyclones. Such structure of ISACs is characterized by a stratospheric warm core due to adiabatic heating and descent, and a tropospheric cold core resulting from adiabatic cooling and a lack of convective DIA. After ISACs overlap with TPVs, the upper‐level circulation of ISACs can be sustained after the peak development phase. Compared to mid‐latitude cyclones, the persistence of the upper‐level circulation and interactions between ISACs with TPVs are found in this study to be a key factor contributing to the extended lifetime of ISACs."

Ashton,From Coastal Retreat to Seaward Growth: Emergent Behaviors From Paired Community Beach Nourishment Choices,"Coastal communities often address shoreline erosion through beach nourishment, adding externally sourced sand to widen beaches for recreation and property protection. While nourishment enhances beachfront property values, the need for periodic maintenance creates interdependencies where the actions of neighboring communities affect local shoreline dynamics. Using a coupled model of two neighboring communities, we examine the interplay between community nourishment decisions and the redistribution of nourishment sand. We find that the value a community places on wider beaches not only influences their propensity to nourish, but also their and their neighbors' nourishment efficiency and net benefits. Communities that nourish more frequently tend to have lower nourishment efficiency, as sand is redistributed alongshore, benefiting less‐active neighbors at their expense. A 20‐year New Jersey case study confirms that communities that nourish more have lower nourishment efficiencies, including instances where less wealthy communities nourish significantly more, enabling wealthier neighbors to enjoy higher efficiencies—suggesting that such dynamics may already be shaping real‐world coastal outcomes. In future scenarios, we simulate the effects of rising sand costs and accelerated erosion due to sea‐level rise under coordinated and non‐coordinated planning methods, finding that less wealthy communities experience a higher risk of beachfront property loss under non‐coordination, exacerbating disparities in coastal management.

Here, authors show such variability is underpinned by specific transcriptomic and chemoarchitectural signatures, thereby supporting neurocognitive specialization. 
 The relationship between brain structure and function, known as structural-functional coupling (SFC), is highly dynamic. However, the temporal variability of this relationship, referring to the fluctuating extent to which functional profiles interact with anatomy over time, remains poorly elucidated. Here, we propose a framework to quantify SFC temporal variability and determine its neurocognitive map, genetic architecture, and neurochemical basis in 1206 healthy human participants. Results reveal regional heterogeneity in SFC variability and a composite emotion dimension co-varying with variability patterns involving the dorsal attention, somatomotor, and visual networks. The transcriptomic signatures of SFC variability are enriched in synapse- and cell cycle-related biological processes and implicated in emotion-related disorders. Moreover, regional densities of serotonin, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and opioid systems are predictive of SFC variability across the cortex. Collectively, SFC variability mapping provides a biologically plausible framework for understanding how SFC fluctuates over time to support macroscale neurocognitive specialization.

By exploring device fatigue mechanisms, the authors develop an interface design strategy that regulates defect movement in films, improving its overall reliability performance. 
 Due to traits of CMOS compatibility and scalability, HfO2-based ferroelectric ultrathin films are promising candidates for next-generation low-power memory devices. However, their commercialization has been hindered by reliability issues, with fatigue failure being a major impediment. Here, we report superior ferroelectric performances with fatigue-free behavior in interface-designed Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based ultrathin heterostructures. A coherent CeO2-x/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 heterointerface is constructed, wherein the oxygen-active, multivalent CeO2-x acts as an “oxygen sponge”, capable of reversibly accepting and releasing oxygen ions. This design effectively alleviates defect aggregation at the electrode-ferroelectric interface and reduces coercive field, enabling improved switching characteristics and exceptional reliability. Further, a symmetric capacitor architecture is designed to minimize the imprint, thereby suppressing the oriented oxygen defect drift. The two-pronged technique prevents intense fluctuations of oxygen concentration within the device during electrical cycling, suppressing the formation of paraelectric phase and polarization degradation. The interfacial design technique ensures superior switching and cycling performances of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 capacitors, embodying a fatigue-free feature exceeding 1011 switching cycles and an endurance lifetime surpassing 1012 cycles, along with excellent temperature stability and long retention. These findings pave the way for the development of high-performance and ultra-stable hafnia-based ferroelectric devices.

Here, the authors report that tunnel-type iridium oxide concentrates activity at tunnel mouths, enabling high performance at low catalyst loading. 
 Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers face challenges due to high iridium loading and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics when using conventional rutile-structured iridium oxide nanocatalysts. Here we find that iridium oxide catalysts with a specific tunnel-type crystal structure exhibit highly localized reactivity, where regions at tunnel mouths drive oxygen evolution far more efficiently than tunnel-wall regions. The intrinsic activity of tunnel mouths is 25-fold higher than that of tunnel walls, with shorter nanorods achieving a better balance between active site exposure and electron/mass transport efficiency. When implemented in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers, this engineered catalyst achieves notable performance at low iridium loading (0.28 mgIr cm−2), delivering over 2.0 A cm−2 at 1.8 V (80 °C) and operating stably for 1800 h—notably outperforming conventional catalysts. Our work identifies catalytic hotspots in tunnel-structured oxides and demonstrates their rational integration into high-performance, durable electrolyzer systems.

Here, the authors show that erythroid proliferative capacity can be vastly increased by BMI1 overexpression, which regulates erythroid self-renewal through both gene repression and activation. 
 The limited proliferative capacity of erythroid precursors is a major obstacle to generate sufficient in vitro-derived red blood cells for clinical purposes. While BMI1, a Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 member, is both necessary and sufficient to drive extensive proliferation of self-renewing erythroblasts, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here we report that BMI1 overexpression leads to 10 billion-fold increase in self-renewal of human erythroblasts, which can terminally mature and agglutinate with typing reagent monoclonal antibodies. BMI1 and RING1B occupancy, along with repressive histone marks, are present at known BMI1 target genes, including the INK-ARF locus, consistent with altered cell cycle kinetics following BMI1 inhibition. Upregulation of BMI1 target genes with low repressive histone modifications, including key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, along with functional studies, suggest that both cholesterol import and synthesis are essential for BMI1-associated self-renewal. We conclude that BMI1 regulates erythroid self-renewal not only through gene repression but also through gene activation and offer a strategy to expand immature erythroid precursors for eventual clinical uses.

Here, the authors report stable, microsecond-long spin lifetimes in rubrene single crystals due to the rapid transient localization of charge carriers. 
 Field-induced electron spin resonance provides valuable insights into the interplay between spin and charge dynamics in organic semiconductors. We apply this technique to ion-gel-gated capacitors and conventional field-effect transistors to study the temperature-dependent carrier dynamics of high-mobility rubrene single-crystals. Unlike previous measurements on other molecular and polymer semiconductors, we observe remarkably long spin relaxation times—on the order of microseconds—persisting from room temperature down to 15 K. Such long relaxation times are caused by the rapid transient-localization motion of charge carriers, which induces efficient motional narrowing. Additionally, by leveraging the high injection efficiency of ion-gel-gated devices, we observe spin lifetimes shortening at high carrier concentrations. This is attributed to emerging spin-spin dipolar interactions and can be modelled using an approach adapted from fluid-phase nuclear magnetic resonance. Our work demonstrates that field-induced electron spin resonance provides a powerful probe of the transient-localization physics of high-mobility molecular crystals. Spin relaxation in organic semiconductors is normally strongly correlated with temperature, varying over many orders of magnitude from 4 K to 300 K.

 The direct oxidation of methane into methanol exploiting O2 as oxidant offers an ideal route for methane utilization. Although the reaction is strongly preferred in thermodynamics, conventional catalytic systems always demand intense energy input like high temperatures or high-energy photons (>2.8 eV) to conquer the large kinetic barrier in the conversion process. In this study, we demonstrate that by creation of a suitable plasmonic photocatalyst, namely oxygen-vacancy-rich CuSeO3-x, the low-energy near-infrared (NIR) photons can serve as the sole energy input to complete CH4-to-CH3OH conversion with remarkable activity (Apparent quantum yield of 1.5% at 800 nm with Au cocatalyst) and near unity selectivity (ca. 96%) at 25 °C. Such fascinating performance is attributed to a small activation energy measured at 0.28 eV, enabled by the existence of CuII-Ov species in CuSeO3-x. Our study suggests that the ensemble of CuII-Ov constitutes an exceptional active site, which can harness the plasmon-induced hot electrons and meantime brings a kinetically advantageous route for reducing O2 into •OH radicals greatly favoring methane activation.

 Flood insurance could mitigate the negative shock from climate-induced disasters, yet many households are still not covered. Here, using data on expected flood damage and National Flood Insurance Program policies, we provide estimates of annual flood risk protection gaps and underinsurance among single-family residences in the contiguous USA. Annually, 70% (US$17.1 billion) of total flood losses would be uninsured. Underinsurance, defined as protection gaps among properties whose current coverage is under the optimal level, totals US$15.7 billion annually. Among at-risk households, 88% are underinsured and average underinsurance is US$7,208 per year. Underinsurance persists both inside and outside the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s special flood hazard areas, suggesting frictions in the provision of risk information and regulatory compliance. Underinsurance falls disproportionately on low-income communities. At least 70% of at-risk households would benefit from purchasing flood insurance, even as prevailing prices rise.

 Achieving carbon neutrality is a critical yet elusive goal for many cities, hindered by limited understanding of the relationship between building emissions and their surroundings. To address this challenge, we present a generalizable open science framework that integrates building energy-consumption data, multi-modal geospatial inputs and graph deep learning to quantify building operating emissions and their links to urban form and socio-economic factors. Applying this approach to five cities with diverse climates and planning contexts—Melbourne, New York City (Manhattan), Seattle, Singapore and Washington DC—we demonstrate that our models explain 78.4% of the variation in building operating carbon emissions across cities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for urban-scale energy modelling. Our findings reveal strong connections between a city’s planning history and its building carbon profile, alongside stark inequalities where wealthier areas often exhibit the highest per capita emissions. Additionally, the relationship between urban density and building emissions is complex and city specific, with emissions extending beyond dense urban cores into suburban areas. To design effective decarbonization strategies, cities must consider how their planning histories, urban layouts and economic conditions shape current emissions patterns. Cutting emissions from urban buildings is difficult without clear knowledge of how they result from urban design and social factors.

 Large-scale removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is required to meet net-zero targets. Enhanced rock weathering, in which crushed silicate minerals are spread on cropland soils, is a promising approach, but the logistics of its supply chain are poorly understood. Here, we use a numerical spatio-temporal allocation model that links potential rock extraction sites in the United Kingdom with croplands, modelling deployment pathways over the period 2025–2070. We find that expanding individual quarries (up to 20 times larger than the current average) and prioritising supply timing and location can increase carbon-removal efficiency by 20%, cut transport demand by 60% and reduce the number of operating quarries four-fold, while enabling up to 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide removal by 2070. However, these large sites may face stronger local opposition and planning challenges, underscoring the critical role of policy in enabling feasible deployment.

 The phase coherence of radar signals makes synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis prone to significant challenges. Echo signal interference introduces speckle noise during imaging; noise appears as random fluctuations in pixel intensities. Besides, coherence exacerbates geometric distortions, complicating the accurate interpretation of spatial distributions within intricate geographic entities, thereby making it difficult to extract meaningful target information from SAR images. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces the DEcomposed-frequency PrOjection Network (Depo-Net), a segmentation-oriented model that mitigates SAR-specific interference through frequency-domain self-attention. It employs a dual-encoder structure for efficient semantic extraction and integrates Spatio-Frequency Synergistic Modulation (SFSM) to minimize speckle noise while maintaining structural integrity in the frequency domain. Additionally, the Harmonized Subspace Spectro-Temporal Attention (HSSTA) synthesizes Discrete Fourier and Wavelet Transform analyses to capture complex spatial correlations among geographic features. To mitigate noise amplification during decoding, the Pluri-frequency Mamba (purfMamba) module synergizes multi-dimensional spectral-spatial features, facilitating noise suppression during high-resolution restoration and maintaining a balance between global structure and local details. Results on three public SAR segmentation datasets demonstrate Depo-Net’s efficacy outperforming 22 previous State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods while minimizing 95th Percentile Hausdorff Distance values.

 Aerosols, through their direct, semi-direct, and indirect interactions with radiation, play a crucial role in Earth's climate. This study focuses on elevated aerosol layers (EALs) in the free troposphere over Eastern India. Using a decade (2013–2023) of spaceborne lidar measurements of aerosol-type-specific extinction coefficient profiles, we examine the occurrence, vertical distribution, extent, and spatial and seasonal variations of various EAL types. Our findings reveal the persistent presence of EALs, primarily consisting of dust and continental aerosols, throughout the year. These layers show their highest occurrence—exceeding by an order of magnitude—during the pre-monsoon season. EAL heights exhibit limited seasonal variation, with the highest elevations observed during the monsoon season (3.6–4.1 km), followed by the pre-monsoon (3.3–4.0 km), winter seasons (3.3–3.6 km) and post-monsoon (3.2–3.5 km). Substantial spatial variations in EAL characteristics are apparent across the study domain in all seasons, likely due to region-specific sources of EALs, as supported by Lagrangian back-trajectory analysis. By analyzing meteorological datasets, we demonstrate that days with EAL observations are associated with negative anomalies in lower-tropospheric stability and precipitation, and positive anomalies in outgoing longwave radiation (indicative of shallow or no convection), compared to days without EALs. These findings suggest a significant role for atmospheric stability and precipitation in controlling EAL variations. This study highlights the potential of height-resolved lidar measurements for accurately quantifying the type, occurrence, and vertical extent of EALs."

 As a strong upper-tropospheric easterly jet stream over the Afro-Australian monsoon region, the tropical easterly jet (TEJ) originates from the meridional thermal contrast between the Asian landmass, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in particular, and the tropical Indian Ocean in boreal summer. Here, we find that the atmospheric heat source anomaly over the southeastern TP can induce an opposite response of the upper-tropospheric zonal wind over the western Pacific, where the TEJ usually inflows and manifests as the double easterly jets. Positive TP heating anomaly could accelerate the northern branch of double easterly jets and decelerate the southern one, and vice versa. Two pathways linking the TP heating and the TEJ are proposed. First, positive heat forcing over the southeastern TP can directly induce the easterly responses over the South Asia by the thermal wind which is mainly determined by the changed meridional temperature gradient. The associated easterly response significantly accelerates the northern part of the TEJ. The other pathway suggests that the TP heating will indirectly modulate the southern branch of double easterly jets by changing the thermal condition over the western North Pacific (WNP). The negative WNP heat anomaly exerts a pair of upper-level cyclones straddling the equator with anomalous westerly in between, primarily decelerating the south branch of the double easterly jets over the Maritime Continent. Our findings suggest the TP heating anomaly significantly influences the upper-tropospheric TEJ, especially the double jets in its inflow region, advancing understanding of the TEJ variability and the Asian summer monsoon dynamics."

 Data merging is widely applied to improve large-scale precipitation estimates. However, traditional merging algorithms rely heavily on gauge observations and suffer from increased uncertainties in data-sparse regions. Statistical uncertainty analysis (SUA) offers a potential solution by estimating merging weights analytically and thereby reducing dependence on gauge data. However, the comparative effectiveness of SUA-merged and traditional gauge-merged precipitation datasets remains unclear, largely due to the scarcity of truly independent validation data. Here, using 268 wholly independent rain gauges, we show that SUA-based merging can effectively suppress random errors and outperform remote sensing and reanalysis products. Notably, compared to traditional gauge-merged datasets, SUA-merged precipitation demonstrates averagely stronger correlation with independent observations and lower root-mean-square errors. These results provide direct evidence for the ability of SUA to mitigate reliance on gauge data, especially in observation-scarce regions. However, SUA-merged products still show limitations with regards to accurately classifying rain/no-rain events, highlighting the need for future enhancements targeting false precipitation detection."

 Existing findings regarding the impacts of aerosol concentrations on fog are inconsistent and have primarily focused on the influence of low aerosol levels. In this study, the effects of high aerosol levels on fog were investigated using the WRF-Chem model to assess the extent to which aerosol levels affect fog in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that liquid water content (LWC), fog duration, and fog-top heights all increased nonlinearly with increasing aerosol concentrations, exhibiting a high growth rate when PM2.5 concentration was below 200 μg m−3, and gradually leveling off thereafter. However, when PM2.5 concentration exceeded 427 μg m−3, LWC, fog duration, and fog-top height all rapidly decreased with increasing aerosol concentrations, due to suppressing effect induced by aerosol-radiation interaction (ARI) overweighed promoting effect of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) on fog. Meanwhile, excessive cloud condensation nuclei suppressed fog through the intense competitions for vapor and the evaporation of smaller droplets. The results suggested that a PM2.5 concentration in the range of 395–427 μg m−3 is the critical threshold that suppressed fog in the NCP, and current pollution levels remain below this threshold. In addition, we analyzed the individual effects of ARI, ACI, black carbon (BC) and non-BC aerosols on fog under current pollution level. The results suggested that ARI effect played a dominant role during the fog–haze episode, while the effect of ACI on fog was negligible. Furthermore, the results showed that BC played a leading role in fog formation."

 Pre-existing tropical disturbances often serve as a precursor to tropical cyclone (TC) formation. However, a very small percentage of these disturbances turn up as TCs, depending on the environmental conditions. Disturbances that remain non-developed throughout their lifespan have very similar characteristics to the disturbances that develop as a TC. Therefore, it is important to comprehend the environmental factors responsible for transforming tropical disturbances into tropical cyclones. In this study, we analyzed the environmental conditions surrounding the disturbance vortex, as well as the structural evolution of the vortices during the pre-genesis stage, for two non-developing and two developing disturbances (which later evolved into different categories) over the Bay of Bengal. The analysis was conducted using output data from the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model, blackbody temperature observations from INSAT-3D, and daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature analysis data. All the disturbances processed over the Indian Ocean warm pool region where the sea surface temperature (SST) was above the threshold of TC genesis. However, the SST anomaly was negative ahead of the non-developing disturbance and positive for the developing disturbances. The main characteristics of the developing disturbances that differed from the non-developing disturbance are the upright structure of the vortex with undistorted vortex core from the dry air intrusion, larger area coverage of cold cloud top with persistent cyclonically spiral cloud bands centred at the vortex core, and the extension of the strong ascending region over time. The intensity of low-level vorticity was unable to identify the developing potential of the disturbances. The synchronous incremental variation of the kinetic energy density of primary and secondary circulations and the vertical helicity in the developing disturbances was helpful for their sustainability."

 Near-real-time precipitation products (NRTs) with high spatiotemporal resolution and short latency time are widely used for flood monitoring, forecasting, and warning, but they are vulnerable to various biases, such as missed events and false alarms. Precipitation merging offer a promising solution to mitigate such uncertainties. However, how to effectively improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates and the ability to detect different intensity events, especially heavy precipitation that triggers floods, remains a critical challenge. This study presents a novel stepwise machine learning (SML) model, which consists of a precipitation intensity classification sub-model and a precipitation segmentation regression sub-model, to improve both precipitation identification and estimation accuracy. The model integrates three NRTs (PERSIANN-CCS, GSMaP-NRT-Gauge, and IMERG-Early) using rain gauges as a reference for data merging, covering the period from 2003 to 2017 across seven flood-prone basins in China. Additionally, the spatial autocorrelation and effectiveness distribution of the NRTs, along with multiple environment variables, are incorporated into the model inputs to further improve the merged product. The merged results, referred to as SML fusion, show significant improvements compared to the original NRTs and the basic machine learning (ML) fusion: (1) SML fusion outperforms all original NRTs in both statistical and categorical metrics, substantially reducing temporal and spatial biases. The median improvements in Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE’) and critical success index (CSI) are 62.13 %, 35.85 %, and 10.17 %, respectively; (2) Incorporating spatial autocorrelation and effectiveness distribution notably enhances the accuracy and detection capability of the merged product, with spatial autocorrelation proving to be a critical factor; and (3) The SML model effectively addresses the instability of the basic ML model, reducing overestimation of light precipitation and underestimation of heavy precipitation. This study provides a timely and robust strategy for improving the detection accuracy of NRTs under complex climatic and topographic conditions, and has potential implications for flood forecasting and hazard assessments in areas where near-real gauge observations are sparse."

We identified the action of SDHAF2 protein, a complex II assembly factor, as critical for metabolic adaptation during complex III dysfunction in HEK293T cells. SDHAF2 loss during complex III inhibition led to a net reductive TCA cycle from loss of succinate oxidation, loss of SDHA active site–derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, insufficient glycolytic adaptation, and a severe growth impairment. Glycolysis adapted cells, however, did not accumulate SDHAF2 upon Q-pool stress, exhibited a net reductive TCA cycle and mild growth phenotypes regardless of SDHAF2 presence.

Unexpectedly, cryo–electron microscopy structures show HMGB1 bound at internal locations on nucleosomes and local DNA distortion. These sites are away from where H1 binds, explaining how HMGB1 and H1 can co-occupy a nucleosome. Our findings suggest a model where HMGB1 counteracts the effects of H1 by distorting nucleosomal DNA and disrupting interactions of the H1 carboxyl-terminal tail with DNA. Compared to mutually exclusive binding, co-occupancy by HMGB1 and H1 allows greater diversity in dynamic chromatin states.

Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition.

However, gaining an unambiguous assignment solely from this spectrum is generally not possible because amino acid–type information cannot be gleaned only from the13Cαshifts and the low resolution in the13C dimension, which is limited by the homonuclear coupling of the13Cαand13Cβnuclei. Here, super-resolution NMR is applied to the TROSY-HNCA and HNcoCA experiments, yielding pseudo-decoupling, which results in a four- to fivefold resolution enhancement in the13C dimension, essential for the assignment, which allows for straightforward assignment of proteins as large as 500 residues based on simulations."

Mitophagy, a critical process for mitochondrial quality control, is severely impaired in exhausted CD8+T cells, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We identified ubiquitin-specific protease 30 (USP30), a mitochondrial deubiquitinase that inhibits mitophagy, as a key factor up-regulated in exhausted CD8+T cells. Notably, prolonged antigen stimulation triggers the T cell receptor and nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 signaling, which drives the transcriptional up-regulation of USP30. Excitingly, our interventions targeting USP30 through genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition effectively restored mitophagy, improved mitochondrial fitness, and rejuvenated CD8+T cell effector functions. These interventions reinvigorated antitumor responses and markedly suppressed tumor growth.

Here, we report that acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) coupled with lysine acetyltransferase 7 (KAT7) modulates β-hydroxybutyrylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9bhb) to promote transcription. We show that KAT7 serves as a β-hydroxybutyryltransferase and preferably catalyzes histone Kbhb, especially H3K9bhb, in 1171 identified Kbhb substrates. ACSS2 is a BHB-CoA synthetase. This enzyme can sense cellular β-hydroxybutyrate and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to and colocalizes with KAT7 at specific locus of chromatin. The ACSS2-generated BHB-CoA can fuel KAT7 for histone H3K9bhb. We demonstrate that the β-hydroxybutyrate drives the ACSS2-KAT7-H3K9bhb axis to promote epigenetic regulation and tumor cell growth.

Our workflow is a straightforward tool for plasmonic nanoparticle design, setting their optimal dimensions for targeted applications."

Although tissue invasion is fundamentally a mechanical process, most studies have focused on the biochemical and genetic aspects of implantation. Here, we fill the gap by using a deformable ex vivo platform to visualize traction during human embryo implantation. We demonstrate that embryos apply forces remodeling the matrix with species-specific displacement amplitudes and distinct radial patterns: principal displacement directions for mouse embryos, expanding on the surface while human embryos insert in the matrix generating multiple traction foci. Implantation-impaired human embryos showed reduced displacement, as well as mouse embryos with inhibited integrin-mediated force transmission. External mechanical cues induced a mechanosensitive response, human embryos recruited myosin, and directed cell protrusions, while mouse embryos oriented their implantation or body axis toward the external cue. These findings underscore the role of mechanical forces in driving species-specific invasion patterns during embryo implantation."

However, developing catalytic systems and reagents that enable the selective activation and functionalization of specific linkages within its complex polymeric structure remains highly challenging. Here, we report a photocatalytic method for the efficient cleavage andgem-difluoroalkenylation of β-O-4 and β-1 lignin models, as well as native lignin biomass. By using α-trifluoromethyl alkenes as functionalization reagents, this protocol provides a wide array of valuablegem-difluoroalkenes through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), β-scission, radical addition, and β-F elimination processes. This redox-neutral method features operational simplicity, good functional group compatibility, and excellent selectivity. In addition, the derivatization of the resultinggem-difluorobishomoallylic alcohol highlights its synthetic potential."
