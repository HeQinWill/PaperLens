10.1088/1748-9326/ad959e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是基于自然的解决方案（NbS）在农业生态系统中的应用，以及如何利用地理空间生命周期评估和精细尺度的社会生态数据来识别NbS的机会。研究整合了生命周期评估（LCA）、生态碳储量模型和土地覆盖土地利用变化模型，以评估特定地理区域内全球变暖潜势（GWP）的速率。结果表明，农田管理的强度（如能源和化肥的使用）是人为GWP的更重要的指标，而非农田面积本身。化肥和燃料的生产过程贡献了大部分GWP，其中化肥施用后的N2O排放贡献最大。研究还强调了在实施NbS时考虑上游过程和城市化对土地利用变化的影响。总的来说，该研究展示了利用LCA和高分辨率影像进行时空和社会生态研究，从而识别和监测NbS的能力，但与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Gabriela Shirkey;Annick Anctil;Ranjeet John;Venkatesh Kolluru;Leah Mungai;Herve Kashongwe;Lauren T Cooper;Ilke Celik;Joshua B Fisher;Jiquan Chen,Identifying opportunities for nature-based solutions with geospatialized life cycle assessments and fine-scale socioecological data,"As we increasingly understand the impact that land management intensification has on local and global climate, the call for nature-based solutions (NbS) in agroecosystems has expanded. Moreover, the pressing need to determine when and where NbS should be used raises challenges to socioecological data integration as we overcome spatiotemporal resolutions. Natural and working lands is an effort promoting NbS, particularly emissions reduction and carbon stock maintenance in forests. To overcome the spatiotemporal limitation, we integrated life cycle assessments (LCA), an ecological carbon stock model, and a land cover land use change model to synthesize rates of global warming potential (GWP) within a fine-scale geographic area (30 m). We scaled National Agricultural Statistic Survey land management data to National Land Cover Data cropland extents to assess GWP of cropland management over time and among management units (i.e. counties and production systems). We found that cropland extent alone was not indicative of GWP emissions; rather, rates of management intensity, such as energy and fertilizer use, are greater indicators of anthropogenic GWP. We found production processes for fuel and fertilizers contributed 51.93% of GWP, where 33.58% GWP was estimated from N2O emissions after fertilization, and only 13.31% GWP was due to energy consumption by field equipment. This demonstrates that upstream processes in LCA should be considered in NbS with the relative contribution of fertilization to GWP. Additionally, while land cover change had minimal GWP effect, urbanization will replace croplands and forests where NbS are implemented. Fine-scale landscape variations are essential for NbS to identify, as they accumulate within regional and global estimates. As such, this study demonstrates the capability to harness both LCA and fine-resolution imagery for applications in spatiotemporal and socioecological research towards identifying and monitoring NbS."

This excess hot-extreme warming (EHEW) is particularly pronounced in the southern IEA, where extremely hot temperatures have increased twice as quickly as the summer mean warming, which itself already exceeds global-land warming by more than threefold. A quantitative analysis based on a Lagrangian temperature-anomaly equation along air-parcel backward trajectories initiated on hot days across IEA reveals that the observed EHEW is primarily attributable to increased diabatic heating, which predominantly occurs from 2 days before to the hot days. Meanwhile, changes in heat-prone synoptic-scale circulation only exert a limited influence on the excess warming. Soil drying within IEA appears to be a critical factor contributing to increased diabatic heating through soil moisture–atmosphere coupling, as it limits evaporation and enhances sensitive heat flux, thereby triggering positive soil moisture-temperature feedback. Our analysis underscores the significant impact of local soil moisture deficits on the intensified extreme heat. Urgent implementation of grassland and livestock management strategies, coupled with drought mitigation measures, is essential for adaptation and ecosystem conservation."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad975b,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中亚地区8544个湖泊和水库的储水量变化。它利用长期光学遥感数据和多源地形高程数据，从1990年到2020年，获得了这些湖泊和水库的月度储水量时间序列。研究发现，区域总储水量以每年−4.78 ± 0.88立方公里的速度下降，主要原因是咸海干涸。其他湖泊中，26%的湖泊储水量减少，22%的湖泊储水量增加。在流域尺度上，小型和中型湖泊(<5000平方公里)的长期变化主要由地表径流变化引起，而地表径流变化又受降水和温度变化的共同影响。此外，研究还发现，中亚地区29%的湖泊在过去几十年里经历了频繁的季节性干涸，这主要是由于夏季蒸发量大造成的。对于大多数(63 ± 8%)这样的湖泊，它们的蒸发水损失大于季节性储水量下降。这项研究强调了地表径流和湖泊蒸发在干旱和半干旱地区储水量损失中的共同作用。研究中使用了卫星遥感技术，例如机载或星载测高仪，以及光学遥感技术，来获取湖泊水位的变化信息，并结合其他数据分析了影响湖泊储水量变化的因素。,"['Satellite observation', 'Remote sensing', 'altimetric sensors', 'optical remote sensing', 'water storage', 'lake evaporation', 'precipitation', 'temperature']",Gang Zhao;Suxia Liu;Haoxin Deng;Qiuhong Tang;Chi Zhang;Yanan Su;Fahu Chen,Identifying drivers of storage dynamics of lakes and reservoirs in the arid Central Asia,"Knowing the storage variations in lakes and reservoirs are essential for water resources and environmental management, especially in the regions facing water scarcity. However, the quantification of the storage changes is limited by sparse in-situ observations and spatial coverage of space (air)-borne altimetric sensors that have been used conventionally in storage retrieval. This hampers the attribution analysis of lake storage changes. Here, we combined long-term optical remote sensing and multi-source terrain elevation data to derive the monthly storage time series from 1990 to 2020 for 8544 lakes and reservoirs in Central Asia, where water scarcity has been bottle-necking local socioeconomic sustainability. The regional total storage has been decreasing with a rate of −4.78 ± 0.88 km3 yr−1 mainly owing to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. For other lakes, 26% of them show decreasing while 22% show increasing trends. At a watershed-scale, the long-term changes in small to medium-sized (<5000 km2) lakes are primarily caused by the changes in surface runoff, jointly affected by precipitation and temperature changes. We also found that 29% lakes in Central Asia experienced frequent seasonal dry out in the past decades. Such seasonal dry out is mainly caused by fast evaporation losses during the summer months. For the majority (63 ± 8%) of these lakes, their evaporation water losses are larger than the seasonal storage drawdown. Our analysis highlights the co-regulation of surface runoff and lake evaporation in the storage losses in arid and semi-arid regions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad993b,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文探讨了妊娠期间空气污染（特别是PM2.5）对儿童生长发育的影响。研究利用热反演导致的空气污染水平的准随机变化作为自然实验，评估了妊娠期空气污染峰值对儿童发育迟缓的影响。结果表明，在空气质量较差的地区，尤其是在低收入社区和更年幼的儿童中，妊娠期热反演导致的空气污染加剧会增加儿童发育迟缓的可能性。研究发现，妊娠期PM2.5平均浓度每增加1 µg/m³，发育迟缓的概率平均增加4.1个百分点。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为准确的PM2.5浓度数据通常依赖于空气质量监测和卫星观测等遥感技术。研究结果强调了控制空气污染，特别是减少PM2.5浓度，对改善儿童健康和福祉的重要性。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'child health', 'air pollution', 'thermal inversions', 'stunting']",Sam Heft-Neal;Martin Philipp Heger;Vaibhav Rathi;Marshall Burke,Identifying child growth effects of elevated pollution levels during pregnancy,"Poor air quality is known to be one of the leading contributors to poor child health globally, and a wealth of evidence has linked pollution exposure during pregnancy to adverse birth and early-life outcomes. While there is some evidence pollution exposure during pregnancy is associated with slowed child growth, this evidence is largely limited to empirical settings in which it is difficult to disentangle the role of pollution from other co-varying factors. Here we rely on quasi-random variation in pollution conditions induced by thermal inversions to estimate the impact of pollution spikes during pregnancy on childhood stunting. We find that thermal inversions during pregnancy worsen air quality and increase the likelihood of childhood stunting, but only in places with poor baseline air quality and particularly for younger children and in lower-wealth communities. Our estimates imply that a 1  µg m−3 increase in average PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy increases the probability of stunting by an average of 4.1 percentage points (95% CI: 0.2–8.0). This translates to an 11.2% increase (95% CI: 0.6%–21.9%) in stunting risk from the sample baseline of 37% children stunted. Our results suggest that policies that limit baseline daily PM2.5 levels, particularly during seasons when thermal inversions are more frequent, have potential to generate meaningful improvements in long-run child outcomes."

Logging is highly selective in the region, with an average of 0.7–4.0 trees harvested per ha, but its direct impact on forest structure and the spatial variation of this impact remain understudied. Here, we investigated the direct impact of logging on forest structure, we related this impact to logging intensity and canopy opening. We compiled unique datasets collecting field measurements and aerial observations in four FSC certified concessions. Our data includes pre- and post-logging inventory of forest plots covering 38 ha, records of over 6000 harvested trees, and drone RGB images covering over 6000 ha. In average, logging activities reduced forest above-ground biomass by 8.8%, stem density by 6.5%, basal-area by 8.5% and canopy cover by 4.4%. Strong relationships were found between the reduction in biomass, stem density, or basal area with logging intensity, canopy opening and the number and volume of harvested trees (relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) between 0.128 and 0.164). Additionally, we demonstrated that canopy opening can be a good indicator to monitor and upscale logging intensity (rRMSE between 0.0005 and 0.0022). This study is the first covering extensive inventory plots and uninhabited aerial vehicle images before and after logging in different locations in Central Africa, providing a valuable reference to evaluate the impact of logging on forest structure. It demonstrates how canopy opening can be used to estimate measurements usually collected in the field and provides to the remote sensing community a unique dataset that will help improving monitoring systems (Dupuis et al 2024 (available at: https://hdl.handle.net/2268/323683)). These findings also have significant implications to control and manage logging activities, especially for certification standards, forest administrations, and European regulations."

Current performance of the GEDI Level 4 A (L4A) AGBD product is, however, subject to model choice and availability of calibration data. Here, we identified biases in the current GEDI L4A AGBD product compared to National Forest Inventory (NFI) data for the Southeast Asian country of Laos, with absolute bias values ranging from −54.24 to 106.23 Mg Ha−1 across different forest types. We optimised the GEDI L4A AGBD model configurations for natural forests in Laos and calibrated them with ancillary variables. The biases were significantly reduced (average bias reduction for all forest types = 42.2 Mg Ha−1), with the greatest reduction for the evergreen (EG) forest type. The calibrated GEDI footprints were aggregated to produce a country-wide map of AGBD for natural forests. The approach also enabled the updating of national-level estimates of average AGBD stock for each forest class in Laos using a model-assisted estimator complementary to the existing NFI design-based estimator. Results highlight the importance of localised calibration in remote sensing applications used in estimating forest biomass, and offer a replicable framework for application in other regions with limited availability of ground data and/or extensive, remote areas of forest."

However, the impact of urbanization-induced cropland encroachment on SOC remains underexplored. This study quantified SOC loss in the top 20 cm (SOC20) and 100 cm (SOC100) soil layers in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai (JZH) region from 1985 to 2019 using high-resolution land cover dataset and multi-temporal SOC maps. Our results show that the cumulative cropland encroachment area in the study area reached 18 925.65 km2, approximately three times the area of Shanghai. The encroached areas of cropland in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai accounted for 59.72%, 31.49%, and 8.79% of the total, respectively. The cumulative SOC100 loss in the JZH region was approximately 65.31 ± 32.45 Tg C, with the SOC20 loss contributing about 32.97%, emphasizing the importance of deep SOC pool. The cumulative SOC20 (SOC100) losses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai contributed approximately 55.36% (57.74%), 35.76% (31.96%), and 8.87% (10.3%) to the total losses in the JZH region, respectively. Moreover, the annual average SOC100 loss accounted for about 8.6% to 25.59% of the terrestrial carbon sink flux (11.24 Tg C yr−1) in the JZH region, emphasizing that SOC loss due to cropland encroachment cannot be overlooked when evaluating the regional carbon sink capacity. Additionally, the positive correlation between SOC loss and regional gross domestic product highlights the trade-off between economic development model of urban expansion through cropland encroachment and the resulting substantial SOC loss. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing the impacts of urbanization on regional SOC stocks, especially with regard to deep soil, and provides scientific insights for future urban planning and land management in this region."

Howell,Aerosol hygroscopicity over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season – Part 1: From the perspective of scattering enhancement​​​​​​​,"Using airborne measurements over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, we examined how much moisture aerosols take up during Africa’s biomass burning season. Our study revealed the important role of organic aerosols and introduced a predictive model for moisture uptake, accounting for organics, sulfate, and black carbon, summarizing results from various campaigns. These findings improve our understanding of aerosol–moisture interactions and their radiative effects in this climatically critical region. 
 Aerosol hygroscopicity plays a vital role in aerosol radiative forcing. One key parameter describing hygroscopicity is the scattering enhancement factor, f(RH), defined as the ratio of the scattering coefficient at humidified relative humidity (RH) to its dry value. Here, we utilize the f(80 %) from ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) 2016 and 2018 airborne measurements to investigate the hygroscopicity of aerosols, its vertical distribution, its relationship with chemical composition, and its sensitivity to organic aerosol (OA) hygroscopicity over the southeast Atlantic (SEA) Ocean during the biomass burning (BB) season.We found that aerosol hygroscopicity remains steady above 2 km, with a mean f(80 %) of 1.40 ± 0.17. Below 2 km, aerosol hygroscopicity increases with decreasing altitude, with a mean f(80 %) of 1.51 ± 0.22, consistent with higher values of BB aerosol hygroscopicity found in the literature. The hygroscopicity parameter of OA (κOA) is retrieved from the Mie model with a mean value of 0.11 ± 0.08, which is in the middle to upper range compared to the literature. Higher OA hygroscopicity is related to aerosols that are more aged, oxidized, and present at lower altitudes. The enhanced biomass burning aerosol (BBA) hygroscopicity at lower altitudes is mainly due to a lower OA fraction, increased sulfate fraction, and greater κOA at lower altitudes.We propose a parameterization that quantifies f(RH) with chemical composition and κOA based on Mie simulation of internally mixed OA–(NH4)2SO4–BC mixtures. The good agreement between the predictions and the ORACLES measurements implies that the aerosols in the SEA during the BB season can be largely represented by the OA–(NH4)2SO4–BC internal mixture with respect to the f(RH) prediction. The sensitivity of f(RH) to κOA indicates that applying a constant κOA is only suitable when the OA fraction is low and κOA shows limited variation. However, in situations deviating these two criteria, κOA can notably impact scattering coefficients and aerosol radiative effect; therefore, accounting for κOA variability is recommended."

In this study, reflectivity changes induced by glaciogenic seeding using different AgI concentrations are investigated under various conditions, and a method is developed to estimate the AgI concentration needed to detect unambiguous seeding signatures. The results aid in operational seeding-based decision-making regarding the amount of AgI dispersed. 
 Detecting an unambiguous radar reflectivity signature is vital for investigating cloud-seeding impacts. The radar reflectivity change attributed to seeding depends on both the cloud conditions and the concentration of silver iodide (AgI) particles. In this study, the reflectivity change induced by glaciogenic seeding using different AgI particle concentrations is investigated under various cloud conditions using a 1D ice growth model coupled with an AgI nucleation parameterization. In addition, an algorithm is developed to estimate the minimum AgI particle concentration needed for a measurable glaciogenic cloud-seeding signature, assuming there is sufficient supercooled liquid water. The results show that the 1D model captures the ice growth habit compared to available observations and yields an unambiguous reflectivity change that is consistent with 3D model simulations and previous observational studies. Simulations indicate that seeding at a temperature of about −15 °C has the highest probability of detecting the radar seeding signature. This finding is consistent with the fact that the seeding temperature was about −15 °C or slightly warmer in most documented cases of unambiguous seeding signatures. Using the 1D model, 2500 numerical experiments are conducted, and the outputs are used to develop a parameterization to estimate the AgI particle concentration needed to detect an unambiguous seeding signature. Application of this parameterization to a real case suggests that seeding between −21 and −11 °C may possibly produce unambiguous seeding signatures and that seeding at about −15 °C requires the lowest AgI particle concentration. Seeding at warmer temperatures in precipitating clouds requires an extremely high amount of AgI and a very high content of supercooled liquid water. The results shown in this study deepen our understanding of the relationship between AgI particle concentration and radar seeding signatures under different cloud conditions. The parameterization can be used in operational seeding-based decision-making regarding the optimal amount of AgI dispersed."

The algorithm has been successfully validated against test scenes. 
 The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission is expected to provide new insights into aerosols, clouds, and radiation. The satellite's payload includes four instruments designed to synergistically retrieve vertical profiles of clouds and aerosols, along with the atmospheric radiation data. This will enable the determination of atmospheric heating rates and top-of-atmosphere radiances and fluxes. This paper focuses on the BMA-FLX processor, specifically created, developed, and validated to retrieve thermal and solar top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes from longwave and shortwave radiances, measured along track by the EarthCARE Broad-Band Radiometer (BBR) instrument. These radiances are co-registered either at the surface or, in cloudy conditions, at the radiatively most significant vertical layer of the atmosphere (reference level). The Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) and Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID) on board EarthCARE support cloud identification, while meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts provide the surface and atmospheric necessary information. In the BMA-FLX processor, flux is estimated independently for each BBR view using different approaches for the longwave and shortwave radiances. A combined flux, derived from co-registered radiances at the reference level, is provided as the best estimate for a given scene. The radiance-to-flux conversion algorithms have been successfully validated through end-to-end verification using L1 and L2 synthetic data for three EarthCARE orbits. In general, a good agreement is found between the retrieved fluxes and the model truth, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) varying between 7 and 18 W m−2 for the solar fluxes and lower than 6 W m−2 for the thermal fluxes. The BMA-FLX's objective is to achieve radiative closure for EarthCARE with solar and thermal fluxes within 10 W m−2."

The potential surge in these occurrences threatens both human health and the Arctic ecosystem. Our ongoing research yields insights into spatial patterns and biodiversity, challenging the belief that the Arctic is unsuitable for toxic and harmful algal events. This work underscores the need to comprehend and address the ecological impact of these emerging species in the Arctic environment. 
 The Arctic Ocean is currently undergoing significant transformations due to climate change, leading to profound changes in its microbial plankton communities, including photoautotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes (i.e. phytoplankton), as well as hetero-, phago-, and mixotrophic protistan species. Among these unicellular organisms, species of potentially toxic and/or harmful algae (hereafter referred to as HA) are of particular concern, as they pose a threat to human and ecosystem health if they potentially spread into Arctic waters. Despite their importance, the spatiotemporal distribution of these communities in the North American Arctic is poorly understood. To address this gap, we compiled and synthesized a large dataset from various sources, partitioned into nine regions based on the Large Marine Ecosystem classification. Our dataset contains 385 348 georeferenced data points and 18 268 unique sampling events (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10498858, Schiffrine et al., 2024), encompassing 1442 unique taxa, with Heterokontophyta (notably diatoms) and Dinoflagellata being the most dominant phyla. Our results indicate distinct spatial patterns of diversity, with the highest diversity observed in Atlantic-influenced regions of the North American Arctic. An analysis of the maximum latitude of HA species over time shows a gradual increase, with a notable rise towards the 1990s. However, this trend is likely influenced by increased research at higher latitudes, meaning no substantial spread of HA species into the North American part of the Arctic. Our study underscores the importance of extensive and long-term sampling efforts to understand the Arctic's biodiversity, particularly with respect to documenting the presence and distribution of HA species.

The database consists of primary climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric humidity, but also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices, both useful information for assessing the impact of climate change in this region. These datasets are only available on  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14364865 
 High spatiotemporal climate datasets are essential to assess the impacts of climate change in high mountains, where the climate is highly variable. However, these regions are characterized by a lack of climatic information, and if any, it is usually short, sparse, or incomplete. This work presents a new series of very high-resolution (1 km) gridded climate datasets for Sierra Nevada (SN), a mountain range classified as a double climate-change hotspot, as it is a semi-arid mountain range in the Mediterranean area that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. The database, called HighResClimNevada, consists of a set of climate data derived from a climate simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the period from 1991 to 2022 and forced with the ERA5 reanalysis. HighResClimNevada provides hourly/daily primary climate variables (i.e., near-surface temperature, precipitation, near-surface relative humidity, surface pressure, surface net radiation, and wind speed), but also bioclimatic variables, extremes indices from the Expert Team of Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and precipitation-hour indicators, which were postprocessed using aggregated temperature and precipitation values from primary climate variables. To evaluate the database performance, HighResClimNevada temperature and precipitation values were compared with reference datasets from different sources. In general, HighResClimNevada captures reasonably well the spatiotemporal variability of raw temperature but also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices in SN. It displays comparable behavior to other climatic products but with a greater level of detail due to its higher spatial resolution. For precipitation, variable, more uncertain and difficult to characterize, HighResClimNevada exhibits a higher amount of precipitation when compared to station-based, coarse satellite-based, and reanalysis-based products. However, these latter present problems in characterizing precipitation in high mountain regions due to the scarcity of data in areas with high spatiotemporal variability, such as SN. The precipitation from HighResClimNevada is comparable to other climatic products like CHIRPS or CERRA-Land, which captures better the spatiotemporal variability in this region. These findings, therefore, suggest HighResClimNevada as a valuable long-term climate tool for a variety of applications, including land management, hydrometeorological research, flora and fauna phenology, and risk assessment.

We show that using a simpler 2D framework improves robustness, speeds up training, and reduces computational needs by 20 %–30 %. We introduce a training procedure that varies the importance of atmospheric variables over time to speed up training convergence. Decreasing computational demand increases the accessibility of training and working with the model. 
 Data-driven medium-range weather forecasts have recently outperformed classical numerical weather prediction models, with Pangu-Weather (PGW) being the first breakthrough model to achieve this. The Transformer-based PGW introduced novel architectural components including the three-dimensional attention mechanism (3D Transformer) in the Transformer blocks. Additionally, it features an Earth-specific positional bias term which accounts for weather states being related to the absolute position on Earth. However, the effectiveness of different architectural components is not yet well understood. Here, we reproduce the 24 h forecast model of PGW based on subsampled 6-hourly data. We then present an ablation study of PGW to better understand the sensitivity to the model architecture and training procedure. We find that using a two-dimensional attention mechanism (2D Transformer) yields a model that is more robust to training, converges faster, and produces better forecasts compared to using the 3D Transformer. The 2D Transformer reduces the overall computational requirements by 20 %–30 %. Further, the Earth-specific positional bias term can be replaced with a relative bias, reducing the model size by nearly 40 %. A sensitivity study comparing the convergence of the PGW model and the 2D-Transformer model shows large batch effects; however, the 2D-Transformer model is more robust to such effects. Lastly, we propose a new training procedure that increases the speed of convergence for the 2D-Transformer model by 30 % without any further hyperparameter tuning."

To understand these changes, models are needed. MetROMS-UHel is a new version of an ocean–sea ice model with updated sea ice code and the atmospheric data. We investigate the effect of our updates on different variables with a focus on sea ice and show an improved sea ice representation as compared with observations. 
 In recent years, the Antarctic sea ice has experienced major changes, which are neither well understood nor adequately reproduced by earth system models. To support model development with an aim to improve Antarctic sea ice and upper ocean predictions, the impacts of updating the sea ice model and the atmospheric forcing are investigated. In the new MetROMS-UHel-v1.0 (henceforth MetROMS-UHel) ocean-sea ice model, the sea ice component has been updated from CICE5 to CICE6, and the forcing has been updated from ERA-Interim to ERA5 reanalyses. Both CICE sea ice models were coupled with the regional ROMS ocean model. We find that the update of CICE and ERA reduced the negative bias of the sea ice area in summer. However, the sea ice volume decreases after the CICE update but increase when the atmospheric forcing is updated. As a net result after both updates, the modelled sea ice becomes thinner and more deformed, particularly near the coast. The ROMS ocean model usually yielded a deeper ocean mix layer compared to observations. Using ERA5, the situation was slightly improved. The update from CICE5 to CICE6 resulted in a fresher coastal ocean due to a smaller salt flux from sea ice to the ocean. In the ice shelf cavities, the modelled melt rates are underestimated compared with observations, which could be attributed to missing tides and inadequate model resolution. These identified sea ice and oceanic changes vary seasonally and regionally. By determining sea ice and oceanic changes after the model and forcing updates, and evaluating them against observations, this study informs modellers on improvements and aspects requiring attention with potential model adjustments."

This study presents a machine learning-assisted “shrink-restricted” SERS strategy (SRSS) to monitor molecular changes in the cellular secretome exposure to six types of NPs. Utilizing three-dimensional (3D) Ag@hydrogel-based SRSS, active targeting of molecules within adjustable nanogaps was achieved to track information. Machine learning was employed to analyze the overall spectral profiles, biochemical signatures, and time-dependent changes. Results indicate that environmentally derived NPs exhibited higher toxicity to BEAS-2B and L02 cells. Notably, the “NPs carrier effect,” resulting from pollutant adsorption, proved to be more harmful. This effect altered the death pathway of BEAS-2B cells from a combination of apoptosis and ferroptosis to primarily ferroptosis. Furthermore, L02 cells demonstrated greater metabolic vulnerability to NPs exposure than that of BEAS-2B cells, especially concerning the “NPs carrier effect.” Traditional detection methods for cell death often rely on end point assays, which limit temporal resolution and focus on single or multiple markers. In contrast, our study pioneers a machine learning-assisted SERS approach for monitoring overall metabolic levels post-NPs exposure at both cellular and molecular levels.

However, the atomic-level mechanisms by which different iron species, including isolated sites, clusters, and particles, participate in N2O decomposition in the presence of CO still remain poorly understood, which hinders the application of the reaction in practical technology. Herein, through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified that isolated iron sites were active for N2O activation to generate adsorbed O* species, which readily reacted with CO following the Eley–Rideal (E-R) mechanism. In contrast, Fe2O3 particles exhibited a different reaction pathway, directly reacting with CO to generate oxygen vacancies (Ov), which could efficiently dissociate N2O following the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. Moreover, the transformation of iron oxide clusters into undercoordinated FeOx species by CO was also revealed through various techniques, such as CO-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations.

Our results demonstrated that, differing from PM2.5, which is significantly shaped by planetary boundary layer height, wind speed plays a crucial role in determining the particle number concentration (PNC), showing strong regional specificity. Furthermore, we systematically identified and analyzed anthropogenically influenced periodic trends. Notably, while Aitken mode observations are initially linked to traffic-related peaks, both Aitken and nucleation modes contribute to concentration peaks during rush hour periods on short-term impacts after deweather adjustment. Pollutant baseline concentrations are largely driven by human activities, with meteorological factors modulating their variability, and the secondary formation of UFPs is likely reflected in temporal residuals. This study provides a flexible framework for isolating meteorological effects, allowing more accurate assessment of anthropogenic impacts and targeted management strategies for UFP and PNC."

Existing approaches provide inadequate understandings of the processes regulating metal bioavailability under nonequilibrium conditions. Experiments were conducted to improve our understanding of the metal bioavailability dynamics induced by sediment resuspension and subsequent redeposition (reequilibration). An isotopically modified bioassay, a novel stable isotope tracing technique, was used to measure metal bioavailability (assimilation rates) to clams within short time windows. Changes in metal partitioning were characterized by porewater analysis using in situ extraction and the diffusive gradients in thin-films technique. Results showed that sediment resuspension released metals into porewater, while reequilibration scavenged metals from the porewater. The assimilation rates of Ni, Cu, and Pb increased with the resuspension time, aligning with increasing porewater concentrations. Unexpectedly, during reequilibration, the metal assimilation rates did not decrease. The discrepancies between bioavailability to the clam and porewater extrapolations may be due to differing sustained conditions of metals in sediments. Overall, this study unveils the metal bioavailability dynamics in nonequilibrium sediments, which could not be accurately predicted relying solely on porewater analysis.

In this study, we discovered that the escape rate of an Escherichia coli GEM biocontained with a CRISPR-based kill switch triggered by anhydrotetracycline (aTc) increased by 3–4 orders of magnitude when deployed in natural surface waters as compared to rich laboratory media. We identified that environmental conditions (e.g., pH, nutrient levels) may contribute to elevated escape rates in multiple ways, including by altering the chemical speciation of the kill switch trigger to reduce its uptake and providing limited nutrients required for the kill switch to function.

We found that the loss of CO2 is a prerequisite for most other pathways, explaining the absence of ISF for PFAS without a CO2– headgroup. The elevated bond dissociation energy of C–CO2– explained the reduced ISF for long-chain PFCA and ωH-PFCA. Raising the MS vaporizer and ion transfer tube temperatures significantly aggravated the ISF of most PFAS.

Globally, the oceanic CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ uptake is reduced by 8% (3%–19% across data sets) during MHWs.

The oceanic CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ uptake decreases during MHWs by 29% (19%–37%) and 14% (5%–21%) in the low‐to‐mid latitude Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively. Reduced dissolved inorganic carbon in the tropics weakens outgassing, while high ocean temperatures diminish uptake in the low‐to‐mid latitudes.

Significant 10–30‐day intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) in temperature and humidity is a major contributor to the humid heatwaves. Configuration of the 10–30‐day quasi‐barotropic wave train at mid–high latitudes with the dipolar pattern of tropical convection leads to the concurrence of strong moisture convergence and anomalous descents over southern China. The increased downward longwave radiation in association with moisture enhancement, shortwave radiation and adiabatic heating in association with descents bring about the persisting hot and humid conditions in humid heatwaves. Due to stronger barotropic energy conversion from mean flow to 10–30‐day circulation at mid–high latitudes, and stronger tropical convection activities in the recent decade, the occurrence of 10–30‐day circulation configuration induced humid heatwaves has increased by 13.3%, thus leading to the predominance of humid heatwaves."

We found that calm weather conditions due to subsidence on the tropical cyclone periphery were conducive to the formation of sea breeze, lake breeze and ozone pollution. The sea and lake breezes had opposite directions, resulting in relay transport of ozone. When polluted air masses passed through, urban areas experienced repeated ozone pollution. Furthermore, urbanization altered the surface energy balance through increased urban land use (LU) and anthropogenic heat (AH) release, raising urban temperature and enhancing urban heat island circulation.

The simulated wind and solar power variabilities and their corresponding droughts during historical periods are more sensitive to the model bias than to the model resolution. Future climate simulations reveal varied future change of these droughts across different regions. Although model resolution does not affect the simulation of historical droughts, it does impact the simulated future changes.

Proxies in the early and mid‐Holocene suggest a Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) where temperatures exceed the pre‐industrial, whereas climate models generally simulate monotonic warming. This discrepancy may reflect proxy seasonality biases or errors in climate model internal feedbacks or dynamics. Using seasonally unbiased ice core reconstructions at NEEM, NGRIP, and Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2, we identify a Greenland HTM of ∼2°C above pre‐industrial, in agreement with other Northern Hemisphere proxy reconstructions. The firn‐based reconstructions are verified through borehole thermometry, producing a multi‐core, multi‐proxy reconstruction of Greenland climate from the last glacial to pre‐industrial. HTM timing across Greenland is heterogenous, occurring earlier at high elevations. Total air content measurements suggest a temperature contribution from elevation changes; regional oceanographic conditions, a weakened polar lapse rate, or variable near‐surface inversions may also be important sensitivities.

Current wedges observed by mid‐latitude ground magnetometers around midnight suggest dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs). The latitude of the auroral brightening was clearly lower than usual, suggesting near‐Earth reconnection (NERX) was closer to Earth than during substorms (∼20–30RE). GOES‐18 at midnight detected magnetic field and plasma signatures consistent with DFBs, following an extremely thin current sheet likely compressed by strong upstream dynamic pressure.

Utilizing satellite observations and eddy covariance tower‐based observations worldwide, we investigated the impact of climate factors on the diurnal patterns of ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Our analysis revealed that the increase in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) shifts the diurnal peak of GPP activity to earlier morning hours, particularly in drylands and areas with short vegetation. After disentangling the strong correlations among VPD, temperature, and soil moisture, we unraveled that VPD emerges as the dominant driver contributing to the widespread afternoon depression of photosynthesis in terrestrial vegetation globally. However, Earth System Models (ESMs) systematically underestimate the significant role of VPD in regulating photosynthesis. Eight out of 10 ESMs exhibited a clear afternoon increase in photosynthesis, which was attributed to temperature.

These measurements enable an estimate of the global flux of N outgassing from arcs (4.0 × 1010 mol/yr). This suggests that Earth is currently in a state of net N ingassing, with roughly half of subducted N returned to the mantle. Additionally, the N outgassing flux of individual arcs correlates with the thickness of subducting pelagic sediment, suggesting that N cycling in the modern solid Earth is largely controlled by sediment subduction."

Grieve;Shiuan‐An Chen;Katerina Michaelides,Climatic Controls on the Length and Shape of the World's Drainage Basins,"Climate is thought to affect the structure and evolution of drainage basins, but it is not clear how climate impacts the power law scaling between channel length and drainage area. Since climate controls runoff, streamflow, and erosion regimes, we looked for dependency of drainage basin morphometrics on climate within a near‐global data set. We show that increasingly arid regions have longer channels and narrower drainage basins, and power law scaling between channel length and basin area (Hack's Law) increases monotonically with aridity. We suggest these results arise due to downstream channel extension by rare large floods that erode channels into previously unchanneled terrain, yielding a morphometric signature in drylands that is preserved over long timescales due to a lack of subsequent topographic smoothing. This new understanding of drainage basin morphometrics on Earth may be used to inform interpretations of past climates on our planet and other solar system bodies."
10.1029/2024JD041371,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究的是2018年台风特拉米在 eyewall replacement cycle (ERC)过程中双暖核结构的演变。它使用耦合大气-海洋模式，研究了台风引起的海洋表面冷却 (SSC) 对双暖核结构的影响。研究发现，中层暖核 (MWC) 在 SEF 期间随着切向风向外扩展而衰减，即使在没有 SSC 的情况下也是如此。这与热力风平衡有关。上层暖核 (UWC) 的衰减则受 SSC 的影响，这显著促成了台风的快速减弱。论文还分析了位温收支，指出径向涡旋平流的减弱是 MWC 衰减的主要原因。总之，这项研究主要关注的是台风动力学和热力学过程的数值模拟，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['typhoon', 'warm core', 'eyewall replacement cycle', 'sea surface cooling', 'coupled atmosphere-ocean model', 'numerical simulation']",Xiangcheng Li;Xiaoping Cheng;Jianfang Fei;Xiaogang Huang;Shunzhi He,Evolution of the Double Warm‐Core Structure in the Eyewall Replacement Cycle of Typhoon Trami (2018),"The evolution of double warm‐cores (DWC) during the secondary eyewall formation (SEF) and the subsequent eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) in Typhoon Trami (2018) was investigated in this study. Using a coupled atmosphere‐ocean model, the impacts of the typhoon‐induced sea surface cooling (SSC) on the DWC structure were also examined. In both the coupled and uncoupled simulations, the middle‐level warm‐core (MWC) decayed as the tangential wind expanded outward during the SEF, even in the absence of SSC. Under the thermal wind balance, the cooling of the MWC was an inherent result to ensure the dynamic consistency during the SEF. In contrast to the uncoupled simulation, the upper‐level warm‐core (UWC) decayed under the influence of SSC, significantly contributing to the rapid weakening of Trami. The negative effects of the SSC on the UWC were more detrimental to the intensity of Trami. Results from the potential temperature (PT) budget of improved accuracy indicated that the decrease in the warming due to the radial eddy advection was mainly responsible for the decay of the MWC. The flattened radial gradient of PT during the SEF accounted for the reduction in the dynamical eye warming associated with the asymmetric mixing. In addition to the convectively induced subsidence, the upper‐level asymmetric structures could also be affected by the SSC. Consequently, the increase in the cooling due to the enhanced asymmetry collaborated with the decrease in the adiabatic warming, leading to the decay of the UWC in the coupled simulation."

In this study, deep convection area (DCA) in East Asia is identified using the infrared channel of Geostationary Korea Multi‐Purpose Satellite‐2A (GK‐2A) over 49 months (from August 2019 to August 2023), and CIT is determined by using in situ aircraft data adjacent to the DCA. Based on the satellite‐based CIT algorithm, the results indicate that 13.85%, 15.65%, and 18.23% of the total turbulence cases are classified as CIT over the Korean Peninsula, East Asia, and the full‐disk area, respectively, which are consistent with those in the previous studies. In East Asia, the CIT ratio is the highest in summer primarily due to the East Asian summer monsoon, and surprisingly, it is the second highest in winter. In winter, DCA occurs along the storm tracks accompanied by Aleutian Low, which provides favorable conditions for flights to encounter CIT in the North Pacific Ocean. The CIT intensity decreases rapidly as the horizontal distance between the DCA boundary and CIT location increases. However, at a distance exceeding 40 km from the DCA boundary, the intensity of turbulence gradually increases, which is most significant in winter. This trend is more likely related to the broader areas of DCA in the winter season than those in summer mainly due to the stronger upper‐level jet and its interaction with a storm system. Eventually, this algorithm can provide better information of avoidance guidance for CIT over the ocean."

Prein;Hugh Morrison,Simulating Precipitation Efficiency Across the Deep Convective Gray Zone,"Precipitation efficiency (PE) relates cloud condensation to precipitation and thus reflects how much of the total atmospheric condensate reaches the surface as precipitation. Because the PE in convective storms is directly linked to their updraft and downdraft dynamics, it is a helpful metric to identify convective processes that influence precipitation. However, km‐scale model simulations do not properly resolve convective processes such as individual updrafts and entrainment, which raises the question if such simulations can accurately represent PE. Here, we present two methods to derive PE from standard model output because condensation is usually not available as an output variable. The first method estimates PE from the state variables vertical velocity, temperature, and pressure, whereas the second method estimates PE from ice water path (IWP) and precipitation. We validate the proposed methods with the explicitly calculated PE using a set of idealized Weather Research and Forecast model simulations of organized midlatitude convective storms at different horizontal grid spacings. We show that PE can be reliably estimated from state variables with an error of less than 5%, partly due to error cancellation effects. Additionally, PE can be simulated by km‐scale models within ∼15% accuracy compared to large‐eddy simulations (LESs). The IWP method is slightly less accurate with a stronger grid spacing dependency of the error, but since it is based on observable quantities, it allows for a validation of simulated PE with satellite observations. Finally, we analyze the grid spacing dependency of the climate change signal of PE and find that future decreases in PE in LESs are robustly captured by km‐scale models."

The behavior of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ cooling rates during such a dramatic events draws attention to our current understanding of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ infrared cooling variation and its connection to changes in CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration.

The stations can appear in different locations and different intermediate months. Lagged correlations are calculated to infer the response of the heat source to sea ice and the response of precipitation to the heat source. Results show that there exist two spatial‐temporal channels. The first is a direct path over high latitudes, with intermediate station appearing in April at a location between Arctic and NEC. The second is a circuitous path, with intermediate station appearing in June over the equatorial Indian Ocean, which can excite a wave train that finally affects the JA precipitation in NEC.

 The androgen receptor (AR) is central in prostate tissue identity and differentiation, and controls normal growth-suppressive, prostate-specific gene expression. It also drives prostate tumorigenesis when hijacked for oncogenic transcription. The execution of growth-suppressive AR transcriptional programs in prostate cancer (PCa) and the potential for reactivation remain unclear. Here, we use a genome-wide approach to modulate canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs—the classic DNA binding elements for AR—to delineate distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activating these AREs promotes differentiation and growth-suppressive transcription, potentially leading to AR+ PCa cell death, while ARE repression is tolerated by PCa cells but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Gene signatures driven by ARE activity correlate with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in PCa patients. Canonical AREs maintain a normal, lineage-specific transcriptional program that can be reengaged in PCa cells, offering therapeutic potential and clinical relevance.

Here they show that the mitochondrial fusion-fission equilibrium can determine the pluripotency of planarian stem cells and that mitonuclear balance is critical for planarian regeneration. 
 Tissue regeneration is a complex process involving large changes in cell proliferation, fate determination, and differentiation. Mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism play a crucial role in development and wound repair, but their function in large-scale regeneration remains poorly understood. Planarians offer an excellent model to investigate this process due to their remarkable regenerative abilities. In this study, we examine mitochondrial dynamics during planarian regeneration. We find that knockdown of the mitochondrial fusion gene, opa1, impairs both tissue regeneration and stem cell pluripotency. Interestingly, the regeneration defects caused by opa1 knockdown are rescued by simultaneous knockdown of the mitochondrial fission gene, drp1, which partially restores mitochondrial dynamics. Furthermore, we discover that Mitolow stem cells exhibit an enrichment of pluripotency due to their fate choices at earlier stages. Transcriptomic analysis reveals the delicate mitonuclear balance in metabolism and mitochondrial proteins in regeneration, controlled by mitochondrial dynamics. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining mitochondrial dynamics in large-scale tissue regeneration and suggest the potential for manipulating these dynamics to enhance stem cell functionality and regenerative processes.

 Accurate crop yield prediction is of utmost importance for informed decision-making in agriculture, aiding farmers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers in optimizing agricultural practices. However, this task is complex and depends on multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Leveraging Remote Sensing (RS) technologies, multi-modal data from diverse global data sources can be collected to enhance predictive model accuracy. However, combining heterogeneous RS data poses a fusion challenge, like identifying the specific contribution of each modality in the predictive task. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal learning approach to predict crop yield for different crops (soybean, wheat, rapeseed) and regions (Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany). Our multi-modal input data includes multi-spectral optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites and weather data as dynamic features during the crop growing season, complemented by static features like soil properties and topographic information. To effectively fuse the multi-modal data, we introduce a Multi-modal Gated Fusion (MMGF) model, comprising dedicated modality-encoders and a Gated Unit (GU) module. The modality-encoders handle the heterogeneity of data sources with varying temporal resolutions by learning a modality-specific representation. These representations are adaptively fused via a weighted sum. The fusion weights are computed for each sample by the GU using a concatenation of the multi-modal representations. The MMGF model is trained at sub-field level with 10 m resolution pixels. Our evaluations show that the MMGF outperforms conventional models on the same task, achieving the best results by incorporating all the data sources, unlike the usual fusion results in the literature. For Argentina, the MMGF model achieves an R2 value of 0.68 at sub-field yield prediction, while at the field level evaluation (comparing field averages), it reaches around 0.80 across different countries. The GU module learned different weights based on the country and crop-type, aligning with the variable significance of each data source to the prediction task.

 Accurate and timely mapping of rural settlements using medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat data, is crucial for evaluating rural infrastructure, estimating ecological service values, assessing the quality of life for rural populations, and promoting sustainable rural development. Current mapping techniques, including pixel-based and object-based classifications, primarily focus on identifying artificial surfaces, often failing to capture the complete spatial footprint of rural settlements. These settlements consist of diverse land cover elements, such as houses, roads, agricultural buildings, ponds, parks, and woodlands, which together form entities with distinct local characteristics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel classification strategy: Entity-Based Image Analysis (EBIA). Inspired by cognitive principles of human visual perception, EBIA groups related land cover elements and differentiates settlements from their background. The key innovation of EBIA lies in its ability to incorporate semantic features within rural settlements, transforming pixel-level land cover classification results (Phase 1) into entity-level settlement mapping results (Phase 2). Our results demonstrate that EBIA effectively maps the comprehensive footprint of rural settlement entities, achieving F1 scores ranging from 0.79 to 0.88 across five globally selected experimental areas. Furthermore, EBIA can be utilized to monitor changes in rural settlements using long-term Landsat imagery. As a new classification strategy, EBIA holds potential for mapping other geographic entities."

 The NASA TROPICS mission encompasses a constellation of CubeSats equipped with microwave radiometers, dedicated to investigating tropical meteorology and storm systems. In a departure from traditional microwave sounders, the TROPICS Microwave Sounder (TMS) employs new frequencies at F-band near 118 GHz and features an additional G-band channel at 205 GHz. We have expanded the capabilities of the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS), a state-of-the-art one-dimensional variational (1DVAR) algorithm, for the retrieval of geophysical variables with the TROPICS Pathfinder early-phase data. Here we focus on assessing the retrieved precipitation in terms of rainfall and graupel. TROPICS captures well the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of Hurricane Ida and Super Typhoon Mindulle. TROPICS depicted the eyewall replacement cycle of Mindulle as it weakened and reintensified. The global precipitation distribution and dynamics are well represented by TROPICS. We compare TROPICS with other precipitation datasets, including Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) products. For example, when compared with GMI, MiRS TROPICS instantaneous precipitation yields a correlation coefficient of 0.5 and an RMSE of 2.0 mm/h. For graupel, MiRS TROPICS retrievals show a correlation of 0.52 and an RMSE of 0.53 kg/m2. The retrieval performance is comparable to other sensors such as the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), while the higher number of channels of ATMS, including its low-frequency channels serve to better constrain retrievals. TMS observes at higher spectral frequencies than the coincident ATMS channels, showing higher sensitivity to rainfall and graupel. The TMS high-frequency channels and lower orbit allow for greater resolution of precipitation features, while lower-frequency ATMS channels excel at resolving hurricane warm-core structures. The results underscore the value of the TROPICS mission for precipitation measurement and demonstrate the successful integration of TROPICS processing capability within the MiRS retrieval algorithm framework."

 Canopy height mapping is critical for assessing forest structure, forest resilience, carbon stocks, habitat, and biodiversity, all of which are threatened by changing climate and weather extremes. While current tools utilizing lidar (e.g., GEDI) and multispectral imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2, airborne imagery) produce canopy height products, significant challenges remain, particularly in capturing fine-scale spatial details across large areas with high frequency. PlanetScope CubeSat imagery, with its 3 m spatial resolution and near-daily frequency, offers a unique opportunity to estimate woody plant structure by capturing fine-scale texture and temporal patterns that shift throughout the year. In this study, we adapted a 3D Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (ST-CNN) to estimate canopy height at 3 m resolution, utilizing sequential PlanetScope time series over five months, summer Sentinel-1 radar imagery, and solar illumination layers as inputs. We generated a large and diverse reference database covering 2,296 sample scenes (each scene = 768 × 768 m, totaling ∼135,000 ha) using a semi-automatic labeling process that leverages 23 aerial lidar surveys conducted in California between 2016 and 2021. Trained on a random selection of 2,046 scenes, the accuracy assessment on the remaining 250 scenes demonstrates strong performance across various ecoregions, capturing 80.8% of the observed variance in live canopy height with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.6 m and a bias of -0.53 m compared with aerial lidar. Analysis of all 681 GEDI footprints over the same testing scenes estimates the MAE of 6.5 m, bias of -1.82 m, and R2 of 0.58 for the GEDI L2A Vector Canopy Top Height RH98 product. The ST-CNN model accurately identifies heterogeneous canopy structures, and shows sensitivity to canopies reaching 50 to 60 m in height. We found a major contribution from the PlanetScope time series, compared to a single PlanetScope image, and marginal benefits of including Sentinel-1 and terrain-based solar irradiance layers to improve performance on dense canopies or diverse topography. Example applications demonstrate the ability to generalize to different years, maintaining consistent predictions between years and capturing changes in canopy height over a seven year period (2017–2023) within 400 plots representing regrowth, minimal change, selective logging, and clear cut areas. We also demonstrate improved canopy height estimation compared to existing products from Landsat (MAE = 8.41 m) and Sentinel-2 (MAE = 7.19 m). A visualization tool displays our data alongside existing products for the Sierra Nevada in 2022. The Planet ST-CNN model, using a 15-day PlanetScope satellite time series, offers a scalable approach for annual canopy height estimation in California, achieving a high level of detail, often down to the resolution of individual trees. This improved capability of forest structure monitoring is expected to deliver crucial, comprehensive data for assessing and tracking forest carbon, biodiversity, and vulnerability, ultimately facilitating data-driven strategies to improve forest resilience."

 Satellite images have been adopted in recent years for identifying topographical features on the Earth’s surface. Researchers have also published reports on the use of satellite images to analyze shoreline changes or to verify shoreline change in numerical models. But reports that demonstrate the reverse process of using satellite images to estimate the incident waves to a beach are rare, particularly to a place where protective coastal structures exist. This paper describes a once-thriving coastal townsite with two fishing ports in Korea which has been transformed into a typical example that relies on protective structures with occasional artificial nourishment to maintain its shoreline stability in the past 20 years. Unlike many others, this study proposes a new methodology to estimate the deepwater wave heights based on the analysis of shoreline data extracted from satellite images over 5 years (2019–2023) for Wonpyeong-Chogok Beach, its median sediment grain sizes D50, and the known empirical relationship between sediment and waves. The entire shoreline of 2,860 m in length is divided into 39 transects, of which one-half of it is protected by submerged and emergent detached breakwaters, where shoreline has advanced, while the rest has eroded. From the standard deviation values calculated from the extracted shoreline location data, the influence of long-term trends was excluded, and the intrinsic standard deviation is obtained by applying sediment size information, and then the incident deep-water (average annual maximum) wave height of 4.363 m was estimated. Applying this methodology to the beach area where the coastal structure was placed, the wave transmission of the coastal structure was calculated 0.91 and 0.72 for LCSs and TT-DBWs, respectively, through the reduction ratio of the standard deviation. Finally, discussions are made on how the resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite images in affecting the standard deviation and long-term trend results in the shoreline data."

 A wide variety of spatially explicit modeling algorithms has recently mushroomed in geoinformation research. These algorithms establish local models with data from spatially confined subsets, thereby offering a new impetus for addressing the issue of spatiotemporal non-stationarity. However, a significant challenge persists in literature that local models are primarily predicated on linear assumptions, limiting their capacity to capture the non-linear relationships prevalent in real-world geographical phenomena. This study remedies this gap through proposing a novel approach that integrates the bagging and stacking approaches of ensemble learning into the spatially explicit modeling framework. We specifically develop the SpatioTemporal Random Forest (STRF) and SpatioTemporal Stacking Tree (STST) algorithms1, which capture and interpret the non-linearity in the spatial and temporal context more effectively. Additionally, we introduce the ‘local importance score’ and ‘spatiotemporally accumulated local effects’ as novel interpretable metrics for visualizing and unraveling the dynamics of non-stationarity in spatial analyses. Simulation and real data experiments validate that the STRF and STST outperform over traditional spatially explicit modeling algorithms to a large content. This study contributes to the methodological innovation of spatially explicit modeling by bringing the nonlinearity in spatiotemporal non-stationarity to the fore."

 Shallow water environmental information is crucial for the study of marine ecosystems and human activities. There have been numerous satellite remote sensing studies focused on this area. However, accurate information acquisition from remote sensing data remains difficult in this region due to the complexity of the environment and the coupling between benthic reflectance and water column scattering. In this study, we developed a method to retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd), seafloor classification, and bathymetric maps by combining satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing imagery in shallow water areas. Firstly, the relationships between remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), water depth, and Kd were established based on radiative transfer theory. This method allows for the retrieval of Kd in shallow water regions, overcoming the limitations present in previous studies. Secondly, we eliminated the water column attenuation and obtained the bottom reflectance index (BRI). The BRI allowed us to determine the bottom reflectance and classify the seafloor using the Gaussian mixture model clustering method. This approach can effectively reduce the error in bathymetric inversion caused by variations in bottom reflectance. Finally, we developed a neural network model for bathymetric inversion. The model inputs consist of Rrs data and spectral shape data containing physical constraint information, aiming to achieve a robust estimation performance. We conducted the study in two experimental areas (the Bimini Islands and the Yongle Atoll) and compared the results with validation data to evaluate the algorithm performance. The results indicated an agreement between the estimated Kd and the validation data (inferred Kd490 values of 0.062 m−1 and 0.058 m−1, compared to a validation data range of 0.055–0.087 m−1 and 0.059–0.070 m−1, respectively). In addition, the seafloor classification accuracy was 86.74 % for the Yongle Atoll area. Finally, the neural network model accurately predicted the bathymetry in the two regions. The accuracy of the bathymetric maps improved significantly with seafloor classification, as indicated by reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 m and 0.15 m, and in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 2.24 % and 5.87 %, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can be used to effectively decouple benthic and water column signals and accurately obtain Kd, bottom reflectance, and bathymetric information for shallow water environments, providing unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring ecosystems and facilitating further research."

 Accurate representation of the stable atmospheric surface layer (ASL) in numerical models has been a challenging task due to the occurrence of different physical processes such as radiative transport, turbulent mixing, and the coupling of vegetation with the atmosphere and underlying soil, as well as aspects of land use heterogeneity, etc. The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory has been widely used to parameterize surface turbulent fluxes in numerical models, which utilize similarity functions to account for the effect of atmospheric stability. Over the years, researchers have proposed various forms of similarity functions, depending on different field experiment datasets around the globe. This study incorporates some of the well-established non-linear similarity functions under stable stratification in the revised MM5 surface layer scheme in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model version 4.2.2 and hence develop a scheme that has various functional forms of similarity functions for computing surface turbulent fluxes under stable stratification. The proposed scheme has been evaluated in simulating near-surface atmospheric variables and surface turbulent fluxes over the domain centered around the location of the Ranchi dataset site (23.412oN, 85.440oE; India) and the CASES-99 experiment site (37.38oN, 96.44oW; Kansas, USA) during the months of January 2009 and October 1999, respectively. The modified scheme is also evaluated for the three contrasting nights representative of intermittently turbulent, fully turbulent, and radiative ASL based on the CASES-99 dataset. In general, all the newly installed similarity functions are found to be consistent in predicting surface turbulent fluxes as well as near-surface atmospheric variables with respect to the default surface layer scheme and the observed data derived from the flux towers over the two domains. However, this study reveals that all the similarity functions are found to be inconsistent during the fully turbulent night while they seem comparable for the first and last nights based on the CASES-99 dataset."

 Recent extremes in Antarctic temperature, surface melt and sea ice loss have been robustly linked to the occurrence of atmospheric rivers (ARs). However, the precise mechanisms that generate variations in the surface impacts of ARs are poorly understood, especially in the Antarctic. Based on Arctic evidence that the vertical and horizontal advancement of ARs over sea ice strongly depends on meteorological conditions, the season, as well as the underlying surface before reaching sea ice, we investigate the vertical structure and impact of extreme ARs reaching sea ice and also the Antarctic ice sheet.Based on MERRA-2, ERA5 and six CMIP6 models (1985–2014), we find that surface inversions are twice as likely to occur during AR conditions in austral summer compared to climatology, and also find a significant increase in the frequency of double inversions. Our results suggest that land-locked sea ice acts as a protective barrier for the Antarctic continent, diminishing wind speeds and moisture levels, and that seasonal variations exhibit a predominant influence of downward shortwave and longwave flux anomalies in summer and winter, respectively. Furthermore, surface warming induced by ARs over sea ice is notably enhanced under conditions of upper-air subsidence, coupled with reduced cloud cover and precipitation in summer, and intensified turbulent heat and downward longwave fluxes in winter.

While catheter ablation is prevalent for the treatment, existing techniques hardly can achieve both tissue selectivity and ablation uniformity. Here, we propose a bioinspired strategy for balloon-based pulsed field ablation (PFA) systems based on “flounder” electrodes. Inspired by a flounder skeleton and citrus peels, the microfabricated electrodes are ultrathin, stretchable, and have a scattered configuration, withstanding large balloon deformation (87% compression), high voltage (1200 volts), and owning exceptional tissue conformability (720° twists). Mechanical-electrical coupled stimulation optimizes balloon electrodes with hemispherical electric field uniformity. A water lily–inspired transfer printing method enables one-step integration of multielectrodes with the balloon. A comprehensive PFA system is complemented, achieving ablation depths of 3.8 millimeters (potato), 3.1 millimeters (rabbit), and 2.3 millimeters (swine) with good uniformity and electrophysiological isolation.

However, existing AOT quartz cylinders are limited in their ability to meet the high rotation rate requirement while minimizing laser-induced photodamage. In this work, we present a trapping particle design to meet this challenge by creating small metamaterial elliptical cylinders with tunable trapping force and torque properties. The optical torque of these cylinders arises from their shape anisotropy, with their optical properties tuned via multilayered SiO2and Si3N4deposition. We demonstrate that these cylinders can be rotated at about three times the rate of quartz cylinders without slippage while enhancing the torque measurement resolution during DNA torsional elasticity studies.

Strikingly, enhancer mobility becomes constrained on transcriptional firing, homogenizing its dynamics with the gene promoter, suggestive of their cotranscriptional sharing of a nuclear microenvironment.

Natural biomolecules represent attractive building blocks for these materials because of their inherent biological function and high biocompatibility; however, assembling them into coordination network materials, especially nanoparticles (NPs), is challenging. Herein, we exploit the coordination between metal ions and phosphonate groups, which are present in many biomolecules, to form metal-biomolecule network (MBN) NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature. Various phosphonate-containing biomolecules, including plant phytate, DNA, and proteins, were used to assemble MBN NPs with tunable physicochemical properties (e.g., size). In addition to excellent biocompatibility and high cargo-loading efficiency (>95%), these two-component MBN NPs have various biological functionalities, including endosomal escape, immune regulation, and molecular recognition, thus offering advantages over nonbiomolecular-based coordination materials.

Our study reveals neural zinc finger (Nzf2) as a crucial orchestrator that controls the timing of OL differentiation both during development and myelin repair, contrasting with its previously suggested role in direct myelin gene regulation.Nzf2ablation delays the onset of OL differentiation, while hyperactivation stimulates OL differentiation both during development and remyelination. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we pinpoint Nkx2.2 as a critical downstream target of Nzf2. Specific binding of Nzf2 in theNkx2.2gene locus inhibits histone deacetylation by disrupting the HDAC1 repressor complex and reducing deacetylase activity. Furthermore, Nzf2 overrides the inhibitory Notch signaling to initiate OL differentiation. Thus, we propose that the Notch-Nzf2-Nkx2.2 axis is a vital component of OL differentiation timing mechanism, suggesting Nzf2 as a potential therapeutic target for stimulating OL differentiation and boosting myelin repair in demyelinating diseases."

People with DS experience co-occurring conditions at higher rates than the euploid population. However, the interplay between immune and metabolic alterations and the clinical manifestations of DS are poorly understood. Here, we report an integrated analysis of immunometabolic pathways in DS. Using multi-omics data, we infered cytokine-metabolite relationships mediated by specific transcriptional programs. We observed increased mediation of immunometabolic interactions in those with DS compared to euploid controls by genes in interferon response, heme metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Unsupervised clustering of immunometabolic relationships in people with DS revealed subgroups with different frequencies of co-occurring conditions. Across the subgroups, we observed distinct mediation by DNA repair, Hedgehog signaling, and angiogenesis. The molecular stratification associates with the clinical heterogeneity observed in DS, suggesting that integrating multiple omic profiles reveals axes of coordinated dysregulation specific to DS co-occurring conditions."

Here, we use high-resolution 3D seismic data to interpret the landforms and sediments of the central North Sea in unprecedented detail. In contrast to previous interpretations of multiple extensive early glaciations, our data suggest that grounded ice extended across the central North Sea only once, from western Norway, during the Early Pleistocene. This ice sheet advance, which probably occurred ~1.1 million years ago, deposited an up to 120-meter-thick layer of till across >10,000 square kilometers of the central basin. During the rest of the Early Pleistocene, elliptical pockmarks and elongate contour-current furrows show that the central basin was instead scoured by along-slope currents. These findings constrain the extent of ice sheets before and during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and reconcile marine and terrestrial evidence for glaciation in northwest Europe."

Through the adoption of membrane-based structures and a photonic enhancement strategy unique to our all-optical detection modality, we further improved the sensitivity to sub–10 picowatt-per-square-micrometer levels. The detection covers the mid-wave infrared regime from 2 to 4.5 micrometers and extends to the long-wave infrared wavelength at 10.6 micrometers, with wavelength-independent sensitivity response.

Our work describes a specific mechanism of cisplatin resistance, which, given the characteristics of NPEPPS as a drug target, has the potential to improve cancer patient outcomes.
