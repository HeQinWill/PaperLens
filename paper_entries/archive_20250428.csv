Using a derivative-based episode detection algorithm with low-cost uncalibrated sensor signal data sensitive to VOCs, ammonia, amine-series, and sulfurous odors, we identified frequent and intense pollution episodes within the community. According to wind data, these episodes came from the direction of the industrial park and often correlated with increased symptom and odor reports. Additionally, metals biomarker toenail sampling revealed elevated nickel levels in a subset of resident children, which is an industrial pollutant of concern in this community. The findings have supported Cherokee Concerned Citizens’ advocacy efforts to mobilize the community and engage with regulatory agencies. Our work demonstrates a transferable methodology for using low-cost sensors and community reports to document industrial pollution impacts in fenceline communities."

The findings enhance our understanding of nighttime biomass burning evolution and its implications for climate and regional air quality, especially regarding interactions with background aerosol water and water-rich fogs and clouds. 
 Biomass burning is a major global source of both primary brown carbon (BrC) and reactive trace gases in the atmosphere and thus has a significant impact on global climate and regional atmospheric chemistry. However, a substantial gap remains in our understanding of the nighttime evolution of biomass burning emissions. Here we present prominent nighttime formation of secondary organic aerosol (Night-OA) with strong absorptivity but markedly different spectral dependence from that of primary biomass burning organic aerosols, which was observed during autumn in the Pearl River Delta region of China when biomass burning plumes prevailed. Our results demonstrate that the formation of Night-OA appeared to have high dependence on both the magnitudes of biomass burning emissions at nightfall and available oxidants of NO2 and O3. Active nighttime NO3 radical chemistry was characterized by quick O3 depletion and almost zero concentration of NO. The rapid decrease in NO2 coincident with the quick nitrate formation suggests that the rapid NO2 consumption supplied the NO3 and N2O5 reaction chains. However, the quickest Night-OA formation occurred when nitrate formation ceased and relative humidity reached maximum, and it mainly added mass to aerosol water-abundant diameter ranges. This co-variation suggests that gas-phase reactions of biomass burning precursors, along with aqueous-phase chemistry involving preexisting hygroscopic aerosols in the diluted plume, likely work in concert to promote the rapid nighttime formation of Night-OA. Preexisting background aerosols are generally much more hygroscopic than the aerosols directly emitted from biomass burning. Incorporating the important role of background aerosols in the aging of diluted biomass burning plumes would be valuable in future laboratory and model simulation studies. The proposed mechanisms for secondary BrC formation have broad implications for the climate and air quality impacts of biomass burning, including the interaction between biomass burning plumes and background aerosols in humid regions, as well as with water-abundant pyroconvection clouds."

Based on multi-site spectroscopic measurements, this study demonstrated the significant spatial heterogeneity in the optical and structural properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in different regions of China and revealed factors affecting WSOC light absorption and the relationship between fluorophores and light absorption of WSOC. 
 To understand the spatial variation of optical and structural properties of water-soluble brown carbon and its influencing factors in China, the light absorption, fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in different regions of China are measured following the same analytical methods. The average light absorption coefficients and mass absorption efficiencies of WSOC at 365 nm (Abs365 and MAE365) rank from high to low as northwest China > southwest China > north China > east China > regional site, with higher values in northern China than southern China and regional sites and higher values in inland areas than coastal areas. The light absorption factors resolved by light absorption spectra-based positive matrix factorization model and the abundance of aromatic O−H and C=C functional groups determined by FTIR both indicate that aromatic compounds are significant light-absorbing substances in WSOC and have a significant impact on fluorophores. Multiple linear regression analysis shows that the fluorophores identified by fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) contribute to about 62 %–93 % of the WSOC light absorption at all sites, in which humic-like substance (HULIS) contributes the most, especially highly oxygenated HULIS (29 %–50 %) with long emission wavelengths. Combustion source emissions and atmospheric chemical processes have significant impacts on the WSOC light absorption at some sites. Moreover, relative humidity (RH) can also affect MAE365 of WSOC, with MAE365 values decreasing with the increase in RH when RH<60 % and remaining relatively unchanged when RH>60 %. Taken together, this study promotes a better understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of optical and structural properties of WSOC and their influencing factors in China."

Our study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite to estimate ground-level PM concentrations using machine learning models. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the world's first ultraviolet–visible instrument for air quality monitoring in geostationary orbit. Since its launch in 2020, GEMS has provided hourly daytime air quality information over Asia. However, to date, validation and applications of these data are largely lacking. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the first 2 years of GEMS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in estimating ground-level particulate matter (PM) concentrations at an hourly scale. To do so, we train random forest and XGBoost machine learning algorithms using GEMS AOD data and meteorological variables as input features, then employ the trained models to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in South Korea. The model-estimated PM concentrations capture the spatial and temporal variations observed in ground-based measurements well, showing strong correlations. However, they exhibit noticeable biases at the extremes, with a tendency to overestimate concentrations at lower PM levels and underestimate them at higher PM levels. Incorporating locally available data, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide measurements, into the model training further enhances performance, improving correlations and reducing errors. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning models with neighbouring station data to estimate PM concentrations at ungauged locations where ground PM measurements are not available. Our results will serve as a reference to aid the evaluation of future GEMS AOD retrieval algorithm improvements and also provide initial guidance for data users."

Hopkins;Ke Li;Hong Liao,Ethanol and Methanol in South Korea and China: Evidence for Large Anthropogenic Emissions Missing from Current Inventories,"Observations during the KORUS-AQ, MAPS-Seoul, and APHH-Beijing field campaigns of 2015–2017 reveal high concentrations of ethanol and methanol in urban air over South Korea and China, with median concentrations of 2–4 ppb for ethanol and 12–18 ppb for methanol. Simulations with the GEOS-Chem model show that these values cannot be captured by current emission inventories. They could originate from volatile chemical products (VCPs). Fitting observed ethanol concentrations with GEOS-Chem would imply per capita VCP emissions 2.4 times higher in South Korea and 1.5 times higher in China than in the U.S. The strong ethanol–methanol correlation suggests a major methanol component in VCP emissions, unlike in the U.S. where methanol use is largely banned. Including these emissions in GEOS-Chem increases the level of surface ozone over South Korea and China by 1–3 ppb. KORUS-AQ aircraft profiles also indicate a high free tropospheric methanol background of 3.2 ppb, which appears to be of terrestrial biospheric origin but cannot be reproduced by GEOS-Chem."

Houston, TX experienced a notable biomass burning (BB) event associated with this wildfire smoke from Jun 4 to 9, 2023. The vertical transport of this smoke layer down to the surface followed afternoon convective activity in the Houston urban area on Jun 6–8. Our monitoring sites at urban, rural, and coastal locations around Houston experienced different levels of wildfire smoke. Carbon monoxide, aerosol absorption, and the Absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) revealed stronger smoke incursions overnight at the urban site. The average nighttime AAE during the BB event period was 1.28 with 384 ppbv of CO; by comparison, the monthly nighttime averages for Jun 2023 were 1.03 and 172 ppbv, respectively. Enhanced PM2.5 and NO2 coincided with BB tracers while higher ozone concentrations were observed the following day at downwind sites relative to the peak observed BB smoke sites. The nighttime NO2 for the BB event was also significantly higher than the monthly average with standard deviation for Jun 2023 (14.5 ppbv versus 5.19 ± 4.61 ppbv, respectively). Ozone concentrations peaked over 100 ppbv on Jun 9 driven by clear skies after the overnight high BB. Understanding the role of convective activity in enhancing the downdraft of BB plumes to the surface will improve assessment of the long-range impacts of wildfire smoke on urban populations."

 Anthropogenic emission reductions resulting from carbon neutrality and clean air policies in China, one of the world’s major emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and aerosols, are likely to influence regional and global photovoltaic (PV) outputs by affecting climate change. Here, we use the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to assess quantitatively how China’s emission reductions toward carbon neutrality will influence the PV potential (PVPOT) and the extremely low PV outputs in the mid-21st century (2041−2060). We find that the large reductions in anthropogenic emissions in the context of China’s carbon neutrality will increase the PVPOT and reduce the occurrence of extremely low PV outputs over some regions in the mid-low latitude continents, especially in East Asia, mainly through increasing the downwelling solar flux at the surface. Our results indicate that China’s carbon neutrality and clean air policies will not only trigger local positive feedback between anthropogenic emission reductions and PV increases but will also generate additional PV enhancements to remote regions, including eastern Australia, South Asia, southern Africa, and eastern South America. This will ultimately accelerate the process of global carbon neutrality in the coming decades."

 •OH reactivity (k′), which is the inverse of •OH lifetime and can be determined by measuring the decay rate of •OH radicals as total •OH reactivity (ktotal′), or summing reactivity from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NOx, and other inorganics as calculated •OH reactivity (kcalc′). k′ is usually underestimated by kcalc′, with the discrepancy named as missing •OH reactivity (kmissing′), mainly representing the reactivity of unknown VOCs. kmissing′ plays an important role in understanding the overall reactivity balance and the production of photochemical oxidants. Given that the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) can simulate k′ and ozone production, uncertainties arise when apply these models to complex ambient atmospheres. We conducted smog-chamber experiments using VOC mixtures under well-controlled conditions. ktotal′ and trace species in the smog-chamber were measured and concurrently simulated by MCM model. The MCM reproduced initial time variations of trace species and ktotal′. We found a corresponding relationship of kmissing′/[HCHO] = 1.5 s−1 ppbv−1 based on the smog-chamber experiments and several field campaigns’ results in Japan. We further applied this factor in 2017 Tsukuba campaign to predict kmissing′ based on diurnal HCHO concentration and obtained good performance of kmissing′ when compared with ktotal′−kcalc′. Also, ozone production regimes were assessed and cross-compared with conventional sensitivity indicators includes [HCHO]/[NO2] and Σki[VOC]i/kN[NOx] based on MCM results.

 Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) and O3 fluxes and concentrations, along with environmental variables such as solar radiation and air temperature, were measured in a tropical rubber tree plantation in China from August 2018 to June 2019. The detected BVOC fluxes included five terpenoid compounds, isoprene and four monoterpenes, measured using a gradient (GRA) sampling system deployed on an above canopy flux tower. Isoprene accounted for only 13 % of total terpenoid emissions at this site. The remaining 87 % of total terpenoid emissions were dominated by α-pinene (16 %), camphene (20 %), β-pinene (19 %), and limonene (32 %). Isoprene and monoterpene emission fluxes showed clear diurnal variations, with higher emissions around noon and lower emissions in the morning and late evening. The emission peaks typically occurred several hours after the peak in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) around noon. Isoprene and monoterpene emissions also varied seasonally. O3 fluxes were negative (downward) and peaked around noon, with the highest fluxes observed in the dry season. BVOC concentrations at the bottom and top levels were higher around noon, and concentrations were higher at the bottom level than at the top level, indicating upward fluxes. O3 concentrations at the bottom and top levels showed clear diurnal variations, with higher values around noon. O3 concentrations at the top level were higher than those at the bottom level. BVOC emissions and ozone flux, along with their concentrations, are correlated with atmospheric conditions including PAR, air temperature (T), and water vapor and appear to be influenced by smoke plumes. The relationships between BVOC emission, ozone flux, atmospheric conditions (represented by S/Q, the ratio of solar scattered radiation to global radiation), and their concentrations and S/Q were investigated. These relationships can be used to better understand and inform strategies for controlling ozone pollution in China and other locations."

 The impact of aerosol on the development of deep convective clouds and the growth of hydrometeors was investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with a detailed spectral bin microphysics scheme. The simulated cloud top temperature, the vertical profile of moving speed of hydrometeors, and the spatial distributions of precipitation rate were compared with observations from satellite, cloud radar, and weather stations, respectively. The results show that the smaller cloud droplets in the polluted condition have greater mobility with ambient air, which can reach up to 10 km of altitude comparing with 7 km in clean condition, thereby increase the collecting efficiency between ice crystals and supercooled liquid droplets therein. Moreover, ice crystals move slowly around 8 km, thereby facilitating the riming of ice particles by supercooled water to form hailstones. The efficient upward transport of cloud droplets in the convective core area further amplifies this process. Increased aerosol concentration enhances the hail production rate by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, and results in a 3.48 % increase in effective terminal velocity of hailstone from surface to 4.5 km. The aerosol-induced hail growth effect is stronger over convective cores than that over non-core area. The intensified sedimentation of hail and its accompanying melting in strong downdraft regions contribute to the increased surface precipitation at late stage of convection in polluted condition."

We use Juno Microwave Radiometer observations of a large-scale storm in 2017 to study the aftermath of such a storm on the atmosphere. Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at. These observations, aided by simulations, show that the water and ammonia cycles are coupled and that their combined effect plays a key role in explaining the depletion of ammonia in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn."

China’s COVID-19 lockdown greatly suppressed these emissions, yet the spatiotemporal patterns of emissions may have shifted as restrictions eased. Here, we developed hourly link-level inventories of GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions from on-road vehicles in Beijing for 2022 and 2023, leveraging extensive observational traffic data and machine learning models. Our analysis revealed that vehicle activity in Beijing greatly increased in 2023 following the relaxation of pandemic control measures, particularly on expressways and during weekends. This resulted in  21%, 22%, and 24% increases in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, respectively, compared to 2022. The rebound was concentrated in two short periods of the strict 2022 lockdowns, accounting for over two-thirds of the total increase in 2023, underscoring the impact of human activity. Furthermore, we found that vehicle fleet updates in 2023 helped slightly mitigate the rebound in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, reducing their total emissions by 8.4%, 6.8%, and 5.1%, respectively. This study precisely quantifies the postpandemic rebound effects, identifies the underlying causes, and provides a framework that can be applied to analyze the emission reduction effects of various local policies."

Sulfur isotope (δ34S) has been used to trace the SO42– formation pathways based on sulfur fractionation. Accurately assessing δ34S fractionation is crucial to quantify SO42– formation pathways. However, previous studies have used particle-phase δ34S to estimate δ34S fractionation (α34Sg→p-estimated) in SO42– formation, leading to significant uncertainties. δ34S values of gas-to-particle (δ34SO2 and δ34SO42–) were synchronously measured to uncover isotope fractionation (α34Sg→p). Results found that α34Sg→p (−3.7‰ to +9.9‰) obtained by gas-to-particle δ34S showed a significant difference with α34Sg→p-estimated(−6.4‰ to +1.4‰) obtained by δ34SO42–, implying different results for SO42– formation using the two methods. Among them, α34Sg→p results indicated the prominent pathway of NO2 oxidation (48–56%), while α34Sg→p-estimated suggested the dominant role of transition metal ion (TMI)-catalyzed O2 (54–80%). Additionally, α34Sg→p results show a more reasonable response to SO42– formation and consistent trends with oxidant concentrations. α34Sg→p-estimated overestimated the TMI-catalyzed O2 pathway contribution (38–47%) to SO42– formation. This is the first study to employ gas-to-particle δ34S to demonstrate the dominant role of NO2 oxidation in SO42– formation. This approach provides new insight into using δ34SO42– for the analysis of SO42– formation."

Sedlacek III;Qi Zhang,Chemical Evolution of Biomass Burning Aerosols across Wildfire Plumes in the Western U.S.: From Near-Source to Regional Scales,"The atmospheric processing of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) and its implications for tropospheric aerosol physicochemical properties remain uncertain. To address this gap, we investigate the chemical transformation of BBOA from wildfire events in the western U.S., using data from aerosol mass spectrometers aboard the DOE G-1 aircraft and at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (∼2800 m a.s.l.) during the summers of 2013 and 2019. This study captures dynamic changes in submicron particulate matter (PM1) concentrations and chemical profiles within wildfire plumes that span a broad range of atmospheric ages, from fresh emissions (<30 min) to plumes transported for several days. As plumes age, the oxidation state of organic aerosols (OA) increases, accompanied by the formation of secondary aerosol components such as phenolic secondary OA (SOA) species, carboxylic acids, and potassium sulfate. Early plume evolution is marked by the evaporation of semivolatile components and the formation of alcohol and peroxide functional groups, while extended aging produces more oxidized species, including carboxylic acids and carbonyl compounds. Normalized excess mixing ratios (NEMRs) of OA to CO demonstrate a complex interplay between evaporation, SOA formation, and oxidative loss. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), we identify distinct BBOA types representing various stages of atmospheric processing and assess the contributions of primary BBOA and secondary BBOA formed through atmospheric reactions. These findings shed light on the intricate mechanisms governing the evolution of BBOA characteristics within wildfire plumes, providing critical insights to improve atmospheric modeling of BBOA and better assess the environmental and climatic impacts of wildfire emissions."

However, the effect of extreme heatwaves on this sensitivity remains uncertain. Here, we present controlled measurements of isoprene temperature responses for a subtropical eucalyptus species, revealing a surprising shift during heatwaves. During non‐heatwave periods, isoprene emissions followed established temperature sensitivity patterns with a well‐defined optimum temperature (Topt); However, heatwaves restricted plant physiological processes, resulting in an unexpected decrease in Topt. Current models, which consider acclimation effect based on long‐term temperature averages, failed to capture this shift, predicting higher Topt values during heatwaves. Remarkably, simulations using the default model curve that assumes no acclimation accurately replicated the observed isoprene emissions under both non‐heatwave and heatwave conditions. Our findings highlight the potential for extreme heat to suppress isoprene emissions in tropical regions and the need to reconsider isoprene‐temperature relationships under future climate."

Accurate prediction of air quality effects from wildfires remains challenging due to uncertainties in fire emission estimates. To enhance the accuracy of fire emissions used in air quality forecast models, we developed a method that utilizes satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations and air quality simulations to calculate dynamic emission scaling factors and improve wildfire air quality forecasts. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) data are employed to fill AOD gaps under thick smoke using two approaches: a regression model and an artificial intelligence model. The scaling factor method was applied to NOAA blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product. The emission scaling factors exhibited significant variability across different fire points, highlighting the need for point‐specific scaling factors. On average, scaling factors were less than 1.0 (indicating emission overestimation) during the initial stages of fire events but exceeded 1.0 (suggesting underestimation) after 7 days of fire duration. An inverse relationship between scaling factors and fire radiative power (FRP) was observed, with emission underestimation for low‐intensity fires (FRP <5 MW) and substantial overestimation for high‐intensity fires (FRP >500 MW). The improved fire emissions were employed in the air quality model for the 2020 US Gigafire event. Utilizing emission scaling factors reduced model bias, increased the correlation and hit rate of PM2.5 exceedance prediction, demonstrating the potential of using emission scaling factors for improving air quality forecasting during wildfire events."

Here, the simulated cloud fraction by the sixth version of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6‐GEM5) was evaluated using CALIPSO lidar retrievals and the second version of the Cloud Feedback Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP2) for the years 2014 and 2015. Horizontal and vertical distributions of clouds in the CRCM6‐GEM5 model were evaluated using cloud profiles and four cloud categories (total, high‐, mid‐, and low‐level clouds) derived directly from the CRCM6‐GEM5 model and treated using the COSP2 satellite simulator. A seasonal analysis was conducted across specific regions in North America. Results showed that the use of COSP2 is essential for comparing CRCM6‐GEM5 outputs against satellite data to account for variable definitions and signal attenuation of active instruments (e.g., Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization: CALIOP). Spatial and vertical cloud distributions and seasonal patterns were generally well represented by the CRCM6‐GEM5 for both winter (December–February) and summer (June–August). High‐ and low‐level clouds were particularly well‐represented, especially in winter. The CRCM6‐GEM5 model demonstrated some difficulty producing enough clouds to accurately represent those at mid‐level. Cloud fraction representation was systematically better during winter than summer. The CRCM6‐GEM5 generally performed well over the whole North American domain for the four cloud categories and COSP2 was confirmed to help mitigate discrepancies in variable definitions. These results contribute to a better understanding of the CRCM6‐GEM5 cloud representations and the use of COSP2 with high‐resolution models."

 The large indicated associations between aerosols and cloud radiative effects imply large negative radiative forcing, i.e., cooling incurred by the aerosols’ effects on clouds, if their relationships are causal. The alternative explanation is aerosol-meteorology co-variability. Here, we examine whether aerosols are the primary driver of aerosol-cloud co-variability, i.e., constituting susceptibility of the cloud properties to aerosols. It is done by domains affected by volcanic aerosols, where the aerosol-meteorology co-variability is expected to be minimized. We hypothesize that volcanic aerosols would reduce aerosol-meteorology co-variability under similar meteorology, thus diminishing aerosol-cloud co-variability. However, our findings in both volcanic and non-volcanic regions across the global oceans indicate a consistent pattern of aerosol-cloud co-variability. This does not prove definitively a causal link between aerosols and cloud properties, but mininimizes the probability that meteorological co-variability is a major cause."

 High-resolution near-surface NO2 data are crucial for monitoring air pollution dynamics. Satellite-based machine learning models are commonly used to estimate NO2 concentrations, but tailoring advanced deep learning techniques to specific environmental problems remains challenging. This study applies a two-stage deep learning approach to estimate ground-level NO2 concentrations in England at a 1 km spatial resolution from 2019 to 2021. Initially, we imputed the TROPOMI NO2 column density to a continuous 1 km resolution. We then developed an efficient spatial-and-local-aware deep learning network (SLNet) for NO2 mapping by integrating the imputed TROPOMI NO2 data with multi-source information from meteorology, chemical transport model (CTM) simulations, and other auxiliary predictors. To address the translation invariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we combined a local channel to identify spatial heterogeneity in the model. Our imputed TROPOMI NO2 surfaces, which initially covered only 34.12 % of valid data, achieved full coverage with reliability and continuity at 1 km spatial resolution. Cross-validation confirmed that the SLNet model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in estimating ground-level NO2. The prediction model achieved R2 values of 0.914, 0.919, and 0.887 for 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, and performed well in urban regions. Additionally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method revealed that features such as satellite and CTM NO2, precipitation, green space, and road density significantly contributed to estimations through both spatial and local channels. The mapping results closely aligned with ground-level observations and accurately captured spatial variations. This study advances NO2 concentration estimation by applying adaptable deep learning techniques and enhances the understanding of air pollution dynamics."

 Aerosol properties over the Tibetan Plateau exert important impacts on weather and climate in this area and downstream regions. The influence of dust on aerosol properties over this region has been demonstrated by previous studies based on remote sensing. However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding how aerosol properties were influenced by dust and the evolution of dust events, especially in a temporally and vertically resolved way. In this study, aerosol microphysical and optical properties in summer were investigated by in-situ surface and tethered-balloon borne observations, which were also utilized to explore dust events with a joint analysis of the MERRA-2 reanalysis data and HYSPLIT backward trajectories. The PM1/PM10 ratios and scattering Ångström exponents were found to be quite low at most of the time during the campaign even in the absence of dust events, evidently suggesting that surface aerosol properties were persistently influenced by dust. Particle mass size distributions in the free troposphere also clearly revealed fingerprints of dust. An examination on individual dust event indicated that dust particles could be of local origins or long-range transported from deserts to the north of the plateau. This study helps improve our understanding on the influence of dust on aerosol properties, possible sources of observed dust particles and the evolution of dust events over this region. A future effort is worth undertaking to address potential impacts of dust-influenced aerosol properties on atmospheric processes of climatic importance by integrating various observations and model simulations."

 Brown carbon (BrC) is the ubiquitous part of the atmospheric organic carbon. It absorbs solar lights and greatly impacts the Earth's radiative balance. This study examines the spectral characteristics of BrC and its radiative effect in the Dhaka South (DS) site and Dhaka North (DN) site from July 2023 to January 2024 with a high-volume particulate matter sampler on quartz filters. Spectral characteristics such as absorption coefficient (babs-λ), mass absorption efficiency (MAE), absorption angstrom exponent (AAE), and refractive index (Κabs-λ) were determined by using a UV–visible spectrophotometer, and fluorescence emission spectra were analyzed in different pH by the fluorescent spectrophotometer. The concentrations of BrC and black carbon (BC) were determined by an aethalometer. The mean concentrations of BrC and BC in Dhaka city were 18.63 ± 3.84 μg m−3 and 17.93 ± 3.82 μg m−3, respectively. The AAE values lie in the range of 3.20–4.01 (DN) and 3.27–4.53 (DS), and the radiative forcing efficiency of BrC was obtained at 4.43 ± 1.02 W g−1 in DN and 3.93 ± 0.74 W g−1 in DS, indicating the presence of highly light-absorbing BrC in these locations. Average MAE and Κabs-λ values were 1.55 ± 0.45 m2g-1 and 0.044 ± 0.013, respectively, in DS, alternatively 1.84 ± 0.59 m2g-1 and 0.052 ± 0.016 in DN. The fluorescence excitation-emission spectra confirmed the presence of a polyconjugate cyclic ring with multifunctional groups in the structure of BrC. Light absorption properties and fluorescence emission spectra were varied with the change of pH. As the pH increased (2–8), the AAE value decreased and MAEBrC-365 increased due to protonation or deprotonation. This study highlights that the BrC has a significant impact on the air quality as well as the Earth's radiative balance, emphasizing its strong light-absorbing properties and variability with environmental factors."

 Satellite measurements of short-lived gaseous pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) provide an unprecedented opportunity to infer global distribution of their emission sources. However, the great differences in the magnitude of anthropogenic emissions have hampered the identification of pollution sources with satellite observations. In this study, we identified NO2 and CO pollution hotspots in China with oversampled TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) concentration data by utilizing an image segmentation method at provincial scale. We also determined the major emitting sectors associated with the pollution hotspots in each province. Based on NO2 pollution hotspots, we can find major emission sources, such as ports, airports, industrial and urban areas. In the hotspots of most provinces, Steel plant, Coke plant, and Power plant were identified as the main NOx emission sources. CO pollution hotspots were closely linked to Steel plant, with additional contributions from Coke plant, Chemical industry, and Non-ferrous metal smelting in certain provinces. The pollution hotspots and their corresponding concentrations yielded a relatively strong correlation with Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) (For NO2, the R2 was 0.937 in provinces with small land area and 0.654 in others, while for CO, the R2 was 0.849 and 0.659, respectively).

We simulated BC and BrC absorption during the intense Canadian boreal wildfires in June 2023 using an enhanced version of CHIMERE chemical and transport model. The study focused on a domain extending from North America to Eastern Europe, including the Arctic up to 85°N. The enhanced model includes an update treatment for BC absorption enhancement and a BrC aging scheme accounting for browning and blanching through oxidation. Validation against Aerosol Robotic Network and satellite data showed the model accurately reproduced aerosol optical depth (AOD) at multiple wavelengths, both near wildfire sources and during transoceanic transport to Europe. Improvements were observed in simulations of absorbing AOD (absorbing aerosol optical) compared with the baseline model. Significant enhancements were achieved in capturing the spatial distribution of aerosol absorption in areas affected by wildfire emissions. For June 2023, the regional all‐sky DRE attributed to Canadian wildfires was reduced from −2.1 W/m2 in the control model to −1.9 W/m2 in the enhanced model. This corresponded to an additional warming effect of +0.2 W/m2 (+10%) due to the advanced treatment of BC and BrC absorption. These results indicate the importance of accurate aerosol absorption modeling in regional climate predictions, during large‐scale biomass burning events. They also highlight potential overestimations of cooling effects in traditional models, emphasizing the need of improved aerosol parameterization to better simulate the DRE and for evaluating the impacts of mitigation strategies."

The multiple experiments on observing droplets were conducted in the air‐sea boundary layer using a self‐developed droplet spectrometer. The concentration and upward velocity of large droplets with particle sizes ranging from 25μm to 1.6 mm were obtained. The sea spray generation function was analyzed using the observed data, and the results showed that the sea salt aerosol (SSA) flux of large droplets was much higher than that given by existing sea spray generation functions, providing a new generation function for large droplets in calculating SSA flux in ocean models."

 Heterogeneous reactions of toluene with mineral oxides play a crucial role in the formation processes of N-containing organic compounds (NOCs). However, less attention was paid to the effects of pollutant content and temperature changes on the formation of NOCs under combined pollution. In this study, the combined effects on the heterogeneous reaction of toluene/NO2/NH3 with α-Fe2O3/α-Al2O3 particles were investigated by using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The results show that the characteristic peak of the R-ONO2 group appears at 1295 cm−1, indicating benzyl nitrate formation in the presence of α-Fe2O3 with or without α-Al2O3. The addition of α-Al2O3 promotes the R-ONO2 formation on the particle surface compared to pure α-Fe2O3 as a result of the dispersion and oxidation of the additional particles. The optimal mass ratio of α-Fe2O3 and α-Al2O3 particles is 3:1. Furthermore, the optimal concentration ratio for toluene, NO2 and NH3 is determined as 2.5:2.5:1. It is obvious that NO2 and toluene are the primary sources of organic nitrates production. Higher concentration proportions of NO2 and toluene within a certain range lead to higher formation amounts of NOCs during the heterogeneous reaction. Spectral analysis demonstrates that reaction kinetics, such as reaction rate and uptake coefficient, are sensitive to temperature variations. When temperature decreases from 298 K to 253 K, the reaction rate increases from (1.59 ± 0.04) × 1018 ions g−1 s−1 to (2.38 ± 0.02) × 1018 ions g−1 s−1. Low temperature favors the production of R-ONO2, resulting from an exothermic process during the heterogeneous reaction. These findings are helpful for further exploring the combined effects on particulate NOCs formation and partly contribute to understanding of multicomponent reaction systems in real environment conditions."

 This study investigates long-term (1980–2014) surface ozone (O3) variability over India using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, offering a comprehensive spatial assessment crucial for addressing air quality and climate change challenges. Model outputs were compared with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) derived surface O3 to evaluate their reliability. Results reveal a persistent north-south gradient in surface O3, with higher values over northern India, consistent with satellite data. Most models indicate a positive trend in surface O3 across the country, while a negative trend is identified over parts of the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a previously unreported phenomenon. Analysis of precursor gases shows significant positive trends over India, with the IGP emerging as a hotspot. Spatial correlations between surface O3 and its precursors highlight regional heterogeneity and complex formation dynamics. VOC-limited regimes dominate across India, whereas NO/NO2-limited chemistry prevails in the IGP, explaining the decreasing trend of surface O3 despite rising NO/NO2 emissions. Among the CMIP6 models, CESM2-WACCM-FV2 is identified as the most reliable for studying surface O3 in India. The spatial distribution provided by CMIP6 models is particularly valuable in regions lacking long-term monitoring, where ground-based observations are limited to point-based measurements. This study underscores the critical role of CMIP6 models in understanding surface O3 variability and highlights the utility of satellite-derived data as a complementary resource. The findings provide actionable insights for policy efforts to mitigate surface O3 and its precursors, improving air quality and addressing climate challenges in India."

 Effects of humic like substances (HULIS) on cloud condensation nuclei, initiation of ice, and global radiative forcing of clouds highlight their significant influence on climate dynamics. However, optical properties of HULIS in cloud water and their indications remain poorly understood. Cloud water samples were gathered from June through August 2021 at Mt. Tai, China, and HULIS and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) within these samples were quantitatively analyzed. The optical characteristics of these substances were examined using UV–Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The average concentration of HULIS was 3.14 ± 2.14 mgC L−1 contributing 38 ± 15 wt% to WSOC (9.42 ± 7.50 mgC L−1). A mass absorption efficiency value at 365 nm (MAE365) of 0.72 m2 g−1 and an absorption Ångström exponent (AAE300–400) value of 3.79 were measured for HULIS compared to 0.54 m2 g−1 and 3.58 for WSOC. Three fluorescent components, i.e., less oxygenated HULIS (LO-HULIS), highly oxygenated HULIS (HO-HULIS), and protein-like substances (PRLIS), were identified in both HULIS and WSOC employing EEM and parallel factor analysis. HULIS light absorption was dominated by HO-HULIS, followed by that of LO-HULIS and PRLIS. Compared to WSOC, HULIS exhibited enhanced light absorption and a higher degree of humification, attributed to its elevated levels of HO-HULIS and LO-HULIS alongside reduced PRLIS. Furthermore, the degradation of PRLIS was posited as a potential pathway for LO-HULIS formation based on the increasing trend in the ratio of LO-HULIS:PRLIS with decreasing PRLIS in WSOC. This study explores secondary HULIS formation in cloud water, advancing our understanding of HULIS evolution."

Using quantum chemical calculations and box model simulation with an updated Master Chemical Mechanism, we found that the formation pathway of chloroacetic acid involved multiphase processes. Our study enhances understanding of atmospheric organic chlorine chemistry and emphasizes the importance of multiphase reactions. 
 Chlorine-containing oxygenated volatile organic compounds (Cl-OVOCs) are indicators of atmospheric chlorine chemistry involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, their formation mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Herein, a strong diel pattern of chloroacetic acid (C2H3O2Cl) was observed with daytime peaks at 19 and 13 ppt (1 h averages) in 2020 and 2021, respectively, at a coastal site in southern China. Ethene was previously proposed as the primary precursor responsible for daytime C2H3O2Cl levels, but a photochemical box model based on Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) simulations indicates that ethene accounts for less than 1 %. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that other alkenes also can act as chloroacetic acid precursors. Using an updated gas-phase VOC–Cl chemistry model, we find that isoprene, the most abundant VOC at the sampling site, along with its oxidation products, accounts for 7 % of the observed C2H3O2Cl.  Moreover, the simulation with the updated MCM produces appreciable levels of other Cl-OVOCs, especially chloroacetaldehyde, a precursor of C2H3O2Cl. We proposed the multiphase reaction of Cl-OVOCs to reconcile the overestimation of Cl-OVOCs and the underestimation of C2H3O2Cl in our gas-phase model. The estimated reactive uptake coefficients for various Cl-OVOCs range from 3.63×10-5 to 2.34×10-2, based on quantum chemical calculations and linear relationship modelling. The box model simulation with multiphase chemistry shows that the heterogeneous conversion of chloroacetaldehyde to C2H3O2Cl can contribute 24 %–48 % of the observed levels. Our study thus proposes a formation mechanism of gaseous C2H3O2Cl and highlights the potential importance of multiphase processes in atmospheric organic acid formation."

Direct deposition measurements are generally more reliable at local scale than dust deposition models, even those based on aerosol concentration measurements. Whatever the scale, relevant local observations are necessary for model evaluation. We present here the results obtained by direct measurement of atmospheric aerosols and total atmospheric deposition using a 14‐month time series from the Caribbean region. Total deposition velocity, lifetime, and scavenging ratio of major and trace elements were determined. Comparing total deposition fluxes of aluminum (dust proxy) and sea‐salt sodium (sea‐salt proxy) with Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) outputs shows that the modeled total deposition rate is underestimated by a factor of two for dust and by a factor of eight for sea salt, while model aerosol concentration is larger than concentration measured near ground level. This result is due to wet deposition being underestimated in the model. The scavenging ratio (w/w) of Saharan dust elements ranges from 95 to 1,390, with a median of 530, close to the geometric mean value of 513. Sea salt presents a greater range of scavenging ratio values, from 325 to 2,355, with a median of 1,180, close to the geometric mean value of 1,030.

 Satellite and reanalysis data over the 2003–2022 period are used to study how the monthly variations of marine stratocumulus (MSc) to the west of Canary Islands and Namibia are influenced by thermodynamic variables and aerosols. Although the estimated inversion strength (EIS) has been thought to be the main predictor of low-cloud cover (LCC), the seasonal cycles of EIS and LCC differ significantly in the Canary MSc region. In linear regression models, adding dust aerosol (DA) optical depth as a predictor improves the prediction of LCC across all seasons and almost everywhere in the region compared to using EIS alone. In boreal summer, large amount of DAs are transported from the Sahara to the Canary MSc region. Analysis of the regression models shows that DAs contribute more than EIS to the Canary summer LCC maximum, reducing the error by up to 11 %. Biomass-burning aerosols (BBAs) also improve the prediction of LCC in the Canary MSc region, but less so than DAs, suggesting that BBAs are less effective as cloud condensation nucleii. Other known thermodynamic predictors of LCC (sea surface temperature, horizontal surface temperature advection, near-surface wind speed, and free-tropospheric relative humidity and vertical velocity) also improve the prediction, but much less effectively than the aerosols. In the Namibia MSc region, there are virtually no DAs but BBAs are abundant. There, EIS alone captures well the seasonal cycle of LCC. In this region, the effect of BBAs on LCC is hidden behind that of EIS, potentially because BBA optical depth and EIS coincidentally have similar seasonal cycles."

To identify the primary modes of East Asian UTLS ozone variability, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was conducted, revealing that the first three EOF modes account for approximately two-thirds of the total variability. The first EOF mode, characterized by a monopole pattern, is associated with the Polar–Eurasian-like teleconnection. Additionally, the second and third EOF modes, featuring meridional and zonal dipole patterns, are linked to the West Pacific-like teleconnection and the British–Baikal Corridor-like teleconnection, respectively. It was found that UTLS ozone concentrations increase over troughs and decrease over ridges of these atmospheric stationary waves in the mid-latitudes. The increase in UTLS ozone concentration caused by these stationary atmospheric waves is expected to create favorable background conditions for a stronger intrusion of stratospheric ozone into the mid-troposphere. Additionally, our results indicate that stratospheric ozone can sustain these stationary atmospheric waves by modulating geopotential height through solar radiation absorption. These findings highlight the crucial role of dynamic-chemical interactions in advancing our understanding of the UTLS system."

Our results suggest that haze particles and their interactions with cloud droplets should be considered especially in polluted conditions. To properly simulate haze–cloud interactions, we need to resolve droplet activation and deactivation processes, instead of using Twomey-type activation parameterization. 
 It is known that aqueous haze particles can be activated into cloud droplets in a supersaturated environment. However, haze–cloud interactions have not been fully explored, partly because haze particles are not represented in most cloud-resolving models. Here, we conduct a series of large-eddy simulations (LESs) of a cloud in a convection chamber using a haze-capable Eulerian-based bin microphysics scheme to explore haze–cloud interactions over a wide range of aerosol injection rates. Results show that the cloud is in a slow microphysics regime at low aerosol injection rates, where the cloud responds slowly to an environmental change and droplet deactivation is negligible. The cloud is in a fast microphysics regime at moderate aerosol injection rates, where the cloud responds quickly to an environmental change and haze–cloud interactions are important. More interestingly, two more microphysics regimes are observed at high aerosol injection rates due to haze–cloud interactions. Cloud oscillation is driven by the oscillation of the mean supersaturation around the critical supersaturation of aerosol due to haze–cloud interactions. Cloud collapse happens under weaker forcing of supersaturation where the chamber transfers cloud droplets to haze particles efficiently, leading to a significant decrease (collapse) in cloud droplet number concentration. One special case of cloud collapse is the haze-only regime. It occurs at extremely high aerosol injection rates, where droplet activation is inhibited, and the sedimentation of haze particles is balanced by the aerosol injection rate. Our results suggest that haze particles and their interactions with cloud droplets should be considered, especially in polluted conditions."

We found significant increases in chlorine (Cl)-rich and solid fuel combustion (SFC) sources, indicating dynamic emission sources, agricultural burning impacts, and meteorological influences. Surges in Cl-rich particles during cold periods highlight their role in particle growth under high-relative-humidity conditions. 
 High-time-resolution aerosol measurements across various Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) regions are critical due to these regions' dense populations, intense industrial activities, recurring pollution episodes, and agricultural practices, as well as the associated health impacts and broader climate implications of aerosol. However, studies (mostly offline) have been predominantly concentrated in the upper IGP (U-IGP), with limited spatial coverage across the central IGP (C-IGP). This study aims to bridge the gap by examining both U-IGP and C-IGP regions, offering an in-depth analysis of elemental concentrations, source apportionment, inter-regional comparisons, seasonal variations, meteorological influences, and health risks through high-resolution Xact measurements conducted at three urban locations. During the colder seasons, elements such as sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K) were found to dominate elemental PM2.5 concentrations, while the warm seasons showed notable changes in aluminum (Al), silica (Si), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) concentrations. These variations underscore the influence of meteorological conditions and different emission sources on pollution levels. From a health perspective, average levels of carcinogenic elements (lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr)) were usually kept below reference levels. However, Pb concentrations exceeded these thresholds by 40 %–50 % during both periods in the U-IGP, largely attributed to coal combustion and lead smelting activities. Using the Multilinear Engine 2 (ME-2) solver, positive matrix factorization (PMF) deconvolved Cl-rich, coal combustion, Cu-rich, dust, solid fuel combustion 1 (SFC1), SFC2, and S-rich components. In both IGP regions, Cl-rich sources, S-rich sources, and SFC1 dominated the elemental sources, with differences observed in their relative contributions, indicating the influence of regional emissions. The role of meteorology in elemental PM2.5 variations during both clean and polluted episodes in the IGP regions was observed. During pollution episodes, the relative contribution of Cl-rich sources increased when PM2.5 concentrations showed a sharp increase as compared to clean periods, especially during cold periods, indicating the role of emissions from trash burning (plastic and PVC) and steel industries along with favorable meteorological conditions in the formation and accumulation of pollutants. During the warm period, the relative contribution of Cl-rich sources in the C-IGP is less, but during the cold period, both the U-IGP and the C-IGP have significant Cl-rich source contributions (44 %), indicating the role of chlorine in extreme haze air pollution in the whole IGP region. During warm periods, high-pollution events occurred across the IGP with major contributions from SFC1 (crop residue burning), indicating that severe pollution events also depend on seasonal emission sources despite less favorable meteorological conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of elemental pollution across the IGP, offering a robust foundation for devising targeted mitigation strategies and regulatory policies to safeguard public health in this densely populated region."

Based on the emitted concentrations, isoprene is one of the top three species contributing to O3 formation, which may be overlooked in observed concentrations. 
 The emissions and secondary transformations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a significant role in ozone (O3) formation. Previous studies have often relied on ambient VOC concentrations to identify key species. However, ambient concentrations represent the residual concentrations after the emitted VOCs have been consumed, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method to identify the key VOC species in both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. The emitted VOC concentrations are calculated during both nighttime and daytime in summer using the nitrate radical, O3, and hydroxyl radical reaction rates and ambient concentrations of 99 VOCs measured at Deyang, Chengdu, and Meishan, China.  The emitted concentrations of alkenes and aromatics are higher than the ambient concentrations. The largest differences between emitted and ambient concentrations are 1.04 ppbv for cis-2-butene at Deyang, 0.81 ppbv for isoprene at Chengdu, and 1.79 ppbv for isoprene at Meishan. In contrast, due to secondary production, the emitted concentrations of oxygenated VOCs are lower than the ambient concentrations. The largest differences are −0.54 ppbv for acetone at Deyang, −0.58 ppbv for acetaldehyde at Chengdu, and −0.5 ppbv for acetone at Meishan. Based on the emitted concentrations, isoprene is one of the top three species contributing to O3 formation at all three sites, which may be overlooked in observed concentrations.  Comprehensive calculation of the emitted VOC concentrations enables the key VOC species in O3 formation to be accurately identified."

The data set comprises in situ and remote sensing observations from three research aircraft: HALO, Polar 5, and Polar 6. All data are published in the PANGAEA database by instrument-separated data subsets. It is highlighted how the scientific analysis of the HALO–(AC)3 data benefits from the coordinated operation of three aircraft. 
 The HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 aircraft campaign was carried out in March and April 2022 over the Norwegian and Greenland seas, the Fram Strait, and the central Arctic Ocean. Three research aircraft – the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), Polar 5, and Polar 6 – performed 54 partly coordinated research flights on 23 flight days over areas of open ocean, the marginal sea ice zone (MIZ), and the central Arctic sea ice. The general objective of the research flights was to quantify the evolution of air mass properties during moist and warm-air intrusions (WAIs) and cold-air outbreaks (CAOs). To obtain a comprehensive data set, the three aircraft operated following different strategies. HALO was equipped with active and passive remote sensing instruments and dropsondes to cover the regional evolution of cloud and thermodynamic processes. Polar 5 carried a similar remote sensing payload to HALO, and Polar 6 was instrumented with in situ cloud, aerosol, and trace gas instruments focusing on the initial air mass transformation close to the MIZ. The processed, calibrated, and validated data are published in the World Data Center PANGAEA as instrument-separated data subsets and listed in aircraft-separated collections for HALO (Ehrlich et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.968885), Polar 5 (Mech et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.968883), and Polar 6 (Herber et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.968884). A detailed overview of the available data sets is provided here. Furthermore, the campaign-specific instrument setup, the data processing, and quality are summarized. Based on measurements conducted during a specific CAO, it is shown that the scientific analysis of the HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 data benefits from the coordinated operation of the three aircraft."

Taylor;Jr.;Devon N. Higgins;Justin M. Krasnomowitz;Murray V. Johnston,"Ultrafine Particle Growth Rate During Biogenic Secondary Organic Matter Formation as a Function of Particle Composition, Size, and Phase","The growth rate of ultrafine seed particles by uptake of secondary organic matter (SOM) is studied with a flow tube reactor to elucidate key factors that can enhance or inhibit the rate. Through application of a time-dependent kinetic model, the molecular growth factor (GF) associated with SOM formation is determined. GF is defined as the fraction of the oxidation products from a biogenic precursor that contribute to seed particle growth. Two seed particle compositions (ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate) are studied under two phase states (effloresced and deliquesced at either 10% or 60% relative humidity) for growth by two different biogenic precursors (isoprene and α-pinene). The results show: (1) ammonium sulfate seed particles give higher GFs than ammonium bisulfate seed particles, (2) increasing the water content of the seed particle increases the GF, and (3) isoprene and α-pinene show the same dependencies of GF on seed particle composition and water content. These dependencies suggest that physicochemical processes in the aqueous layer at or near the air–particle interface enhance the growth rate of particles in the 40 to 80 nm size range, which is relevant to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei."

Al-Mashala;Meredith Schervish;Sithumi M. Liyanage;Jace A. Barton;Manabu Shiraiwa;Elijah G. Schnitzler,Multiphase Processing of the Water-Soluble and Insoluble Phases of Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol,"Biomass burning is one of the most significant sources of organic aerosol in the atmosphere. Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) has been observed to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to give core–shell morphology with the hydrophobic phase encapsulating the hydrophilic phase, potentially impacting the evolution of light-absorbing components, i.e., brown carbon (BrC), through multiphase processes. Here, we demonstrate how multiphase processing differs between the water-soluble (i.e., hydrophilic) and insoluble (i.e., hydrophobic) phases of BBOA in terms of reactive uptake of ozone in a coated-wall flow tube. Effects of relative humidity (RH) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation were investigated. Experimental timeseries were used to inform simulations using multilayer kinetic modeling. Among non-irradiated thin films, the uptake coefficient was greatest for the water-soluble phase at 75% RH (3 × 10–5, corresponding to a diffusion coefficient of BrC, DBrC, of 3 × 10–9 cm2 s–1) and least for the same phase at 0% RH (1 × 10–5, corresponding to DBrC of 1 × 10–10 cm2 s–1). The uptake coefficient for the water-insoluble phase fell between these two (about 1.5 × 10–5), regardless of RH, and the corresponding DBrC increased only slightly (8 × 10–10 cm2 s–1 at 0% RH to 9 × 10–10 cm2 s–1 at 75% RH). The uptake coefficients of both phases at 0% RH decreased significantly after UV irradiation, consistent with a transition from viscous liquid to solid and supported by qualitative microscopy observations. Modeling multiphase ozone oxidation of primary BrC components in the atmosphere demonstrated, first, that LLPS may extend the lifetime of water-soluble BBOA encapsulated by water-insoluble species by a factor of 1.5 at moderate to high RH and, also, that UV irradiation may extend the lifetime of both phases by more than a factor of 2.5."

A. J. Brown;N. J. Warwick;A. T. Archibald,Multi‐Model Assessment of Future Hydrogen Soil Deposition and Lifetime Using CMIP6 Data,"Atmospheric hydrogen indirectly contributes to greenhouse warming by extending methane lifetime, and increasing stratospheric water vapor and tropospheric ozone. Its main sinks are oxidation with OH, and dry deposition via microbial soil uptake. The latter accounts for approximately 50−90% $50-90\,\%$ of the sink and is poorly constrained under present day conditions, with very limited studies on its future evolution. This work uses an offline hydrogen deposition scheme to perform the first multi‐model assessment of deposition velocities driven using data from five models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 6 project. Deposition values calculated from historical data are compared to observations, and deposition velocities are evaluated across four scenarios (2015−2100) $(2015-2100)$. We find deposition velocity increases with time and stronger climate forcing. A 20% $\%$ present‐day, inter‐model discrepancy, linked to differences in soil moisture and porosity, leads to a 33% $\%$ variation in hydrogen's global warming potential over a 100‐year time horizon."

Iraci,Global Source-Receptor-Relationship Database for Integrated Tropospheric Ozone Observations from Multiplatform Datasets in Western North America during 1994–2021,"Atmospheric observations show that free tropospheric ozone has increased across the Northern Hemisphere over the past three decades. The sources driving this increase remain unclear. In this study, we developed a source-receptor relationship database combining harmonized multiplatform ozone data and advanced atmospheric transport modeling. This database can identify emission regions responsible for ozone increases and can also be used to analyze other co-observed atmospheric constituents. 
 Long-term atmospheric ozone observations in Western North America (WNA) provide essential data for assessing tropospheric ozone trends. Backward atmospheric simulations based on these observations establish the source-receptor relationships (SRRs) to improve our understanding of the factors driving ozone trends across different regions, time periods, and atmospheric layers. In this study, we integrated 28 years of ozone data (1994–2021) from ozonesondes, lidar, commercial aircraft, and aircraft campaigns across WNA, spanning the upper atmospheric boundary layer, free troposphere, and upper troposphere (i.e., 900 to 300 hPa). We reconciled the multiplatform datasets using a data fusion framework to generate 553,608 gridded ozone receptors. For each receptor, we use the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model, driven by ERA5 reanalysis data, to achieve the SRRs calculations, providing global simulations at high temporal (hourly) and spatial (1° x 1°) resolution from the surface up to 20 km above ground level. This SRR database retains detailed information for each receptor, including the gridded ozone value product, which enables user to illustrate and identify source contributions to various subsets of ozone observations in the troposphere above WNA over nearly 3 decades at different vertical layers and temporal scales, such as diurnal, daily, seasonal, intra-annual, and decadal. More generally, the calculated SRRs are applicable to any study looking to evaluate origins of airmasses reaching WNA. As such, this database can support source contribution analyses for other atmospheric components observed over WNA, if other co-located observations have been made at the spatial and temporal scales defined for some or all of the gridded ozone receptors used here."

The data show a relatively large level of variability, but also important trends in greenhouse gases, and signals from fires as well as seasonal biological activity. 
 Long-term and high-precision measurements of the mole fraction of greenhouse gases (GHG), together with their isotopic composition, are of fundamental importance to understand land-atmosphere interactions. Current flask monitoring programs have important information gaps in large regions of the Earth, particularly in the southern hemisphere and in continental tropical regions. Here, we report on the initiation of a monitoring program and the resulting dataset of high-precision GHG measurements at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), located in the central Amazon region of Brazil. In September 2021, we installed an automated flask sampler designed and built by the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to collect air samples in 3-liter flasks at a height of 324 m above ground level. Samples are collected weekly, during a one-hour integration time between 13:00 and 14:00 h local time (17:00–18:00 UTC). The flasks are shipped to Jena, Germany, for analyses of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, H2, SF6, 13C–CO2, 14C–CO2, 18O–CO2, 13C–CH4, 2H–CH4, O2/N2, and Ar/N2 at the laboratories of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC). Measurements from this monitoring program provide reference information for this site and act as an additional independent quality control for other measurements in the region. The record of SF6 and simulations based on a regional atmospheric transport model suggest that the footprint of the measurements is predominantly from the southeasterly and northeasterly directions. The time series of the different gas species measured in this monitoring program are being made publicly available through the ATTO data portal and the atmospheric flask sampling program of the MPI-BGC."

Observations of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5-Siloxane) are used for optimizing emissions from personal care products, para-dichlorobenzene (PDCBZ) for insecticides, and parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF) for emissions from the construction (coatings + adhesives) subsector. Continuous ground-site measurements obtained in Las Vegas and Los Angeles (LA) during summer 2021 are used to optimize the temporal emission profiles of the area sources. Additionally, in situ aircraft-based observations (June 2021) over the LA region are used to evaluate emission factors for the basin. The configuration of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is optimized using vertical wind profile measurements obtained from the Pick-Up truck-based Mobile Atmospheric Sounder (PUMAS) deployed in the LA basin to minimize the uncertainty of the inversion due to meteorology. While the diurnal amplitude in emission rates from personal care products and insecticides is reduced after optimization, that of construction VCPs (coatings + adhesives) is enhanced. From the aircraft inversion, we find that the inventory underestimates the emissions originating from construction by a factor of 5.3 (95% confidence interval 4.3–6.3) in the LA basin. Emissions from consumer products (personal care + cleaning) and insecticides were reduced by a factor of 2.1 (1.7–2.5) and 5.2 (3.9–6.4), respectively, following optimization."

This paper employed an integrated modeling approach, incorporating numerical simulations, statistical analyses, and machine learning to address this issue. We comprehensively accounted for the different driving mechanisms, along with the various migration and transformation processes of groundwater VOCs. This investigation identified 11 key factors influencing surface pollutant flux. The data-enhanced statistical surrogate models and sampling-fusion-based support vector machine (SVM) surrogate models were established for appropriate generic modeling applications in which the high computation burden and difficulty could be avoided of the complicated numerical modeling. Those models would enable accurate prediction of surface fluxes and reliable classification of environmental risks. Notably, the pollutant fluxes through the soil–air interface over a short period could be sufficient to cause slow-airflow space air concentrations to exceed acceptable levels. Particularly, the established generic statistical surrogate models and SVM surrogate models have significant implications in efficiently and rapidly assessing the VOCs surface fluxes and environmental risk with meaningful quantified uncertainties for specific site conditions."

To improve our understanding of the chemical and physical properties of BBA emitted at different times of the day and their evolution during atmospheric aging, we conducted a study as a part of the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality field campaign. Particle samples were collected onboard a research aircraft from smoke plumes from a wildfire in eastern Oregon during late afternoon and nighttime flights on August 28, 2019. A time-resolved aerosol collector was used to collect samples on substrates for offline spectromicroscopic imaging to investigate the single-particle characteristics of BBA particles. Approximately 20,400 individual particles from 10 selected samples were analyzed using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis, revealing their elemental composition, morphology, and viscosity. Elemental microanalysis indicated that aged potassium is likely found in the form of K2SO4, KNO3, and possible K-organic salts. Further chemical speciation and carbon bonding mapping within individual particles were conducted using synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Real-time, water-soluble light absorption measurements were acquired using a particle-into-liquid sampler instrument coupled to a liquid waveguide capillary cell and total organic analyzer. In the late afternoon samples, 65% of the total particle number population consisted entirely of organic components, compared to 46% in the nighttime particles. These differences were attributed to discrepancies in composition at the time of emission and to the daytime condensation and accumulation of photochemically formed secondary organic material on existing BBA particles, a process that halts at night. Microscopy images indicated that particle viscosity was lower in the nighttime particles (<101 Pa·s), likely due to increased relative humidity and a higher contribution from hygroscopic inorganic components. The chemical heterogeneity of individual particles was quantified using STXM-derived mixing state parameters. The nature of carbon bonding within individual particles was inferred from the extent of carbon sp2 hybridization derived from NEXAFS spectra. Average percentages of sp2 hybridization range between 40% and 60%, with no noticeable differences between late afternoon and nighttime flights. These findings were compared with the online optical properties of both late afternoon and nighttime smoke plumes, providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between chemical composition and optical properties of BBA particles at different times of the day."

The annual co-occurrence frequency ranged from 26% to 50% in the YRD from 2015 to 2022, with higher frequencies observed in coastal cities. Notably, the co-occurrence frequency was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic, implying that such co-occurrence may be more spatially widespread with continuous PM2.5 reduction in China. Taking the pandemic period as an example, we leveraged a machine learning algorithm (i.e., Random Forest) coupled with SHapley Additive ExPlanation (SHAP) to identify higher relative importance of solar radiation-related variables (e.g., surface net solar radiation) during co-occurrence periods compared to non-co-occurrence periods in the YRD. Additionally, incorporating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measurements, we further showed the higher relative importance of VOCs to the extremes of ozone and PM2.5 through a case study at Shaoxing (a typical city in the YRD). Overall, the findings highlight the increasing potentials for co-occurring extremes with ongoing PM2.5 reductions in the YRD and suggest that reducing VOCs (e.g., halocarbons) may help mitigate these extremes in the future."

SW07 occurred at the earliest winter time of the year recorded in the satellite era (1979 to present). The study found that, strong blocking highs affected stratospheric warming via nonlinear planetary wave prior to SW07, and the substantial sea ice loss over Antarctic Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea likely created favorable conditions for the formation of these blocking highs. Furthermore, the stratospheric preconditioning significantly amplified the intensity of the planetary waves. A downward‐propagating negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM) signal after SW07 supported blocking highs, creating a favorable circulation for planetary wave perturbations prior to SW08. In addition, enhanced ozone transport from low latitudes to the pole during SW07 and SW08 contributed to ozone recovery."

However, detectable ship‐tracks are not produced in many instances. Virtual ship‐tracks have been conceived to expand the scale of ACIs analyses. Cloud responses in virtual ship‐tracks differ strongly from those of detected ones. Here we show that the current approach of virtual ship‐tracks can lead to systematic biases and errors and suggest necessary improvements. Errors in trajectory modeling introduce mismatches between areas actually affected by ship‐emissions and virtual ship‐track locations, that is, positional errors. Positional errors systematically underestimate ACI signals and the underestimate is severe as indicated by analysis of cloud droplet number concentration changes. The assumption of fixed ship‐track width also systematically diminishes resulting aerosol effects by more than 10%, which leads to a forcing difference of around 0.1 Wm−2 $\mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$. We make suggestions to improve the simulation of virtual ship‐tracks so that their full potential for studying ACIs can be unleashed."

 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has complex effects on human health through ozone pollution and heatwave compound events (OPHW). Although the climatic driving mechanisms of single extreme events in China have been preliminarily confirmed, the nexus of ENSO-OPHW-population exposure risk remains unclear. This study collected Niño 3.4 index, surface O3 and 209 Chinese cities' meteorological station data during the warm seasons (May–October) of 2013–2020, to reveal the effects of the ENSO on the three types of OPHW (ozone pollution-daytime heatwave: OPDH, ozone pollution-nighttime heatwave: OPNH, and ozone pollution-daytime and nighttime compound heatwave: OPCH) and the OPHW risks in major cities in China, via spatiotemporal statistics and geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) modeling. Trend analyses indicate that ozone concentration, temperature, and the co-occurrence days of the three types of OPHW increase at a higher rate during El Niño periods than during La Niña periods. The driving effect of ENSO are found to amplify the OPHW is ranked as follows: ozone concentration (6.1 μg m−3) > temperature (1.8 °C) > co-occurrence days (0.2 days). Driven by the position of the subtropical high and anticyclonic changes over the continent, clear skies, high temperatures, low humidity, and low wind speeds significantly influence the three types of compound events. Moreover, during La Niña periods, the anomalous low-level anticyclone shows a significant southward shift compared to El Niño periods. During El Niño periods, the population exposure risk caused by OPHW is generally higher than during La Niña periods. OPDH, OPNH, and OPCH lead to the maximum relative changes of population exposure risk in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (100 %), Sichuan-Chongqing (44.5 %), and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (11.2 %) urban agglomerations, respectively. These findings highlight the need for targeted research on the differential impacts of various compound events on regional population health and ecosystems. This study provides critical insights and methodological support for coordinated responses to extreme event changes and ozone pollution management."

 The lower atmosphere close to the Earth's surface, though crucial for various process studies and models, still remained a gap area for a long. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) pioneered in collecting aerosol and cloud data using manned aircraft. However, to fill the data gap in the lower atmosphere, IITM envisaged Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) as an innovative aerial platform and the program ‘Lower Atmospheric Research using Unmanned Aerial System Facility (LARUS)’ is instigated to demonstrate the efficacy of a fixed-wing medium size UAS for probing the lower atmosphere for climate studies. The UAS is equipped with lightweight advanced science payload and an isokinetic aerosol inlet, for targeted in-situ measurements of aerosol, chemistry, radiation, turbulence and meteorological parameters (temperature (T) and Relative Humidity (RH)). The vertical profiles on different flight days depicted high vertical diurnal variability of the measured parameters. Comparison of T & RH profiles of INSAT-3DR Sounder and UAS depicted huge data gap in satellite profiles in the lower altitudes. The new approach in our study is obtaining high frequency simultaneous in-situ measurements within the footprint of 5 km with high vertical resolution to study local atmospheric processes.The data emphasises elevated absorbing aerosol layers (AAL) or haze layers with maximum absorption up to 500 m above the ground due to local anthropogenic activities. The sample filter papers revealed the type, source and morphology of the observed aerosols. The incoming and reflected (outgoing) shortwave radiation indicated distinct features with an albedo of 0.178 above the haze layer (at 500 m) and 0.017 at the surface and solar absorption of 70 W/m2 in the layer 0–500 m. The presence of haze also influenced the turbulence parameters (u, v, w) and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) at those altitudes. This study demonstrates instrumented UAS for lower atmospheric research, the first of its kind in India, highlighting various results essential for climate studies."

 Mitigating air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), one of China's most densely populated regions, is critical for reducing pollution-related health impacts. This study uses the WRF-Chem model to simulate the concentrations of two key pollutants, PM2.5 and O3, and to assess their responses to various emission control measures. Our objective is to provide actionable insights for designing effective clean air policies to improve future air quality in the YRD. The sensitivity analysis using the Comprehensive Air Quality Index (CAQI) underscores the complex interactions between PM2.5, O3, and reductions in NOx and VOC emissions. Notably, NOx reductions exhibit the greatest potential for lowering CAQI in summer, but in winter, the positive effects on PM2.5 reduction may be offset by higher O3 levels. Despite this trade-off, deep NOx emission cuts remain the most effective strategy for controlling both PM2.5 and O3 pollution in the YRD. These findings provide critical numerical insights and serve as a strong foundation for policymakers to develop targeted air quality management strategies."

Acid-rich concentration spikes matched the distribution of high-temperature fumaroles, whereas CO2is emitted broadly from high- and low-temperature fumaroles. The CO2flux was 15 to 41 kilograms per second from hot fumaroles and 61 to 131 kilograms per second for the overall plume. The typical CO2flux calculation of multiplying CO2/SO2ratio with SO2flux underestimates total CO2flux by at least threefold. We quantified substantial magmatic gas scrubbing by the hydrothermal system, with 56 to 79% of initial HCl and 33 to 68% of initial SO2lost. This study highlights the importance of precise acid-gas measurements for detecting heterogeneous degassing and suggests that traditional CO2flux measurements may substantially underestimate contributions from cold CO2degassing, leading to underestimated global volcanic fluxes."

In particular, we explore the potential expansion of Italy’s current atmospheric ICOS network by identifying additional existing and future stations that would most effectively improve the constraint of carbon flux estimations, with a focus on the southern region. Through a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments using the LUMIA regional inverse system, we evaluated 23 potential stations and identified Chieti (CHI, located in the Abruzzo region in mid-Italy) and Lecce (ECO, located in the southeastern Puglia region) as the most promising additions. These stations demonstrated significant value in recovering the annual and seasonal cycles of the assumed true CO2 fluxes (simulated by LPJ-GUESS) in southern Italy. Incorporating both CHI and ECO into the current network reduces the prior biases by approximately 82%, compared to the 48% reduction achieved when adding the CHI station alone. Our findings also suggest that adding more stations beyond CHI and ECO results in only marginal gains in flux precision. We therefore emphasize the need for targeted research funding to support the integration of these current and future stations into the ICOS atmospheric network in southern Italy, where the current network is sparse, with only Potenza as an ICOS atmospheric station. This research highlights the importance of strategic station selection to optimize network performance and improve regional carbon flux assessments, ultimately contributing to better reconciliation and understanding of discrepancies between bottom–up and top–down greenhouse gas estimation methods."
10.5194/acp-25-3873-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了平流层硫酸盐气溶胶在晴空条件下的辐射强迫和反馈与地表温度的依赖关系。论文使用一维辐射-对流平衡模型，发现硫酸盐气溶胶的辐射强迫随着地表温度的升高而减弱，而二氧化碳的辐射强迫变化较小。这是因为硫酸盐气溶胶主要吸收大气光学薄的波长，从而掩盖了随温度升高而增加的地表辐射。此外，气溶胶的存在还会减弱辐射反馈。这项研究强调了气溶胶长波吸收的光谱特性在决定强迫的地表温度依赖性和减少反馈方面的重要作用。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究结果对于理解气溶胶对气候的影响以及提高气候模型的准确性具有重要意义，而这些模型通常会用到卫星观测数据，因此与大气环境遥感技术，尤其是大气成分分析，有较强的关联性。,"['stratospheric sulfate aerosol', 'radiative forcing', 'radiative feedback', 'surface temperature', 'atmospheric composition', 'longwave radiation', 'climate modeling']",Ravikiran Hegde;Moritz Günther;Hauke Schmidt;Clarissa Kroll,Surface temperature dependence of stratospheric sulfate aerosol clear-sky forcing and feedback,"Using a one-dimensional radiative–convective equilibrium model, we show that in clear-sky conditions, stratospheric sulfate aerosol forcing weakens with increasing surface temperature while CO2 forcing varies much less. This effect arises as sulfate aerosol, unlike CO2, absorbs mainly at wavelengths where the atmosphere is optically thin. It thereby masks the surface emission, which increases with warming. The spectral masking also results in weaker radiative feedback when aerosol is present. 
 Stratospheric sulfate aerosol originating from explosive volcanic eruptions can perturb the radiative budget for several years. However, the understanding of the state dependence of aerosol forcing and its effect on the radiative feedback is still incomplete. Using a one-dimensional radiative–convective equilibrium model of the tropical atmosphere, we quantify the contributions to clear-sky forcing and feedback from absorbing and re-emitting longwave radiation, stratospheric heating, and enhanced stratospheric water vapour. We show that aerosol forcing has a stronger surface temperature dependence than CO2 forcing. At surface temperatures from 280 to 300 K, the aerosol forcing becomes less negative (weaker) with increasing surface temperature because its longwave component becomes more positive. Additionally, the radiative feedback is less negative in the presence of the aerosol. The dependence of the feedback parameter on the aerosol concentration and of the forcing magnitude on temperature arises from the same process: aerosol absorbs in the spectral range in which the atmosphere is optically thin and thus spectrally masks the temperature-dependent surface emissions. The study highlights the critical role played by the spectral nature of aerosol longwave absorption in determining the surface temperature dependence of the forcing and in reducing the feedback in comparison to an atmosphere without stratospheric aerosol."

Our modeling revealed that OA in China increased by 5.6 % from 1990 to 2019, primarily due to a 32.3 % increase in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and an 8.1 % decrease in primary organic aerosols (POAs), both largely driven by changes in anthropogenic emissions. Biogenic SOA increased due to warming but showed little response to changes in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions. 
 Organic aerosol (OA) is a major type of fine particulate matter. OA shows a large variability influenced by anthropogenic emissions, vegetation, and meteorological changes. Understanding OA trends is crucial for air quality and climate studies, yet changes in OA over time in China are poorly documented. This study applied the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 with comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (CAM6-Chem) to investigate long-term OA trends in China from 1990 to 2019 and identify the driving factors. The simulations agreed well with ground-based measurements of OA from 151 observational sites and the CAQRA reanalysis dataset. Although OA trends showed a modest 5.6 % increase, this resulted from a significant −8.1 % decrease in primary organic aerosols (POAs) and a substantial 32.3 % increase in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Anthropogenic emissions of POA and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were the dominant contributors to these trends. While biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) played a secondary role in SOA formation, significant changes were observed in specific subspecies: isoprene-derived SOA decreased by −18.8 % due to anthropogenic sulfate reduction, while monoterpene-derived SOA increased by 12.3 % driven by enhanced emissions from rising temperatures. Through sensitivity experiments, our study found a negligible response of monoterpene-derived SOA to changes in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions as a net effect of changes in multiple pathways. This study highlights the complex interplay between POA reduction and SOA growth, revealing notable OA trends in China and the varying roles of both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions."

Accurate global measurements of these particles are crucial for estimating this cooling effect. This study compares and harmonizes two newly developed global aerosol datasets, offering insights for their future use and refinement. We identify pristine oceans as a significant source of uncertainty in the datasets and, therefore, in quantifying the role of aerosols in Earth's climate. 
 Quantifying global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations is crucial for reducing uncertainties in radiative forcing resulting from aerosol–cloud interactions. This study analyses two novel, independent, open-source global CCN datasets derived from spaceborne Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis and examines the spatio-temporal variability of CCN concentrations pertinent to liquid clouds. The results reveal consistent large-scale patterns in both CALIOP and CAMS datasets, although CALIOP values are approximately 79 % higher than those from CAMS. Comparisons with the existing literature demonstrate that these datasets effectively bound regionally observed CCN concentrations, with CALIOP typically representing the upper bound and CAMS the lower bound. Monthly and annual variations in CCN concentrations obtained from the two datasets largely agree over the Northern Hemisphere and align with previously reported variations. However, inconsistencies emerge over pristine oceans, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, where the datasets show not only opposing seasonal changes but also contrasting annual trends. Seasonal cycles in these regions are well represented in CAMS, consistent with previous in situ observations, while annual trends seems to be better captured by CALIOP. A comparative study of trends in CCN and cloud droplet concentrations suggests that dust-influenced and pristine maritime environments are primary regions that limit our current understanding of CCN–cloud droplet relationships. Long-term CCN observations in these regions are crucial for improving global datasets and advancing our understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions."

We develop a conceptual model for stratospheric aerosol lifetime in terms of production and decay timescales, as well as a lag between injection and decay. We find residence time depends strongly on injection height in the lower stratosphere. We show that the lifetime of stratospheric aerosol from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is around 22 months, significantly longer than is commonly reported. 
 The amount of time that volcanic aerosols spend in the stratosphere is one of the primary factors influencing the climate impact of volcanic eruptions. Stratospheric aerosol persistence has been described in different ways, with many works quoting an approximately 12-month “residence time” for aerosol from large tropical eruptions. Here, we aim to develop a framework for describing the evolution of global stratospheric aerosol after major volcanic eruptions and quantifying its persistence, based on global satellite-based aerosol observations, tracer transport simulations, and simple conceptual modelling. We show that the stratospheric residence time of air, which is estimated through passive tracer pulse experiments and is one factor influencing the lifetime of stratospheric aerosols, is strongly dependent on the injection latitude and height, with an especially strong sensitivity to injection height in the first 4 km above the tropical tropopause. Simulated stratospheric tracer evolution is best described by a simple model which includes a lag between the injection and initiation of removal from the stratosphere. Based on analysis of global stratospheric aerosol observations, we show that the stratospheric lifetime of stratospheric aerosol from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is approximately 22 months. We estimate the potential impact of observational uncertainties on this lifetime, finding it unlikely the lifetime of Pinatubo aerosol is less than 18 months."

Most space-based studies report the potential energy. We use Aeolus wind data to estimate the kinetic energy (density). However, the data quality is a challenge for such analyses, as the accuracy of the data is in the range of typical GW amplitudes. We find a temporal coincidence between enhanced or breaking planetary waves and enhanced gravity wave kinetic energy density. 
 Information about the energy density of gravity waves (GWs) is crucial for improving atmosphere models. So far, most space-based studies report the potential energy, Epot, of GWs, as temperature measurements from satellites are more common.We use Aeolus wind data to derive the kinetic energy density, Ekin, of GWs above the northern Atlantic and Europe. Assuming perfect instrument performance, this would be a lower limit for the kinetic energy density, as Aeolus only measures the horizontal line-of-sight wind. Aeolus, the European Space Agency's (ESA's) fourth Earth Explorer Mission, was the first Doppler wind lidar in space and measured vertical profiles of the horizontal line-of-sight wind from the ground to an altitude of ∼ 20–30 km between 2018 and 2023. With a vertical resolution of 0.25–2 km, Aeolus measurements are in principle well suited for the analysis of GWs. However, the data quality is a challenge for such analyses, as the error in the data is in the range of typical GW amplitudes in the troposphere and stratosphere.In this study, we derive daily resolved time series of Ekin before, during, and after two streamer events above the northern Atlantic and Europe. Streamers are large-scale tongue-like structures of meridionally deflected air masses, which are caused by enhanced planetary wave activity. They are linked to vertical shear of horizontal wind and a pressure system, two possible GW generation mechanisms. We find that there is a temporal coincidence between the enhanced daily averaged Ekin and occurrence of the streamer events, which we identified in total column ozone measurements. The derivation of GW signals based on Aeolus data is possible, however: we collected about 100 profiles to statistically reduce the uncertainty in the daily averaged Ekin. Compared to non-satellite measurements, those daily averaged values are at the upper border."

The aim of the algorithm is to save researchers working on these tasks significant amounts of time and allow them to proceed with their analysis. The work demonstrates that this algorithm can achieve the goal of speeding up analysis and provide accurate formulas. 
 Mass spectrometry is an established method for studying the chemical composition of gases and particles in the atmosphere. Using this technique, signals corresponding to thousands or even tens of thousands of compounds may be detected from ambient air. The process of identifying all the peaks in the mass spectra is often arduous and time-consuming, in particular when multiple overlapping peaks are present. This manual peak fitting and identification may take even experienced analysts anywhere from weeks to months to complete, depending on the desired accuracy and completeness.In this work, we attempted to automate the fitting and formula assignment workflow and evaluate how far the process can get using a “one-button” algorithm. The algorithm constructed in this work takes in commonly known parameters specific to the instrument type, and by pressing one button it runs and ultimately provides a list of likely peaks for the mass spectrum. The algorithm utilizes weighted-least-squares fitting and a modified version of the Bayesian information criterion along with an iterative formula assignment process. We applied it to synthetic mass spectra and both a gas-phase chemical-ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) dataset and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) dataset. The results were largely comparable with manual peak fitting and identification done previously but were achieved in a fraction of the time. Erroneous assignments mainly appeared at low-intensity signals, with interference from nearby higher-intensity signals, a case that is challenging also for manual peak fitting. This algorithm provides an excellent starting point for a peak list, which, if needed, can be manually revised.The main result of this study is the algorithm itself. While further improvements and tweaks are possible, the algorithm presented here is currently being implemented into the commonly used Tofware analysis software package to allow easy utilization by the broader community. We hope this can save valuable time of researchers for data interpretation rather than data processing and curation."

Sensitivity tests demonstrate the complexity and nonlinear interactions of auxiliary parameters in the air mass factor calculation. An improved agreement is found with measurements from a global ground-based instrument network. The scientific retrieval provides a useful source of information for studies combining HCHO and NO2. 
 The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite launched in October 2017, is dedicated to monitoring the atmospheric composition associated with air quality and climate change. This paper presents the global retrieval of TROPOMI tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns using an updated version of the Peking University OMI NO2 (POMINO) algorithm, which focuses on improving the calculation of air mass factors (AMFs). The algorithm features explicit corrections for the surface reflectance anisotropy and aerosol optical effects, and it uses daily high-resolution (0.25°×0.25°) a priori HCHO and NO2 profiles from the Global Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) dataset. For cloud correction, a consistent approach is used for both HCHO and NO2 retrievals, where (1) the cloud fraction is recalculated at 440 nm using the same ancillary parameters as those used in the NO2 AMF calculation, and (2) the cloud-top pressure is taken from the operational FRESCO-S cloud product.The comparison between POMINO and reprocessed (RPRO) operational products in April, July and October 2021 as well as January 2022 exhibits high spatial agreement, but RPRO tropospheric HCHO and NO2 columns are lower by 10 % to 20 % over polluted regions. Sensitivity tests with POMINO show that the HCHO retrieval differences are mainly caused by different aerosol correction methods (implicit versus explicit), prior information on vertical profile shapes and background corrections, while the NO2 retrieval discrepancies result from different aerosol corrections, surface reflectances and a priori vertical profile shapes as well as their nonlinear interactions. With explicit aerosol corrections, the HCHO structural uncertainty due to the cloud correction using different cloud parameters is within ±20 %, mainly caused by cloud height differences. Validation against ground-based measurements from global Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations and the Pandonia Global Network (PGN) shows that in April, July and October 2021 as well as in January 2022 POMINO retrievals present a comparable day-to-day correlation but a reduced bias (normalized mean bias, NMB) compared to the RPRO products (HCHO: R=0.62, NMB=-30.8% versus R=0.68, NMB=-35.0%; NO2: R=0.84, NMB=-9.5% versus R=0.85, NMB=-19.4%). An improved agreement of the HCHO/NO2 ratio (FNR, formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide ratio) with  MAX-DOAS and PGN measurements based on POMINO retrievals is also found (NMB: −14.8 % versus −21.1 %). Our POMINO retrieval provides a useful source of information, particularly for studies combining HCHO and NO2."

Real-time online monitoring of VOCs is highly needed for understanding their emission sources, environmental impacts, health effects, and climate changes, as many analytical methods are limited to field detection. In this work, a flying-drone-based mass spectrometer (drone-MS) system was developed for visual real-time monitoring of complex VOCs and mapping their diffusions and distributions in the air along with spatiotemporal, geospatial, and environmental information that varies with the flight paths. Analytical performances of the drone-MS system were investigated by detecting a mixture of 18 VOCs, showing high sensitivity (limits of detection, LODs: 1.10–17.91 μg/m3; limits of quantification, LOQs: 3.84–37.61 μg/m3), good reproducibility (relative standard deviations, RSDs, intraday: 0.96–16.49%; interday: 1.17–18.28%; n = 7), and excellent quantitative ability (R2 > 0.99). Online monitoring of complex VOCs was successfully obtained at high temporal resolution (1.0 s) and high spatial resolution (2.0 m), providing an accurate source apportionment of different VOC emissions. Furthermore, practical applications of urban air quality monitoring and spatial distribution mapping of complex VOCs in air were also demonstrated. Overall, this methodology offers new possibilities for the online monitoring of complex VOCs in the air, effectively tackling the longstanding challenge of accurately characterizing complex VOCs and their diffusions and distributions."

Gas-phase reaction of methoxyphenols with nitrate radicals (NO3) yields to important secondary products like nitrophenols, yet their atmospheric kinetics are far from adequate and consistent. This study investigates the gas-phase reaction kinetics of guaiacol, a key representative methoxyphenol, with NO3 by using a controlled 30 m3 indoor chamber. Both relative rate and absolute rate methods were employed, yielding rate constants of (3.1 ± 0.2) × 10–11 and (2.43 ± 0.19) × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, respectively, at 298 ± 2 K under dry conditions. The rate constant decreased with an increase in humidity, highlighting the inhibitory effect of water vapor on NO3-initiated reactions. The calculated nocturnal atmospheric lifetime of guaiacol due to NO3 reactions is less than 2 min at typical nocturnal NO3 levels, underscoring the significance of this pathway in the budget of methoxyphenols during nighttime or within a 24 h cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first determination of the NO3-guaiacol rate constant using the absolute rate method and provides insights into the role of relative humidity in methoxyphenol oxidation.

This study, however, provides physical insights into two main possible processes, secondary gravity waves (GWs) and Lamb waves, which may explain those observed large‐scale thermospheric disturbances. The comparison between the simulations and observations suggests that the MESORAC‐HIAMCM secondary GWs are consistent with GRACE‐FO measured global‐propagation thermospheric density disturbances in timing and amplitude.

All prior studies considered enhancing cloud albedo only with fine aerosols (FA). Adding coarse sea spray aerosols (CSA, radius>1 μm) has been thought to have the opposite effect. Using nearly a decade of satellite observations and global aerosol reanalysis, we found that the maximum radiative cooling effect from marine stratocumulus occurs when FA is around 3 μg m−3 and CSA is around 30 μg m−3. Under low winds and high stability conditions, optimal FA and CSA can enhance cooling by −95 W m−2, nearly 60% more than adding FA alone. This CRE response to FA and CSA was consistently observed across various cloud‐controlling factors, thus minimizing the probability of being caused by meteorological co‐variability. These findings improve our understanding of how different aerosols affect Earth's climate, improve the evaluation of cooling achieved through marine cloud brightening, and support its feasibility."

The observational results after 2003 show that the aerosol increased several times after large volcanic eruptions and wildfires. The largest increases in vertically integrated stratospheric aerosol backscattering coefficient (IBC) above 16.5 km (IBC16.5) were observed after the Raikoke volcanic eruption in 2019 at Tsukuba and the Australian wildfire in 2019/20 at Lauder. The increased IBC16.5 returned to normal levels in 1–2 years. After the volcanic eruptions, the particle depolarization ratio (PDR) increased for several days and then decreased in a few dozen days in most cases. In contrast, the increased PDR after the large wildfires gradually decreased in 1–2 years. These suggest that large volcanic ash was quickly removed to the troposphere or dissolved in or coated with liquid to become non‐depolarizing. In contrast, the wildfire smoke stays in the stratosphere for a few years due to its small size and mass density.

However, accurate identification of CH4 sources for reducing CH4 emissions is often hampered by inadequate accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage of CH4 detection, and lack of accurate CH4 forward modeling used in top‐down inversion systems. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in Pampa, Texas using two CH4 sensors (LI‐COR and OGI camera) to detect CH4 releases. We investigated whether high‐resolution simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with greenhouse gases (WRF‐GHG) could accurately simulate the CH4 plumes in the presence of evolving atmospheric boundary layer from sunrise to noon. CH4 plumes showed substantial variation in time. At a release rate of ∼17.5 kg hr−1, the maximum enhancement of CH4 measured by LI‐COR was 2.6 ppm at sunrise (7:36 a.m.), 250 m from the release location. Within half an hour after sunrise, this enhancement decreased to 0.3–0.4 ppm. The enhancement was 0.2 ppm by 10:00 a.m. and further dropped to less than 0.1 ppm after 11:30 a.m. Due to the low temperature at sunrise, the OGI camera failed to detect the CH4 plume. The WRF‐GHG large‐eddy simulation (LES) with 32 m grid spacing successfully reproduced these CH4 enhancements. In situ measurements together with numerical simulations illustrate the impact of the transition from a stable boundary layer in the early morning to a convective boundary layer at noon on the dispersion of CH4 plumes.

South Asia, especially its northwesternmost part, is emerging as a global hotspot for thunderstorms and lightning, driven by dynamic interactions between the orography of the TP and the South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM). This study used TRMM satellite observations from 1998 to 2013, combined with ERA‐5 reanalysis data and the HYSPLIT trajectory model, to comprehensively investigate how thunderstorms in the region impact the atmospheric composition over the TP. The findings reveal that thunderstorms in the region predominantly occur during the SASM. Spatially, these thunderstorms are concentrated along the southern Himalayan front, especially in the westernmost indentation between the TP and the Iranian Plateau, an area also characterized by heavy anthropogenic pollution. By employing the HYSPLIT model to trace transport pathways associated with the thunderstorm, the study demonstrates a clear convergence of pollutants from the South Asia boundary layer into thunderclouds. Furthermore, three principal transport pathways were identified for substances originating from the tops of thunderstorms entering the TP. These pathways are closely linked to the tropospheric westerlies, the anticyclonic circulation of the South Asian High, and processes penetrating the tropopause, accounting for approximately 58%, 33%, and 9% of thunderstorms, respectively. Notably, the impact of these thunderstorm‐driven transport processes on the TP and even the lower stratosphere is expected to intensify as thunderstorms become more frequent and pollution levels rise in South Asia due to global warming and local social development."

 The North China Plain (NCP) experiences the most severe persistent (≥3 days) ozone pollution (POP) across China. The study investigates the POP events during the advancement of EASM using the regional climate-chemistry-ecology model RegCM-Chem-YIBs. Summers from May to August are divided into the Meiyu-flood (MYF) period, and the periods before and after. Over the past ten years, most POP events occurred in the MYF period and its preceding period, with the longest duration and highest intensity during the MYF period. A notable peak was observed in 2017, with a significant increase in POP frequency across all three monsoon periods. Process analysis and sensitivity experiments for the 2017 events were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In the PreF period, POP events are associated with the Baikal ridge and a high-pressure system over the NCP region. Chemical reactions, vertical advection, and turbulent transport facilitate the accumulation of surface O3, while horizontal advection has a negative effect. The most severe POP events occur in the MYF period, driven by a stable and strong Baikal ridge and a relatively weak Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH). Local chemical reactions and advections contribute significantly to these events. In the PostF period, POP events are rare due to a significant decrease in solar radiation. Compared to 2016, 2017 featured a stronger and earlier-established Baikal ridge and a weaker, later-jumped WPSH, leading to an increase of 2.0–2.3 ppb hr−1 in the O3 chemical production rate during early summer.

 The potential gradient variable (PG) is sensitive to several atmospheric processes. This study analyses the effect of traffic on the PG recorded at the Buenos Aires station under fair weather (FW) conditions. To identify the existence or not of an effect of traffic on the PG (FW), different statistical techniques were used. Significant differences were found in the daily means of PG (FW) between weekdays (W) and weekends (Wd), with consistent patterns throughout the year. In addition, spectral analysis revealed a significant seven-day cycle. When vehicular flow and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were examined for both W and Wd days, they showed a variation consistent with the changes observed in PG (FW). Although aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed some changes in its daily variability, it did not show significant differences in its daily means. During the SARS-CoV-2 confinement in 2020, a decrease in PG (FW) was observed, accompanied by a decrease in vehicular flow and NO2, reinforcing the idea of the influence of these emissions on PG (FW). These results highlight the importance of considering anthropogenic effects when analysing PG (FW) in urban areas, especially in locations with low measured pollutant emissions."

However, gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) characteristics remain debated due to limitations in the commonly used KCl-coated denuder method. Here, we reassess GOM characteristics by simultaneously employing both the denuder method and a more reliable dual-channel method with a cation exchange membrane in an integrated system (CSAMS). Based on year-long observations in urban Beijing, we found significantly distinct seasonal patterns of GOM concentrations when using different methods: the denuder method showed GOM peaks in spring and troughs in summer, while the dual-channel method recorded the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. These  results indicated significant seasonal variability in method consistency (the ratio of denuder GOM to dual-channel GOM), with values ranging from 7.3% in summer to 18.7% in spring (p-value < 0.05). Using a generalized additive model, we quantified the impacts of different environmental variables on method consistency. GOM, particulate-bound mercury, relative humidity, ozone, and nitric acid were identified as the main factors. Our study suggests temporal and potential spatial biases in GOM measurement introduced by the denuder method. We recommend reassessing the existing understanding of GOM characteristics and atmospheric mercury chemistry in future studies."

We find that both satellite reconstructions of the Earth's energy budget and atmosphere‐only GCM simulations forced with observed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and sea‐ice trends support the hypothesis of a negative surface albedo feedback over the Southern Ocean.

On 15 January, neutral densities and NOIRF (Nitric Oxide Infrared Radiative Flux) were found to be depleted over the Hunga‐Tonga following the volcanic eruption, as observed by Swarm and SABER. Subsequently, the following day, a significant and highly localized enhancement in NOIRF is observed. Using TIEGCM (Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model) simulations with gravity wave input, it has been established that wave‐induced lower atmospheric forcing is primarily responsible for the compositional and temperature changes.

Wiltshire,Drivers of persistent changes in the global methane cycle under aggressive mitigation action,"Drivers of persistent changes in the global methane cycle under aggressive mitigation action 
 To achieve the Paris climate agreement goals, methane (CH4) emission mitigation plays a key role. Therefore, a better understanding of the global methane cycle is indispensable. Here we simulate the global methane cycle fully interactively from 1850 to 2100 with a strong mitigation action scenario (SSP1-2.6) post 2014. We show that the atmospheric methane burden largely recovers to early 20th-century levels, while wetland methane emissions follow a persistent upward trend from 166 Tg(CH4) yr–1 at pre-industrial to 221 Tg(CH4) yr–1 in 2100. The methane lifetime decreases from 9.3 to 7.3 years over the 1850–2100 period. We identify net primary productivity as the main driver behind the wetland methane trend with R2 = 0.7. This implies that important components of the methane cycle (wetland methane, methane lifetime) are subject to Earth system feedbacks, potentially impacting any prospective methane mitigation action. Therefore, methane mitigation strategies will need to consider feedbacks in the Earth system."

 Advancements in geostationary satellites allow monitoring of terrestrial photosynthesis at sub-daily scales, offering unprecedented opportunities for understanding vegetation productivity. However, at short temporal scales, photosynthesis is highly influenced by illumination conditions, particularly diffuse radiation (Ddif). Existing empirical models often overlook Ddif's impact, leading to uncertainties in hourly gross primary productivity (GPP) mapping. We determined that incorporating Ddif effects into GPP modeling improves clear-sky GPP mapping using Himawari-8. We employed a light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) considering Ddif and compared it with other empirical models: parametric, regression, and machine learning. The LGBM outperformed others, achieving an R2 of 0.8146 and root mean square error of 2.848 μmol CO₂/m2/s against ground observations from 2020 to 2021. To investigate input variable contributions in LGBM predictions, we performed SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis. Results confirmed that aerosol optical depth (AOD) had a greater impact during morning and evening when Ddif influence increased due to solar path length. Hourly GPP maps over East Asia from 2020 to 2021 using the LGBM demonstrated that diurnal patterns differ by landcover, with variations observed in latitudinal profiles. This underscores the need to examine GPP spatial distribution at high frequency. We confirmed that the spatial distribution of AOD SHAP values varied over time, highlighting temporal dynamics of aerosol effects. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of GPP mapping using geostationary satellites and suggest various impact studies can use our proposed framework. This approach provides a valuable tool for understanding vegetation's rapid response to atmospheric aerosols, contributing to more accurate ecosystem flux modeling."

 As a major source of atmospheric pollution, the spatiotemporal evolution patterns and influencing factors of PM2.5 are crucial for the regulation of air quality. The Loess Plateau, a vital ecological barrier in China, is a transitional zone for northwest dust transport and eastern industrial pollution, making its environmental issues particularly significant. With its fragile ecosystem, PM2.5 pollution not only degrades air quality but may also exacerbate soil erosion and ecological degradation. Understanding PM2.5 distribution patterns is essential for formulating regional ecological protection strategies and promoting sustainable development. However, research on the spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of air pollutants in this region remains limited. This study analyzed PM2.5 vector data from 2010 to 2020 to explore its spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors. Results indicate that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration decreased during this period, from 44.570 μg·m−3 in 2010 to 30.207 μg·m−3 in 2020, a decrease of 32.25 %. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration shows a pattern of ‘high in the southeast and low in the northwest’, with hotspots mainly concentrated in the provinces of Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and cold spots in Inner Mongolia and Qinghai. Through geodetectors and correlation analyses, it was found that natural factors (e.g., altitude, temperature, and precipitation) had a significantly greater influence on PM2.5 concentrations than socioeconomic factors. In particular, elevation (DEM) had the strongest explanatory power for PM2.5 concentrations and was significantly negatively correlated with PM2.5 concentrations. It was also found that PM2.5 concentrations were significantly higher in winter than in other seasons, mainly due to low winter temperatures, inversions, and residents' reliance on coal for heating. The airflow in Xi'an and Taiyuan mainly originated from the north-west, with 53.53 % and 58.09 %, respectively. Potential source areas for Xi'an included Guangyuan, Yuncheng, Xiangyang, and Yan'an, while Taiyuan's sources were primarily Shijiazhuang (Hebei) and Zhengzhou (Henan). Overall, the control of PM2.5 pollution in the Loess Plateau has achieved remarkable results, but interregional synergistic management and ecological protection still need to be strengthened in the future."

 Currently, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region faces the concurrent issues of aerosol and ozone pollution. Aerosols have a significant impact on the actinic radiative flux, which greatly influences the formation of ozone. This study quantitatively estimates the impact of scattering aerosol actinic radiative effect on the vertical distribution of ozone and secondary pollutants during a double high pollution episode in October 2012 using a localized parameterization formula for aerosol extinction profiles and the Weather Research Forecast–Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model. Scattering aerosols can increase photolysis rates when the Aerosol Optical Depth is low. Aerosol actinic radiative effect reduces ground level ozone and PM2.5 in the morning. In the core area of the PRD, the reduction in ozone reaches up to 20 ppb, while PM2.5 decreases by 4–8 μg/m3. But it increases ozone and PM2.5 levels in the upper and middle layers of the boundary layer during midday and the afternoon, with ozone increasing by 5–20 ppb and PM2.5 by 1–2 μg/m3. Enhanced oxidizing capacity promotes the generation of sulfate and secondary organic aerosols, further increasing scattering aerosols and forming a positive feedback loop. The acinic radiative effect of aerosols lead to a diurnal variation in the reduction of surface ozone concentration, with a more pronounced effect in the morning. When radiation is weak in the morning and there is sufficient precursor for ozone, changes in radiation have a greater impact on ozone. As radiation becomes stronger, even though aerosols attenuate the radiation, there is still sufficient radiative flux to drive actinic reactions, and the impact of scattering aerosols on surface ozone concentration at midday is not significant. The mechanisms by which aerosol actinic radiative effect influence secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and sulfates are similar to those for ozone described above."

 Downwelling longwave radiation (DLR) is crucial for the global energy cycle. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a focal point in global energy cycle research owing to its distinct geographical position and remarkably high elevation. At present, the DLR estimates under clear-sky conditions are relatively mature, but only a few studies have specifically estimated the DLR under all-sky conditions. Moreover, some of these methods still need to be improved with regard to spatial resolution and accuracy when applied over the TP. The primary challenge is the uncertainty of cloud radiation effects and the atmospheric conditions beneath the clouds. Current parameterization schemes often rely solely on near-surface meteorological parameters and the cloud fraction, which are insufficient for characterizing the thermal differences between the cloud base and the surface. Additionally, optical sensors are limited by their penetration depth and cannot directly provide information on the cloud base. By combining satellite data, meteorological forcing data, reanalysis temperature profiles, and land surface temperature datasets and simultaneously considering the thermal radiation contributions from both the atmosphere below clouds and the cloud layer itself, the all-sky DLR over the TP was estimated. With the introduction of a low-cloud correction scheme and the incorporation of multiple temperature and humidity input parameters when estimating the radiation contribution from the atmosphere below clouds, these improvements further enhance the accuracy. The precision of this study is comparable to that of CERES-SYN, with RMSEs below 30 W m−2 at any timescale, and more detailed spatial variations can be presented due to the higher spatial resolution. A comparison with existing DLR estimation schemes shows that this study achieves more accurate results without the need for local calibration with preobtained in situ data. Therefore, this method shows the potential for application across various regions globally to further improve the precision of DLR estimation."

We used advanced technology to measure aerosol composition and found that these particles grow with humidity, significantly increasing their heat-trapping effect in the infrared region, especially in winter. Our findings suggest these aerosols could be a key factor in Arctic warming, emphasizing the importance of understanding aerosols for climate prediction. 
 This study investigates the impact of hygroscopic aerosols, such as sea salt and sulfate, on longwave downward radiation in the Arctic. These aerosols absorb atmospheric water vapor, leading to wet growth, increased size, and enhanced longwave downward radiation emission, defined as the aerosol infrared radiation effect. Observations of aerosols, especially their composition, are challenging during the Arctic winter. We use an emission Fourier transform spectrometer to measure aerosol composition. Observations show that the aerosol infrared radiation effect of dry aerosols is limited to about 1.45±2.00 W m−2. Wet growth significantly increases this effect. During winter, at relative humidity levels between 60 % and 80 %, wet aerosols exhibit effects approximately 7 times greater than dry aerosols. When relative humidity exceeds 80 %, the effect can be up to 20 times higher. Sea salt aerosols in Ny-Ålesund demonstrate high effect values, while non-hygroscopic aerosols like black carbon and dust show consistently low values. Reanalysis data indicate increased water vapor and sea salt aerosol optical depth in Ny-Ålesund after 2000, correlating with significant positive temperature anomalies in this area. Moreover, wet aerosols can remain activated even in dry environments, continuously contributing high effects, thereby expanding the area affected by aerosol-induced warming. This warming effect may exacerbate Arctic warming, acting as a positive feedback mechanism."

Meas. Tech., 14, 4033–4051, 2021). The distribution of organic nitrates and their effects on local ozone production are analyzed based on field observations in conjunction with model simulations. 
 Organic nitrates serve as important secondary oxidation products in the atmosphere, playing a crucial role in the atmospheric radical cycles and influencing the production of secondary pollutants (ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols). However, field measurements of organic nitrates are scarce in China, and a comprehensive localized mechanism for organic nitrates is absent, hindering effective pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we conducted measurements of ambient gaseous organic nitrates and examined their effects on local O3 production at a polluted urban site in eastern China during summer. The average daytime concentrations of alkyl nitrates (ANs) and peroxy nitrates (PNs) throughout the campaign were 0.5 ± 0.3 and 0.9 ± 0.7 ppbv, respectively, with peaks reaching up to 1.6 and 3.6 ppbv. An observation-constrained box model, incorporating an updated mechanism for organic nitrates, was employed to assess the environmental impact of these compounds. The model results indicated that PN production inhibited the daytime O3 production by 16 % (0.8 ppbv h−1), which is relatively low compared to previous studies. Furthermore, scenario analyses revealed that production yields (α) of ANs would alter the response of O3 formation to precursors due to varying compositions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Our results suggest that blind pollution control may cause ineffective pollution prevention and highlight the necessity of a thorough understanding of organic nitrate chemistry for local O3 control strategy."

 Cooking emissions are a significant source of PM2.5, posing considerable public health risks due to their high toxicity and proximity to densely populated areas. Despite their importance, there is currently a lack of an accurate, long-term, high-resolution national cooking emission inventory in China, primarily due to the challenges in obtaining high-quality activity level data over extended periods and at fine spatial scales. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict activity levels and further estimate emissions."

Emmons;Vaishali Naik;Kostas Tsigaridis;Øyvind Seland;Gerd A. Folberth;Douglas I. Kelley,Historical trends and controlling factors of isoprene emissions in CMIP6 Earth system models,"Understanding historical isoprene emission changes is important for predicting future climate, but trends and their controlling factors remain uncertain. This study shows that long-term isoprene trends vary among Earth system models mainly due to partially incorporating CO2 effects and land cover changes rather than to climate. Future models that refine these factors’ effects on isoprene emissions, along with long-term observations, are essential for better understanding plant–climate interactions. 
 Terrestrial isoprene, a biogenic volatile organic compound emitted by many plants, indirectly influences Earth's radiative balance through its interactions with atmospheric oxidants, affecting ozone formation, methane lifetime, and secondary aerosol production. Elucidating its historical changes is therefore important for predicting climate change and air quality. Isoprene emissions can respond to climate (e.g. temperature, shortwave radiation, precipitation), land use and land cover change (LULCC), and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, historical trends of isoprene emissions and the relative influences of the respective drivers of those trends remain highly uncertain. This study addresses uncertainty in historical isoprene emission trends and their influential factors, particularly the roles of climate, LULCC, and atmospheric CO2 (via fertilization and inhibition effects). The findings are expected to reconcile discrepancies among different modelling approaches and to improve predictions of isoprene emissions and their climate change effects.To investigate isoprene emission trends, controlling factors, and discrepancies among models, we analysed long-term (1850–2014) global isoprene emissions from online simulations of CMIP6 Earth system models and offline simulations using the Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases (VISIT) dynamic vegetation model driven by climate reanalysis data.Mean annual global present-day isoprene emissions agree well among models (434–510 TgC yr−1) with a 5 % inter-model spread (24 TgC yr−1), but regional emissions differ greatly (9 %–212 % spread). All models show an increasing trend in global isoprene emissions in recent decades (1980–2014), but their magnitudes vary (+1.27 ± 0.49 TgC yr−2, 0.28 ± 0.11 % yr−1). Long-term trends of 1850–2014 show high uncertainty among models (−0.92 to +0.31 TgC yr−2).Results of emulated sensitivity experiments indicate meteorological variations as the main factor of year-to-year fluctuations, but the main drivers of long-term isoprene emission trends differ among models. Models without CO2 effects implicate climate change as the driver, but other models with CO2 effects (fertilization only/fertilization and inhibition) indicate CO2 and LULCC as the primary drivers. The discrepancies arise from how models account for CO2 and LULCC alongside climate effects on isoprene emissions. Aside from LULCC-induced reductions, differences in CO2 inhibition representation (strength and presence or absence of thresholds) were able to mitigate or reverse increasing trends because of rising temperatures or in combination with CO2 fertilization. Net CO2 effects on global isoprene emissions show the highest inter-model variation (σ=0.43 TgC yr−2), followed by LULCC effects (σ=0.17 TgC yr−2), with climate change effects exhibiting more or less variation (σ=0.06 TgC yr−2).The critical drivers of isoprene emission trends depend on a model's emission scheme complexity. This dependence emphasizes the need for models with accurate representation of CO2 and LULCC effects alongside climate change influences for robust long-term predictions. Important uncertainties remain in understanding the interplay between CO2, LULCC, and climate effects on isoprene emissions, mainly for CO2. More long-term observations of isoprene emissions across various biomes are necessary, along with improved models with varied CO2 responses. Moreover, instead of reliance on the current models, additional emission schemes can better capture isoprene emissions complexities and their effects on climate."

 In this study, we investigated the seasonal distribution of extreme surface ozone (O3) episodes in association with meteorological conditions over the Arabian Gulf (AG) between 2016 and 2019. We used hourly surface O3 measurements from the United States Embassy in Manama and air temperature observations from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. We computed the maximum daily 8-h average of O3 using the Air Quality Index methodology. The results showed that the air quality in Manama can be categorized as “good,” “moderate,” “unhealthy for sensitive groups,” “unhealthy,” and “very unhealthy” for 45.31 %, 20.61 %, 19.08 %, 11.63 %, and 3.37 % of the time, respectively. The extreme days, defined as days with MDA8-O3 ≥ 86 ppb, occurred 72.11 % in summer, 15.65 % in fall, 12.24 % in spring. No extremes were recorded in winter. Our analysis of surface O3 values obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service showed that the O3 levels during summer extremes were higher by 10 ppb than their climatological mean. We then categorized the O3 summer extremes into single-day episodes (SDEs) and multi-day episodes (MDEs), revealing that most of the extremes (73.58 %) were MDEs. An analysis of meteorological conditions using the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, MODIS-Terra, and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System database revealed that the MDEs exhibit increased temperatures, temperature subsidence form the mid-troposphere, weakened wind speeds, low aerosol optical depth, and increased insolation.

However, considering the regional nature of air pollution nationwide and the significant emission load from rural areas, a potentially large fraction of urban PM2.5 might originate from emissions outside of a city’s boundary, i.e. transboundary emissions. Here, we couple top-down (STILT-PM2.5) and bottom-up (WRF-Chem) modeling approaches with a new, nationwide, monthly-resolved, and fine-scale (5 km × 5 km) anthropogenic emission inventory to assess the impact of transboundary emissions to urban PM2.5 concentrations across 143 cities (122 NCAP and 67 million plus -cities with population >1 million, among which 46 cities are also NCAP cities). We find that, on average, ∼85% (STILT-PM2.5: 82% [95% CI: 80–85%; IQR: 77%–94%] & WRF-Chem: 89% [95% CI: 87%–91%; IQR: 88%–96%]) of urban PM2.5 across the 143 cities originates from transboundary emissions, with domestic biomass burning (32%), energy generation (16%) and industry (15%) being the leading average emission sources to the transboundary contribution. In addition, 107 of the 122 NCAP cities from both modeling approaches have annual transboundary PM2.5 contributions exceeding 80%, indicating that an entire mitigation of within-boundary emissions alone in these cities will not achieve the most conservative targets outlined as part of NCAP.

Herein, we investigate how city-level ozone pollution would be affected by self- and collaborative mitigation actions among and beyond the 60 cities, by a modeling analysis of the daily maximum 8 h average ozone for summer (June–July–August). We find that a local uniform 20% cut in anthropogenic emissions would decrease ozone by a mere 2.6% and even worsen ozone over two cities. Due to cross-city ozone transport, the implementation of a range of city-specific emission cuts from 10% to 30% resulted in ozone changes that were essentially the same as those obtained from a uniform 20% cut. By contrast, a 20% emission cut across the entire country would decrease ozone in the 60 cities by 4.5% with no ozone deterioration in any city. Furthermore, owing to the transitioned ozone chemical regime and extended ozone chemical lifetime, the transboundary ozone from outside the two plains would be enhanced by emission reductions in the 60 cities (e.g. an increase by 68% with complete removal of emissions), leading to a significant suppression (about 23%) on the expected benefit. Nationwide collaborative action is essential for more effective city-level ozone mitigation."

This study used data from the largest polar expedition in history, MOSAiC, and the CERES satellite to analyse the impact of clouds on radiation. Simulations showed accurate results, aligning with observations. Over the year, clouds caused the atmospheric surface system to lose 5.2 W m−² of radiative energy to space, while the surface gained 25 W m−² and the atmosphere cooled by 30.2 W m−². 
 An accurate representation of the radiation budget is essential for investigating the impact of clouds on the climate system, especially in the Arctic, an environment highly sensitive to complex and rapid environmental changes. In this study, we analyse a unique dataset of observations from the central Arctic made during the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition in conjunction with state-of-the-art satellite products from CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) to investigate the radiative effect of clouds and radiative closure at the surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA). We perform a series of radiative transfer simulations using derived cloud macro- and microphysical properties as inputs to the simulations for the entire MOSAiC period, comparing our results to collocated satellite products and ice-floe observations. The radiative closure biases were generally within the instrumental uncertainty, indicating that the simulations are sufficiently accurate to reproduce the radiation budget during MOSAiC. Comparisons of the simulated radiation budget relative to CERES show similar values in the terrestrial flux but relatively large differences in the solar flux, which are attributed to a lower surface albedo and a possible underestimation of atmospheric opacity by CERES. While the simulation results were consistent with the observations, more detailed analyses reveal an overestimation of simulated cloud opacity for cases involving geometrically thick ice clouds. In the annual mean, we found that, during the MOSAiC expedition, the presence of clouds leads to a loss of 5.2 W m−2 of the atmosphere–surface system to space, while the surface gains 25.0 W m−2 and the atmosphere is cooled by 30.2 W m−2."

In this study, we probe the photoaging behavior of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) particles collected on filters during the two Fire Influence on Regional and Global Environments Experiment (FIREX) campaigns in 2016 and 2019. We evaluate changes in the chemical properties during direct photolysis on the filters and probe the photobleaching rates over extended time periods in dilute aqueous solutions. We find that most of the laboratory burns (FIREX 2016) increase the average carbon oxidation state of the BBOA over 1–3 days of photolysis. We also introduce a new characterization method called Solar Flux-Weighted Mass Absorption Cross-section (SFW-MAC) that describes the full absorption properties of the mixture. We find that estimates from our photolysis rates are in the same range as ambient lifetimes. Our results show that longer term aging studies of more than 4 days are needed to fully capture the bleaching rate of atmospheric BrC aerosols, especially for photorecalcitrant BrC that will play a larger role farther away from the original emission source."

Everest Reveals Significant Reduction in Anthropogenic Mercury Emissions Over the Past Decade,"Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic metal of global concern, with its anthropogenic emissions strictly controlled by the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The effectiveness of this convention is evaluated by global atmospheric Hg monitoring among other indicators. However, it is uncertain to directly link anthropogenic Hg emissions to atmospheric Hg concentrations mainly due to legacy Hg re-emissions. Here, we reconstructed the past atmospheric Hg concentrations and isotope compositions using the annually resolved (1982–2020) leaves of Androsace tapete at Mt. Everest, Tibetan Plateau. Our reconstruction indicates that the atmospheric Hg concentrations increased from the early 1980s to 2002 (3.31 ng m–3), followed by a large (∼70%) decline until 2020 (0.90 ng m–3). The declining trend of atmospheric Hg concentrations resembles those observed at North Hemisphere background sites, particularly in Chinese rural areas. Notably, there has been an increasing enrichment of light isotopes in atmospheric Hg over the past decade. Using an isotope mixing model based on δ202Hg, we show that the atmospheric Hg has declined over the past decade that is mainly driven by reduced anthropogenic emissions. The contributions of the terrestrial legacy re-emissions are rather stable, but their atmospheric fractions increased from ∼44% in 2010 to ∼62% in 2020. Given the importance of legacy Hg, the current strategies should prioritize assessing legacy Hg remobilization."

Identifying factors influencing surface ozone formation is complicated because ozone photochemical production rates are non-linearly dependent on concentrations of precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We compare ozone production regimes (OPRs) identified from satellite observations and model simulations, as defined by the ratio of column formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide (FNR, HCHO/NO2). We performed CAMx simulations for summer 2016 over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and compared output against two OMI NO2 and HCHO retrievals. Our analysis spans diurnal and altitudinal variations of OPRs, offering important insights for effective policy formulation. At the time of the OMI overpass oz(∼1:30 p.m. LT), OPR is NOx-limited over most of the CONUS, as determined from OMI column ratios. Analysis of CAMx column ratios shows similar results. In contrast, more regions are VOC-limited when we constrain our ratio to within the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). In the morning (∼9 a.m. LT), the CAMx PBL column ratios shift towards VOC-limited regime compared to the afternoon. We highlight areas of the CONUS where satellite measurements of FNR may not be an accurate indicator of near-surface OPRs. Air quality regulations based on satellite observations should consider the diurnal variations of surface OPRs and assess how well their ratios represent near-surface OPR. Our results have implications for interpretation of TEMPO data for policy relevant applications."

 Atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition has changed dramatically across China over the recent decades, exerting profound impacts on regional climate and ecosystem. Here we present an observation- and model-based analysis to disentangle the trends of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition in China, in response to the emission and climate changes, under the past (2013–2022) and future (2020–2050) scenarios. Both observational evidence and model results indicate an obvious declining trend of the national-average inorganic nitrogen deposition across China from 19.31 kg N ha−1 yr−1 to 14.64 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (−24.2 %) between 2013 and 2022, of which wet and dry deposition declines by −15.8 % and −33.4 %, respectively. Using a series of regional climate-chemistry coupled simulations, we find that the declined inorganic nitrogen deposition in 2013–2022 results comparably from the recent emission changes (69.8 % for oxidized nitrogen and 48.1 % for reduced nitrogen) and precipitation decreases. We further predict a significant decrease in inorganic nitrogen deposition under the SSP245 (−39.18 %) and SSP585 (−47.33 %) scenarios in the near-future. Overall, the contribution of emission reductions surpasses that of climatic changes and dominates the projected declining trends in inorganic nitrogen deposition. This paper provides some important insights into the drivers of atmospheric inorganic deposition in China and lays the foundation for assessing the effectiveness of emission control policies on atmospheric nitrogen deposition reduction."

 Near-surface ozone (O3) is one of the most severe air pollutants in China, particularly over densely populated Jiangsu Province in the Yangtze River Delta. In this study, an O3 source tagging technique is utilized in a chemistry-climate model to quantify the source contributions of various emission sectors and regions for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to O3 concentrations in Jiangsu Province during 2013–2019. The results show that the near-surface O3 in Jiangsu Province is mainly contributed by surrounding and remote anthropogenic NOx emissions through long-range transport. Local anthropogenic NOx emissions account for only 13 % and 18 % of the annual and summertime mean near-surface O3 in Jiangsu Province, respectively. Anthropogenic NOx emissions from the surface transportation, industry, and energy sectors account for 21 %, 22 % and 20 % of the annual mean near-surface O3 concentration in Jiangsu Province, respectively. Biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs emissions each explains one-third of the annual mean near-surface O3 concentration in Jiangsu, while methane and stratospheric chemical production contribute 21 % and 6 %, respectively. The sources from stratospheric production, aircraft, lightning, and foreign emissions are the primary contributors to O3 in the mid- and high troposphere. During high pollution days in Jiangsu Province, the near-surface O3 concentrations increase with the maximum exceeding 20 ppb, which is attributed to both the enhanced photochemical production and regional transport in favorable meteorological conditions."

 The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) plays crucial roles in regulating air pollution levels; however, its relationships with PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) under diverse meteorological conditions, as well as potential causes, are not yet well understood. This study leverages approximately three years of satellite/radiosonde derived PBLH to investigate PBLH-PM2.5 relationships under six typical circulation patterns in North China, and some novel physical explanations for the varying PBLH-PM2.5 relationship are proposed. The six circulation patterns are dominated by three high- and three low-pressure systems, with significantly negative PBLH-PM2.5 correlations exhibited in high-pressure patterns, while weak or even insignificant relationships in low-pressure patterns. Meteorological factors, particularly humidity and vertical winds, can largely explain the varying PBLH-PM2.5 relationships across different synoptic patterns. Under high-pressure patterns, elevated PM2.5 aligns well with high humidity within boundary layer, which restricts the magnitude of the PBLH and thus the negative PBLH-PM2.5 correlation. However, under low-pressure patterns, humidity in boundary layer and in free atmosphere exert conflicting effects on PBLH-PM2.5 relationship. Higher PM2.5 is observed when only the boundary layer is moist, whereas when thewhole column is moist or supersaturated, nucleation, transitions, and wet scavenging lead to reduced PM2.5 and lower PBLH, thereby the positive PBLH-PM2.5 correlation. Additionally, the column feature of vertical wind within boundary layer can also help explain the positive PBLH-PM2.5 relationship. These findings provide deeper insights into understanding boundary layer processes and pollution dynamics."

Our results suggest that such thin aerosol layers are not so rare in the UTLS and can potentially trigger and impact cirrus cloud formation through heterogeneous ice nucleation. By altering the microphysical cloud properties, this could affect clouds' evolution and lifetime and thus their climate effect. 
 One of the most powerful instruments for studying aerosol particles and their interactions with the environment is atmospheric lidar. In recent years, fluorescence lidar has emerged as a useful tool for identifying aerosol particles due to its link with biological content. Since 2022, this technique has been implemented in Leipzig, Germany. This paper describes the experimental setup and data analysis, with a special emphasis on the characterization of the new fluorescence channel centered at 466 nm. The new capabilities of the fluorescence lidar are examined and corroborated through several case studies. Most of the measurement cases considered are from the spring and summer of 2023, when large amounts of biomass-burning aerosol from huge forest fires in Canada were transported to Europe. The fluorescence of the observed aerosol layers is characterized. For wildfire smoke, the fluorescence capacity was typically in the range of 2×10-4–7 × 10−4, which aligns well with the values reported in the literature. The key aspects of this study are the capabilities of the fluorescence lidar technique, which can potentially improve not only the typing but even the detection of aerosol particles. In several measurement cases with an apparently low aerosol load, the fluorescence channel clearly revealed the presence of aerosol layers that were not detectable with the traditional elastic-backscatter channels. This capability is discussed in detail and linked to the fact that fluorescence backscattering is related to aerosol particles only. A second area of potential of the fluorescence technique is the distinction between non-activated aerosol particles and hydrometeors, given water's inability to exhibit fluorescence. A smoke–cirrus case study suggests an influence of the aerosol layer on cloud formation, as it seems to affect the elastic-backscatter coefficient within the cloud passing time. These aforementioned applications promise huge advancements towards a more detailed view of the aerosol–cloud interaction problem."

Varon,A data-efficient deep transfer learning framework for methane super-emitter detection in oil and gas fields using the Sentinel-2 satellite,"We target the challenge of detecting methane super-emitters in oil and gas fields, which is critical for mitigating climate change. Traditional satellite-based detectors struggle due to interference from complex surfaces. We developed a novel method using deep transfer learning that improves detection efficiency and accuracy by reducing artifacts and adapting methane knowledge to different regions. Application revealed significant methane emissions, demonstrating the potential of our method. 
 Efficiently detecting large methane point sources (super-emitters) in oil and gas fields is crucial for informing stakeholder decisions about mitigation actions. Satellite measurements by multispectral instruments, such as Sentinel-2, offer global and frequent coverage. However, methane signals retrieved from satellite multispectral images are prone to surface and atmospheric artifacts that vary spatially and temporally, making it challenging to build a detection algorithm that applies everywhere. Hence, laborious manual inspection is often necessary, hindering widespread deployment of the technology. Here, we propose a novel deep-transfer-learning-based methane plume detection framework. It consists of two components: an adaptive artifact removal algorithm (low-reflectance artifact detection, LRAD) to reduce artifacts in methane retrievals and a deep subdomain adaptation network (DSAN) to detect methane plumes. To train the algorithm, we compile a dataset comprising 1627 Sentinel-2 images from six known methane super-emitters reported in the literature. We evaluate the ability of the algorithm to discover new methane sources with a suite of transfer tasks, in which training and evaluation data come from different regions. Results show that DSAN (average macro F1 score 0.86) outperforms four convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MethaNet (average macro F1 score 0.70), ResNet-50 (average macro F1 score 0.77), VGG16 (average macro F1 score 0.73), and EfficientNet-V2L (average macro F1 score 0.78), in transfer tasks. The transfer learning algorithm overcomes the issue of conventional CNNs, which is their performance degrades substantially in regions outside regions with training data. We apply the algorithm trained with known sources to an unannotated region in the Algerian Hassi Messaoud oil field and reveal 34 anomalous emission events during a 1-year period, which are attributed to three methane super-emitters associated with production and transmission infrastructure. These results demonstrate the potential of our deep-transfer-learning-based method in contributing towards efficient methane super-emitter discovery using Sentinel-2 across different oil and gas fields worldwide."

Vertical profiles of four greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)) were analyzed and discussed. 
 Understanding the vertical profile of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is crucial for elucidating their sources and sinks, transport pathways, and influence on Earth's radiative balance, as well as for enhancing predictive capabilities for climate change. Remote sensing methods for measuring vertical GHG profiles often involve substantial uncertainties, while in situ measurements are limited by high equipment costs and operational expenses, rendering them impractical for long-term continuous observation efforts. In this study, we have developed an automatic low-cost and user-friendly multi-altitude atmospheric sampling device designed for small- and medium-sized unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs), balloons, and other flight platforms. A field campaign was carried out in the Mount Qomolangma (also known as Mount Everest) region, at an average surface altitude of 4300 m above sea level (a.s.l.). During the campaign, we conducted 15 flights and collected 139 samples from the ground surface up to a height of 1215 m using a hexacopter UAV platform equipped with the sampling device. The samples were analyzed using the Agilent gas chromatography (GC) 7890A instrument, enabling the derivation of the vertical profiles for four GHG species (CO2, CH4, N2O, and SF6) within the boundary layer of the Mount Qomolangma region.

Sutton;Niveta Jain;Ulrike Dragosits,A Framework for Gridded Estimates of Ammonia Emissions from Agriculture in South Asia,"The release of ammonia into the air poses a serious risk to ecosystems and human health and so it is important to characterise where this polluting gas originates from. It is known that agriculture is an important source of ammonia (e.g. using fertilisers) and that South Asia is a global hotspot of this pollutant. It is, therefore, important to refine methods used to estimate how much ammonia is released in South Asia to be then used in advanced chemistry models for air quality assessments. 
 Emissions of ammonia (NH3) from agricultural activities are a major threat to ecosystems and human health. Its quantification via emissions inventories is vital to the understanding of mitigation strategies and policy formation. South Asia, specifically the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), is a global hotspot of NH3 emissions from agriculture but also an area of great uncertainty due to a lack of data that are representative of local practices. This study presents a framework into which indigenous data can be ingested to adjust such estimates, to provide spatially distributed (0.1° × 0.1°) emissions in five agricultural sectors for improved input data for atmospheric chemistry transport models, by moving away from Tier 1 methods for emission inventories. Results incorporate data such as lower emission factors of NH3 following the application of Urea (13 % of total nitrogen lost as NH3-N) to provide a total estimated emission of NH3 in the SAARC of ~6 Tg, with high values (> 5 g NH3 m-2 a-1) in the Indian states Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP)."

Schwab,Aerial Estimates of Methane and Carbon Dioxide Emission Rates Using a Mass Balance Approach in New York State,"Methane and carbon dioxide emission rates were calculated for facilities across several sectors in New York State using aerial observations. Of the sampled facilities, landfills dominated the methane emission rates while combustion facilities had the highest carbon dioxide emission rates, followed by landfills. The self-reported EPA inventory is mostly underestimating landfill methane emissions apart from a few facilities with comparable numbers. 
 Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories are vital for climate mitigation as they can identify areas of need and ensure effective policy and regulation in reducing GHG emissions. Several studies have shown that self-reporting GHG inventories are undercounting methane emissions across all anthropogenic sectors showcasing an increasing need to validate the inventory with direct measurements. This study carried out aerial observations and emission rates of methane and carbon dioxide across multiple sectors in New York State (NYS). Emission rates were calculated for each of the sources using a mass balance method and were subsequently compared to the 2021 Environmental Protection Agency GHG Reporting Program (EPA GHGRP) Inventory. Landfills were the source of the highest observed methane emission estimates, ranging from 161–3440 kg/hr. There was also significant variation in observed emissions within facilities between seasons indicating a significant influence from meteorology. Observed carbon dioxide emission estimates were dominated by combustion facilities followed by landfills. Comparisons with the inventory show that methane emissions averaged over ten observed landfills are underestimated by a factor of 2. However, out of the ten landfills, five landfills had observed methane emission estimates significantly higher than the inventory value, four landfills had an inventory value within the uncertainty range of the observations, and one landfill observed emission estimate was markedly lower than the reported inventory estimate. Seneca Meadows Landfill was the highest emitter from the measurements and was ~4.3x higher than what was reported to the 2021 EPA GHGRP Inventory. The difference in emissions between landfills could be due to operational differences or waste quantities. NYS can use this information to inform the NYS GHG Inventory and improve emission estimation methodologies to better depict actual emissions."

CHN-CH4, a map of anthropogenic methane emissions was created by combining satellite data, national statistics, and climate guidelines. Over 30 years, China emitted 1157 Tg of methane, peaking in the 2010s. Shanxi province had the highest emissions. CHN-CH4 helps improve tracking, informs global climate models, and strengthens collaboration between science and policy to combat climate change. 
 China is the largest emitter of global methane emissions, contributing about 10 % to anthropogenic climate change based on existing methane inventories. However, significant uncertainties in these statistics limit the accuracy at both national and sub-national scales. The lack of continuous gridded emissions inventories also constrains the inverse analysis of atmospheric observations. To address these, we present CHN-CH4, a spatially aggregated 0.1°×0.1° anthropogenic methane emission inventory for mainland China from 1990 to 2020. CHN-CH4 offers the country with new temporal coverage and details, by means of national statistical yearbooks and remote sensing products. Over the three decades, mainland China emitted 1156.689 [884.857–1413.315] Tg of methane, with the highest emission occurred in the last decade.

As important priors, CHN-CH4 enables robust comparisons between estimated emissions and atmospheric observations, thereby improving the accuracy of inverse modelling, which is crucial for effective tracking of methane emissions. By providing a reliable and detailed emissions inventory, CHN-CH4 would be a valuable tool in accelerating the global effort to achieve equitable methane emission reduction goals, as well as supporting China’s climate policy."

This study advances our understanding of the selection of basic parameters in the four-dimensional local ensemble transform Kalman filter assimilation system and the performance of ensemble simulation in a particulate-matter-polluted environment. 
 Accurately simulating severe haze events through numerical models remains a challenge because of uncertainty in anthropogenic emissions and physical parameterizations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). In this study, a coupled Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem)–four-dimensional local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4D-LETKF) data assimilation system has been successfully developed to optimize particulate matter concentration by assimilating hourly ground-based observations in winter over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region and surrounding provinces. The effectiveness of the 4D-LETKF system and its sensitivity to the ensemble member size and length of the assimilation window are investigated. The promising results show that significant improvements have been made by analysis in the simulation of particulate matter during a severe haze event. The assimilation reduces root mean square errors in PM2.5 from 69.93 to 31.19 µg m−3 and of PM10 from 106.88 to 76.83 µg m−3. Smaller root mean square errors and larger correlation coefficients in the analysis of PM2.5 and PM10 are observed across nearly all verification stations, indicating that the 4D-LETKF assimilation optimizes the simulation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration efficiently. Sensitivity experiments reveal that the combination of 48 h of assimilation window length and 40 ensemble members shows the best performance for reproducing the severe haze event. In view of the performance of ensemble members, an increasing ensemble member size improves ensemble spread among each forecasting member, facilitates the spread of state vectors about PM2.5 and PM10 information in the first guess, favors the variances between each initial condition in the next assimilation cycle, and leads to better simulation performance in both severe and moderate haze events. This study advances our understanding of the selection of basic parameters in the 4D-LETKF assimilation system and the performance of ensemble simulations in a particulate-matter-polluted environment."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00291,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究论文主要探讨了使用机器学习方法预测大气相关有机化合物的纯组分表面张力。大气气溶胶的表面性质会影响其化学和物理过程，例如吸湿增长、气溶胶-云相互作用和非均相化学反应。由于许多有机化合物缺乏实验数据，因此需要开发预测方法。该研究使用实验数据训练机器学习模型，利用化合物的分子结构和温度来预测表面张力。研究结果表明，将预测的表面张力值纳入热力学计算中，可以显著改变气溶胶活化成云滴所需的临界过饱和度。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它研究的气溶胶和云滴形成过程与大气成分分析和气候模型密切相关，这些模型通常依赖于遥感数据进行验证和改进。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术有间接但重要的关联。,"['atmospheric aerosols', 'organic compounds', 'surface tension', 'aerosol-cloud interactions', 'hygroscopic growth', 'machine learning', 'cloud droplet activation', 'thermodynamic modeling']",Ryan Schmedding;Mees Franssen;Andreas Zuend,A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting the Pure-Component Surface Tension of Atmospherically Relevant Organic Compounds,"Atmospheric aerosols are complex mixtures of highly functionalized organic compounds, water, inorganic electrolytes, metals, and carbonaceous species. The surface properties of atmospheric aerosol particles can influence several of their chemical and physical impacts, including their hygroscopic growth, aerosol–cloud interactions, and heterogeneous chemical reactions. The effects of the various compounds within a particle on its surface tension depend in part on the pure-component surface tensions. For many of the myriad of organic compounds of interest, experimental pure-component surface tension data at tropospheric temperatures are lacking, thus, requiring the development and application of property estimation methods. In this work, a compiled database of experimental pure-component surface tension data, covering a wide range of organic compound classes and temperatures, is used to train four different types of machine learning models to predict the temperature-dependent pure-component surface tensions of atmospherically relevant organic compounds. The trained models process input information about the temperature and the molecular structure of an organic compound, initially in the form of a Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string, to enable predictions. Our quantitative model assessment shows that extreme gradient-boosted descent along with Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) key descriptors of molecular structure provided the best balance of derived input complexity and model performance, resulting in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ∼1 mJ m–2 in pure-component surface tension. Additionally, a simplified model based on molar mass, elemental ratios, and temperature as inputs was developed for use in applications for which molecular structure information is incomplete (RMSE of ∼2 mJ m–2). We demonstrate that including predicted pure-component surface tension values in thermodynamically rigorous bulk–surface partitioning calculations may substantially modify the critical supersaturations necessary for aerosol activation into cloud droplets."

This analysis addresses a key DCOTSS science question, namely “How much tropospheric air and water is irreversibly injected into the stratosphere by convection?” A novel method for defining individual storms or a cluster of adjacent storms as objects and tracking them throughout their lifetime facilitates the analysis. Overshooting convection injected 3.92 × 106 – 5.36 × 106 km3 of air into the stratosphere in 2021 and 9.59 × 106 – 1.06 × 107 km3 in 2022 over the North American study domain with GOES being higher than GridRad during both years. GOES overshooting detections were more uncertain due to difficulty differentiating updrafts from adjacent broad areas of cold outflow. Overshooting volume from the top 10 storm objects each year contributed 37%–52% of the total domain‐wide volume. Total object‐lifetime volume from these events ranged from ∼1.3 × 105 to 7.9 × 105 km3 for GOES and ∼8.7 × 104 to 8.0 × 105 km3 for GridRad. Overshooting seldom exceeded 5% of the total anvil area, and most often occupied <1%, demonstrating that very small regions within convection are responsible for impacting stratosphere composition. Despite differences in overshooting characteristics, airmasses initiated from GOES and NEXRAD overshooting and advected forward in time by reanalysis model winds had similar spatial and vertical distributions, indicating that geostationary satellite data could be used to study the long‐range transport of overshooting airmasses."

However, observational studies tracing these pollution episodes along the pathway to Delhi are lacking. This study investigates haze pollution at an upwind site in Sonipat using advanced instrumentation during October 25 to 15 November 2023, encompassing biomass burning and Diwali events. Sudden spikes in pollutants caused severe haze, temporary reductions in pollution due to rainfall, and a resurgence of haze during Diwali. Two major haze episodes were identified, with particulate matter (PM2.5) levels exceeding 300 μg/m3. Organics dominated composition based PM2.5 (C‐PM2.5) followed by Black Carbon (BC), jointly accounting for ∼80% of total mass during all the episodes, with secondary inorganics contributed minimally. Limited day‐night variations and low inorganics contribution suggested minimal photochemical activity and secondary formation. Elevated levels of biomass burning tracers and emission ratios indicated aged, oxidized aerosols from crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana, supported by fire count data and 72‐hr backward trajectory analysis. Regional meteorology, including a shallow atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and low wind speeds, hindered pollutant dispersion, leading to accumulation and prolonged haze. By integrating emission analysis, meteorological factors, and transport dynamics, this study provides critical insights into haze formation, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation strategies, such as stricter crop residue burning controls and improved emission management, to address haze pollution and its health risks effectively."

However, little is known regarding the chemical speciation and long‐term trends of NOy in China. In this study, we analyzed the temporal variations in NOy and speciated compounds during eight intensive field campaigns and 6 years of continuous measurements during 2007–2023 at Mount Tai in the North China Plain (NCP). The measured concentration levels of NOy were significantly higher than those at other remote high‐altitude sites globally. NO2 was the most abundant species (24%–42%), followed by pNO3− (18%–34%) and PAN (7%–12%). Over the study period, the concentrations of NOx, NOy, and NOz exhibited a significant downward trend, while pNO3− exhibited a significant upward trend. Vertical transport from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) substantially influences the atmosphere at Mount Tai, with air masses from both PBL and free troposphere containing different chemical compositions of NOy. The lower free troposphere above the NCP contained relatively high abundances of PAN and pNO3−. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of decadal trends in NOy and its chemical speciation in China's high‐altitude atmosphere. Our findings underscore the necessity for additional efforts to mitigate photochemical and secondary aerosol pollution caused by nitrogen species at high altitudes in China."

A recent observational effort into this mechanism, the Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical and CLimate Impact Project (ACCLIP), sampled the composition of the ASM UTLS over the northwestern Pacific region during boreal summer 2022 using two airborne platforms. In this work, we integrate Lagrangian trajectory modeling with convective cloud top observations to diagnose ASM convective transport which contributed to ACCLIP airborne observations. This diagnostic is applied to explore the properties of convective transport associated with prominent ASM sub‐systems, revealing that for species ranging in lifetime from days to months, transport from convection along the East Asia Subtropical Front was generally associated with more UTLS pollutants than transport from convection over South Asia. The convective transport diagnostic is used to isolate three convective transport events over eastern Asia which had distinct chemical tracer relationship behaviors, indicating the different economical behaviors of the contributing source regions. One of these transport events is explored in greater detail, where a polluted air mass was sampled from convection over the Northeast China Plain which may have been high enough in altitude to impact the composition of the stratosphere. Overall, the presented diagnosis of convective transport contribution to ACCLIP airborne sampling indicates a key scientific success of the campaign and enables process studies of the climate interactions from the two ASM sub‐systems."

Pratt,Sensitivity of Wintertime Arctic Black Carbon to Removal Processes and Regional Alaskan Sources,"Air pollutants are primarily transported from midlatitude emission regions in winter and early spring, leading to elevated concentrations of aerosols, including black carbon (BC), in the Arctic, a phenomenon known as Arctic haze. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry is used to investigate potential causes of uncertainties in modeling Arctic BC for winter 2014. The model captures observed variability in BC at surface sites, reproducing BC concentrations at Zeppelin but showing a low bias at Tiksi, Alert, and Utqiaġvik/Barrow. The influence of removal processes on model BC biases is explored by switching off dry or wet deposition. Wet deposition, during transport in the North Atlantic storm track, and locally over Svalbard, dominates BC removal at Zeppelin, while wet removal in the Pacific storm track influences BC at Alert and Utqiaġvik/Barrow. Dry removal over Asian source regions and Alaska affects BC at Utqiaġvik/Barrow, and is larger than wet removal at Tiksi due to the proximity of local/regional anthropogenic sources. Regional runs over northern Alaska in late January show improved simulated BC compared to observations at Utqiaġvik/Barrow, in part, due to better resolution of removal processes, and local/regional emissions. Sensitivity runs also show that regional Alaskan sources, notably from the North Slope of Alaska oil fields, may be contributing 30%–50%, on average, to observed BC at Utqiaġvik/Barrow in January and February 2014, with the remainder from outside the region. These findings highlight the importance of local Arctic emissions, and the need for improved emission inventories in the Arctic."

 Multiple Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments have been operating in the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics (LAP), Thessaloniki, Greece over a decade to monitor trace gases in the troposphere. In this work, we present methodology, applied for the first time in LAP for retrieving total NO2 columns in the atmosphere by applying the Direct Sun DOAS technique (DS-DOAS) on solar direct radiance spectra acquired with a research grade MAX-DOAS system, Delta. For the retrieval of total NO2 two spectral fitting methods were tested using cross sections of NO2 at two different temperatures for the tropospheric and the stratospheric component. The method that is based on concurrent spectral DOAS fittings with NO2 cross sections at two temperatures (294 K and 220 K) (2T method) produces results of better quality as compared to the method using NO2 cross section at one 254.5 K (1T method), with latter underestimating the total NO2 vertical column density by up to 15%. This was verified by the good agreement (correlation coefficient R = 0.973) against the total NO2 columns measured by an independently calibrated collocated Pandora system. Finally, the total NO2 columns derived from the Delta instrument were compared with collocated observations by S5P/TROPOMI, showing an underestimation of the latter by up to 40% for days with high NO2 concentrations, while the agreement is better under low NO2 conditions. The overall agreement between the satellite and Delta system observations is characterized by a correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a mean bias of −2.63 ± 2.75 Pmolec/cm2."

 Understanding the interactions between atmospheric aerosols and the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is important for human health, climate, and weather forecasting models. In this study, an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) model is coupled with a radiative transfer model (RTM) to investigate the effects of aerosol optical depth τλ and single scattering albedo ω on the growth and thermodynamics of the PBL, or the so-called aerosol-PBL interactions (API). The developed model, called EDMF-AERO, was first extensively validated against in-situ radiosonde and microwave radiometer (MWR) observations in the summer, showing very good performance and enabling us to study the API effects proposed in the literature called stove and dome. Having established the model’s satisfactory accuracy we performed a sensitivity study, isolated API effects study, and estimated which compound effect of API influences PBL development more. For the stove case for τ500=0.4 and ω=0.9, the PBL growth speeds up ∼8% and warms up ∼12.5% faster compared to the reference (τ500=0,ω=1.0). For the dome case for τ500=0.4 and ω=0.9, the PBL growth slows down ∼5% and warms up ∼4.5% slower compared to the reference. In extreme conditions (τ500=1.5, ω=0.81) for the stove case we recorded ∼62% and ∼72% increase in PBL growth and heating rates respectively. For the dome case, we recorded ∼21% and ∼22% decreases in PBL growth and heating rates respectively. In both cases, the feedback loop severely impacts surface aerosol concentrations and enhances heat index. Based on the sensitivity runs, a parametrization relating the τ500 and ω on the PBL heating rate and PBL growth is suggested. The EDMF-AERO model developed in this study proves to be capable of providing new insights into the topic of API."

Introducing transfer entropy as a novel method reveals that aged organic aerosol originates from both open-ocean ozonolysis and local peat-burning oxidation. Methanesulfonic acid and organic sea spray both mirror phytoplankton activity, with the former closely tied to coccolithophore blooms and the latter linked to diatoms, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria. 
 Organic aerosol (OA) is recognized as a significant component of particulate matter (PM), yet their specific composition and sources, especially over remote areas, remain elusive due to the overall scarcity of high-resolution online data. In this study, positive matrix factorization was performed on organic aerosol mass spectra obtained from high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) measurements to resolve sources contributing to coastal PM. The focus was on a summertime period marked by enhanced biological productivity with prevailing pristine maritime conditions. Four OA factors were deconvolved by the source apportionment model. The analysis revealed primary marine organic aerosol (PMOA) as the predominant submicron OA at Mace Head during summertime, accounting for 42 % of the total resolved mass. This was trailed by more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) at 32 %, methanesulfonic acid organic aerosol (MSA-OA) at 17 %, and locally emitted peat-derived organic aerosol (peat-OA) at 9 % of the total OA mass. Elemental ratios (O:C–H:C) were derived for each of these factors: PMOA (0.66–1.16), MO-OOA (0.78–1.39), MSA-OA (0.66–1.39), and peat-OA (0.43–1.34). The specific O:C–H:C range for MO-OOA hints at aliphatic and lignin-like compounds contributing to more oxidized organic aerosol formation. The total mass concentrations of primary organic aerosol and secondary organic aerosol were overall equal and almost exclusively present in the marine boundary layer, in agreement with previous findings. This study reveals that OA not only reflects atmospheric chemistry and meteorology – as evidenced by the significant ageing of summertime polar air masses over the North Atlantic, driven by ozonolysis under Greenland anticyclonic conditions – but also serves as an indicator of marine ecosystems. This is evident from MSA-OA being notably associated with stress enzyme markers and PMOA showing the typical makeup of largely abacterial phytoplankton extracellular metabolic processes. This study also reveals distinct source regions within the North Atlantic for OA factors. MSA-OA is primarily associated with the Iceland Basin, with rapid production following coccolithophore blooms (lag of 1–2 d), while diatoms contribute to a slower formation process (lag of 9 d), reflecting distinct oceanic biological processes. In contrast, PMOA is sourced from more variable ecoregions, including the southern Celtic Sea, western European Basin, and Newfoundland Basin, with additional contributions from chlorophytes and cyanobacteria at more southerly latitudes. Overall, these findings emphasize the need for longer-term investigations to further map the influence of phytoplankton taxa variability on aerosol composition and the broader impacts on aerosol–climate interactions."

MSA concentrations in ice cores decreased over the industrial era, which has been attributed to pollution-driven changes in DMS chemistry. We use a model to investigate DMS chemistry compared to observations of DMS, MSA, and sulfate. We find that modeled DMS, MSA, and sulfate are influenced by pollution-sensitive oxidant concentrations, characterization of DMS chemistry, and other variables. 
 Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is primarily emitted by marine phytoplankton and oxidized in the atmosphere to form methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfate aerosols. Ice cores in regions affected by anthropogenic pollution show an industrial-era decline in MSA, which has previously been interpreted as indicating a decline in phytoplankton abundance. However, a simultaneous increase in DMS-derived sulfate (bioSO4) in a Greenland ice core suggests that pollution-driven oxidant changes caused the decline in MSA by influencing the relative production of MSA versus bioSO4. Here we use GEOS-Chem, a global chemical transport model, and a zero-dimensional box model over three time periods (preindustrial era, peak North Atlantic NOx pollution, and 21st century) to investigate the chemical drivers of industrial-era changes in MSA and bioSO4, and we examine whether four DMS oxidation mechanisms reproduce trends and seasonality in observations. We find that box model and GEOS-Chem simulations can only partially reproduce ice core trends in MSA and bioSO4 and that wide variation in model results reflects sensitivity to DMS oxidation mechanism and oxidant concentrations. Our simulations support the hypothesized increase in DMS oxidation by the nitrate radical over the industrial era, which increases bioSO4 production, but competing factors such as oxidation by BrO result in increased MSA production in some simulations, which is inconsistent with observations. To improve understanding of DMS oxidation, future work should investigate aqueous-phase chemistry, which produces 82 %–99 % of MSA and bioSO4 in our simulations, and constrain atmospheric oxidant concentrations, including the nitrate radical, hydroxyl radical, and reactive halogens."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated that the LNP samples were spherical and, notably, that the surface of grass LNP appeared floccose compared to the other two LNP types. Using our custom-built drop Freezing Ice Nuclei Counter (FINC), we found that LNPs from softwood (LNPsw) were the most ice-active with a median ice nucleation temperature, T50, of −15.6 °C at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. 31P NMR suggested that LNPsw had the lowest number of hydroxyl groups, indicating that the functional groups present at the surface of the nanoparticles may be impacting the ice nucleation ability of LNPs. We then separated LNPsw by size with cascade centrifugation to create three distinct size bins of particles with mean diameters of 79, 154, and 279 nm. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was used to quantify the size, surface area, and particle number of these size-resolved LNPsw. Despite their different sizes, all size-resolved LNPsw suspensions at 0.2 mg/mL were ice active at the same temperature, with T50 values ranging from −14.9 to −15.9 °C. Remarkably, solubilized lignin, which did not undergo the nanoprecipitation procedure, froze in the same temperature range. Thus, the conversion of solubilized lignin into nanoparticles did not improve the ice nucleation ability of softwood lignin. We reconcile these results with a proposed role of the aggregation of lignin, as nanoparticles or dissolved, which facilitates the ice nucleation of aqueous droplets of lignin. Overall, the chemical composition and the ability of nonproteinaceous organic matter to aggregate may govern its ice nucleating ability. These findings help us understand how BBOA nucleate ice and impacts the formation and phase of clouds in the atmosphere."

This relationship is mostly evident for particles in the ultrafine size range. Furthermore, epidemiological research has found that those who live near airports have increased risks of premature mortality, decreased lung function, and adverse birth outcomes. Previous exposure studies of airport emissions have been based in urban centers, making it difficult to selectively measure airport emissions without the contribution of other related sources. Our aim was to characterize the relationships between air pollutant particle measures (ultrafine particles [UFP], fine particulate matter [PM2.5], black carbon [BC]) and air traffic (landings and take-offs [LTO]) at the Ottawa International Airport [YOW]. A monitoring site was established in greenspace approximately 600 m east of YOW and away from roadways and urban development. Air pollutant particles were measured continuously from June 2022 to January 2023. Flight track data was used to derive hourly LTO counts. Analyses of source directionality showed that UFP concentrations were higher when downwind from the airport. Further, when wind speeds were less than 20 km/h, UFP and LTO showed similar diurnal trends. No evidence of these associations was evident for PM2.5 and BC. After selecting for airport wind directions and wind speeds less than 20 km/h, linear regression models showed each additional takeoff led to a 10–13% increase in the 50th to 99th UFP concentration percentiles. Our findings support policies designed to reduce potential health impacts of airport emissions on the exposed community."

The Chinese Loess Plateau develops loess‐paleosol sequences (eolian deposits) reflecting glacial‐interglacial cycles. Here, we investigate the Hg concentration and isotopic composition of loess‐paleosol sequences covering three glacial‐interglacial cycles (spanning 350–80 ka). Paleosol layers display higher THg, Δ199Hg, and Δ200Hg values than loess layers, meaning enhanced Hg(II) wet deposition during interglacials. Based on a Δ200Hg‐based mixing model, Hg(II) wet and Hg(0) dry depositions account for 42% and 58% of Hg input into the Chinese Loess Plateau during interglacials but 21% and 79% during glacials, respectively. This work highlights a strong climatic control on atmospheric Hg deposition at glacial‐interglacial time scales, and suggests that atmospheric Hg deposition will likely increase in middle latitudes without considering perturbations of anthropogenic emissions."

This work examined changes in GW activity observed by AWE during two major Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) in the 2023 and 2024 winter season. Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitude GW activity during these events shared similarities. Variations in mesospheric GW activity showed an evident correlation with the magnitude of zonal wind in the upper stratosphere. NH midlatitude GW activity at ∼ $\mathit{\sim }$87 km was reduced following the onset of SSWs, likely caused by wind filtering and wave saturation. The upward propagation of GWs was suppressed when the zonal wind reversed from eastward to westward in the upper stratosphere. In regions where the zonal wind weakened but remained eastward, the weakened GWs could be due to their refraction to shorter vertical wavelengths."

 The Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) traps pollutants from South and East Asia elevated by deep convection, which profoundly influences the atmospheric composition and hence stratospheric chemical processes. Here, we identified a significant weakening of the ASMA in the layer of 70–200 hPa during 1958–2020 and found that the change in anthropogenic aerosol emissions was the dominant external forcing responsible for this weakening trend. Significant increases in anthropogenic aerosol emissions over South and East Asia and decreased aerosol emissions over Central Asia led to a decreased meridional temperature gradient at low-latitudes and an increased meridional temperature gradient at mid-latitudes in the troposphere over the Eurasian continent, resulting in a weakened ASMA. The results based on satellite observations and numerical simulations indicated that the weakened ASMA may affect the spatial distribution of CO and water vapor in the UTLS over Asian summer monsoon region."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108129,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了冬季巴伦支-喀拉海（BKS）快速海冰减少事件发生时，大气变暖的变化情况。论文利用1979-2024年的卫星记录，将时间分为两个阶段（1979-2002和2003-2024），重点分析了两个阶段之间的差异。研究发现，气候变化影响了与快速海冰减少相关的BKS上空大气反气旋异常的位置和结构，导致绝热冷却的最大值从上对流层转移到中对流层，并增强了水平温度平流，尤其是在近地面的经向方向上。因此，尽管BKS上空低对流层中的辐射冷却增强，但正大气温度异常增强，最大值从800 hPa转移到地面。这项研究强调了在近几十年快速海冰减少期间，增强的暖水平温度平流对地表变暖的重要性。由于BKS上空大气温度和湿度增加，导致向下长波辐射增加，正的皮肤温度异常也随之放大。该研究使用了卫星观测数据来分析大气温度和海冰变化，与大气环境遥感技术相关。,"['sea ice concentration', 'atmospheric temperature', 'satellite observations', 'longwave radiation', 'atmospheric warming', 'Barents-Kara Seas (BKS)']",Xia Hu;Zhina Jiang;Linhao Zhong;Minghu Ding;Lei Zhang,Changes of atmospheric warming associated with rapid sea ice loss events on the synoptic time scale in winter,"•The positive atmospheric temperature anomaly during rapid sea ice loss amplifies, but with the maximum shifting from 800 hPa to the surface. •The maximum adiabatic cooling migrates from the upper to the mid-troposphere, while the horizontal temperature advection is bottom amplified. •The enhanced warm horizontal temperature advection plays a crucial role on the surface air temperature during rapid sea ice decline. 
 This study examines how the Arctic warming during rapid sea ice decline changes over Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) on the synoptic time scale in winter. We divide the satellite record 1979–2024 into two time periods: 1979–2002 (P1) and 2003–2024 (P2), with a focus on the difference between P1 and P2. A rapid sea ice loss event is defined, when the sea ice tendency index falls below the 5th percentile of the corresponding P1/P2 time series for at least three consecutive days. Composite analysis shows that the negative center of sea ice concentration anomaly for rapid sea ice loss events in P2 shifts more northward compared to P1, consistent with the retreat of Arctic sea ice edge due to global warming. Climate change influences the position and structure of atmospheric anticyclonic anomaly over BKS associated with rapid sea ice loss, which makes the maximum adiabatic cooling in the upper troposphere shift to mid-troposphere and enhances the horizontal temperature advection, particularly in the meridional direction near the surface. Consequently, the positive atmospheric temperature anomaly intensifies, with the maximum at 800 hPa shift to the surface, despite enhanced diabatic cooling in the lower troposphere over BKS. This study underscores the significance of enhanced warm horizontal temperature advection with bottom amplified on the surface warming during rapid sea ice decline in the recent decades. As a result, the positive skin temperature anomaly is also magnified, which is due to increased downward longwave radiation resulting from increased atmospheric temperature and moisture over BKS."

However, observational data inherently exhibit spatiotemporal gaps, and high costs and equipment requirements further exacerbate these limitations, particularly for in situ measurements. While particle-resolved models can simulate individual particle composition and size changes and serve as benchmarks, they face challenges in real-world applications due to a combination of factors. One of the major challenges is the limited availability of detailed input data (e.g., emission inventories) that accurately reflect actual environmental conditions. In this study, we frame the emulation of aerosol simulation as a general task and treat the estimation of real-world mixing states as a downstream task. We developed a foundation model pretrained on particle-resolved simulations and fine-tuned it using observational data from the field campaign. The fine-tuned model consistently outperformed baseline models, showing greater stability and robustness across various data sets. Permutation feature importance and sensitivity analyses revealed that aerosol species concentrations were the most critical factors for the foundation model. This approach, which involves pretraining on particle-resolved simulations and fine-tuning on limited observational data, offers a viable solution to challenges posed by limited observational data."

 Satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) offer a promising approach for monitoring plant heat and water stresses across spatial scales. Most studies have focused on seasonal responses of satellite-observed SIF and its physiological component, fluorescence efficiency (Φf), to heat and water stresses. However, their diurnal responses remain poorly understood. Besides, polar-orbiting satellites typically use a daily correction factor to upscale fixed-time SIF observations into daily averages (SIFdaily). Given the diurnal SIF variations, the reliability of this approach under stress conditions is uncertain. In this study, we used the ratio of SIF to near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRvR) as a a linear approximation of Φf. Then, we applied the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to model hourly observations of summer (June–August) SIF and Φf from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) data. Our modeling was constrained to mainland China from 2019 to 2022. We calculated anomalies in SIF and Φf at different times of the day and conducted linear regressions on them with daily air temperature or soil moisture anomalies. Our results showed that the responses of SIF and Φf to stresses varied significantly with time of day and vegetation type. On days experiencing high water and heat stresses, morning and afternoon SIF exhibited weaker declines than midday. In contrast, morning Φf generally exhibited stronger increases than midday, whereas afternoon Φf showed weaker increases. Such diurnal differences in SIF and Φf responses were more pronounced in forests than in grasslands and intensified with rising water and heat stress levels. Additionally, we found that morning polar-orbiting satellite SIF observations tended to overestimate SIFdaily changes, whereas midday observations tended to underestimate them. These biases also intensified with rising stress levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of diurnal satellite SIF observations in deepening our understanding of plant responses to water and heat stress, as well as in improving the monitoring of plant stresses."

 Aerosols and clouds play essential roles in the global climate system, and aerosol–cloud interactions have a significant impact on the radiation balance, water cycle, and energy cycle of the Earth–atmosphere system. To understand the effect of aerosols on the vertical distribution of stratocumulus microphysical quantities in southwest China, we analyzed data from nine aircraft observations over Guangxi from 10 October to 3 November 2020. This analysis focused on the daylight variation characteristics and formation mechanisms of stratocumulus microphysical profiles, considering the influence of aerosol number concentration in relation to the source of air mass and individual cases. Aerosol number concentration (Na) and cloud droplet concentration (Nc) decreased gradually with an altitude increase below 1500 m and did not change with a height between 1500 and 3300 m. The temperature inversion layer at the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) hindered the increase in the cloud droplet particle size. The lower layer of the stratocumulus cloud in Guangxi mainly contained small-sized cloud droplets (effective diameter of a cloud droplet (Ed) < 15 µm), and the middle and upper layers of cloud droplets were large-particle-size cloud droplets (Ed > 20 µm). The vertical distribution of cloud microphysical quantity had apparent daylight variation. When aerosols in the PBL were transported to the upper air (14:00 to 20:00 Beijing time, BJT), Nc in the lower layer decreased, and the small-particle-size cloud droplets (Ed < 20 µm) in the middle layer and upper layer increased. Aerosols from the free atmosphere were transported into the PBL (10:00 to 13:00 BJT), providing an abundance of cloud condensation nuclei, which increased the number of small-particle-size cloud droplets in the lower layer of the cloud (near the top of the PBL). The characteristics of cloud microphysical quantities (Nc and Ed) were also affected by the source of air mass and the height of the PBL. Na and Nc were high under the influence of land air mass or aerosols within the PBL, and the cloud droplet number concentration spectrum was unimodal. Na and Nc were low under the influence of marine air mass or above the boundary layer, and the cloud droplet number concentration spectrum was bimodal. The relationship between stratocumulus and aerosol in this region is consistent with the Twomey effect. Ed and Na remain negatively correlated in different liquid water content ranges, and the FIE (aerosol first indirect effect) ranged from −0.07 to −0.58."

Bradley;Barbara Dix;Fergus Mackenzie;J. Pepijn Veefkind;Joost A. de Gouw,Deep transfer learning method for seasonal TROPOMI XCH4 albedo correction,"Currently, measurement of methane from the TROPOMI satellite is biased with respect to surface reflectance. This study demonstrates a new method of correcting for this bias on a seasonal timescale to allow for differences in surface reflectance in areas of intense agriculture where growing seasons may introduce a reflectance bias. We have successfully implemented this technique in the Denver–Julesburg basin, where agriculture and methane extraction infrastructure is often co-located. 
 The retrieval of methane from satellite measurements is sensitive to the reflectance of the surface, and in many regions, especially those with agriculture, surface reflectance depends on the season. Existing corrections for this effect do not take into account a changing relationship between reflectance and the methane correction value over time. It is an important issue to consider, as agricultural emissions of methane are significant and other sources, like oil and gas production, are also often located in agricultural lands. In this work, we use a set of 12 monthly machine learning models to generate a seasonally resolved surface albedo correction for TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) methane data across the Denver–Julesburg basin. We found that land cover is important in the correction, specifically the type of crops grown in an area, with drought-resistant-crop-covered areas requiring a correction of 5–6 ppb larger than areas covered in water-intensive crops in the summer. Additionally, the correction over different land covers changes significantly over the seasonally resolved timescale, with corrections over drought-resistant crops being up to 10 ppb larger in the summer than in the winter. This correction will allow for more accurate determination of methane emissions by removing the effect of agricultural and other seasonal effects on the albedo correction. The correction may also allow for the deconvolution of agricultural methane emissions, which are seasonally dependent, from oil and gas emissions, which are more constant in time."

Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomography technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds’ inner structure with high spatial resolution and significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Also, the technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles. 
 The submillimeter-wave radiometer operating in the along-track scanning mode continuously collects brightness temperature (TB) data over a two-dimensional (2D) cloud cross-section as the platform moves forward. TB observations from multiple positions and viewing angles show great promise in better constraining the 2D cloud microphysical properties compared to single-angle observations. In this study, we develop two types of tomographic reconstruction algorithms to retrieve 2D ice water content (IWC) profiles using multi-angle TB observations. The one-dimensional (1D) tomographic algorithm performs 1D retrievals beam by beam using each TB observation at a specific sensor position and viewing angle to derive cloud properties along the propagation path. It then integrates the 1D retrieval results to construct 2D cloud cross-section. The 2D tomographic algorithm directly constrains the 2D cloud microphysical properties using multi-angle scanning TB observations. Starting with an initial assumption, the algorithm iteratively refines the 2D cloud microphysical quantities by minimizing discrepancies between TB simulations and observations under prior constraints. Both tomographic algorithms are developed based on a hybrid of Bayesian Monte Carlo integration (MCI) and the optimal estimation method (OEM). A simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of two tomographic reconstruction algorithms. The experiment demonstrates stable convergence of both tomographic methods, with the 2D tomographic algorithm exhibiting superior performance. The experiment results highlight the significant advantage of using multi-angle observations to constrain 2D cloud structure. Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomographic technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds' inner structure with high spatial resolution. Also, the technique significantly improves retrieval accuracy by correcting systematic biases and reducing the derivation of retrieval errors. Furthermore, the tomography technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles."

Labban;Khan Alam,"Climatology, trend and correlations of aerosol, cloud and meteorology over the climatologically important monsoon and adjacent northern regions of Pakistan","•An increasing trend in AOD and AI is observed over R1 region, while decreasing trends are observed over R2 region. •AE shows a decreasing trend over both the regions. •Seasonal changes in cloud properties are relatively high in spring and summer over both the R1 and R2 regions. •AI shows significant negative correlations with COT/CER/LWP in R1 but weak positive correlations in R2. •The correlation between aerosols, clouds, and meteorological factors is stronger in R1 compared to R2. 
 Quantifying changes in aerosols, cloud characteristics, and their correlations on both spatial and temporal scales is essential for understanding future climate changes. In this study, 11 years (2009–2019) of aerosol, meteorological, and cloud datasets are analyzed to evaluate climatology, trends, and their relationships over the climatologically important core monsoon- (R1) region and the adjacent high-altitude northern (R2) region of Pakistan. The study utilizes Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data for aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE), CLARA-A3 data for liquid cloud properties such as cloud droplet effective radius (CER), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), cloud geometrical thickness (CGT), and liquid water path (LWP), and ERA-5 data for meteorological variables at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. Negative trend in AE over both the R1 and R2 regions (−5 % and −10 %) are observed which could be due to deforestation, increasing temperature, and changing precipitation patterns that may disturb the dust activity and monsoon circulations. The concurrent increasing trend in AOD (12.4 %) and Aerosol Index (AI) (3.2 %) is observed over R1, likely driven by rapid urbanization, industrialization, and biomass burning. Conversely, a decreasing trend in AOD (−7.0 %) and AI (−14.14 %) is observed over R2, possibly due to anthropogenic emission control policies in China, that reduces aerosol inflow in remote areas, including the high-altitude R2 region. Positive trends are observed in CDNC, CER, CGT, COT, and LWP, with percent changes of 9.2 %, 20.7 %, 4.06 %, 6.7 %, and 10.7 % over R1 region and 34.7 %, 5.4 %, 16.98 %, 21.9 %, and 24.8 % over R2 region, respectively. Meteorological variables, including mixing ratio (q), geopotential (z), convective available potential energy (CAPE), horizontal wind speed at 10 m above the surface (si10m), dew point temperature at 2 m (d2m) and temperature at 2 m (t2m), show positive trends over both R1 and R2 regions. Correlation analysis reveals positive AOD-CDNC and negative AOD-CER relationships in both regions. In contrast, AI-COT, AI-CGT and AI-LWP correlations are negative (−0.13, −0.26 and −0.20) over R1 region but insignificant weak negative AI-CGT (−5.7 × 10−6) and positive AI-COT (0.099) and AI-LWP (0.061) are observed over R2 region. The contrasting behavior of AI-COT and AI-LWP correlations can be attributed to the difference in cloud regime and meteorological conditions over the R1 and R2 regions. The results of this study provide critical insights into aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions, with implications for regional climate modeling, monsoon variability, and future climate projections. The findings also contribute to global aerosol-cloud research by emphasizing the importance of region-specific mechanisms in shaping aerosol-cloud interactions."

Currently, physical dispersion models and satellite observations are the primary methods used to forecast and monitor volcanic ash clouds, but each has limitations. Leveraging their respective advantages and effectively integrating physical dispersion models and satellite data are key to improving the accuracy of volcanic ash dispersion forecasts. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) can be used to optimize model predictions of volcanic ash dispersion by assimilating observational data, thereby combining the complementary benefits of predictions and observations. In this study, an EnKF‐based data assimilation method is presented that combines satellite observations with a volcanic ash dispersion model (HYSPLIT) to further improve the accuracy of volcanic ash dispersion predictions. The eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) during May 2010 were used to evaluate the performance of this approach. The results indicate that the forecasts optimized using data assimilation show marginal improvements in the accuracy of the spatial distribution, mass loading, and cloud top height of the ash cloud at times even outperforming the corresponding satellite retrievals. This method addresses the issue of insufficient model initialization accuracy and continuously optimizes predictions through the ongoing assimilation of satellite observations, thereby enhancing the accuracy of model predictions."

Understanding the emission reduction pathway under SI influence is crucial for achieving long‐term O3 attainment. However, the role of SI in tropospheric O3 pollution in China remains poorly understood. To develop effective O3 control strategies, we employed a localized comprehensive air quality model and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model. We found that SI contributions vary seasonally, peaking in spring at lower latitudes and then delays northward progressively as latitude increases, with peak SI contributions at higher latitudes occur in June. Spatially, SI impacts surface O3 most in high‐latitude regions, decreasing with lower latitudes. As O3‐laden air reaches the surface, O3 control strategies become less effective, necessitating additional emission reductions. As SI contributions increase, the optimal emission reduction pathway shifts: for the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei and Pearl River Delta regions during the spring seasons from 2020 to 2023, it changes from “VOC only” to “NOx only” at thresholds of 13.57 and 8.39 ppb, respectively. For Yangtze River Delta, Fenwei Plain, and Chengyu, the “VOC only” path remains optimal.

However, the stability of levoglucosan in the atmosphere has only been evaluated through laboratory experiments or model simulations. Here, we investigated the atmospheric stability of levoglucosan and its two co‐emitting isomers, mannosan and galactosan, utilizing bihourly measurement data at a suburban site in Hong Kong over a period of 4 months. The concentrations of the three saccharides, upon normalization by BB‐derived potassium, displayed a distinct and consistent depletion during daytime hours from 08:00 to 16:00, which follows an exponential decay pattern. We calculated individual daytime decay rate constants of the three saccharides by utilizing their day‐by‐day decay kinetics.

The estimated lifetime of levoglucosan was 13 ± 7 hr, ranging from 3 to 46 hr under the atmospheric condition of temperature of 22 ± 5°C, and a relative humidity of 55 ± 14%.

Lieb;Ian C. Faloona,Deducing atmospheric conditions that contribute to elevated pollution events in the Salton Sea Air Basin,"•Deep stratospheric intrusions and unregulated soil NOxemissions could be responsible for continued O3exceedances. •Biomass burning, agricultural soil emissions, and wind-blown dust are the main sources of high PM2.5levels in Calexico. •Extreme PM10levels are mostly associated with strong wind events that occur in the spring and autumn. 
 The Salton Sea Air Basin (SSAB) has struggled to comply with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for three federally regulated air pollutants: ozone, PM2.5, and PM10. Seasonal and diurnal patterns are presented along with their long-term decadal trends to better understand the relationship between the meteorological setting and air pollution levels as well as their deviations. This analysis revealed that ozone exceedances are no longer dominated by regulated NOx emissions but rather are primarily controlled by regional agricultural soil emissions. These emissions are also likely influenced by stratospheric ozone transport to the deep convective boundary layers unique to the area. Observed peak ozone levels are still ∼2–5 ppb lower on weekends indicative of a NOx-limited regime during the warm season. This implies that local ozone production is directly dependent on NOx levels, which emphasizes the need to address unregulated sources of NOx pollution such as those from heavily fertilized, arid agricultural soils. Additionally, strong correlations of PM2.5 with NOx, PM10, and CO, indicate that influences from combustion sources as well as agricultural soils, secondary formation, and mechanical processes are all important sources of PM2.5 production in Calexico, the main city of PM2.5 nonattainment on the southern border with Mexico. These PM2.5 exceedances occur in winter months, when low ventilation accumulates localized PM2.5 precursor emissions. Source apportionment of PM2.5 was assessed using non-negative matrix factorization of data from the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) site in Calexico. The CSN data analysis for Calexico identifies biomass burning as the dominant source of high PM2.5 concentrations, followed by agricultural soil emissions and wind-blown dust. In the immediate vicinity of the Salton Sea, less frequent PM2.5 exceedances seem to be associated with occasional windstorms. Further, analysis of PM10 exceedance days indicates that high winds, primarily westerly, are a critical factor, and the low PM2.5/PM10 ratios suggest minimal contribution from photochemical or combustion sources. Furthermore, the correlation of PM10 with wind speed across various sites underscores the importance of dust resuspension and soil erosion. This comprehensive assessment highlights the complexity of air quality problems in the SSAB. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for targeted and localized air quality management strategies for this region which, despite its low population, suffers some of the worst air pollution impacts in the state of California."

 A significant challenge exists in the interconnections among tropical forests, aerosols, and climate resilience, as aerosols profoundly influence weather patterns and air quality. Emissions from forest fires and deforestation increase aerosol concentrations, disrupting cloud formation and precipitation, which undermines the ability of tropical forests to purify air, sequester carbon, and support biodiversity. This review aims to synthesize recent research on aerosol science related to tropical forest ecosystems and their roles in air quality and climate regulation. This review highlights the role of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)—such as isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes—in ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generation in tropical forests. Biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions enhance BVOC oxidation, altering SOA characteristics like particle size and hygroscopicity. Land cover changes, such as converting forests to plantations, also affect BVOC emissions, potentially increasing ozone levels in the upper troposphere. Additionally, the review explores hydrogen sulfide emissions from mangrove forests, emissions of primary biological aerosol particles, and the impacts of soil dust and mineral aerosols from regions including the Amazon and Southeast Asia. The effects of biomass burning in these areas vary by combustion efficiency and fuel types, with implications for cloud dynamics and air quality. Moreover, key transport routes, such as trans-Atlantic movements of African smoke, exacerbate aerosol impacts on soil fertility and air quality. In Southeast Asia, biomass burning increases particulate matter, impacting air quality and regional climate. Finally, policy recommendations and current research gaps are presented to help policymakers and scientists enhance sustainable forest management toward climate resilience in tropical ecosystems amid ongoing environmental changes."

 Satellite remote sensing has become essential for observing precipitable water vapor (PWV). However, limitations in sensor performance, algorithmic assumptions, and estimation methods can result in errors in satellite retrievals of PWV, which limits the accuracy of these products. This study analyzes the bias and post-processing correction of the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) PWV operational products aboard China's polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, Fengyun-3D. Initially, a global quality assessment is conducted using AERONET observations from May 2019 to May 2020. Afterward, variations in the product's bias are analyzed using various influencing factors. Validation results show that the four PWV products of MERSI-II tend to underestimate values to varying degrees. Bias varies based on factors such as solar zenith angle, view zenith angle, solar azimuth angle, view azimuth angle, digital elevation model, and normalized difference vegetation index. Based on the bias analysis, factors are selected, and a post-processing correction is implemented on the PWV products using the Extreme Gradient Boosting model. Post-processing correction results show that the mean bias of the PWV products is nearly zero, with minimal impact from the selected parameters. The correlation coefficient of the three-channel weighted product is 0.975, and 76.0 % of the matchups fall within the expected error envelope of ±(0.03 + 0.1 × PWVAERONET). These research findings assist in minimizing bias and enhancing the quality of MERSI-II PWV products."

Sheese,Age of air from ACE-FTS measurements  of sulfur hexafluoride,"We present a 17-year stratospheric age-of-air dataset derived from ACE-FTS satellite measurements of sulfur hexafluoride. This is the longest continuous, global, and vertically resolved age of air time series available to date. In this paper, we show that this dataset agrees well with age-of-air datasets based on measurements from other instruments. We also present trends in the midlatitude lower stratosphere that indicate changes in the global circulation that are predicted by climate models. 
 Climate models predict that the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) will accelerate due to tropospheric warming, leading to a redistribution of trace gases and, consequently, to a change of the radiative properties of the atmosphere. Changes in the BDC are diagnosed by the so-called “age of air”, that is, the time since air in the stratosphere exited the troposphere. These changes can be derived from a long-term observation-based record of long-lived trace gases with increasing concentration in the troposphere, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) provides the longest available continuous time series of vertically resolved SF6 measurements, spanning 2004 to the present. In this study, a new age-of-air product is derived from the ACE-FTS SF6 dataset. The ACE-FTS product is in good agreement with other observation-based age-of-air datasets and shows the expected global distribution of age-of-air values. Age of air from a chemistry–climate model is evaluated, and the linear trend of the observation-based age of air is calculated in 12 regions within the lower stratospheric midlatitudes (14–20 km, 40–70°) in each hemisphere. In 8 of 12 regions, there was not a statistically significant trend. The trends in the other regions, specifically 50–60 and 60–70° S at 17–20 km and 40–50° N at 14–17 and 17–20 km, are negative and significant to 2 standard deviations. This is therefore the first observation-based age-of-air trend study to suggest an acceleration of the shallow branch of the BDC, which transports air poleward in the lower stratosphere, in regions within both hemispheres."

 This study evaluates the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) in forecasting a mega Asian dust storm (ADS) event that occurred over South Korea on 28–29 March 2021. We specifically evaluated a combination of five dust emission schemes and four land surface schemes, which are crucial for predicting ADSs. Using both in situ and remote sensing data, we assessed surface meteorological and air quality variables, including 2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity, 10 m wind speed, particulate matter with a diameter of 10µm or less (PM10), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over South Korea. Our results indicate that prediction of surface meteorological variables is more influenced by the land surface scheme than by the dust emission scheme – generally showing good performance when dust emission schemes are combined with the Noah land surface model with multiple parameterization options (Noah-MP). In contrast, prediction of air quality variables, including PM10 and AOD, is strongly affected by the dust emission schemes, which are directly related to the generation and amount of dust through interaction with surface properties. Among the total of 20 available scheme combinations, the University of Cologne 2004 scheme combined with the Community Land Model version 4.0 (UoC04-CLM4) showed the best performance, closely followed by the University of Cologne 2001 scheme combined with CLM4 (UoC01-CLM4). UoC04-CLM4 outperformed the other scheme combinations by reducing the root mean square errors of PM10 up to 29.6 %. However, both UoC04-CLM4 and UoC01-CLM4 simulated values closest to the MODIS AOD but tended to overestimate the AOD in some regions during the dust emission and transport processes. In contrast, other scheme combinations significantly underestimated the AOD throughout the entire simulation process of ADSs."

These findings suggest significant anthropogenic contributions (MTANT), challenging the traditional view that MT emissions are predominantly natural (MTNAT) in current inventories. This oversight likely results in a substantial underestimation of MT’s role in urban ozone (O3) production. Therefore, we developed a novel approach to generate a gridded emission inventory (EI) of MTANT, integrating flux measurements of MT and carbon monoxide (CO). Results show that MTANT emission rate in Beijing core areas exceeds MTNAT by a factor of 1.83, with household volatile chemical products (VCPs) contributing 56% of total MTANT emissions. Incorporating MTANT emissions into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model significantly improved the simulation of diurnal MT variations (correlation coefficient, r = 0.985) and reduced the normalized mean bias (NMB) in surface MT concentration predictions by 53%. Notably, the combined effects of anthropogenic and biogenic MT emissions increased summertime maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 levels by 12.8 ppb in Beijing core areas, with MT from household VCPs (MTVCP) accounting for 62% of the MTANT-driven O3 increase. This study provides a robust quantitative foundation for assessing the impact of anthropogenic MT emissions on urban air quality and highlights the urgent need for targeted regulatory measures to mitigate their growing contribution to O3 pollution."

 Atmospheric aerosol is an essential component of the atmosphere, with a significant radiative forcing impact. Aerosol influences the processes of radiation transmission, energy cycle, climate change and Earth-atmosphere interaction, and it is inextricably linked to environmental protection and human health. As coarse mode dominant absorptive particles, dust aerosol has a complex effect on climate (cooling in shortwave and warming in longwave) and is easy to cause human respiratory diseases. In this study, the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm, which supports simultaneous retrieval of multiple aerosol optical and microphysical parameters with measurements from different sources and levels, is applied to the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) measurements on board the Chinese Gaofen-5 (02) satellite. The optical and microphysical properties of aerosols in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from April to June in 2023 are obtained, and a dust event is tracked. The results show that DPC/GRASP method is capable to retrieve aerosol optical and microphysical properties in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and is highly correlated with AERONET, and can be used to identify the evolution process of dust weather. It provides a new method and process scheme for the efficient and accurate acquisition of aerosol optical and microphysical properties in large areas by integrating various aerosol observation platform data in the future, and provides a new reference for the study of the evolution of dust weather and the diffusion of dust aerosol."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121206,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文探讨了在中国未来气候和植被变化背景下，生物源排放对地表臭氧的影响。论文利用生物排放和地球化学模型，评估了不同区域（如京津冀、山东等地）在2030年和2060年气候情景下，植被变化对臭氧污染的影响。研究发现，气候变暖会增强生物源排放对地表臭氧的贡献，尤其是在氮肥使用量较高的华北地区，生物氮氧化物的作用更为显著。虽然生物挥发性有机物（BVOCs）的增加会提高RO2自由基的浓度，但其对臭氧的影响取决于氮氧化物（NOx）的水平。在高NOx地区，BVOCs通过RO2+NO反应促进臭氧生成；而在NOx稀缺地区，RO2+HO2反应占主导，通过竞争效应减少臭氧。这项研究强调了生物源排放在中国未来臭氧污染中的关键作用，与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['surface ozone', 'biogenic emissions', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'climate change', 'vegetation changes', 'ozone source apportionment']",Wenpeng Wang;Ying Wang;Xiangyue Chen;Xiaodong Zhang;Tan Xu;Yuan Zhao;Lei Ma;Bolong Chen;Hongchao Zuo,The future underlying differential response of surface ozone to biogenic emissions in China (2019–2060),"•China's surface ozone were predicted based on future climate and vegetation changes. •Climate warming enhances the contribution of biogenic emissions to surface ozone. •Future surface ozone in North China is increase due to higher fertilizer application. •Surface ozone declines with BVOCs enhancement in urban areas as P(H2O2)/P(HNO3) >9. 
 China's major megacity clusters experience severe summer ozone pollution, posing significant public health risks. In the context of declining anthropogenic emissions and increasing biogenic emissions driven by climate warming, understanding future surface ozone trends and their response to biogenic emissions is critical. This study integrates advanced biogenic emission and geochemical models to assess the impact of vegetation changes on ozone pollution in key regions—Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ), Shandong (SDC), Chengdu-Chongqing (CCC), Fenwei Plain (FWP), Mid-Yangtze (MYC), Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHM), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD)—under 2030 and 2060 climate scenarios. Results demonstrate intensified ozone pollution by 2030 in GHM, MYC, FWP, and SDC, and by 2060 in JJJ, FWP, and GHM. The Random Forest model attributes ∼76.0 % of future ozone changes to biogenic emissions. Ozone source apportionment (OSAT) and brute force (BF) methods reveal increasing biogenic contributions to ozone formation in most scenarios. Mechanistic analysis shows biological nitrogen oxides (BNOx) play a larger role than biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), especially in northern China with high nitrogen fertilizer use. While rising BVOCs increase RO2 radicals, their ozone impact depends on NOx levels: in NOx-rich regions, BVOCs promote ozone via RO2+NO reactions; in NOx-scarce regions, RO2+HO2 reactions dominate, reducing ozone through competitive effects. This effect is observed in megacity clusters when P(H2O2)/P(HNO3) exceeds 9. Overall, this study highlights the pivotal role of biogenic emissions in shaping China's future ozone pollution under climate and vegetation changes."

 Atmospheric hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important oxidant in the troposphere that impacts atmospheric oxidation capacity and plays key roles in S(IV) oxidation. In the past decade, researchers have proposed new H2O2 formation mechanisms as well as its significant environmental effects, based on field measurements, laboratory experiments, and modeling. However, these unconventional chemical processes related to atmospheric H2O2 have not been systematically reviewed, previous reviews on atmospheric H2O2 were published in the early 2000s. Herein, we review the recent atmospheric H2O2 studies throughout the world, mainly focusing on the observations, sources, and environmental effects of atmospheric H2O2. First, we summarize the temporal and vertical distributions of atmospheric H2O2 across urban, rural, mountainous, forested, and oceanic regions, as well as the upper atmosphere. Next, we discuss recent advancements in understanding potential sources of atmospheric H2O2 and its multiphase formation mechanisms. Finally, the increasing environmental effects of atmospheric H2O2, including its role in diagnosis of O3-NOx-VOCs sensitivity and significance in sulfate formation, are outlined.

 The Global Dimming and Brightening (GDB) phenomenon plays an important role in the Earth's climate, with clouds and aerosols being the major drivers. This study investigates GDB causes by quantifying the contributions of changes in clouds, aerosols, water vapor and ozone to the surface solar radiation (SSR) changes during 1984–2018. To this aim, radiative transfer calculations were performed by the FORTH-RTM (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas Radiative Transfer Model) on a monthly basis and 0.5°x0.625° spatial resolution using modern and improved datasets for clouds and aerosols. Validation against high-quality ground measurements confirmed RTM's reliability. Results show a global mean brightening of 0.88 Wm−2decade−1 from 1984 to 2018, stronger over land (2.57 Wm−2decade−1) than oceans (0.19 Wm−2decade−1). Globally, changes in clouds (especially middle-level cloud amount (CA) and high-level cloud optical thickness (COT)) were the main GDB drivers. However, the contribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) changes was remarkable over specific land areas with strong anthropogenic activity, such as Europe, India and East China. In the 80's and 90's changes in AOD were the main GDB driver, subsequently in the 2000s high-level cloud optical thickness contributed the most to GDB followed by the AOD changes, while finally in the 2010s both clouds and AOD had comparable contributions. Over land, AOD had a comparable contribution to GDB with that of clouds whereas the contribution of aerosols' asymmetry parameter (AP) and single scattering albedo (SSA), water vapor and ozone was quite small or insignificant."

However, the response relationship between air quality and public attention is unclear.

Employing seasonal time series analysis, spatial analysis, spatial lag models, we examined the spatiotemporal response and driving factors of air quality and PAAQ index in Shandong province, China from 2014 to 2021. Our study focused on keywords analysis and spatiotemporal dimensions to uncover regional disparities in public response and concerns regarding air pollution. The results indicate that: (1) Consistent improvements in air quality have led to a decline in public concern, particularly since 2020. Monthly variations in PAAQ, AQI, PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and NO2 exhibit a U-shaped pattern, with lower levels in summer and higher levels in winter, while O3 exhibits an inverse trend. (2) Air pollution in Shandong province demonstrates spatial clustering, with high pollution concentrations in the central, northwestern, and southern regions, whereas the Shandong Peninsula exhibits relatively better air quality. (3) Industrial cities in central and southern Shandong province experience high PAAQ levels due to severe winter pollution. PAAQ is more pronounced and forward-looking in developed areas, decreasing rapidly as air quality improves. (4) The proportion of the secondary industry, the urban population proportion, the number of Internet users per capita, and the AQI positively amplify PAAQ. The PAAQ index serves as a quantitative tool to gauge public feedback on air quality management, aiding governments in identifying key areas for intervention, optimizing spatiotemporal pollution control strategies, and promoting regional collaborative governance."

As seasons progress, local contributions within each region to its NOy budget decreased from 32 %–43 % to 23 %–30 %, while transboundary contributions increased from 16 %–33 % to 27 %–37 %, driven by a shift in synoptic settings that allowed pollutants to spread more broadly across the regions. 
 We investigated source contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions to reactive nitrogen species (NOy) loadings across East Asia during the 2022 winter–spring transition. Using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and its Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM), we conducted air quality simulations, leveraging top-down estimates of NOx emissions adjusted by the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns. After the Bayesian inversion, the inventoried NOx emissions increased by 50 % in South Korea and 33 % in China compared to the a priori estimates, which substantially reduced the model's prior underestimation of surface NO2 concentrations from −32.75 % to −13.01 % in South Korea and from −10.26 % to −3.04 % in China. We compared local and transboundary contributions of NOx emissions to NOy concentrations across East Asia. Local contributions showed a declining trend, from 32 %–43 % in January to 23 %–30 % by May, while transboundary contributions consistently increased from 16 %–33 % in January to 27 %–37 % by May. North China consistently contributed over 10 % to East Asia's NOy loadings. East China and South Central China were significant contributors to each other's NOy budget by 9 %–12 %. South Central China transboundary contributions consistently outweighed local contributions by 5 %, indicating vulnerability to pollution transport. South Korea, initially the least influential, contributed 1 %–4 % to transboundary NOy concentrations in January. This increased to 6 %–7 % by May, becoming comparable to other regions' contributions. These behaviors of NOy were driven by distinct synoptic settings, where strong wintertime northwesterly winds directed pollutants southeastward, while their weakening in spring led to more multidirectional transport patterns, allowing pollutants to spread more broadly across the regions."

The dataset avoids a sharp drop in zero-value frequency after 2019 as caused by the instrument upgrade but is also more continuous for various periods. This dataset is crucial for accurately assessing dimming and brightening and for supporting other applications. 
 Inhomogeneities in the sunshine duration (SSD) observational series, caused by non-climatic factors like China's widespread transition from manual to automatic SSD recorders in 2019 or station relocations, have hindered the accurate estimation of near-surface solar radiation. These issues significantly affect the analysis of global dimming and brightening, as well as related applications, such as solar energy planning and agriculture management. This study compiled raw SSD observational data from 1961 to 2022 from more than 2200 stations in China and clearly found that the improved precision from 0.1 h to 1 min following the instrument update in 2019 led to a sudden reduction in the frequency of zero SSD from 2019 onward, referred to as the day0-type discontinuity. For the first time, we systematically corrected this known day0-type discontinuity at 378 stations (17 %) in China, resulting in an SSD series with comparable frequencies of zero value before and after 2019. On this basis, we constructed a homogenization procedure to detect and adjust discontinuities in both the variance and mean of the daily SSD from 1961 to 2022. Results show that a total of 1363 (60 %) stations experienced breakpoints in SSD, of which ∼65 % were confirmed to be associated with station relocations and instrument replacements. Compared to the raw SSD, the homogenized SSD is more continuous to the naked eye for various periods and presents weakened dimming (p<0.05) across China from 1961 to 1990 but a non-significant positive trend with a reduction of 60 % in the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the homogenized SSD tends to better capture the dimming phenomenon. Northern regions continue dimming from 1991 to 2022, but southern regions of China brighten slightly. The implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control since 2013 has contributed to a reversal of SSD trends thereafter, which is better reflected in the homogenized SSD, with a trend shift from −0.02 to 0.07 h d−1 per decade from 2013 to 2022 in China, especially in heavily polluted regions. Besides this, the relationships of cloud cover fraction and aerosol optical depth with SSD are intensified in the homogenized dataset. These results highlight the importance of the homogenized SSD in accurately understanding the dimming and brightening phenomena. The homogenized SSD dataset is publicly available for community use at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301478 (He et al., 2024)."

Top-down (TD) methods measure methane emissions from all sources across an entire site and often use BU estimates to attribute emissions specifically to natural gas, often through ethane-to-methane ratio analysis. However, traditional BU methods do not adequately account for variations in throughput and failure conditions, which can significantly impact gas composition and emission rates. The Mechanistic Air Emissions Simulator (MAES) is a computer model developed to estimate methane and other hydrocarbon emissions from oil and gas facilities. MAES employs two distinct modeling approaches: mechanistic models and traditional methods. MAES uses mechanistic models to estimate emissions based on fluid flow through equipment and equipment states, offering a detailed, process-oriented emissions representation. In contrast, the traditional methods utilized by MAES estimate emissions by applying activity data multiplied by emission factor distributions, offering a statistical approach grounded in empirical data. This study applies MAES to assess emission impacts on three vintages of production wellpads in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin: a wellpad with two stages of separation (“old” facility), one with three stages of separation (“current” facility), and a tankless wellpad (“future” facility). The study found that increased throughput led to higher methane emissions in older wellpads but not in tankless future facilities. Additionally, MAES also showed that failure conditions, like stuck dump valves, increased emission rates and affected the ethane-to-methane ratio, which could vary by 2.15 times depending on facility configuration. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating variability in facility operations into emissions estimates to improve accuracy and guide effective mitigation strategies."

The average global oceanic nitrogen deposition is 40.7 Tg N yr−1, with 78% deposited in the open ocean. Reduced nitrogen (NHx) and oxidized nitrogen (NOy) contribute equally predominantly through wet deposition (62%). Of the total nitrogen deposition to oceans, 39% originates from natural emissions, 33% from fuel combustion including shipping and aviation (11%), and 22% from agricultural activities. Transportation and agriculture are the major contributors in the Northern Hemispheric mid‐high latitude and Coastal biomes, whereas natural emissions are dominant in Trades and Southern Hemispheric biomes. Both wet and dry NOy deposition decreases in the Northern Hemisphere mid‐high latitudes but increases in tropical biomes, whereas NHx shows opposing changes in wet and dry deposition. Anthropogenic emissions drive over 60% of IAVs of oceanic nitrogen deposition except for the NHx deposition over tropical biomes. Changes in anthropogenic emissions from combustion sources not only influence NOy deposition through nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from fuel combustions but also lead to opposing trends in wet and dry NHx deposition due to nonlinear chemistry of secondary inorganic aerosol formations. These findings highlight the need for integrated management strategies targeting multiple pollutants, including NOx, ammonia (NH3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) along with international regulations on shipping and aviation to effectively control nitrogen deposition over the ocean."

Elemental carbon consists of char‐EC and soot‐EC, which differ in mass absorption efficiency (MAE). However, the MAEs of these forms remain underexplored primarily due to the limited methods available for measurement, limiting the accuracy of EC climate impact assessments and leading distortions of EC radiative effect in the temporal and spatial distribution. In this study, we derived MAEs for char‐EC and soot‐EC using combined modeling methods based on observational data, revealing key differences. Soot‐EC generally has higher MAEs than char‐EC, except from biomass burning. Meteorological factors, such as relative humidity, also influence the MAEs of char‐EC and soot‐EC differently. The differences in sources and aging process lead to changes in the mass concentration and MAE of char‐EC and soot‐EC over time. Ignoring these differences can lead to discrepancies in the radiative effect from −9.1% to 18.7%. This study underscores the importance of considering the char‐EC and soot‐EC in accurate EC radiative effect estimates, and implies that optimizing the management of different black carbon emission sources would mitigate global warming to varying extents due to the divergence of the char/soot emission ratio and their MAE."

Mean growth rates of CO2, CH4, and δ13C‐CO2 at LLN, DSI, and Mauna Loa (MLO) were found similar over the monitoring period until March 2019, whereas δ18O‐CO2 showed unclear trend. Seasonal patterns at LLN and DSI reflect distinct influences from different regions. At LLN, daytime photosynthesis reduced CO2, whereas CH4 rose in the afternoon caused by the influences associated with upslope valley breezes. We also observed an enlarging diurnal amplitude of CH4 with a significant large growth rate of 9.2 ppb yr−1 in the afternoon, which was plausibly owing to the intensified upslope winds at LLN. Based on the measurements associated with backward trajectories during nighttime, Southeast Asian biomass burning enhanced 1.5 ppm (+0.4%) of CO2 and 15.4 ppb (+0.8%) of CH4 at LLN in spring. Concentration weighted trajectory identifies potential source areas along the westerlies passing through southern China and Thailand, with reduced contributions from southern Southeast Asia as a result of mixing with the air in the South China Sea."

The associated decrease in human activities and therefore emissions provided a unique opportunity for a real world laboratory for atmospheric scientists. The impact on primary emissions, that is, NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$, has been vastly studied but its consequences on secondary pollutants, O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ and secondary organic aerosol, have been reported to a lesser degree and the understanding is more limited. One reason is the chronic imbalance in the attention dedicated to volatile organic compounds. In the present study, we report on the evolution of volatile organic compounds under lockdown conditions in Europe by analyzing the concentrations relayed to the Airbase service of the European Environmental Agency. Subsetting was performed to account for human activity and the influence of meteorology. Traffic or urban stations exhibited the most important reduction in benzene and, more substantially, toluene concentrations. Xylenes, trimethylbenzenes, and ethylbenzene also decreased under lockdown conditions, though less when the synoptic conditions were associated with slow flows. Acyclic alkenes evidenced no change or increased slightly, whereas n‐alkanes increased. The evolution of the relative importance of the sources was investigated by means of diagnostic ratios (toluene to benzene and benzene to toluene to ethylbenzene) and exhibited a shift from traffic toward biomass/biofuel/coal burning, indicating a possible increase in the domestic use of solvents."

 Satellite-based data can provide continuous aerosol observations but suffer from significant uncertainties across various regions. Transfer learning improves model generalization, yet its application in atmospheric research remains limited. Here, we introduce an innovative framework for retrieving global aerosol optical depth (AOD) which named the Aerosol domain-Adaptive Network (AAdaN). The framework utilizes a neural network to estimate mutual information, and aligns spatial covariate shift via a transfer loss term. Then, we assess the retrieval potential in unknown scenarios using independent land cover type, and the proposed model demonstrates satisfactory results. The cross-validation shows strong agreement with in-situ measurements, both in sample-based and site-based evaluations. Specifically, the site-based ten-fold cross-validation of our AOD retrievals indicate that all accuracy metrics are satisfactory, with a Pearson correlation of 0.766 and a Root-Mean-Square Error of 0.118, and that about 76.05 % of the retrievals meet the expected error criteria [±(0.05 + 20 %)]. Additionally, the proposed AAdaN achieves stable, high-accuracy aerosol retrievals across various surface and atmospheric conditions, and can generate spatially continuous AOD distributions.

 Ozone (O3) pollution is a pervasive air quality issue, with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly contributing to O3 formation. Utilizing continuous online monitoring data from a chemical park in Shenyang in 2019, we analyzed variations in VOCs, conventional pollutants, and meteorological conditions, preliminarily determining their apparent effects on O3. Results indicated an “M”-shaped monthly average ozone variation, with peaks in summer and troughs in winter, influenced by photochemical reactions and meteorological factors. The daily mean concentrations of alkanes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons in VOCs displayed clear periodicity, with peaks occurring at 5:00–7:00 and 19:00–20:00, and troughs at 14:00–15:00. The monthly mean concentrations exhibited seasonal trends, with higher levels in fall and winter, and lower levels in spring and summer, demonstrating a pattern opposite to that of O3. Using machine learning techniques, we modeled the relationship between key factors and O3 concentration. The results revealed that the optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the highest correlation coefficient and demonstrated the best performance. Using the feature importance method, we identified the key factors most strongly associated with O3 concentration. The optimized model was then employed to examine the variation in O3 concentration across different temperature and humidity conditions.

 The Sichuan Basin (SCB), located in Southwest China, often has serious ozone (O3) pollution due to its special topography, complex meteorological conditions and emissions. The frequent occurrence of extreme high temperature has recently aggravated the biogenic O3 precursors emission and the O3 pollution in the SCB. To quantify the O3 pollution caused by high temperature, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used to study the formation mechanism and transport process of the O3 pollution event in the SCB in July 2022, after updating emission information with TROPOMI satellite data and MEGAN model initial data. The results show that during the pollution period, the SCB was affected by the alternating effects of the circulation changes caused by the eastward movement of the northern continental high pressure and the westward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high pressure. The continuous control of the high pressure formed extremely high temperature, which led to the accelerated generation of O3 in the SCB. The southeastern continental high pressure and the northwestern subtropical high pressure converged in the SCB, forming a “zigzag”-shaped circulation, which prevented O3 from being transported out of the SCB. The results of integrated process rate analysis (IPR) show that the negative contribution of horizontal advection accelerates the O3 output from the cities in the middle of the SCB to the surrounding cities, resulting in the rapid spread of pollution over the SCB, the O3 accumulation in the high altitude of the basin, and the positive contribution of chemical generation in the south of the SCB."

Our findings reveal unique oxidation pathways for different monoterpenes, leading to either chain-terminating products or highly reactive intermediates that can contribute to particle formation in the atmosphere. This research highlights APRs as potentially significant but underexplored atmospheric oxidants that may influence future approaches to modelling climate. 
 Monoterpenes are released into the atmosphere in significant quantities, where they undergo various oxidation reactions. Despite extensive studies in this area, there are still gaps that need to be addressed to fully understand the oxidation processes occurring in the atmosphere. Recent findings suggest that reactions between alkenes and acyl peroxy radicals (APRs) can be competitive under atmospheric conditions. In this study, we investigate the oxidation reactions of seven monoterpenes with the CH3C(O)OO⋅ radical and subsequent diverse reactions, including accretion, alkyl radical rearrangements, H-shift, and β-scission reactions. The accretion reaction leads to the release of excess energy, which is sufficient to open small secondary rings in the alkyl radical structures. This reaction is most significant for sabinene (31 %) and α-thujene (18 %). A competing reaction is O2 addition, which the majority of alkyl radicals undergo, subsequently leading to the formation of peroxy radicals. These then react further, forming alkoxy radicals that can subsequently undergo β-scission reactions. Our calculations show that for β-pinene, camphene, and sabinene, β-scission rearrangements result in radicals capable of undergoing further propagation of the oxidative chain, while for limonene, α-pinene, and α-thujene, scissions leading to closed-shell products that terminate the oxidative chain are preferred. The results indicate that if reactions of monoterpenes with APRs are indeed competitive under atmospheric conditions, their oxidation would lead to more oxygenated compounds with a higher molar mass, potentially contributing to secondary organic aerosol yields. Moreover, this study highlights the significance of stereochemistry in controlling the oxidation of monoterpenes initiated by APRs."

Bowman,Predictions of failed satellite retrieval of air quality  using machine learning,"The large fleet of Earth observation satellites in orbit currently generate huge volumes of data, requiring significant computational resources to process these data in a timely manner. We present a method for predicting poor-quality measurements using machine learning. We find that machine learning methods can accurately predict poor-quality measurements and remove them from the processing chain, saving time and computational resources. 
 The growing fleet of Earth observation (EO) satellites is capturing unprecedented quantities of information about the concentration and distribution of trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Depending on the instrument and algorithm, the yield of good remote soundings can be a few percent owing to interferences such as clouds, non-linearities in the retrieval algorithm, and systematic errors in the radiative transfer algorithm, leading to inefficient use of computational resources. In this study, we investigate machine learning (ML) techniques to predict failures in the trace gas retrieval process based upon the input satellite radiances alone, allowing for efficient production of good-quality data. We apply this technique to ozone and other retrievals using measurements from multiple satellites: the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (Suomi NPP CrIS) and joint retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Retrievals are performed using the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, Multi-SEnsors (MUSES) algorithm. With this tool, we can identify 80 % of ozone retrieval failures using the MUSES algorithm at a cost of 20 % false positives from CrIS. For AIRS-OMI, 98 % of ozone retrieval failures are identified at a cost of 2 % false positives. The ML tool is simple to generate and takes <0.1 s to assess each measured spectrum. The results suggest that this tool can be applied to data from many EO satellites and can reduce the processing load for current and future instruments."

VISIT-SIF helps to improve photosynthetic processes through a combination of biogeochemical modeling and observed SIF. 
 Satellite retrievals of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can provide opportunities to improve our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and the carbon cycle at the global scale. Here, we present a new biogeochemical process-based carbon and nitrogen cycle model for representing SIF retrievals (VISIT-SIF version 1.0: Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases and SIF) acquired by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) with an hourly time step and a spatial resolution of approximately 0.31 × 0.31°. The implementation of radiation transfer models (RTMs) helps to address the interaction of chlorophyll fluorescence with vegetation and atmosphere. However, the computation of RTMs becomes more time-consuming, which can make it impractical in applications of satellite observations with larger data volumes. This study resolves this issue by parameterizing the radiative transfer processes and the geometric relationships. This approach enables the ease of implementation of VISIT-SIF for simulating satellite SIF retrievals even for the satellites having off-nadir observation angles. With an initial 7 years of data (2009–2015), our model simulations showed a consistent global mean value of 0.51 ± 0.39, with GOSAT SIF retrievals of 0.46 ± 0.42 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1; the root mean squared error was 0.29 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1. We also found that the mean seasonal variability in the simulated SIFs was mostly consistent with the GOSAT SIF retrievals at the subcontinental scale. However, the simulated results indicated less sensitivity to water stress in the late dry season in arid and semiarid regions relative to that of the GOSAT SIF retrievals, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies using multiple biogeochemical process-based models. This comparison suggested that there is a critical need to improve our knowledge of SIF variability and biophysical processes in such regions."

However, the connection between optical properties and toxicity of combustion particles remains a matter of little concern. In this study, combustion particles were collected from 11 primary sources, including biomass burning, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust. The extractable organic matter (EOM) in bituminous coal combustion particles shows the highest light-absorption, fluorescence properties, and toxicity among samples. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis combined excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy resolved 4 types of basic chromophore components in EOM. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analysis further resolved ∼800 molecules, predominantly aromatics (84% ± 4.6%), which showed positive correlations with the light-absorption, fluorescence properties and toxicity of EOM (p < 0.05). Aromatics are inferred to be the intrinsic link between the optical properties and toxicity of EOM in combustion particles. Additionally, the benzene poly(carboxylic acid)s (BPCAs) method, which could identify and quantify fused benzene rings in EOM, further indicates the high condensation degree of aromatics is closely correlated with the light-absorption, fluorescence properties of EOM.

 Frequent multispectral observations of sufficient spatial detail from well-calibrated spaceborne sensors are needed for large-scale terrestrial monitoring. To meet this demand, the NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project was initiated in early 2010s to produce comparable 30-m surface reflectance from the US Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the European Copernicus Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and currently from two OLI and two MSI sensors, by applying atmospheric correction to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, masking out clouds and cloud shadows, normalizing bi-directional reflectance view angle effects, adjusting for sensor bandpass differences with the OLI as the reference, and providing the harmonized data in a common grid. Several versions of HLS dataset have been produced in the last few years. The recent improvements on almost all the harmonization algorithms had prompted a production of a new HLS dataset, tagged Version 2.0, which was completed in the summer of 2023 and for the first time takes on a global coverage (except for Antarctica). The HLS V2.0 data record starts in April 2013, two months after Landsat 8 launch. For 2022, the first whole year two Landsat and two Sentinel-2 satellites were available, HLS provides a global median of 66 cloud-free observations over land, substantially more than from a single sensor. This paper describes the HLS algorithm improvements and assesses the harmonization efficacy by examining how the reflectance difference between contemporaneous Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations was successively reduced by each harmonization step. The assessment was conducted on 545 pairs of globally distributed same-day Landsat/Sentinel-2 images from 2021 to 2022. Compared to the TOA data, the HLS atmospheric correction slightly increased the reflectance relative difference between Landsat and Sentinel-2 for most of the spectral bands, especially for the two blue bands and the green bands. The subsequent bi-directional reflectance view angle effect normalization effectively reduced the between-sensor reflectance difference present in the atmospherically corrected data for all the spectral bands, and notably to a level below the TOA differences for the red, near-infrared (NIR), and the two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The bandpass adjustment only had a modest effect on reducing the between-sensor reflectance difference. In the final HLS products, the same-day reflectance difference between Landsat and Sentinel-2 was below 4.2% for the red, NIR, and the two SWIR bands, all smaller than the difference in the TOA data. However, the between-sensor differences for the two blue and the green bands remain slightly higher than in TOA data, and this reflects the difficulty in accurately correcting for atmospheric effects in the shorter wavelength visible bands. The data consistency evaluation on a suite of commonly used vegetation indices (VI) calculated from the HLS V2.0 reflectance data showed that the between-sensor VI difference is below 4.5% for most of the indices. These results suggest that the harmonization is robust and the HLS V2.0 data are adequate for quantitative terrestrial applications."

 We characterized optical properties (absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients, Ångström exponents, single scattering albedo) of aerosols during dust events at an urban site in El Paso, Texas using in-situ, real-time measurements. Simultaneous measurements of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5) and wind data from an adjacent Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Continuous Ambient Monitoring Station are used in this study. Data from both sites was obtained at 5-min resolution. Twenty-seven dust events (15 synoptic, 12 mesoscale) occurred during 24 days from April–June 2021. HYSPLIT and STILT back-trajectories indicated many dust events (∼46 %) originated from the west-southwest (favoring transport across dust source areas in the Chihuahuan Desert). Mean absorption Ångström exponent values of El Paso dust (1.19 and 1.15 for synoptic and mesoscale events) were lower than published values for “pure” dust at other locations (generally accepted as greater than 2). Single scattering albedo values averaged 0.94 during synoptic and mesoscale dust events, confirming the scattering nature of mineral dust in the region. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations averaged 191 and 41 μg/m3 during dust event periods versus 28 and 8.7 μg/m3 during non-event (background) periods. Absorption / scattering Ångström exponent ratios of dust event aerosols were representative of large particles-black carbon mixture rather than a “pure” dust, suggesting mixing with urban aerosols, while many observations during non-event periods fall into the large particles-black carbon mixture and large particles-low absorption categories, suggesting that dust is a constant key component of the aerosols in El Paso. The 5-min time resolution revealed the evolution of complex aerosol events (e.g., brown carbon followed by dust, multiple dust events within one day, fireworks, advection of low-absorption gypsum dust from White Sands. New Mexico), emphasizing the importance of detecting and quantifying high intensity, short-duration events “lost” in 24-h or hourly air quality data."

 Aerosols have a profound impact on the hydrological cycle, energy equilibrium, and ecological stability of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP) region. Reanalysis datasets provide comprehensive aerosol information for this area regardless of weather conditions, yet their accuracy and applicability remain to be verified. The aerosol types, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and three-dimensional spatial distribution of dust aerosol from MERRA-2 (Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) and CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) aerosol reanalysis dataset are compared with the data from the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) spaceborne lidar during the period spanning 2007 to 2011 across the TP. Both MERRA-2 and CAMS can accurately characterize the predominant aerosol type in the TP as dust. MERRA-2 demonstrated a superior capability in capturing individual aerosol occurrence event. Concerning dust AOD (DAOD), the correlation coefficient between monthly averaged DAOD of MERRA-2 (CAMS) and CALIPSO is 0.78 (0.90), with absolute deviations of 0.06 (0.05). Both MERRA-2 and CAMS can follow the annual variability with the peaks in spring and the troughs in winter. Spatially, MERRA-2 overestimated DAOD by 0.26 in the northwestern TP and the southern Indo-Gangetic Plain, while underestimated by −0.05 in the remaining regions. On the other hand, CAMS overestimated DAOD by 0.17 in the Taklimakan Desert, the Qaidam Basin in the northern TP, and the Thar Desert in southwestern TP, but underestimated by −0.10 elsewhere across the TP. Vertically, the annual averaged dust extinction coefficient decreased with increasing altitude among the CALIPSO, MERRA-2 and CAMS datasets. The dust extinction coefficient displayed a seasonal variation with higher values in spring and summer and lower values in autumn and winter. Compared with CALIPSO data, both MERRA-2 and CAMS tend to underestimate dust mass concentration near the surface layer, with CAMS exhibiting more pronounced underestimation, particularly in spring and summer. In the context of the dust emission over the TP, MERRA-2 demonstrates superior performance compared to CAMS in the Taklimakan and the Thar Desert, while CAMS exhibits a greater efficacy than MERRA-2 in anthropogenic aerosol emission sources such as the Indus Gangetic Plain. Furthermore, regarding atmospheric circulation and aerosol transport, the vertical distribution of dust in MERRA-2 aligns more closely with actual observations obtained from CALIPSO."

One purpose was to compare measurement techniques. We focus on the major greenhouse gases. To measure these, air was sampled with the AirCore technique and with flask sampling, and samples were analysed after the flight. In flight, observations were done with an optical method. In a companion paper, we report on observations of chlorine and bromine containing trace gases. 
 Within the HEMERA balloon infrastructure project, a stratospheric balloon carrying a multi-instrument payload to a maximum altitude of 31.2 km was  launched on 12 August 2021. On board the openly constructed gondola, several types of instruments were used for simultaneous air sampling and in-flight measurements to characterize climate-relevant trace gases in the stratosphere and troposphere, as well as to compare and evaluate different instrumental approaches and sampling techniques. For observations of the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), flask with AirCore sampling and in-flight spectrometry were deployed. Overall, results from different methods agree well. While better precision was achieved for the post-flight measurements of AirCore devices and flask sampling, in situ spectrometry provided a higher degree of detail on the vertical structure of the CH4 profile. Age of air was derived from mixing ratios of CO2 and SF6. As seen in previous studies, higher values were obtained from SF6 than from CO2. Correcting for chemical losses,  maximum values of 4.4–5.1 years were derived from SF6 mixing ratios at altitudes above 20 km compared to 4.2–5.0 years from  CO2 mixing ratios. The resulting dataset should be well suited for multi-tracer approaches to derive age of air, particularly in combination with a large suite of halocarbons measured from flask and AirCore sampling and one more AirCore sample which was reported in a companion publication (Laube et al., 2025)."

These aerosols then interact with stratocumulus clouds over the Southeast Atlantic, which is difficult for climate models to account for. Our instrument, 4STAR, determines aerosol radiative properties. A dataset was already created for 2016, but additional quality control was required to address instrument issues for 2017 and 2018. 
 The NASA ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) airborne field campaigns deployed a 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research) instrument onboard a P-3 aircraft to measure columnar optical properties of biomass burning aerosol smoke plumes over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean from 2016 to 2018. Although 4STAR’s retrievals of aerosol optical properties from direct solar irradiances and diffuse sky radiances were performed, analyzed, and compared against other field campaigns via Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) campaign medians by Pistone et al., 2019 for ORACLES 2016, such an analysis was not extended to 2017 and 2018 due to previously unquantified instrument performance issues. As a result, only the 4STAR 2016 dataset was available to the public via https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2016_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021a). The instrument issues were diagnosed and mitigated through use of a four-wavelength set, instead of the previous five-wavelength set. Uniform Quality Control (QC) standards were established to ensure consistent data quality across all three campaigns. This resulted in research-quality, four-wavelength 4STAR datasets for 2017 and 2018 that have since been archived along with the original five-wavelength 4STAR 2016 dataset on the NASA Earth Science Project Office website, replacing the older versions at https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2017_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021b) and https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2018_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021c).

Potential improvements to these initial releases, such as broadening the spectral range, substituting for missing flight-level albedo, and removing unreliable scattering angles, are discussed. The complete 3-year ORACLES 4STAR 2016–2018 has many uses, including the determination of subseasonal changes in aerosol properties, modelling aerosol evolution, and the validation of satellite-retrieved aerosol products."

Bowman,Relating Multi-Scale Plume Detection and Area Estimates of Methane Emissions: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis,"Surface emissions of atmospheric trace gases like methane are typically inferred through two methodologies: plume detection and area-scale estimation. Integrating these methods can enhance emission monitoring but remains challenging due to irregular sampling, variable detection sensitivities, and differing spatial resolutions among plume-detecting instruments. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to link plume-scale and area-scale emission estimates for regions with dense point-source emissions. Our analysis demonstrates that the spatial resolution of plume-detecting instruments influences the observed distribution of plume emission rates. Empirical tests using oil and gas emissions data from the Permian Basin reveal a robust linear relationship between summed gridded plume emission rates and area-scale estimates. After accounting for variability in sampling of the plume detectors, area-scale estimates derived from TROPOMI flux inversions strongly correlate with weekly plume sums (R2 > 0.94, P < 0.005). We also assess the feasibility of using plume data to inform area-scale estimates within a Bayesian assimilation framework and find that plume assimilation improves the constant EDF inventory, bringing it into agreement with independent TROPOMI-derived emission estimates. This work highlights that, given sufficient sampling and favorable observational conditions, plume observations from aircraft, satellites, and in situ instruments can inform and enhance area-scale methane emission estimates, particularly within the oil and gas sector."

B-DOM was obtained from the growth phase to the stationary phase in a culture experiment with marine bacteria in coastal seawater. B-DOM composition was evaluated through chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) (e.g., amino acid-like, humic-like). Photoproduced OVOCs from B-DOM were measured using Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). Acetaldehyde was photoproduced from B-DOM in proportion to light exposure time, with photoproduction rates of 0.20–0.51 nM h–1. However, no direct quantitative relationship between the acetaldehyde photoproduction rates and the levels of CDOM or FDOM was observed. Since acetaldehyde photoproduction was highest during the growth phase of the bacterial culture, it was suggested that the fraction of B-DOM susceptible to microbial degradation contributes to the source of acetaldehyde. In contrast, the photoproduction of acetone from B-DOM was minimal, implying sources other than B-DOM are responsible for acetone on the marine surface. These findings suggest that B-DOM has the potential to generate acetaldehyde upon solar exposure, with implications for understanding the contribution of microbial-derived organic matter to the production of these compounds in the marine environment."

HFC-134a is regulated under the Montreal Protocol. However, the emissions, consumption, and emission–consumption relationships of HFC-134a are unclear. Here, this study reveals that observation-based HFC-134a emissions increased from 19.5 ± 2.5 Gg yr–1 in 2011 to 33.1 ± 7.5 Gg yr–1 in 2020 in China, but with a lower increase (2%) compared to those (48%) reported in a previous inventory-based emission estimate from 2015 to 2020. Consequently, the emission discrepancy between observation-based and inventory-based emissions reached 24.9 ± 7.5 Gg yr–1 (equivalent to 36.6 ± 11.0 Tg of CO2-eq yr–1) in 2020. Therefore, this study built a novel approach (Observation-based Sectoral Activity and Emission Function Attribution Model, OSAM) to quantitatively attribute these emission discrepancies. We found that the emission discrepancies of HFC-134a were generally attributed to the consumption (35.6%) and emission functions (64.4%) used in previous emission inventories; thereby an emission inventory with new emission–consumption relationships, which matched the observation-based estimates, was established in this study. This study provides an emission discrepancy reconciliation approach applicable worldwide."

This study examines the heatwave-induced aerosol variations using aerosol chemical component measurements (2011, 2018, and 2023) and routine PM2.5 mass concentrations in New York City’s downwind region. Results indicate that, under current emission reductions, heatwave PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 41% (daytime), 30% (nighttime), and 26% (rush hour), significantly greater than nonheatwave reductions (∼20%), highlighting enhanced PM2.5 mitigation effects during heatwaves. Particle sulfate, ammonium, and locally formed secondary organic aerosol (SOA) were the dominant contributors to heatwave aerosol reductions, closely tracking precursor emission changes. Additionally, sulfate and local SOA showed similar reduction rates (∼0.2 μg m–3 per year), while regional SOA remained independent of volatile organic compound (VOC) emission reductions, suggesting a more complex formation process. Further reductions in local SOA concentrations are expected with ongoing emission controls, although continuous monitoring remains crucial. These findings will also offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for similar research in other regions."

Brown carbon from wildfires is a complex and poorly characterized mixture of compounds with varying composition, volatility, and reactivity. We conducted controlled burns of western United States fuels at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory during the FIREX FireLab 2016 study. We measured water-soluble brown carbon absorption, total aerosol absorption, and aerosol composition with a shared thermally denuded inlet at temperatures between ambient and 250 °C. We simultaneously collected filter samples at ambient temperature and 250 °C for detailed analysis of molecular size, hydrophobicity, and octanol–water partitioning coefficient log(KOW) using chromatographic separation techniques with wavelength-resolved absorption detection. For the controlled burns, ∼92% of the water-soluble brown carbon at 365 nm consisted of low-volatility organic compounds with log(Csat) values between (−5.1 ± 2) to (0.4 ± 2) and oxygen-to-carbon ratios between 0.0–1.1. Species with molecular mass <500 Da contributed 82 ± 13% of the absorption at 365 nm, while species >500 Da contributed only 6.2 ± 3.7%. Thermodenuder temperatures of 250 °C were equivalent to log(Csat) < −9 with observed oxygen-to-carbon ratios of 1.2 ± 0.3. We found that while only ∼6% of water-soluble brown carbon at 365 nm persisted at these temperatures, approximately 50% of the total absorption in the offline samples remained, with an increased contribution by molecules >500 Da of 15 ± 12%. HPLC analysis showed that the compounds removed at 250 °C had log(KOW) values between 2.9 ± 0.7 and 3.5 ± 0.7 and contained aliphatic, aromatic, hydroxyl, and carbonyl functional groups."

 Air quality in northern South America faces significant challenges due to insufficient high-resolution emission inventories and sparse atmospheric studies. This study addresses these gaps by developing a novel framework that integrates high-resolution nighttime light data from SDGSAT-1 and multisource remote sensing datasets with deep learning techniques to downscale emission inventories. The refined inventories are coupled with meteorological inputs into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) model, enabling precise simulation of pollutant dynamics. Validated against ground measurements from Colombia's SISAIRE monitoring network, demonstrates significant improvements in spatiotemporal accuracy, particularly for particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) with error reductions of 22–30 % and correlation coefficients increasing from 0.68 to 0.85. These findings underscore the critical role of satellite-enhanced inventories in resolving localized emission patterns and seasonal variability, such as dry-season PM₁₀ spikes (150 % increase from wildfires). The framework provides policymakers with actionable insights to prioritize mitigation in rapidly urbanizing regions and manage transboundary pollution. By bridging data scarcity gaps, this replicable methodology offers transformative potential for global air quality management and public health protection, advocating for expanded ground monitoring networks and real-time satellite data integration in future applications."

 The exchange of gaseous element mercury (GEM) between forests and atmosphere is an important part of the global mercury (Hg) cycle. However, there is ongoing debate about whether forests are as a net sink or source of GEM, especially in Hg-polluted regions. This study monitored the GEM fluxes over the canopy of an Hg-contaminated forest in subtropical Southwest China from August 2017 to December 2020 b y the aerodynamic gradient method. From August 2017 to July 2018, the atmospheric GEM concentration was 4.41 ± 1.49 ng m−3, with the forest serving as a source, exhibiting an average GEM flux of 101 ± 226 ng m−2 h−1, higher in summer (270 ng m−2 h−1) and lower in spring (13.3 ng m−2 h−1). By contrast, after 2019, the atmospheric concentration increased to 10.8 ± 36.3 ng m−3, due probably to adjacent city construction, resulting in the forest being switched to a net GEM sink (−48.5 ± 254 ng m−2 h−1). These findings indicated that atmospheric GEM concentration might play a major role in the GEM sink/source transition of forests. Future decreases in atmospheric Hg concentration may prompt the forest to release GEM again. Further studies are required to determine the time needed for the GEM exchange between the atmosphere and forest to reach a balance."

However, the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions, including interactions with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), remain largely unquantified. In this study, we combine laboratory data with a thermodynamic model to predict the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions. Our results suggest that BBOA with a H2SO4-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.37─an estimated upper limit for pyroCb smoke in the lower stratosphere after two months of aging─is highly viscous and frequently exists in a glassy state. Even at a higher H2SO4-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.79─an estimated upper limit after nine months of aging─BBOA can still transition to a glassy state under certain stratospheric conditions.

Here, we investigated the potential SA‐MSA‐HIO3‐HIO2 quaternary nucleation mechanism by exploring the formation of (SA)w(MSA)x(HIO3)y(HIO2)z (0 ≤ w + x + y ≤ 3, 1 ≤ z ≤ 3) clusters with quantum chemical calculation and kinetics modelling. The results indicate that SA‐MSA‐HIO3‐HIO2 can effectively nucleate under marine atmospheric conditions. The nucleation rate is up to 7 orders of magnitude higher than that of SA/MSA‐HIO3‐HIO2, SA‐MSA‐HIO2 ternary mechanisms, and SA/MSA/HIO3‐HIO2 binary mechanisms at some specific conditions. The nucleation is mainly driven by acid‐base reaction (HIO2 as base) and halogen bonds besides hydrogen bonds, with the three acids showing both competitive and cooperative roles. More importantly, it was found that the contribution of MSA to the aerosol nucleation is comparable to SA at equal concentrations. The unexpectedly high contribution of MSA is attributed to its higher halogen‐bonding capacity than SA. This study highlights the need to consider the multicomponent nucleation mechanism in the marine atmosphere for accurate aerosol and climate projections, and may serve as important proof that MSA as weak acid can effectively nucleate even coexisting with SA."

Xiong,Uncertainty Analysis of Surface Downward Longwave Radiation Models Based on Cloud Base Temperature,"Cloud base temperature (CBT) is a crucial factor determining the surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) under cloudy conditions. Theoretically, CBT‐based parameterized models offer more accurate representations of cloud radiation effects and SDLR compared to simplistic models. However, they have poor performance in practical retrievals and have less development and application than other models. This study aims to pinpoint the shortcomings of existing CBT‐based models, quantify model errors, and evaluate the impact of key parameter errors on SDLR retrieval results. Using simulated datasets based on radiative transfer models and ground‐based remote sensing datasets, we conducted a detailed analysis of four CBT‐based models. Our findings reveal that current model formulations inadequately capture the contributions of the atmosphere and cloud, leading to overestimation of the former and underestimation of the latter. However, these errors can partially offset each other. Under accurate parameter conditions, mean SDLR errors are within 10 W/m2 for Diak, Gupta‐Cal, and Wang models, and approximately −5 W/m2 for the Schmetz model. The influence of cloud base height (CBH) and cloud fraction (CF) is significant and complex. When errors in CBH and CF are combined, CF error exerts a dominant influence. Surface downward longwave radiation error is insensitive to CBH error when CF is underestimated, while the impact of CBH error on SDLR estimation is notable when CF is overestimated. Regardless of CBH error, SDLR error is sensitive to CF error. Furthermore, when model errors are combined with cloud parameter errors, model errors may amplify or partially offset the impacts of parameter errors."

 Maritime transportation is a substantial contributor to anthropogenic NOx emissions and coastal air pollution. Recognizing this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has steadily implemented stepwise stricter emission standards for ships in recent years. However, monitoring emissions from sea-bound vessels poses inherent challenges, prompting the exploration of satellite observations as a promising solution. Here we use TROPOMI measurements of NO2 plumes together with information on ship position and identity, and atmospheric models to quantify the NOx emissions of 130 plumes from individual ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in 2019. Because most of the emitted NOx is in the form of NO, which is not immediately converted into detectable NO2, plumes show their NO2 maximum some 15-30 km downwind of the ship’s stack. Further downwind NO2 decreases because of plume dispersion and photochemical oxidation. Background ozone and wind speed play a significant role both in detectability of the NO2 plume and the relationship between NOx emissions and observed NO2, explaining the good detection conditions in the eastern Mediterranean summertime, where ozone levels are high. Taking such effects of emissions, dispersion, entrainment, and in-plume chemistry in full account, we find emission strengths of 10-317 g (NO2) s−1. We then calculate emission factors of the detected ship plumes using AIS and ship specific data and find that newer Tier II ships have higher emission factors compared to older Tier I ships. This is especially the case when running at lower engine loads, which is the most frequently observed mode of operation in our ensemble. Additionally, at the time of detection around half of the emission factors detected for Tier II ships lie above the IMO weighted average limits. The presented method sets the stage for automated ship emission monitoring at sea, contributing to better air quality management."

 Tourism activities can have a significant impact on air quality in forest scenic areas. In this work, we measured the levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including carbonyls and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), in the national forest park of Mountain Laoshan (Mt. Laoshan) in Qingdao, China, and evaluated the impact of these levels on air quality in this specific area. We found that during the May Day holidays (May 1–5, 2021), when the number of tourists is typically high, the average of VOCs total concentration was around 23.8 ± 22.6 ppbv, about 1.5 times higher than during periods with fewer tourists, ≈16.3 ± 15.2 ppbv. Most VOC species exhibited a bimodal profile diurnal variation during lunch and dinner periods. Using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, five anthropogenic sources were identified, with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage and traffic emissions being the two primary sources of VOCs in the Mt. Laoshan forest scenic area, respectively. The results indicate that tourism has a significant impact on atmospheric VOCs levels in the investigated area. Based on a 0-D model, we studied the effects of additional emissions from human activity on the atmospheric chemistry in the Mt. Laoshan forest scenic area. It was found that the additional NOx and VOCs emissions from tourism obviously increased the NO3 reactivity during the night and OH formation during the daytime, which significantly increases the local atmospheric oxidation capacity. Therefore, this study emphasizes the significant impact of tourism activities, such as catering and traffic emissions, on the local air quality in forest scenic areas."

In this study, we collected information on reproductive history, sociodemographic profiles, lifestyle, and residential details of 10,153 couples at risk of pregnancy. Each participant’s 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year average O3 exposure levels were estimated using a previously developed randomized trees model. We used discrete-time Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the fecundability odds ratio (FOR) for each 10 μg/m3 change in the O3, adjusting for a set of demographics, lifestyle, and environmental covariables. We observed that a 10 μg/m3 increase in the annual average level of exposure to O3 was associated with a 16% reduction in fecundity (FOR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.82–0.85). We also observed a 40% increase in the odds of infertility (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.34–1.46) for each 10 μg/m3 rise in the annual mean of O3 exposure. After adjustment for fine particulate matter, the strong association between O3 exposure of fecundity to O3 persisted. Given the increasing epidemic of infertility, we strongly advocate for heightened consideration of O3’s impact on reproductive health, as it may partially counterbalance the health benefits gained from improved PM2.5 levels in a middle-income setting."

Interestingly, NPF was observed to coincide with the African biomass burning season, although wet removal of pre‐existing aerosols is needed during these NPF events. Surface and airborne measurements show that these NPF events likely occurred in the upper region of the marine boundary layer, and the newly formed aerosols were further transported to the surface via vertical air motions. Using a box model, we predicted that a large fraction of these particles could grow to sizes related to cloud condensation nuclei. Our study shows that NPF can occur over the southeast Atlantic, and the African biomass‐burning plume likely contributed to the NPF occurrence."

Estimating NCCN using aerosol optical properties is essential for obtaining continuous NCCN data. This study highlights the significant impact of relative humidity (RH) on NCCN estimation through aerosol optical data, especially at low supersaturations (SS). When RH exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60% at 0.2% SS), NCCN estimation shifts from underestimation to overestimation, with the overestimation degree increasing with RH. Including RH in the estimation formula can effectively reduce this bias, although the aerosol optical hygroscopicity parameter is found to have a minimal effect on NCCN estimation. Based on these insights, a new parameterization scheme for NCCN estimation is proposed, which can significantly reduce NCCN estimation bias when using wet aerosol optical data at high RH levels (40%–90%)."

This study aims to construct long-term daily-scale visibility and fog-haze datasets for China using machine learning models, analyze their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, identify key influencing factors of visibility. The results show that the LightGBM model achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 4.03 km), representing a 7.04 % improvement in R2 and 0.6 km reduction in RMSE compared to the baseline model, while maintaining robust stability across both seasonal (R2 = 0.77–0.79, RMSE = 3.83–4.18 km) and spatial scales (R2 = 0.58–0.76, RMSE <4 km). Atmospheric visibility showed an initial decline followed by an upward trend from 2001 to 2023, reaching its lowest point in 2015 (20.77 km) and recovering to 21.26 km by 2023. Visibility was lowest in winter (20.33 km) and highest in summer (22.32 km), with low-value areas concentrated in eastern and central city clusters. Overall, a declining trend was observed, with an annual average decrease of 0.03–0.08 km. From 2000 to 2013, the annual average visibility decreased by 0.09–0.13 km, with the decline area accounting for 22.56 %–55.38 %.

SO₂, relative humidity, and surface pressure are the most important variables affecting atmospheric visibility, with contributions of 17.43 %, 13.29 %, and 10.58 %, respectively. The thresholds for these variables are 11.4 μg/m3, 74.9 %, and 998 hPa. The frequency of haze in China increased from 9.97 days in 2001 to 20.3 days in 2013 and then decreased to 11.03 days by 2023. Overall, there is an average annual decrease of 0.5 days, with the spatial pattern showing a decline in the eastern and central regions, and an increase in the western region. Specifically, light haze and alert haze decreased by 0.75 and 0.2 days per year, respectively, while mild haze increased by 0.32 days per year. The area without haze has continuously decreased by 11.89 %, while the area with low-frequency haze has increased by 12.91 %. The area with high-frequency haze first increased and then decreased, showing an overall reduction of 1.03 %, mainly concentrated in city clusters in the eastern and central regions. From 2001 to 2013, the area of high-frequency haze increased by 5.68 %, while it decreased by 6.71 % from 2013 to 2023.

Recent HONO measurements from space in fresh biomass burning plumes offer the potential to inform about HONO formation mechanisms globally. However, research is needed to further develop, interpret, and evaluate the satellite retrievals. Here, we present a new global HONO column data set of 5.5 years from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We leverage the Covariance‐Based Retrieval Algorithm to significantly improve the sensitivity to weak HONO signals over all biomass burning regions. Radiative transfer simulations for retrieving HONO columns indicate a strong dependence on plume height and smoke aerosols. Such information is mostly inaccessible from space for thick plumes but can be obtained from suborbital measurements during dedicated campaigns. We compare the TROPOMI HONO columns to aircraft observations from the BB‐FLUX campaign. When explicitly accounting for aerosols, the satellite and aircraft data are in good agreement albeit with significant comparison uncertainty. We also evaluate the TROPOMI retrievals against HONO columns measured by IASI and discuss the differences. Next, we demonstrate the potential of geostationary satellites like the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer to provide temporally resolved information on pyrogenic HONO. Finally, we find a close relationship between satellite HONO detections and fire intensity both in space and time, highlighting the likely dominance of HONO production during the flaming phase of the fires."

We estimated PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using laser light scattering (PurpleAir sensors) and examined total carbon (TC) and its organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) fractions in total suspended particles (TSP). We investigated the dominant sources of carbonaceous aerosol using air mass backward‐trajectories from the NOAA HYSPLIT model and radiocarbon source apportionment of TC. TC concentrations were about twice as high in the Interior compared to the coast, with contemporary sources dominating at both Toolik (95%–99%) and Utqiaġvik (86%–89%) over minor contributions from fossil sources. Elevated PM, TC, OC, and EC concentrations coincided with major boreal forest fire activity in North America that brought smoke to the region. The radiocarbon signature of EC measured at Toolik during these wildfire events indicated that over 90% of the EC came from contemporary sources.

Here, comparisons between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) observations from field campaigns during the 2017–2018 Austral summer over the Australasian sector of the SO and simulated CCN from the Community Atmospheric Model 6 (CAM6) are presented. Modeled MBL CCN number concentration (NCCN) is underestimated, by close to 100% at latitudes south of 55°S with the NCCN bias (a) largest close to the Antarctic Plateau during summer, implying the biased CCN type has seasonal and latitudinal variation and, (b) three times larger over sea ice than over open water, implying sea spray CCN are better simulated compared to secondary CCN. Assessments of aerosol size distributions indicate an underestimation of accumulation‐mode‐aerosols (Ac) with diameters 70 nm < D < 100 nm. CCN supersaturation spectra indicate that the observed CCN had lower hygroscopicity compared to simulated CCN, implying differences in CCN chemical composition. With secondary aerosols including sulfate being less hygroscopic than sea salt CCN, the CCN activation ratio derived using bulk hygroscopicity kappa in the Abdul‐Razzak function leads to an underestimation of critical supersaturation south of 62°S. The biases reported here highlight important shortfalls in simulated CCN that can be important to the well‐documented underestimated Nd by Earth System Models, a key feature and uncertainty of pre‐industrial conditions."

Moreover, they tend to have a very high spatiotemporal variability. In order to understand this variability, long‐term measurements with high temporal resolution are essential. This paper presents an analysis of 3 months of online INP measurements (10 min time‐resolved), using a PINE cloud chamber (−33°C ≤ T ≤ −22°C). Measurements were made from December 2022 to March 2023 at the PUY station (France, 1,465 m a.s.l), a site exposed to a variety of air masses including free troposphere conditions. A large part of the temporal variability of INP concentrations (over four orders of magnitude at a single temperature) can be explained by air mass origin. INP concentrations measured for oceanic air masses are in the lower range (from ≈0.1 to ≈10 L−1). Those for continental air masses are in a medium range (from ≈1 to ≈100 L−1) and depend on the level of pollution of the air mass. INP concentrations measured for southern air masses show highest concentrations (from ≈10 to ≈500 L−1) and mostly depend on the amount of dust in the ambient air. Moreover, measurements were conducted during two dust events revealing INP concentrations over 1000 L−1 at −32°C. Subsequently, a set of parameterizations capable of tracing the measured INP variability were developed. This will facilitate our understanding of the impact of INP concentrations on mixed‐phase cloud properties with cloud models."
10.1029/2025EF006044,True,Earth's Future,该研究论文探讨了欧洲地区粗颗粒物增加对人为细颗粒物减少所带来的气候变暖效应的缓解作用。研究发现，粗颗粒物通过影响细颗粒物的凝结，改变了气溶胶的粒径分布，从而增加了太阳辐射的散射，部分抵消了细颗粒物减少导致的降温效果减弱。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究内容与大气成分分析（特别是气溶胶的粒径分布和光学特性）密切相关，并间接涉及空气质量监测，因为气溶胶是空气质量的重要组成部分。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的关联性。,"['aerosols', 'coarse particles', 'fine particles', 'radiative effects', 'solar radiation', 'emission controls', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'atmospheric composition analysis (aerosol size distribution)']",Chen Cui;Pengfei Tian;Wenfang Wang;Zeren Yu;Binrui Wang;Chenguang Tang;Xianjie Cao;Jiening Liang;Lei Zhang,Increasing Coarse Aerosols Mitigated the Warming Effect of Anthropogenic Fine Particle Reductions in Europe,"Recent decades have seen substantial variations in the physicochemical characteristics of atmospheric aerosols with expected continued changes in the future. While sustained global emission controls have yielded significant environmental benefits, the associated climate penalty from complex radiative effects has induced additional warming, raising public concern. Our study reveals that increased coarse particles enhance fine particle coagulation, contributing to higher coarse particle levels and a reduction in coarse particle peak size, thereby scattering more solar radiation and mitigating the warming from reduced fine particles in Europe. From 1999 to 2021, changes in coarse particles offset 24.6% (26.3%) of the reduced cooling effect at the top (ground) of atmosphere from fine particle reductions. Our findings highlight the complex but significant role of aerosol size changes in influencing solar radiation budget, offering potential relief for global warming concerns and bolstering emissions reduction efforts, with important global and European implications amid ongoing and expected anthropogenic emission cuts."

 This study comprehensively analyzes trends in tropospheric ozone precursors over the Indian region from 2018 to 2024, focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and glyoxal (CHOCHO), using TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite datasets. Our results reveal contrasting trends: while HCHO and CHOCHO show consistent increases, NO2 exhibits a slight decrease over the past few years, likely reflecting the impact of emission control measures. The mean growth rate calculated for HCHO Vertical Column Density (VCD) is ∼1.7 % yr−1 and ∼2 % yr−1 for CHOCHO, whereas tropospheric NO2 VCDs show a slower growth rate of ∼ −0.21 %yr−1, indicating a reduction in NOx emissions over recent years. The growth rate of HCHO is consistent with findings from previous studies. However, unlike earlier long-term studies, a recent decline in NO2 has been observed. Long-term OMI dataset measurements are used to corroborate these findings. Analysis of the formaldehyde-to-nitrogen ratio indicates that the Indian mainland region is mostly NOx-limited in nature, and further shifts toward highly NOx-limited ozone production are observed in most parts of the study area. Seasonal patterns show pronounced peaks in NO2 during winter and HCHO and CHOCHO during pre- and post-monsoon seasons, underscoring the significant influence of biomass burning and agricultural activities on precursor levels. The seasonal variation in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and fire density was analyzed to assess emissions from biogenic and pyrogenic sources. These findings emphasize the complexity of ozone precursor dynamics in India, highlighting the need for targeted emission controls to mitigate regional ozone pollution."

 Ambient atmospheric aerosol particles consist of primary particles that are directly emitted and secondary particles that are formed through nucleation or chemical reactions. The number concentration of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, which has a significant impact on air quality and climate, is largely influenced by secondary particles formed through nucleation. Therefore, a precise understanding of nucleation is essential. Homogeneous nucleation is a mechanism in which new condensed-phase substances, aerosol particles, are generated through the phase transition of vapor under conditions of vapor supersaturation. Several theories have been proposed to explain nucleation processes, including H2SO4-H2O binary homogeneous nucleation, H2SO4-H2O-NH3 ternary homogeneous nucleation, and ion-mediated nucleation. In practice, many air quality models including Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling system (CMAQ) still use only H2SO4-H2O binary homogeneous nucleation module to calculate nucleation rates. The comparison and validation of different nucleation theories in the polluted regions of South Korea has never been conducted. In this study, we used CMAQv5.2 to simulate the aerosol number concentration at Seoul Olympic Park during the KORUS-AQ campaign. The results revealed that the model underestimated the aerosol number concentration by approximate a factor of 10 compared to observations. This is primarily due to nucleation rates, which raises the need for an alternative module with higher accuracy. To simulate nucleation rates and aerosol number concentrations, we applied five different nucleation modules to a box model Korea Air quality observation-based Box model (KAB) as well as a 3-dimensional chemical transport model CMAQ. Based on the KAB modeling results, the ion-mediated H2SO4-H2O binary nucleation module resulted in a significantly higher nucleation rate compared to the calculations from the existing modules (0.06 cm−3s−1 vs. 1.16 cm−3s−1), providing values closer to the observed nucleation rates. And according to the CMAQ modeling results, ternary H2SO4-H2O-NH3 homogeneous nucleation module gave the calculated aerosol number concentration the closest to the observed value. Such comparisons between modules are expected to be useful for selecting the most suitable nucleation module for the atmospheric conditions in South Korea."

 Wildfire particulate matter from Canadian forest fires significantly impacted the air quality in the northeastern United States during the summer of 2023. Here, we used real-time and time-integrated instrumentation to characterize the physicochemical properties and radiative effects of wildfire particulate matter reaching the metropolitan areas of New Jersey/ New York during this extreme incident. The radiative forcing of −352.4 W/m2 derived here based on the measured optical properties of wildfire particulate matter explains, to some extent, the ground level temperature reduction of about 3 °C observed in New Jersey/ New York City during this incident. Such negative radiative forcing in densely populated megacities may limit natural ventilation, increase the residence time of wildfire particulate matter and background air pollutants, exacerbating public health risks. This study highlights the importance of radiative effects from wildfire particulate matter in densely populated areas and their potential implications for climate, air quality and public health.

In the present study, we measured atmospheric BC over the Arabian Sea (AS) during June on board a research expedition. While BC is expected to decrease as we move away from continental landmass, surprisingly, despite negligible land-based combustion activities at this time of the year, a zone of high BC was observed offshore within a narrow band impacted by the Biparjoy cyclone. The median BC concentration was two-fold higher within the cyclone-impacted zone than in the region east of this zone. Airmass back-trajectory and satellite fire map analysis revealed that savanna burning in Africa could significantly affects elevated BC signals over the AS. However, the absence of correlation of BC with biomass-burning tracers inside the high-BC zone clearly suggested some other active source(s). Correlation analysis of BC with oceanic deep-water vertical mixing indicators as well as atmospheric processes provides vital pointers that a significant amount of this BC can be regurgitated from waters, which are brought to the surface from depth, as the deep ocean is one of largest reservoirs of BC aerosols. These findings demand a nascent scope for controlled simulation experiments to estimate regurgitated BC from the ocean to reduce its uncertainty."

Gerber;Stephan Fueglistaler,Protection without poison: why tropical ozone maximizes in the interior of the atmosphere,"The ozone concentration in the tropical stratosphere peaks at 26 km, protecting life from harmful ultraviolet light without poisoning it. Climate models reproduce this peak, but textbook explanations yield errors of 10 km. Simplifying the well-understood sources and sinks of ozone, we develop a theory explaining that tropical ozone peaks where its dominant sink transitions from damping of atomic oxygen aloft (mainly via catalytic chemistry) to damping of ozone below (mainly via transport). 
 The number density of ozone, [O3], maximizes around 26 km in the tropics, protecting life from harmful ultraviolet (UV) light without poisoning it at the surface. Textbooks explain this interior maximum with two  paradigms: (1) the source-controlled paradigm explains [O3] as maximizing where its source maximizes between abundant photons aloft and abundant [O2] below, and (2) the source / sink competition paradigm, inspired by the Chapman cycle, explains ozone as scaling with [O2] and the photolytic source / sink ratio. However, each paradigm's prediction for the altitude of peak [O3] is off by 10 km, reflecting their well-known omission of ozone sinks from catalytic cycles and transport. We present a minimal, steady-state theory for the tropical stratospheric [O3] maximum, accurate to within 1 km and formulated in terms of the dominant ozone sinks. These sinks are represented simply by augmenting the Chapman cycle with linear damping of O and O3, leading to the Chapman+2 model. The Chapman+2 model correctly simulates peak tropical [O3] at 26 km, yet this peak is not explained by either paradigm. Instead, the peak is newly explained by the transition from an O-damped regime aloft to an O3-damped regime below. An explicit analytical expression is derived for ozone under gray radiation. This theory accurately predicts an interior maximum of ozone and correctly predicts that an increase in top-of-atmosphere UV light will lead to a downward shift in the peak [O3] due to a downward shift in the regime transition, a result not even qualitatively predicted by the existing paradigms."

However, exchanging cylinders at remote sites presents logistical challenges, requiring systems that minimize gas consumption. We developed methods for calculating greenhouse gas mole fractions and uncertainties using our original system designed to reduce standard gas use. We validated its long-term stability through instrument comparisons. The system has proven effective for maintaining observations at remote sites. 
 We have revised a calculation method of mole fractions and uncertainties for in situ CO2 and CH4 measurements with a working standard-gas-saving system. It uses on-site compressed air to track the baseline drift of sensors. The Japan–Russia Siberian Tall Tower Inland Observation Network (JR-STATION) is made up of this system, which was installed across nine different sites in Siberia. The system acquires semi-continuous data by alternating between sampling air from multiple altitudes through switched flow paths and recording several minutes of averaged data for each altitude. We estimated the sensor repeatability (ur) based on the measurement of on-site compressed air. The ur for CO2 and CH4 was mostly around 0.05 ppm and below 5 ppb, respectively. The combined standard uncertainties (uc(x)) of time-averaged ambient air measurements were sometimes higher than the ur for each period because the data included atmospheric variability during the measurement period of several minutes. Data users should consider the difference between the ur and uc(x) to select optimal data, depending on their focusing spatial scale. The CO2 and CH4 data measured with a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer and a tin dioxide sensor (TOS) exhibited good agreement with those measured by cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)."

Power plant emission contributions to breathing level (0–10 m) pollution are estimated over the FNSB using high-resolution Lagrangian tracer simulations run with temporally varying emissions and power plant plume rise accounting for atmospheric boundary layer stability and validated against comprehensive ALPACA-2022 observations. Average relative power plant contributions of 5–23% and 4–28% are diagnosed for SO2 and NOx, respectively, with lower relative contributions in polluted conditions due to larger surface emissions. Highest population-weighted contributions are found in central and eastern (residential) areas of Fairbanks. Significant temporal variability in power plant contributions is revealed, depending on power plant operations and Arctic boundary layer stability. Vertical transport of power plant tracers to the surface depends on the interplay between the presence of temperature inversion layers and power plant stack heights as well as prevailing large-scale or local winds. Notably, power plant emissions can be transported to the surface even under strongly stable conditions, especially from shorter stacks, whereas down mixing from tall stacks mainly occurs under weakly stable conditions."

In the 2019 and 2022 droughts, stomatal closure in the Yangtze River Basin, caused by soil moisture deficits, led to ∼60% reductions in ozone deposition rates to vegetation, aligning with reduced photosynthesis inferred from satellite remote sensing of solar induced fluorescence. Ozone production increased due to higher isoprene emissions from heat stress, NOx‐rich airflow from North China, and enhanced solar radiation. Soil drought intensified temperatures and increased isoprene emissions by 27%, but these only had marginal impact on ozone (<5 ppbv) in South China, where ozone formation is NOx‐limited. Reduced ozone uptake by drought‐stressed vegetation played a dominant role, driving 10–20 ppbv increases in daily maximum 8‐hr average ozone concentrations and a threefold rise in events exceeding 100 ppbv."

The modeled ERF is very sensitive to the non‐volcanic background aerosol concentration: doubling the non‐volcanic aerosol background weakens the ACI ERF by ∼30% ${\sim} 30\%$.

 Despite the continuous global warming, over the past several decades, the tropical East Pacific has experienced a cooling trend whose origin remains an area of active research. Mounting evidence has linked tropical sea-surface temperature (SST) patterns to changes in the Southern Ocean via remote teleconnections. Using a fully-coupled global climate model, we demonstrate that stratospheric ozone depletion can produce a La Niña-like tropical SST trend pattern resembling recent observations. This tropical response initially arises from mid-latitude ocean adjustments to ozone-driven surface wind anomalies, which then enhance in the tropics via positive cloud feedback and wind-evaporation-SST feedback. Our finding suggests that the observed La Niña-like tropical SST trend pattern may have been, in part, caused by the formation of the ozone hole in the late 20th century. It also implies that ozone recovery in the coming decades will likely contribute to a future weakening or reversal of the observed tropical SST trends."

PM2.5 significantly increased mortality risk only in Wuhan (RR = 1.212, 95% CI: 1.110–1.323). In contrast, SO2 and O3 were protective, with O3 reducing mortality risk by up to 11.1% at certain lag periods. Stratified analysis indicated a markedly stronger effect of NO2 in southeastern regions. These findings highlight the need to address air pollution in pandemic preparedness and call for further research on its regional impacts to guide targeted public health interventions."

 Aerosol pollution significantly influences the interaction between solar radiation and the earth's atmosphere and seriously threatens human health. Numerous studies have applied machine learning models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to estimate aerosol-related parameters, including aerosol optical depth and particulate matter concentrations (e.g., PM2.5). However, current aerosol products primarily provide horizontal or spatially discontinuous vertical data, lacking comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) coverage. To address this gap, we developed the XGBoost-LightGBM-Wavelet (XLW) model, integrating XGBoost, LightGBM, and wavelet transforms to merge multisource data. This approach, for the first time, produced high-resolution, three-dimensional, full-coverage aerosol distribution data for China in 2015. The model outputs a dataset of aerosol spatial distribution with a horizontal resolution of 0.05°, and 167 layers within 10 km in the vertical direction. The XLW model demonstrates excellent predictive ability, effectively filling gaps in aerosol distribution. It enhances signal continuity and strengthens lower-layer signals, closely matching ground LiDAR observations and providing a more accurate representation compared to the Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data. The dataset accurately reveals the 3D distribution of aerosols, which is meaningful for a comprehensive study of aerosol distribution at different altitudes in various regions. At 300 m height above ground level, the most polluted regions are the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta region, with an average aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) of 0.34 and 0.40 km−1, respectively. As the height increases to 1 km, the average AEC notably decreases to 0.23 and 0.24 km−1 in the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta. By 3 km, aerosol distribution becomes sparse over most regions of China. For the vertical variations of aerosol distributions in typical cities, in the North China Plain and Yangtze River Delta, aerosol concentrations consistently decrease from the near-surface to 4 km. However, in the Pearl River Delta, aerosol concentrations decrease consistently from 0 to 2 km, with relatively stable between 2 and 3 km. Above 4 km, aerosol concentrations are nearly negligible in all typical cities. The XLW model can accurately produce a high-resolution, 3D, full-coverage aerosol spatial distribution dataset, which is vital for conducting thorough studies on aerosol transport, aerosol radiative effects, and climate change."

 Chloride-containing aerosols significantly influence tropospheric chemistry and cloud microphysics. Sea salt aerosols (SSAs) are a major source of chlorine-containing aerosols in coastal regions. However, existing methods for estimating chlorine depletion using Single Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (SPAMS) suffer from significant limitations. This study demonstrates that relying solely on [Cl]- signal at m/z = −35 and −37 to quantify chlorine content leads to substantial overestimation of chlorine depletion, particularly in fresh SSAs, where additional chlorine is contributed by [Na2Cl]+ and [NaCl2]- ions. Using SPAMS data collected at a coastal site in Hong Kong during winter, spring and summer, we propose an improved methodology that accounts for all potential chlorine-depleting components. This improved method shows a better correlation with bulk observations, reducing the average estimated chlorine depletion from 98 ± 1 % to 57 ± 3 %, aligning closely with bulk results (49 ± 22 %). The new method significantly improves the refined analysis of chemical processes affecting chlorine depletion by precisely resolving size-dependent biases, organic acid, and NH3 concentration-dependent dual roles. Seasonal analyses highlight the strong influence of dominant air masses, with winter exhibiting the highest depletion due to air masses originating from industrial inland/coastal regions, while summer shows minimal depletion under clean marine conditions. The improved method establishes a more reliable framework for quantifying chlorine depletion in individual SSAs, advancing mechanistic understanding of coastal chlorine cycling."

 Despite emission reduction efforts, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) concentrations have not responded to precursor reduction as expected. In this study, the key drivers of long-term variations versus short-term pollution events were quantified by using a random forest (RF) model and the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method on the basis of atmospheric SNA concentrations in Qingdao from 2004 to 2023. The results validated the prediction accuracy of the RF + SHAP model for SNA trends. The rapid decrease in SO42− was driven by SO2 reductions, especially after 2013, at a rate of 8.0 %·yr−1. In contrast, the NO3− concentration slightly increased overall before 2017 and then slowly decreased. The SHAP analysis results revealed that the increase in atmospheric oxidation capacity enhanced the secondary formation of NO3−, thus offsetting the benefits of NOx emission reduction and marking a shift from SO42−-driven pollution to NO3−-driven pollution. Corresponding to this shift, the NH4+ concentration initially decreased before 2016, followed by a slight increase. Notably, during SNA pollution events, the key drivers shifted. Enhanced heterogeneous reaction processes, especially NH3-driven gas–particle conversion, led to increased SNA formation. Our findings highlighted the changes in SNA formation mechanisms at different time scales, thereby advancing the understanding of the underlying atmospheric processes."

 Accurate prediction of dense fog is critical for daily life and economic activities. However, its high sensitivity to numerical initial conditions underscores the pivotal role of data assimilation in improving prediction quality. The impacts of data assimilation on a warm advection fog over the South China Sea and a cold advection fog in the North of China in 2021 were investigated using the radiance data from the FY-3D Microwave Humidity Sounder II (MWHS2) and the conventional observational data from the Global Telecommunication System (GTS). The three-dimensional variational assimilation (3DVAR) data assimilation scheme was applied to introduce the MWHS2 radiance data, using the Radiative Transfer for Tovs (RTTOV) model as the observation operator. Experiments with and without data assimilation were performed to show the impact of data assimilation on the analysis and forecast of the warm and cold advection fog events. Experimental results showed that the assimilation experiments outperformed the control experiment in simulating the warm advection fog over the west coast and sea areas of the Leizhou Peninsula and its northeast sea areas. Specifically, for visibility below 1 km, the data assimilation experiment (Exp_Da) improved the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) by 11.82 % and 6.56 %, and the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 19.92 % and 14.38 %, compared to the control experiment, for the 3-h and 6-h forecasts. It was found that Exp_Da significantly improved the representation of meteorological variables, including temperature advection and relative humidity, which were crucial for better predicting fog coverage. In the cold advection fog case in the North of China, the assimilation experiment resulted in an improved simulation of cold advection, particularly at 1000 hPa. In summary, assimilating both satellite and conventional observational data improves the simulation and prediction of warm and cold advection fog events. However, accurately simulating thin fog remains challenging. Visibility in the range of 1 km to 2 km has not been well simulated, necessitating further advancements in model development and fog diagnostic methodologies."

By comparing two different chemistry modeling schemes, we found that including complex chemical reactions leads to a more accurate prediction of how long SO2 stays in the atmosphere. This research helps improve our understanding of volcanic pollution and its impact on air quality and climate, providing better tools for scientists to track and predict the movement of these pollutants. 
 Lagrangian transport models are important tools to study the sources, spread, and lifetime of air pollutants. In order to simulate the transport of reactive atmospheric pollutants, the implementation of efficient chemistry and mixing schemes is necessary to properly represent the lifetime of chemical species. Based on a case study simulating the long-range transport of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) for the 2019 Raikoke eruption, this study compares two chemistry schemes implemented in the Massive-Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC) Lagrangian transport model. The explicit scheme represents first-order and pseudo-first-order loss processes of SO2 based on prescribed reaction rates and climatological oxidant fields, i.e., the hydroxyl radical in the gas phase and hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous phase. Furthermore, an implicit scheme with a reduced chemistry mechanism for volcanic SO2 decomposition has been implemented, targeting the upper-troposphere–lower-stratosphere (UT–LS) region. Considering nonlinear effects of the volcanic SO2 chemistry in the UT–LS region, we found that the implicit solution yields a better representation of the volcanic SO2 lifetime, while the first-order explicit solution has better computational efficiency. By analyzing the dependence between the oxidants and SO2 concentrations, correction formulas are derived to adjust the oxidant fields used in the explicit solution, leading to a good trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. We consider this work to be an important step forward to support future research on emission source reconstruction involving nonlinear chemical processes."

D. Campos;Yang Yang;Xu Yue;Hong Liao,Revisiting the high tropospheric ozone over southern Africa: role of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions,"The impacts of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions on high tropospheric ozone levels are not well studied in southern Africa. We combined model simulations with recent observations at the surface and from space to quantify tropospheric ozone and its drivers in southern Africa. Our work focuses on the impact of emissions from different sources at different spatial scales, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of air pollution drivers and their uncertainties in southern Africa. 
 Tropospheric ozone over southern Africa is particularly high and causes tremendous health risks and crop yield losses. It has been previously attributed to the influence by biomass burning (BB), with a neglected contribution from anthropogenic emissions. However, due to the lack of measurements for ozone and its precursors, the modeled impacts of BB and anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric ozone levels in southern Africa were not well evaluated. In this study, we combined the nested GEOS-Chem simulation with a horizontal resolution of 0.5°×0.625° with available multiple observations at the surface and from space to quantify tropospheric ozone and its main drivers in southern Africa. Firstly, BB emissions from current different inventories exhibit similar peaks in the summer season but also have large uncertainties in southern Africa (e.g., uncertainty of a factor of 2–3 in emitted NOx). The model–satellite comparison in the fire season (July–August) in 2019 shows that using the widely used Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 (GFED4.1) inventory, the model tends to overestimate by 87 % compared to OMI NO2, while the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED2) inventory can greatly reduce this model bias to only 34 %. Consequently, the modeled tropospheric column ozone (TCO) bias was reduced from 14 % by GFED4.1 to 2.3 % by QFED2. In addition, the QFED2 also has a much better spatial representativeness than GFED4.1. The simulated surface daily maximum 8 h mean (MDA8) ozone was decreased from 74 ppb by GFED4.1 to only 56 ppb by QFED2. This suggests a highly overestimated role of BB emissions in surface ozone if GFED4.1 is adopted. The model–observation comparison at the surface shows that the global Community Emissions Data System (CEDSv2) anthropogenic inventory tends to underestimate anthropogenic NOx emissions in typical southern African cities and likely misrepresented anthropogenic sources in some areas. That means that urban ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in southern Africa may be strongly underestimated. For example, a 10-fold increase in anthropogenic NOx emissions can change the ozone chemistry regime and increase PM2.5 by up to 50 µg m−3 at the city of Luanda.  Furthermore, we also find that TROPOMI can already capture the urban NO2 column hotspots over low-emission regions like southern Africa, while this is unavailable from the OMI instrument, highlighting the critical role of high-resolution measurements in understanding atmospheric chemistry issues over southern Africa. Our study presents a deeper understanding of the key emission sources and their impacts over southern Africa that will be helpful not only to formulate targeted pollution controls, but also to enhance the capability to predict future air quality and climate change, which would be beneficial for achieving a healthy, climate-friendly, and resilient development in Africa."

Here, we use novel satellite data and a chemistry model to investigate the impact of the pandemic on tropospheric ozone (O3), a key pollutant, in 2020. Overall, we found substantial decreases of up to 20 %, two-thirds of which came from emission reductions, while one-third was due to a decrease in the stratospheric O3 flux into the troposphere. 
 Activity restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic caused large-scale reductions in ozone (O3) precursor emissions, which in turn substantially reduced the abundance of tropospheric O3 in the Northern Hemisphere. Satellite records of lower-tropospheric column O3 (0–6 km) from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) highlight these large reductions in O3 during the COVID-19 period (2020), which persisted into 2021 and 2022. The European domain average O3 reduction ranged between 2.0 and 3.0 DU (where DU denotes Dobson units) (11.0 %–14.6 %). These satellite results were supported by the TOMCAT chemical transport model (CTM) through several model sensitivity experiments to account for changes in emissions and the impact of the meteorological conditions in 2020. Here, the business-as-usual (BAU) emissions were scaled by activity data (i.e. anonymized mobility data from big tech companies) to account for the reduction in O3 precursor emissions. The model simulated large O3 reductions (2.0–3.0 DU), similar to the satellite records, where approximately 66 % and 34 % of the O3 loss can be explained by emission changes and meteorological conditions, respectively. Our results also show that the reduced flux of stratospheric O3 into the troposphere accounted for a substantial component of the meteorological signal in the overall lower-tropospheric O3 levels during the COVID-19 period."

Comparing observed air quality with gridded model output is desirable, and so we created gridded datasets over South Korea using air quality station measurements, which agreed with airborne measurements around Seoul. 
 We present gridded surface air quality datasets over South Korea for three key species – ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – during the time frame of the Korea–US Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) mission (May–June 2016). Mixing ratios for the key species were mapped to 0.1° × 0.1° grid cells (hourly resolution), which were constructed from the 300+ air quality network sites using inverse distance weighting with simple declustering. Cross-comparing the interpolated fields against the site data that were used to create them reveals high prediction skill for O3 (80 %) throughout South Korea and moderate skill (60 %) for CO and NOx on average in densely observed regions after individual mean bias corrections. The gridded O3 and CO interpolations predict the NASA DC-8 observations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) with high skill (80 %) in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) after subtracting the mean bias. DC-8 NOx observations were much less predictable on account of consistently negative vertical gradients within the PBL. Our gridded products capture the mean of and variability in O3 throughout South Korea and the mean of and variability in CO and surface NOx in most site-dense urban centres (SMA, Cheongju, Gwangju, Daegu, Changwon, and Busan)."

We have developed two methodological approaches, namely, elastic net modeling and extreme gradient boosting regressor, that can effectively predict annual average concentrations for nearly all countries. Both methods show good performance for the country's yearly average, while sensitivity tests show less robust results at the sectoral level.

We used three machine learning algorithms and an ensemble method to construct PM2.5 mapping prediction (1 km2) and two-day forecasting models majorly using satellite-driven data in South Korea (2015–2022). We performed a simulation study to examine the statistical properties of short-term PM2.5 risk estimation using  prediction models. Our ensemble spatial prediction model showed better performance than single algorithms (0.956 test R2). The range of the R2 values was 0.78–0.98 across the monitoring sites. The average % bias was from 1.403%–1.787% when our mapping models for PM2.5-mortality risk estimation, compared to the estimates from monitored PM2.5. The best R2 of our forecasting models was 0.904.

 Silicate-based meteoric smoke particles (MSPs) resulting from extraterrestrial dust impacting on the upper atmosphere are likely involved in seeding the formation of mesospheric ice-based noctilucent clouds (NLCs). However, the detailed physicochemical properties of MSP seeds remain elusive. Considering that ice formation is sensitive to MSP charging efficiency, here we focus on species which can efficiently capture charge. As in situ MSP characterisation is highly challenging, we mimic atmospheric MSP formation using laser ablation and collisional cooling to produce small anionic magnesium silicate clusters. Our detailed experimental and theoretical characterisation shows that these clusters have unusual oxygen-rich structures. Moreover, the corresponding neutral clusters have extraordinarily high adiabatic electron affinities and 3-18% charging efficiencies, which is remarkably consistent with estimates required by models to simulate atmospheric measurements. Overall, our highly oxidised anionic silicate clusters exhibit all necessary chemical, electronic and optical properties to be highly credible MSP-based seed candidates for NLC nucleation."

 Aerosol optical and radiative properties over the Leh Ladakh, located in the climate sensitive Hindu Kush Himalayan region are examined using one year measurements from a newly installed sky radiometer from July 2023 to June 2024. Columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD), at 500 nm exhibits a distinct seasonal variation with peak during spring (0.104 ± 0.041) and minimum in autumn (0.077 ± 0.031), while Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) is found to be maximum in winter (1.041 ± 0.205) and minimum (0.658 ± 0.225) in spring. The highest EAE in winter is complemented with the highest AOD_Fine-mode (0.071 ± 0.034) among the seasons which may be associated with the combustion of firewood, charcoal, kerosene or other fuels used to burn to bear the cold winter months, when temperature varied between −15 and −25 °C. Seasonal variation of Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) at 500 nm varied from 0.905 ± 0.055 (winter) to 0.942 ± 0.061 (summer), while the lowest value of SSA during winter is complemented with more absorbing aerosols during winter season. The dominance of fine mode aerosols during the winter seasons is also complemented by the bi-modal volume size distribution. However, the station is experiencing a negligible contribution of dust-aerosols (1%), followed by 18% mixed aerosols and 16% non-absorbing aerosols. The current observing site is dominated by absorbing aerosols which contributed by highly absorbing (49%), moderately absorbing (9%) and slightly absorbing (6%) during the one year of study period. The absorbing aerosols are characterized by high values of AOD_Fine-mode (0.061 ± 0.028), imaginary refractive-index (0.014 ± 0.009), EAE (0.932 ± 0.240) and low value of SSA_Total (0.872 ± 0.070). On the other hand, the non-absorbing aerosols are characterized by high values of AOD_Total (0.088 ± 0.040), SSA_Total (0.991 ± 0.016), SSA_Coarse-mode (0.978 ± 0.038), and low value of imaginary refractive-index (∼0.001). The estimated aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) reveals the high heating rates during spring (0.09 K day−1) among the seasons, while the heating rate is found to be highest by absorbing aerosols (0.08 K day−1) among the aerosol types."

Results showed traffic's impact on nitrogen dioxide levels and atmospheric dynamics on particulate matter. The research confirmed MARS-corrected sensors as cost-effective for monitoring, despite challenges like sensor ageing and data quality control. 
 As part of the TURBAN project, the “Legerova campaign” investigated air quality and meteorology in a traffic-dense area of Prague, Czech Republic, from 30 May 2022 to 28 March 2023. The study deployed a network of 20 low-cost sensor (LCS) stations to measure NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, complemented by advanced meteorological instruments such as a microwave radiometer and Doppler lidar. Ensuring data quality from LCS measurements presented significant challenges. Initial field tests at a reference monitoring station revealed strong correlations between raw LCS and reference data (r > 0.90 for NO2 and PM2.5, r > 0.80 for O3 and PM10). However, individual biases were observed. Applying the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) method effectively reduced biases and enhanced alignment with reference measurements for all pollutants (R2 0.88–0.97). During the campaign, sensor ageing and technical issues were identified through double mass curve analysis and final field testing. The highest NO2 concentrations were recorded in streets with dense building blocks and traffic lights, corresponding to peak traffic patterns (with medians of concentrations 20–34 ppb). Aerosol concentrations were generally low (medians of PM10 < 25 µg m−3 at all sites), with less temporal and spatial variability than NO2. Elevated PM10 and PM2.5 levels occurred primarily during temperature inversions, often linked to local sources, and during a short, non-local episode. This study highlights the MARS method as a reliable tool for field calibration of LCS networks and provides valuable data on urban air quality and its dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution."

Emme;Hannah M. Horowitz,Impacts of sea ice leads on sea salt aerosols and atmospheric chemistry in the Arctic,"There is uncertainty in the sources of Arctic cold-season (November–April) sea salt aerosols. Using a chemical transport model and satellite observations, we quantify Arctic-wide sea salt aerosol emissions from fractures in sea ice, called open sea ice leads, and their atmospheric chemistry impacts for the cold season. We show that sea ice leads contribute to Arctic sea salt aerosols and bromine, especially in under-observed regions. 
 The processes contributing to Arctic cold-season (November–April) sea salt aerosols (SSAs) remain uncertain. Observations from coastal Alaska suggest that emissions from open leads in sea ice, which are not included in climate models, may play a dominant role. Their Arctic-wide significance has not yet been quantified. Here, we create an emission parameterization of SSAs from leads by combining satellite data of lead area (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observation System (AMSR-E) product) and a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to quantify pan-Arctic SSA emissions from leads during the cold season from 2002 to 2008 and to predict their impacts on atmospheric chemistry, evaluating the results of our simulated SSAs against in situ observations. The AMSR-E product detects large leads with certainty (> 3 km in size), and, hence, our study is limited to quantifying emissions from large leads. Lead emissions vary seasonally and interannually. Simulated total monthly SSA emissions increase by 1.1 %–1.8 % (≥60° N latitude) and 5.6 %–7.5 % (≥75° N) for the 2002–2008 cold seasons. SSA concentrations primarily increase at the location of leads, where standard model concentrations are low. GEOS-Chem overestimates SSA concentrations at Arctic sites compared to ground observations, even when lead emissions are not included, suggesting underestimation of SSA sinks and/or uncertainties in SSA emissions from blowing snow and the open ocean. Multi-year monthly mean surface bromine atom (Br) concentrations increase by 2.8 %–8.8 % due to SSAs from leads for the 2002–2008 cold seasons. Changes in ozone concentrations are negligible. While leads contribute < 10 % to Arctic-wide SSA emissions in the years 2002–2008, these emissions occur in regions of low background aerosol concentrations. Leads may increase in frequency under future climate change, which could increase SSA emissions from leads."

The results uncovered three factors that influence calibration performance: calibration period, concentration range and time averaging. We developed a comprehensive framework for the best sensor calibration practices, which serves as a valuable reference for calibrating various sensor types used in air quality monitoring. 
 The rapid expansion of low-cost sensor networks for air quality monitoring necessitates rigorous calibration to ensure data accuracy. Despite numerous published field calibration studies, a universal and comprehensive assessment of factors affecting sensor calibration remains elusive, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality across different networks. This study deployed eight sensor-based monitors in strategically chosen locations continuously for 2 years in Hong Kong, Macau and Shanghai. These locations covered a wide range of climatic conditions: Hong Kong's subtropical climate, Macau's similar yet distinct urban environment and  Shanghai's more variable climate. Each monitor employed a dynamic baseline tracking method for the gas sensors, which isolates the concentration signals from temperature and humidity effects, enhancing the sensors' accuracy and reliability. This strategic deployment ensured that the sensors' performance and calibration processes were tested across diverse atmospheric conditions. The tests, which involved evaluating the validation performance by analysing randomly selected calibration sample subsets ranging from 1–15 d, indicated that the length of the calibration period, pollutant concentration range and time-averaging period are pivotal for sensor calibration quality. We determined that a 5–7 d calibration period minimizes calibration coefficient errors, and a wider concentration range improves the validation R2 values for all sensors, suggesting the necessity of setting specific concentration range thresholds.  A time-averaging period of at least 5 min for data with 1 min resolution was recommended to enable optimal calibration in field operation.  This study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive calibration assessment and the importance of considering environmental variability in the sensor calibration condition. These findings offer methodological guidance for the calibration of other sensor types, providing a reference for future research in the field of sensor calibration."

Here we investigate how sounding continuity can improve across the full CLIMCAPS record (2002 to the present day), spanning multiple instruments and satellites. 
 The Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Combined Atmospheric Product System (CLIMCAPS) characterizes the atmospheric state as vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, CO2, CO, CH4, O3, HNO3 and N2O, together with a suite of Earth surface and cloud properties. The CLIMCAPS record spans more than 2 decades (2002–present) because it utilizes measurements from a series of hyperspectral infrared sounders on different satellite platforms. In this paper, we take a stepwise approach to diagnosing CLIMCAPS V2 with the goal of identifying which Bayesian retrieval components to improve for a future V3 release. CLIMCAPS is based on the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) heritage retrieval approach and is the first system to extend the Aqua record with sounders on next-generation platforms in the same orbit. With the baseline quality of CLIMCAPS V2 soundings well-established, the objective of a V3 upgrade is to improve retrieval consistency across the different instruments and platforms for the sake of a seamless global record of atmospheric soundings. We demonstrate how the retrieval averaging kernels (AKs) are key metrics in diagnosing a multi-instrument system such as CLIMCAPS, and we conclude with the recommendation to upgrade the channel subsets and radiative transfer model error spectrum used in defining the Bayesian measurement error covariance matrix."

 Tracing sources and assessing intervention effectiveness are crucial for controlling atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution. Isotopic techniques enable precise top-down tracing, but the absence of long-term, global-scale multi-compound isotopic data limits comprehensive analysis. Here, we establish a blockchain-based isotopic database, compiling 34,815 isotopic fingerprints of global PM and its emissions from 1,890 pollution events across 66 countries. This allows retrospective analysis and predictions, revealing that PM sources are distinct, dynamically changing over time, and often asynchronous with interventions. Additionally, we estimate source contributions to PM2.5 and its compounds, highlighting the increasing impact of biomass burning. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2100, PM levels may decline to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m³ in the Americas and 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m³ in Asia under climate mitigation scenarios but will still exceed WHO guidelines without further controls on natural emissions.

McCoy;Trude Eidhammer;Andrew Gettelman;Ci Song;Hamish Gordon;Isabel L. McCoy,Constraining aerosol–cloud adjustments by uniting surface observations with a perturbed parameter ensemble,"Whether increased aerosol increases or decreases liquid cloud mass has been a longstanding question. Observed correlations suggest that aerosols thin liquid cloud, but we are able to show that observations were consistent with an increase in liquid cloud in response to aerosols by leveraging a model where causality could be traced. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are the largest source of uncertainty in inferring the magnitude of future warming consistent with the observational record. The effective radiative forcing due to ACI (ERFaci) is dominated by liquid clouds and is composed of two terms: the change in cloud albedo due to redistributing liquid over a larger number of cloud droplets (Nd) and the change in cloud macrophysical properties due to changes in cloud microphysics. These terms are, respectively, referred to as the radiative forcing due to ACI (RFaci) and aerosol–cloud adjustments. While the magnitude of RFaci is uncertain, its sign is confidently negative and results in a cooling in the historical record. In contrast, the adjustment of cloud liquid water path (LWP) to enhanced Nd and associated radiative forcing is uncertain in sign. Increased LWP in response to increased Nd is consistent with precipitation suppression, while decreased LWP in response to increased Nd is consistent with enhanced evaporation from cloud top. Observational constraints of these processes are poor in part because of causal ambiguity in the relationship between Nd and LWP. To better understand this relationship, precipitation (P), Nd, and LWP surface observations from the Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) atmospheric observatory are combined with the output from a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) hosted in the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). This allows for causal interpretation of observed covariability. Observations of precipitation and cloud from ENA constrain the range of possible LWP aerosol–cloud adjustments relative to the prior from the PPE by 15 %, resulting in a global value that is confidently positive (a historical cooling) ranging from 2.1 to 6.9 g m−2. It is found that observed covariability between Nd and LWP is dominated by coalescence scavenging and that this observed covariability is not strongly related to aerosol–cloud adjustments."

However, nearby clouds induce spectral distortions that bias these retrievals beyond the accuracy needed for global CO2 source and sink assessments. This study employs a physics-based linearization approach to represent 3D cloud effects and introduces radiance-level mitigation techniques for actual OCO-2 data, enabling the operational implementation of these corrections. 
 Accurate and continuous measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are essential for climate change research and monitoring of emission reduction efforts. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2 and 3) satellites have been deployed to infer the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mixing ratio (XCO2) from passive spectroscopy, with a designed uncertainty of less than 1 ppm for the regional average. This accuracy is often not met in cloudy regions because clouds in the vicinity of a footprint introduce biases in the XCO2 retrievals. These arise from limitations in the one-dimensional (1D) forward radiative transfer (RT) model, which does not capture the spectral radiance perturbations introduced by clouds adjacent to a clear footprint. Our paper introduces a three-dimensional (3D) RT pipeline to explicitly account for these effects in real-world satellite observations. This is done by ingesting collocated imagery and reanalysis products to calculate the cloud-induced perturbations at the footprint level. To make that computationally feasible, a simple approximation for their spectral dependence is used. The calculated perturbations are then used to reverse (undo) the cloud vicinity effects at the radiance level, at which point the standard 1D OCO-2 retrieval code can be applied without modifications. For two cases over land, we demonstrate that this approach indeed reduces the XCO2 anomalies near clouds. We also characterize the dependence of the XCO2 footprint-level bias on the distance from clouds and other key scene parameters, such as surface reflectance. Although this dependence may be specific to cloud type, aerosols, and other factors, we illustrate how it could be parameterized to bypass our physics-based 3D-RT pipeline for use in an operational framework. In the future, we intend to explore this possibility by applying our tool to a variety of scenes over land and ocean."

 We present a comprehensive characterization of the optical properties of various aerosol types based on data collected using a compact dual-wavelength depolarization elastic lidar (532 and 808 nm, CIMEL CE376). This study evaluates the vertical distribution and temporal evolution of aerosols observed in the subtropical North Atlantic region, covering Saharan dust, volcanic aerosols, and fresh and aged wildfire plumes. Measurements were conducted between August 2021 and August 2023, using a modified two-wavelength Klett inversion method to derive the aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficients from CE376 lidar measurements. To assess the performance of the CE376 system, an intercomparison campaign with an MPL-4B lidar (MPLNET) was conducted, with both systems were collocated at the Izaña Atmospheric Research Centre (Canary Islands, Spain). Both instruments depicted the vertical aerosol structure similarly. Discrepancies were primarily attributed to errors in determining the overlap function and depolarization calibration in each instrument, as well as the greater influence of solar background radiation on the CE376 system during daylight. The absolute difference in the volume depolarization ratio (δv) was 0.003, which decreased to 0.002 when only nighttime data were analyzed. The combination of the two channels of the CE376 provided valuable insights into particle linear depolarization (δP), extinction Ångström exponent (EAE (532/808)) and attenuated color ratio (ACR (808/532)). Fresh Saharan dust particles, characterized by large, non-spherical morphology and a well-mixed vertical layer, exhibited the lowest EAE (532/808), the highest ACR (808/532) and δP (532) >0.15. In contrast, smaller particles with quasi-homogeneous morphology were attributed to sulfate aerosols from the early stages of the Cumbre Vieja volcano eruption and aged Canadian wildfire plumes traveling across the Atlantic. These aerosols showed the lowest δP (0.03 for volcanic sulfate and 0.08 for aged wildfire aerosols) and the highest EAE (532/808) (1.5 and 1.2, respectively). Intermediate values of these retrieved parameters were associated with a heterogenous mixture of ash, soot and charred vegetation from fresh local forest wildfires. The retrieved properties underscore the suitability of the CE376 micro-lidar for continuous monitoring and characterization of the temporal and vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols."

Results reveal that nocturnal low-level jets are most frequent in spring and intensify in summer, significantly enhancing turbulence and shear near the surface, particularly at night. Additionally, cloud cover raises the mixing layer height by approximately 100 m at night due to the greenhouse effect but reduces it by up to 200 m in the afternoon. 
 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) dynamics play a critical role in shaping urban atmospheric processes by governing the exchange of energy, momentum, and mass within the lower atmosphere. This study investigates PBL dynamics in Hefei, a city in the western Yangtze River Delta (YRD), using 3 years (June 2019 to June 2022) of Doppler wind lidar data. Seasonal and diurnal variations in key parameters, including wind profiles, shear intensity, turbulent mixing, low-level jets (LLJs), and mixing layer height (MLH), are analyzed. Results show that horizontal wind speeds accelerate more rapidly above 3 km with the predominant westerly winds (270°±15°) in all seasons. The vertical depth of the high-wind zone (>8 m s−1) during the day is found to be generally deeper than at night, particularly in winter. In Hefei, LLJs primarily form at sunset and dissipate by noon, typically at altitudes between 0.5 and 0.6 km throughout the year, except in July. LLJ occurrences are the most frequent in spring (31.7 %), followed by summer (24.7 %), autumn (22.3 %), and winter (21.3 %). Summer LLJs are the most intensified, extending up to 1.5 km. The larger wind gradient below the jets significantly enhances turbulence and shear intensity near the ground at night. The seasonal average MLH peaks between 14:00  and 15:00 UTC+8, reaching approximately 1.2 km in spring and summer. Cloud cover raises MLH by about 100 m at night but decreases it by 200 m at the afternoon peak. This study provides insights into lidar-based PBL dynamics and highlights implications for local standards concerning low-altitude economic activities."

 Using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day–night band (DNB), we examined the feasibility of developing a gridded nighttime aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data set based on the spatial derivative of measured top-of-atmosphere attenuated upwelling artificial lights at night (ALAN) over the US, Middle East, and Indian Subcontinent regions for 2017. We also studied the potential of using NASA's standard operational Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) for estimating the spatial derivatives of surface artificial-light emissions, which is one of the key lower boundary conditions for the retrieval process. The sensitivity of nighttime aerosol retrievals to observing conditions and different methods of estimating the spatial derivative of surface artificial-light emissions were also explored. Root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of ∼ 0.15 and ∼ 0.18 and correlations of ∼ 0.8 and ∼ 0.6 were found between VIIRS nighttime AOT and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) nighttime and daytime data, respectively, suggesting that the proposed gridded nighttime AOT retrievals have reasonable skill levels for potential data assimilation, air quality, and climate studies of significant events. We also found that NASA Black Marble products can be used to estimate the spatial derivative of surface artificial-light emissions for nighttime AOT retrievals over regions that are not frequently contaminated by aerosol plumes, such as the USA. This study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing a gridded nighttime AOT data, using artificial lights, for monitoring of nighttime aerosol events over large spatial and temporal domains. Given the deployment of VIIRS instruments (currently in orbit and forthcoming) aboard the NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series satellites, this study can be viewed as a precursor for gridded nighttime AOT retrievals at both regional and global scales in the future. We also show that the use of the NASA Black Marble products, which would greatly save the processing time of this method, is challenging over regions with frequent aerosol pollution, such as the Indian Subcontinent, and further exploration is required."

In this study, we examine ground‐ and ship‐based remote sensing observations from two Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) field campaigns conducted in the high‐latitude regions of Northern and Southern Hemispheres (NH and SH). A comparison of macrophysical properties for low, mid‐level, high, and deep clouds shows that the cloud top heights and thickness values are higher in the Arctic for each cloud type compared with the Southern Ocean and Antarctic regions, possibly due to higher sea surface temperatures in the north Atlantic. The Arctic also shows lower ice phase occurrence frequencies compared with the SH high latitudes for low clouds. For high, mid‐level and deep clouds, the cloud phase distributions as a function of temperature show small geographical variabilities. The observations are then compared with the Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to evaluate the representations of these cloud properties. The results show that the model captures cloud base and top heights well and reproduces the differences in cloud macrophysical properties between the two hemispheres. But the model underestimates ice phase frequencies for all cloud types. Such model cloud phase bias is strongly correlated with positive relative humidity biases and negative aerosol number concentration biases, indicating an important role of relative humidity and aerosols in modulating cloud phase partitioning in the model."

This study presents the first spatial and temporal distributions of total ozone columns (TOC) retrieved from the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), on board China's FengYun‐4B satellite (FY‐4B/GIIRS) launched in 2021. Particularly, we focus on the variations of TOCs in East Asia from diurnal to seasonal time scales. Retrievals are implemented using spectra from March, June, September, and December, representing different seasons. The results show that the degree of freedom for the signal (DOFS) typically exhibited a range of 0.8–1.4, with the vertical detection sensitivity of GIIRS peaking in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) region, where the ozone variability is the highest. Collocation comparisons with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) retrievals, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements, the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) simulations, and in situ ozone observations show good agreement. The comparisons of TOCs between GIIRS, Pandora and ERA5 at different latitudes and different time scales demonstrate the ability of FY‐4B/GIIRS in capturing the temporal and latitudinal ozone variations, particularly at middle and high latitudes.

However, it is crucial to differentiate atmospheric BC into char and soot subgroups, given their significant disparities in physicochemical properties and potential impacts. We first conducted a comparative study of char/soot in PM10 and rainwater, collected over a year in urban Guangzhou, China. The mean char/soot ratio in PM10 (∼2.5) is obviously higher than that in rainwater (∼0.8), corresponding to higher wet scavenging efficiency of soot. Through sequence rainwater sampling during individual rainfall events, we further distinguished the contributions of in‐cloud and below‐cloud scavenging, with in‐cloud scavenging predominantly contributed to the distinct difference between char and soot. Such a distinct wet scavenging behavior of char and soot would have substantial implications for the atmospheric behavior of BC, which should be considered in future models for accurate evaluation of its lifetime and climate impact."

This study employs the GEOS-Chem model to analyze different aerosol heterogeneous uptake coefficients (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4) and their effects on photochemical ozone levels across global regions under future Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios. Lower uptake coefficients lead to an increase in the concentration of radical species like HO2 and reduce the extent of aerosol-inhibited regime (AIR) in regions such as India and East Asia which are currently within AIR, leading to a notable increase in surface ozone (40–50%), particularly during colder months. Projections for 2046 indicate a global reduction in AIR, resulting from stricter emission controls. By 2096, the extent of AIR further diminishes, with regions like Southeast Asia transitioning to NOx-limited conditions, though aerosol uptake of HO2 continues to elevate surface ozone levels by 10–15% in heavily aerosol-loaded areas."

Among others, time, city, PM2.5, and O3 were identified as the primary influencing factors of ATI, exhibiting complex nonlinear relationships in real-world environments. The unique variation patterns of breath-borne NO and H2O2 from rats indicated the time-resolved impacts of ground human activities on weekends and PM components on air toxicity.

 Data assimilation (DA), as an indispensable component within contemporary Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, plays a crucial role in generating the analysis that significantly impacts forecast performance. Nevertheless, developing an efficient DA system poses significant challenges, particularly in establishing intricate relationships between the background field and the vast amount of multi-source observation data within limited operational time windows. Recently, Deep learning-based (DL-based) weather forecast models have shown promise in matching, even surpassing, the leading operational NWP models worldwide. This success motivates the exploration of establishing DL-based DA frameworks. DL models possess multi-modal modeling capabilities, enabling the fusion of multi-source data in the feature space, which is very similar to the process of assimilating multi-source observational data in DA systems.

 The hydroxyl radical controls the removal of many trace gases in the atmosphere and initiates the production of secondary pollutants such as ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosols. An accurate understanding of the chemistry of this radical is important to understand the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere and to develop effective control strategies. A previous assessment found that in some regions, measurements of the hydroxyl radical were up to ten times greater than predicted, suggesting an unknown chemical mechanism was responsible. However, recent measurements have revealed interferences associated with some instruments. Here we show that accounting for interferences results in measured hydroxyl radical concentrations that agree with model predictions over a wide range of conditions. This suggests that while there may be gaps in our knowledge of this chemistry in some environments, our understanding of hydroxyl radical chemistry and the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere is better than previously believed.

 Air pollution remains a major problem in many parts of California, significantly impacting public health and regional climate. However, the contribution of anthropogenic dust from agricultural sources, among major pollutants in California’s semi-arid Central Valley, remains largely unclear. Here, we used the Cropland Data Layer from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify crop types and land use/cover and leveraged satellite-derived estimates of major dust events between 2008 and 2022 over California. We identified fallowed land—an unplanted agricultural land parcel—as a key anthropogenic dust source in California. Specifically, we find that the Central Valley accounts for about 77% of total fallowed land areas in California, where they are associated with about 88% of major anthropogenic dust events. We also find that the geographic coverage of these fallowed lands expanded between 2008 and 2022 with associated increasing anthropogenic dust activities. Additionally, these anthropogenic dust activities are sensitive to the drought severity over the fallowed lands, with potential cumulative effects on downstream dust burden during prolonged multi-year drought conditions. Overall, our results have important implications for public health, including increased risk for Valley fever and for regional climates, such as increases in extreme precipitation and snowmelt over the Sierra Nevada.

Sielmann,ESA's Aeolus Mission Reveals Uncertainties in Tropical Wind and Wave‐Driven Circulations,"The recent European Space Agency Aeolus mission provided global coverage of horizontal line‐of‐sight (HLOS) wind profiles. Using observing system experiments with HLOS winds in the ECMWF data assimilation system, we quantify the effects of HLOS winds on wave circulation and the mean zonal state in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) in relation to the background shear. Despite large observation random errors, the assimilation of HLOS winds produced substantial effects on Kelvin and n=1 $n=1$ Rossby wave zonal winds, and, through 4D‐Var, on mixed Rossby‐gravity waves. The effects are asymmetric in easterlies and westerlies, consistent with the background shear. The largest analysis differences due to HLOS winds occurred during the 2019/2020 disruption of the quasi‐biennial oscillation. The results highlight the importance of observing shear zones within the UTLS for reducing tropical analysis uncertainties."

Implications for Climate Research,"This study addresses the longstanding question of the reliability of gridded visible/infrared satellite cloud properties in partially cloudy scenes. By using in‐situ cloud probes and airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) observations, we analyze bias changes in satellite retrievals from the Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra‐Red Imager (SEVIRI) geostationary sensor during the ORACLES campaign. Biases in cloud optical depth (τ) and droplet effective radius (re) modestly change for cloud area fraction greater than 35%. The agreement between SEVIRI and RSP re substantially improves when the retrievals are averaged after removing pixels with τ < 3.0, yielding biases indistinguishable from overcast scenes. In addition, satellite and RSP show an excellent agreement for closed‐ and open‐cell stratocumulus clouds, showing that the satellite retrievals capture spatial changes of re, and confirming that satellites can faithfully reproduce real physical features for optically thick and partially cloudy scenes. We demonstrate that a simple methodology can minimize uncertainties in satellite‐based climate studies."

 This work presents an experimental and computational study of the ozonolysis of allyl methyl sulfide (H2C=CHCH2SCH3, AMS) and allyl ethyl sulfide (H2C=CHCH2SCH2CH3, AES) in the gas phase at atmospheric conditions. The experiments were carried out using carbon monoxide (CO) as scavengers of nascent OH radicals. The main products of the reaction with O3 from AMS and AES were identified and quantified by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The yields of the SO2, formaldehyde and formic acid products found were (26 ± 1) %, (62 ± 1) % and (7 ± 1) % for the AMS/CO/O3 reaction, and (19 ± 1) %, (62 ± 1) % and (8 ± 1) % for the AES/CO/O3 reaction, respectively. Besides those products, acrolein was also identified when the OH radical scavenger was absent. In this case, the yields obtained were (37 ± 1) %, (6 ± 1) %, (63 ± 1) % and (4 ± 1) % in the AMS/O3 mixture, and (28 ± 1) %, (5 ± 1) %, (41 ± 1) % and (4 ± 1) % in the AES/O3 mixture, for SO2, acrolein, formaldehyde and formic acid, respectively. A small difference in product yields in the presence of CO could be attributed to secondary reactions with OH radicals.DFT and post-Hartree-Fock composite computational chemistry calculations of reactants, transition states and products in the reaction paths were used to lend support to the experimental findings for the AMS + O3 reaction. The calculated rate coefficients obtained in this work are in close agreement with the experimental data, with the ωB97X-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVTZ and ωB97X-V/aug-cc-pVTZ as the most accurate and reliable DFT methods. The inclusion of the SVECV-f12 protocol on top of those DFT calculations markedly improves the accuracy of the results. Atmospheric implications are discussed in terms of significant POCP and AP of sulfides and its products obtained."

Fong,"Identifying surface sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring gaps in Saint John, Canada with land use regression and hot spot mapping","•We employed a two-stage modelling approach for estimating surface SO2in Saint John. •Model-derived SO2hot spots helped identify areas for additional air monitoring. •Increased SO2monitoring is needed in the northern and eastern parts of Saint John. •Wind-related variables and temporal lags of surface SO2greatly impacted the result. 
 Saint John experiences ambient sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution due to a high density of industrial activities. Despite recent reduction in SO2 emissions, over 90 % of the provincial exceedances of air pollutants were related to SO2 or total reduced sulphur (TRS), and over 70 % among which occurred in Saint John. Pinpointing intra-urban SO2 hot spots is important for revealing the neighborhoods exposed to high health risk. However, this is challenging due to limited spatial coverage of monitoring. To fill the monitoring gap, we developed two-stage gradient boosting models combining a classifier that discerned between SO2-free and SO2-polluted days and a regressor that estimated daily SO2 levels based on remote sensing data. With a 10-fold cross-validation, the classifier achieved 83 % accuracy and the regressors attained R2 of 0.46 and 0.44 for daily mean and maximum SO2 respectively. Based on model outputs, we conducted spatial hot spot analysis and found high SO2 levels spread to northeast, north, and southeast Saint John, where SO2 monitoring was absent. Several existing monitoring sites in west Saint John do not have SO2 regularly measured. Besides the spatiotemporal lags of nearby monitored SO2, wind-related variables such as wind speed and direction had high importance in predicting surface SO2, which might suggest potential impacts to remote unmonitored communities from the transport of SO2. In summary, our findings suggest that certain unmonitored areas in Saint John may experience high SO2 levels. Expansion of monitoring efforts would help inform where and when mitigation should be taken to minimize SO2-related health impacts."

 Understanding aerosol composition is essential for identifying sources and assessing impacts. We analyzed the chemical profile of 100 24-hour PM2.5 samples and used this data for mass reconstruction and source apportionment. Samples were collected between April 2019 and March 2020 at a site located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 4.2 μg m−3 to 51.4 μg m−3, with a mean of 17.5 μg m−3, and maxima during biomass burning (BB) events. Samples were classified according to the presence or absence of BB events affecting the area, and mass reconstruction was performed. Optimal OM/OC ratios were determined to be 2.5 (BB-samples) and 1.9 (non-BB samples), being OM ∼  65% and ∼  54%, respectively. On average, other components accounted for ∼  14% geological minerals > ∼  10% inorganic ions > ∼  6% elemental carbon > ∼  3% sea salt > ∼  2% non crustal K. Source contributions were further studied using Positive Matrix Factorization. Open biomass burning was the main contributor to PM2.5 (28.4%) and total carbon (25.7%), highlighting the significance of long-range pollutant transport. The temporal variability of this factor aligns with fire events identified using fire location, back-trajectory analysis, and aerosol classification schemes. The remaining factors found were: SOA + soil + road dust (17.7%), mobile sources powered by low sulfur (15.8%) and high sulfur fuels (11.1%), construction + grills (12.1%), agriculture (9.3%) and thermal power plants + industry (5.6%).

 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as a principal air pollutant, stands as one of the key indicators in atmospheric quality monitoring. The spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 concentration in Madrid and Valencia during 2013–2022 were obtained from satellite-derived PM2.5 products and ground-based measurements. The peak PM2.5 concentrations occurred in July, August and December in Madrid, showing a geographical trend of hotspots in the southeast and coldspots in the northwest. Similarly, the highest PM2.5 concentration in Valencia was observed in December and summer months (June–August), with hotspots appearing along the coastline. At diurnal and monthly scales, PM2.5 concentrations in Madrid positively correlated with air temperature (AT); the results of feature importance using XGBOOST-SHAP model reveal that high temperature-humidity enhances PM2.5 at seasonal scale, while high wind speed (WS) weakens it. Therefore, to mitigate elevated PM2.5 levels during summer and winter in Madrid, strategies should focus on increasing green spaces and pervious pavement. Additionally, since Valencia experiences the peak PM2.5 during spring and winter, requiring measures of reducing emission. Moreover, excessive humidity contributes the most to PM2.5 accumulation in Valencia. For both cities, potential urban ventilation corridors during winter align along southwest-northeast direction, which could serve as an effective strategy to facilitate the dispersion of PM2.5."
