10.1088/1748-9326/addfed,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注一种新型建筑材料CarbonFiberStone (CFS)，以及它在建筑应用中的碳足迹。论文通过生命周期评估和技术经济分析，将CFS与传统钢筋混凝土进行比较，结果表明CFS墙体可以实现净负碳排放，并且成本与传统建筑材料相似。因此，该研究主要关注可持续建筑材料和碳减排，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['carbon sequestration', 'carbon footprint', 'life cycle assessment', 'sustainable building materials', 'biochar', 'carbon negative']",Friedrich J Bohn;Uwe Arnold;Ömer Bucak;Erik Frank;Leonie Schrafstetter;Kolja Kuse,CarbonFiberStone: a new carbon negative and cost-effective alternative to conventional building materials by fusing three different CDR technologies,"Unprecedented urbanization has led to a sharp increase in the world’s building stock, increasing material consumption and environmental impact. This study introduces CarbonFiberStone (CFS), a novel lightweight construction material, and assesses its carbon footprint in a specific building application. CFS is defined as a millimeter-thin bio-based carbon fiber fabric bonded to compression-resistant stone slabs using an adhesive. CFS is extremely resistant to compression and tension. The resulting stone powder from the stone cutting process is used for enhanced rock weathering. The wall element presented here incorporates a layer of biochar for insulation purposes. Using life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, we compare five CFS-based building blocks with two conventional reinforced concrete blocks in single and multi-story residential buildings. The results show that CFS walls achieve a net carbon negative balance of −56.86–65.32 kg CO2eq m−2, sequestering 0.10–0.15 t CO2 per square meter of living space at similar costs to conventional construction with reinforced concrete. These results show that CFS has the potential to become a viable, sustainable alternative to conventional building materials and thus has the potential to make a significant contribution to the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement."

We focused on the supply of three ES in an Alpine river, namely habitat provision, recreational activities, and hydroelectricity production from run-of-the-river (RoR) power plants. We applied an integrated hydrological, hydraulic and habitat modeling approach to quantify the effects of climate change (CC) on these services, based on the outcomes of four regional climate models. The paper investigated the effects of water use policies such as the introduction of prescriptions for environmental flow (EF) under the same CC models. We observed that CC significantly affects the river suitability for the supply of ES at the catchment scale, while the introduction of EF releases are relevant at a more local scales (several reaches). Under future scenarios, simulated increasing abstractions for hydroelectricity production from RoR power plants have a stronger effect on white-water rafting and a relatively smaller effect on fish habitat. Quantifying the potential effects of CC and of different strategies of river flow management under these scenarios is a promising approach to support the design of long-term water resources management strategies at catchment and local level."

However, dynamical models for the Indian Ocean often exhibit significant biases compared to historic tide gauge (TG) based sea level records, highlighting the need for improved methods. To address this gap, we applied a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning network to reconstruct hourly storm surges across 29 TG locations along the Indian Ocean coastlines for the period 1979–2021. Our results demonstrate the robust performance of the LSTM model, which outperforms existing global surge reconstructions by realistically capturing storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and extreme conditions. We extended this approach to generate future projections of ESL for the Indian Ocean, which has been lacking for the densely populated coastline. The ESL projections are generated by integrating storm surges predicted via LSTM with bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) predictors, tide data from hydrodynamic models, and mean sea level (MSL) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report (AR6). The findings reveal that future ESL changes will be predominantly driven by MSL rise, with contributions from tides and storm surges accounting for approximately 10%. Notably, the analysis indicates a rapid emergence of ESL events in the Indian Ocean. By 2030–2040, equatorial islands will experience the one-in-a-hundred-year ESL (ESL100) annually, and the Arabian Sea coastline and the south subtropical regions by 2050 under a high-emission scenario. The findings underscore the urgent need to implement adaptive measures to safeguard vulnerable coastal populations."

Revealing the impacts of LCC on climate extremes helps to improve risk assessment capability and provides targeted adaptation and mitigation strategies to enhance regional climate resilience. In this study, we parameterized remotely-sensed land cover maps into the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to examine the biogeophysical effects of LCC on temperature and precipitation extremes in the Arctic–Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) core domain, where the contribution of substantial LCC to abnormal climate variations has been little explored. Results showed that LCC had varying degrees of impact on regional climate extremes. Alteration in surface albedo induced net radiation changes, which further resulted in variation in maximum temperature (Tmax), with ice days (ID) and warm spell duration index (WSDI) increased by more than 3 days, and the maximum value of daily maximum temperature (TXx) decreased by more than 0.6 °C. The LCC-induced combined effects of water vapor supply and atmospheric dynamics resulted in a decreasing trend in precipitation extreme, with the number of days with precipitation exceeding 10 mm (R10mm) and annual total precipitation in days with precipitation exceeding 1 mm (PRCPTOT) decreased by more than 3 days and 15 mm, respectively, while consecutive dry days (CDD) increased by more than 3 days. These findings highlight the importance of LCC for regional climate variability in the Arctic and Boreal regions, contribute to a better understanding of LCC-climate interactions."

Using machine learning, we filled data gaps and introduced a new approach to analyze EC trends. Our findings reveal a significant decline in EC due to stricter pollution controls, though this slowed after 2020. This study provides a versatile framework for addressing data gaps and supports strategies to reduce urban air pollution and its climate impacts. 
 Ground-based measurements of elemental carbon (EC) – classified under thermal–optical methods and considered a surrogate for black carbon – are essential for assessing air quality and evaluating climate impacts. However, data gaps caused by technical challenges impede comprehensive analyses of long-term trends. This study proposed an ensemble learning modeling method to address these challenges. The model used readily accessible ground observation air pollutant data as proxies for EC-related tracers, along with meteorological parameters, to enhance prediction accuracy. It integrated outputs from Gradient Boosting Regression Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and random forest models, combining them through ridge regression to produce robust predictions. We applied this approach to reconstruct hourly EC concentrations from 2013–2023 for four cities in eastern China, filling 45 %–79 % of missing data and improving prediction performance by 8 %–17 % compared to individual models. Over the 11-year period, EC exhibited an overall decline (−0.20 to -0.14µgm-3a-1), with a more significant decrease from 2013–2020 (−0.24 to -0.15µgm-3a-1). During this time, the average EC concentration in the four cities dropped from 3.26 to 1.59 µg m−3, followed by a noticeable slowdown in the rate of decline from 2020–2023 (−0.12 to -0.04µgm-3a-1). Additionally, a fixed emission approximation method based on ensemble learning was proposed to quantitatively analyze the drivers of long-term EC trends. The analysis revealed that anthropogenic emission controls were the predominant contributors, accounting for approximately 92 % of the changes in EC trends from 2013–2020.  However, their influence weakened post-2020, contributing approximately 80 %. These findings highlighted that while China's Clean Air Actions implemented since 2013 have substantially reduced black carbon concentrations, sustained and enhanced strategies are still necessary to further mitigate black carbon pollution."

However, most O3 formation analysis based on the box model (OBM) does not include any OVOC constraint. To access the interference of OVOCs with O3 simulation, this study presents results from a field campaign and OBM analysis. Our results indicate that no OVOC constraint in the OBM can lead to overestimation of OVOCs, free radicals, and O3. 
 Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), an important subgroup of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are emitted directly or formed secondarily through photochemical processes. They play a crucial role in tropospheric chemistry as ozone (O3) precursors. However, due to measurement limitations, the influence of OVOCs on O3 formation has often been underestimated. In this study, 74 VOCs (including 18 OVOCs) were measured at five representative stations (urban, suburban, industrial, upwind, and downwind stations) in Zibo, an industrial city in the North China Plain. The VOCs level in Zibo (44.6 ± 20.9 × 10−9) is in the upper-middle range (> 32 × 10−9) compared to previous studies conducted in most Chinese cities, with OVOCs contributing for 30.0 %–37.8 %. The average O3 formation potential in Zibo is 410.4 ± 197.2 µg m−3, with OVOCs being the dominant contributor (31.5 %–55.9 %). An observation-based model (OBM) was used to access the contributions of chemical production (RNetProd) and emissions/transport (REmis&Trans) to individual OVOCs. Daytime (08:00–18:00 LT) RNetProd is highest at the urban site (5.9 × 10−9 h−1), while nighttime REmis&Trans is most negative at the industrial site (0.76 × 10−9 h−1). Simulations without OVOC constraint overestimate OVOCs (42.1 %–126.5 %) and key free radicals (e.g., hydroperoxy radicals (HO2, 5.3 %–20.4 %) and organic peroxy radicals (RO2, 6.6 %–35.1 %)), leading to a 1.8 %–11.9 % O3 overestimation. This overestimation causes an underestimation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) (1.8 %–20.9 %) and atmospheric oxidizing capacity (3.5 %–12.5 %). These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive OVOC measurements to constrain numerical models, especially in regions with dense anthropogenic emissions, to better reproduce atmospheric photochemistry, and to formulate more effective air pollution control strategies."

Based on the simulation results, we successfully employed neural networks to predict particle charge states and estimate ion-induced nucleation rates. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of particle charging and introduces advanced methods for evaluating ion-induced nucleation in atmospheric research. 
 The charge state of atmospheric new particles is controlled by both their initial charge state upon formation and subsequent interaction with atmospheric ions. By measuring the charge state of growing particles, the fraction of ion-induced nucleation (FIIN) within total new particle formation (NPF) can be inferred, which is critical for understanding NPF mechanisms. However, existing theoretical approaches for predicting particle charge states suffer from inaccuracies due to simplifying assumptions; hence their ability to infer FIIN is sometimes limited. Here we develop a numerical model to explicitly simulate the charging dynamics of new particles. Our simulations demonstrate that both particle growth rate and ion concentration substantially influence the particle charge state, while ion–ion recombination becomes important when the charged particle concentrations are high. Leveraging a large set of simulations, we constructed two regression models using residual neural networks. The first model (ResFWD) predicts the charge state of growing particles with known FIIN values, while the second model (ResBWD) operates in reverse to estimate FIIN based on the charge fraction of particles at prescribed sizes. Good agreement between the regression models and benchmark simulations demonstrates the potential of our approach for analyzing ion-induced nucleation events. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that ResFWD and the benchmark simulations exhibit similar sensitivity to noises in the input parameters, but the robustness of the ResBWD simulations depends on retention of initial particle charge state at the prescribed sizes. Our study provides insights into charging dynamics of atmospheric new particles and introduces a new method for assessing ion-induced nucleation rates."

The findings were obtained through observations made during two flights of the Clouds-Atmospheric Dynamics-Dust Interactions in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign and a convection-permitting simulation run with the Meso-NH model. They provide new insights into the complex dynamics of cyclogenesis in the Cabo Verde region and challenge the existing model of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). 
 The role of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) in Cabo Verde cyclogenesis remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the inhibiting factors leading to the failed cyclogenesis of mesoscale convective system (MCS) Pierre Henri observed during two flights of the Clouds-Atmospheric Dynamics-Dust Interactions in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign. We use CADDIWA data and a convection-permitting simulation run with the Meso-NH model. We show that the African easterly wave in which MCS Pierre Henri is embedded forms a region of cyclonic recirculation that is relatively protected from lateral intrusions, called a marsupial pouch, which keeps the SAL away from the MCS. By contrast, a dusty, dry, and warm air layer between 0.8 and 2 km altitude, called the Saharan trade wind layer (STWL), penetrates into the convective core of MCS Pierre Henri, increasing the convective inhibition (CIN) area and contributing up to 40 % of the CIN area during the MCS' mature phase. The cold pools produced by convection also increase the CIN area and contribute up to 50 % of this area after the MCS' intense phase. Upper-tropospheric dry air, with relative humidity below 15 % between 7 and 11 km altitude, gradually penetrates into the 150 km circle around the MCS, reaching 18 % of the area during its dissipation phase and preventing the MCS' anvil expansion. The inhibiting roles of the STWL, cold pools, and upper-tropospheric dry air in leading the cyclogenesis fail to provide new insights into the complex dynamics of cyclogenesis in the Cabo Verde region and challenge the existing model of the SAL."

Patra;Sachiko Hayashida,Impact of post-monsoon crop residue burning on PM2.5 over northern India: optimizing emissions using a high-density in situ surface observation network,"Air pollution in Delhi during the post-monsoon period is severe, and association with intensive crop residue burning (CRB) over Punjab state has attracted attention. However, the relationship has been unclear as the CRB emissions conventionally derived from satellites were underestimated due to clouds or thick smoke/haze over the region. We evaluated the impact of CRB on PM2.5 to be about 50 %, based on a combination of numerical modeling and an observation network using low-cost sensors we installed. 
 The impact of post-monsoon crop residue burning (CRB) on surface PM2.5 concentrations over the Punjab–Haryana–Delhi (PHD) region in northern India was investigated using a regional meteorology–chemistry model, NHM(WRF)-Chem, and a high-density in situ surface observation network comprising Compact and Useful PM2.5 Instrument with Gas Sensors (CUPI-G) stations. We optimized CRB emissions from 1 to 15 November 2022 using the model and surface PM2.5 observational data. The CUPI-G data from Punjab were found to be crucial for CRB emission optimization, as the CRB emissions in northern India in October and November are predominantly originating from Punjab, accounting for 80 % of the CRB emissions. The new emission inventory is referred to as OFEv1.0, with 12 h time resolution, in daytime (05:30–17:30 IST) and nighttime (17:30–05:30 IST). The total emissions in OFEv1.0, such as PM2.5, CO, organic carbon, and black carbon, were consistent with previous studies. OFEv1.0 substantially increased emissions relative to those calculated from satellite fire observation data (prior emissions). We showed that the prior PM2.5 emissions were underestimated by approximately 8.6 times in the period 1–15 November 2022 and sometimes obscured completely due to clouds or thick smoke/haze on 8 and 10 November 2022. Large differences in optimized daytime and nighttime emissions indicated the importance of diurnal variations. Daytime emissions were larger than nighttime emissions on some days but not on others, indicating that diurnal variation shape may have differed each day. The mean contribution of CRB to surface PM2.5 over PHD was 30 %–34 %, which increased to 50 %–56 % during plume events that transported pollutants from Punjab to Haryana and to Delhi. Due to insufficient performance of the meteorological model simulation on 8 and 9 November 2022 and the lack of measurement sites on the southern side of Punjab, emission optimization was not successful in the case of increased PM2.5 concentrations observed in Haryana on these days."

 A new modular multi-sensor aerological dropsonde system for high and fast-flying research aircraft has been developed for studying atmospheric processes. This new system allows us to drop release containers with up to four sondes inside,  and data from up to 30 sondes can be transmitted simultaneously. After separation from the release container, the sondes enable high-resolution spatio-temporal profiling of temperature, humidity, and pressure with a time resolution of 1.12 s and wind of 1 s, corresponding to approximately 10 m vertical resolution. The modular design ensures simple integration of additional sensors without extensive flight tests and recertification for e.g. particle measurements and radioactivity.The standard meteorological sonde comprises sensor elements of a commercial Graw DFM-17 radiosonde, a 400 to 406 MHz band communication link to the aircraft, and an optional satellite communication module. By means of the satellite link, the data can be made available worldwide in near-real time, and data loss is avoided when the dropping aircraft leaves the telemetry range.The main feature of the new system is the release container, which allows for dropping through standard dropsonde dispensers of both mid-size turbo-prop aircraft (e.g. Dornier Do 128-6) and jet aircraft (e.g. the Gulfstream 550 “High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft” HALO). The release container ensures safe separation from the aircraft and protects its payload during deceleration from aircraft speed to fall speed before the sondes are released by an electro-mechanical mechanism. Operations in different campaigns have confirmed the reliability of the entire system and the quality of acquired data. Feasibility of the technical and operational approach for targeted observations of a mesoscale convective system in Argentina was demonstrated by HALO measurements during the SouthTRAC (TRAnsport and Composition of the southern hemisphere UTLS (upper troposphere–lower stratosphere) campaign) campaign. Moreover, a configuration consisting of a meteorological sonde coupled with an optical counter for particle sizing was tested during a Saharan dust episode over Germany using a Dornier Do 128-6 aircraft. Secondly, a meteorological sonde together with a radioactivity sensor was successfully dropped from a Learjet 35A."

Sica,Retrieval of bulk hygroscopicity from PurpleAir PM2.5 sensor measurements,"PurpleAir sensors provide a low-cost way to monitor air quality, with over 30 000 sensors available worldwide. However, their measurements require calibration with trusted data for accuracy. Our new technique builds on previous calibration methods by also enabling the measurement of a quantity related to how pollutants grow with humidity. Mapping this new quantity will improve air quality forecasting. 
 PurpleAir sensors offer a unique opportunity for a large-scale and densely populated array of sensors to study surface air quality. While  PurpleAir sensors are inexpensive and abundant, they must be corrected to better agree with validated coincident measurements from more sophisticated instrumentation. Traditionally, this  correction is performed using statistical methods. We propose a method to both correct  PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements and allow for an estimate of the hygroscopic growth of aerosols, using a novel correction approach based on the optimal estimation method (OEM). The hygroscopic growth of  aerosols can be retrieved using the sensitivity of the correction to water activity, which influences the measured size distribution of the aerosols. By employing the physically based  correction using calibrated measurements from the nearby Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks air quality site, the average daily mean absolute error (MAE) of the PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements is decreased from 5.58 to 1.68 µg m−3, and the average daily bias decreases from 4.75 to −0.23 µg m−3. This improvement in the correction is comparable to that seen using conventional statistical methodologies. Our OEM retrieval also allowed us to estimate seasonal bulk hygroscopicity values ranging from 0.33 to 0.40. These values are consistent with the accepted ranges of bulk hygroscopicity for atmospheric particulate matter (0.1 to 0.9) determined in previous studies using calibrated air quality measurement instruments, which suggests that our method allows a new aerosol product to be determined from a large sensor network."

Here, we detail a novel approach involving data weighting to improve quantification of these peak values. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied data weighting to carbon monoxide, methane, and volatile organic compound sensor data. This work broadens our ability to use air sensors in contexts where accurate quantification of peak concentrations is essential. 
 Traditional calibration models for low-cost air quality sensors have demonstrated a tendency to underpredict peak concentrations. We assessed the utility of adding data weights to low-cost sensor colocation data to improve the quantification of peak concentrations when the majority of colocation data is at a baseline concentration and varies due to intermittent, transient events. Specifically, we explore the effects of data weighting on three different pollutant colocation datasets: total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4). Leveraging two different weighting functions, a sigmoidal and a piecewise weighting regime, we explored the impacts of the base model choice (multilinear regression, MLR, vs. random forest, RF, models), the sensitivity of weighting functions, and the ability of data weighting to improve high-concentration pollution measurements. When compared to unweighted colocation data, we demonstrate significant reductions in both error (root mean square error, RMSE) and bias (mean bias error, MBE) for pollutant peaks across all three datasets when data weighting is employed. For the top percentile of data, we observe an average of 23 % reduction in RMSE and a 35 % reduction in MBE when optimal weights are employed. More significant reductions occurred in the 95th–99th percentile of data, where MBE was reduced by an average of 70 %. RMSE in the 95th-99th percentile was reduced by an average of 26 %. However, data weighting can also generate larger errors at baseline pollutant concentrations. Data weighting regimes were sensitive to input parameters, and input weighting functions may be tuned to better predict peak concentration data without significant reductions in the fidelity of baseline pollutant predictions."

The results from 47 sites in China show the best correlation over 0.9 concerning the radiosonde measurements. This validates the relative humidity (RH) accuracy with various data integrations. Three representative sites present the different seasonal characteristics, indicating the geographic and height influences on the RH vertical distribution. 
 Precise continuous measurements of relative humidity (RH) vertical profiles in the troposphere have emerged as a considerable scientific issue. In recent years, a combination of diverse ground-based remote sensing devices has effectively facilitated RH vertical profiling.  This work introduces a newly developed approach for obtaining continuous RH profiles by integrating data from a Raman lidar, a microwave radiometer (MWR), and satellite sources. RH profiles obtained using synergistic approaches are subsequently compared with radiosonde data throughout a 5-month observational study in China. Our suggested method for RH profiling demonstrates optimal concordance with the best correction coefficients R of 0.94 in Huhehaote (HHHT), 0.92 in Yibin (YB), and 0.93 in Qingyuan (QY). The mean value of RH decreased with height and presented seasonal characteristics in QY. Finally, the RH height–time evolution was used to distinguish hail and heavy precipitation.

The key contribution is the identification of critical hydrodynamic processes – ice transport, heat advection, and shear-driven turbulence production – that influence lake thermal structure and ice cover and explain the superior performance of 3D lake models to their 1D counterparts. 
 The Laurentian Great Lakes significantly influence the climate of the Midwest and Northeast United States due to their vast thermal inertia, moisture source potential, and complex heat and moisture flux dynamics. This study presents a newly developed coupled lake–ice–atmosphere (CLIAv1) modeling system for the Great Lakes by coupling the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) regional climate model (RCM) with the three-dimensional (3D) Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) and investigates the impact of coupled dynamics on simulations of the Great Lakes' winter climate. By integrating 3D lake hydrodynamics, CLIAv1 demonstrates superior performance in reproducing observed lake surface temperatures (LSTs), ice cover distribution, and the vertical thermal structure of the Great Lakes compared to the NU-WRF model coupled with the default 1D Lake Ice Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS). CLIAv1 also enhances the simulation of over-lake atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, wind speed, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, underscoring the importance of resolving complex lake dynamics for reliable regional Earth system projections. More importantly, the key contribution of this study is the identification of critical physical processes that influence lake thermal structure and ice cover – processes that are missed by 1D lake models but effectively resolved by 3D lake models. Through process-oriented numerical experiments, we identify key 3D hydrodynamic processes – ice transport, heat advection, and shear production in turbulence – that explain the superiority of 3D lake models to 1D lake models, particularly in cold season performance and lake–atmosphere interactions. Critically, all three of these processes are dynamically linked to water currents – spatially and temporally evolving flow fields that are structurally absent in 1D models. This study aims to advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie the fundamental differences between 3D and 1D lake models in simulating key hydrodynamic processes during the winter season, and it offers generalized insights that are not constrained by specific model configurations."

Wendt,DECIPHeR-GW v1: a coupled hydrological model with improved representation of surface–groundwater interactions,"Groundwater is vital for people and ecosystems, but most physical models lack the representation of surface–groundwater interactions, leading to inaccurate streamflow predictions in groundwater-rich areas. This study presents DECIPHeR-GW v1, which links surface and groundwater systems to improve predictions of streamflow and groundwater levels. Tested across England and Wales, DECIPHeR-GW shows high accuracy, especially in southeast England, making it a valuable tool for large-scale water management. 
 Groundwater is a crucial part of the hydrologic cycle and the largest accessible freshwater source for humans and ecosystems. However, most hydrological models lack explicit representation of surface–groundwater interactions, leading to poor prediction performance in groundwater-dominated catchments. This study presents DECIPHeR-GW v1 (Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology and GroundWater), a new surface–groundwater hydrological model that couples a model based on hydrological response units (HRUs) and a two-dimensional gridded groundwater model. Using a two-way coupling method, the groundwater model component receives recharge from HRUs, simulates surface–groundwater interactions, and returns groundwater levels and groundwater discharge to HRUs, where river routing is then performed. Depending on the storage capacity of the surface water model component and the position of the modelled groundwater level, three scenarios are developed to derive recharge and capture surface–groundwater interactions dynamically. Our coupled model was set up at 1 km spatial resolution for the groundwater model, and the average size of the surface water HRUs was 0.31 km2. The coupled model was calibrated and evaluated against daily flow time series from 669 catchments and groundwater level data from 1804 wells across England and Wales. The model provides streamflow simulation with a median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.83 across varying hydro-climates, such as wetter catchments with a maximum mean annual rainfall of 3577 mm yr−1 in the west and drier catchments with a minimum of 562 mm yr−1 in the east of Great Britain, as well as diverse hydrogeological conditions including chalk, sandstone, and limestone. Higher KGE values are found in particular for the drier chalk catchments in southeast England, where the average KGE for streamflow increased from 0.49 in the benchmark DECIPHeR model to 0.7. Furthermore, our model reproduces temporal patterns of the groundwater level time series, with more than half of the wells achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.6 or higher when comparing simulations to observations. Simulating 51 years of daily data for the largest catchment, the Thames at the Kingston River basin (9948 km2), takes approximately 17 h on a standard CPU, facilitating multiple simulations for model calibration and sensitive analysis. Overall, this new DECIPHeR-GW model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency in reproducing streamflow and groundwater levels, making it a valuable tool for addressing water resources and management issues over large domains."

However, most existing magnetopause models cannot capture this time-dependent process, and numerical simulations demand significant computational resources. We have developed the first time-dependent 3D model capable of showing these shield changes. It is significantly more precise and performs nearly instant computations. 
 The interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere is a critical area of research in space weather and space physics. Accurate determination of the magnetopause position is essential for understanding magnetospheric dynamics. While numerous magnetopause models have been developed over past decades, most are time-independent, limiting their ability to elucidate the dynamic movement of the magnetopause under varying solar wind conditions. This study introduces the first time-dependent three-dimensional magnetopause model based on quasi-elastodynamic theory, named the POS (Position–Oscillation–Surface wave) model. Unlike existing time-independent models, the POS model physically reflects the dynamic responses of magnetopause position and shape to time-varying solar wind conditions. The predictive accuracy of the POS model was evaluated using 38 887 observed magnetopause-crossing events. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 0.774 Earth radii (RE, representing a 17.9 % improvement over five widely used magnetopause models. Notably, the POS model demonstrated superior accuracy under highly disturbed solar wind conditions (22.1 % better) and in higher-latitude regions (27.0 % better) and flank regions (33.3 % better) of the magnetopause. The POS model's remarkable accuracy, concise formulation, and fast computational speed enhance our ability to predict magnetopause position and shape in real time. This advancement is significant for understanding the physical mechanisms of space weather phenomena and improving the accuracy of space weather forecasts. Furthermore, this model may provide new insights and methodologies for constructing magnetopause models for other planets."

 In this study, we assess the relevance and utility of several performance indicators (model quality (bias) and model performance (temporal and spatial) indicators), developed within the FAIRMODE framework by evaluating eight Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) models and their ensemble in calculating concentrations of key air pollutants, specifically NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and O3. The models' outputs were compared with observations that were not assimilated into the models. For NO2, the results highlight difficulties in accurately modelling concentrations at traffic stations, with improved performance when these stations are excluded. While all models meet the established criteria for PM2.5, indicators such as bias and winter–summer gradients reveal underlying issues in air quality modelling, questioning the stringency of the current criteria for PM2.5. For PM10, the combination of model quality indicators, bias, and spatial-temporal gradient indicators prove most effective in identifying model weaknesses, suggesting possible areas of improvement.

However, models including chemistry are very slow. Hence, any computation speedup of such models is important for understanding the role of atmospheric chemistry within the Earth system. In this study we analyzed and optimized the time step for chemistry calculations. Our results show that atmospheric models could be run notably faster without any loss in accuracy. 
 Numerical integration of multiphase chemical kinetics in atmospheric models is challenging. The underlying system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is stiff and thus difficult to solve. Rosenbrock solvers are a popular choice for such tasks. These solvers provide the desired stability and accuracy of results at an affordable yet large computational cost. The latter is crucially dependent on the efficiency of the step size control. Our analysis indicates that the local error, which is the key factor for the step size selection, is often overestimated, leading to very small substeps. In this study, we optimized the first-order step size controller most commonly employed in Rosenbrock solvers. Furthermore, we compared its efficiency to a second-order step size controller. We assessed the performance of the controllers in both a box and a global model for very stiff ODEs. Significant reductions in the computation time were accomplished with only marginal deviations in the results compared to the standard first-order controller. This was achieved not only for gas-phase chemistry but also for the more complex aqueous-phase chemistry in cloud droplets and deliquescent aerosols. Depending on the selected chemical mechanism, significant improvements were already achieved by simply adjusting heuristic parameters of the default controller. However, especially for the global model, the best results were achieved with the second-order controller, which reduced the number of function evaluations by 43 %, 27 % and 13 % for gas-phase, cloud and aerosol chemistry, respectively. The overall computational time was reduced by over 11 % while requiring only minimal adjustments to the original code. Analysis of a 1-year integration period showed that with the second-order controller, the deviations from the reference simulation stay below 1 % for the main tropospheric oxidants. The results presented here show the possibility of more efficient atmospheric chemistry simulations without compromising accuracy."

In this study, we conducted a high-throughput assessment of antibiotic resistance development in the model strain Escherichia coli K12 after 50-day exposure to 15 aliphatic DBPs commonly found in drinking water against 8 different classes of antibiotics. The results showed that most treated bacteria developed resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics such as ampicillin and fosfomycin, with resistance levels increasing by 1.16- to 6.39-fold, higher than for other classes of antibiotics. Multidrug resistance was observed in the tribromoacetonitrile (TBAN), bromonitromethane (BNM), and dibromonitromethane (DBNM) groups. DBPs exposure induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damaged the bacterial cell membrane. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed mutations and differential expression in genes related to cell wall synthesis and structure, indicating that exposure to DBPs will influence the bacterial cell wall. Nontargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis further confirmed the cell wall structure alteration by the increased proportion of noncanonical d-amino acids in peptidoglycan, the major component of the cell wall, potentially explaining the observed resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics.

To accomplish this, hydrogen use has been suggested in many industries that currently rely on fossil fuels. Yet, the emissions intensity of hydrogen depends on how it is produced and distributed. Additionally, it is unclear whether hydrogen use leads to a reduction in GHG emissions compared to alternative decarbonization options such as electrification with renewables. Here, we systematically compare the decarbonisation potential of supplying hydrogen to the United Kingdom from a wide range of global supply chains. We do this by assessing 37,000 configurations of the hydrogen supply chain from primary energy production through to end-use. We find that imports of green hydrogen production are unlikely to be compatible with the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard. The maximum mitigation potential is achieved when electrification is prioritized, and hydrogen used only for applications where electrification is not viable. This leads to a reduction of up to 280 Mt CO2e/a across all sectors considered in the UK. In the short term, use of domestic green hydrogen infrastructure should focus on displacing existing gray hydrogen use."

Continuous alterations in the composition of plastisphere microbiomes were observed during incubation, and the successions of plastisphere microbiomes were significantly influenced by the colonization environment, followed by the polymer type and incubation time. The assembly of plastisphere microbiomes was dominated by stochastic processes; however, determinism contributed more to the assembly of plastisphere bacterial communities than to fungal communities, suggesting that the filtering effects of MPs on bacteria were stronger than those on fungi. The microbial communities in plastispheres exhibited networks of lower complexity and stability, as well as lower functional diversity, than the networks within bulk soils. Bacterial communities played a greater role in plastisphere microbial network formation and MP degradation than fungal communities.

The inherent heterogeneity of these systems, along with solute exchange between high- and low-permeability regions, results in anomalous transport, including early solute arrivals and prolonged residence times. A key challenge in studying these processes is the inability to directly observe the subsurface transport mechanisms. To overcome this, we employed etched dolostone cores with controlled geometry in reactive transport experiments and applied positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to directly visualize solute transport. Our findings demonstrate that flow rate significantly influences solute exchange between the conduit and the fracture/matrix. PET imaging and reactive transport experiments reveal distinct solute and mineral precipitate distributions under low- and high-inertia flow conditions. Numerical simulations further highlight the role of fracture aperture in modulating solute exchange and show how higher flow rates induce 3D recirculation zones that enhance local reactivity.

Here, we assessed intestinal ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) during earthworm development (egg, juvenile, and adult) and their influence on soil ARGs and potential pathogens. Our results showed that ARGs and potential pathogens were widespread and varied within earthworm guts at different growth stages. Earthworm guts harbored significantly (p < 0.05) fewer high-risk ARGs than soil, indicating potential roles of earthworms in soil ARG mitigation. Conversely, potential pathogens were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in guts than in soil. We further found that earthworms across life stages increased soil potential pathogens and reinforced ARG-mobile genetic element (MGE)-pathogen linkages in the soil ecosystem.

The mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer offers advantages as a test species due to its asexual reproduction, short life cycle, and high sensitivity to pollutants. However, we identified variability in response sensitivity to pollutants, which may stem from the nutritional composition and growth stage of its primary food source, Navicula spp. diatoms. This study aimed to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of 96 h toxicity tests to sodium chloride with N. triangulifer fed diatoms of varying ages (target concentrations: 329, 494, 741, 1111, 1666, and 2500 mg/L). We tracked Navicula spp. growth stages under controlled conditions and characterized fatty acid and lipid contents at each stage to assess how these factors influence N. triangulifer sensitivity to sodium chloride, a common reference toxicant. Sensitivity increased significantly as the diatom feed aged, highlighting the need for standardized culturing methods to improve test reliability. This study is the first to simultaneously characterize the growth stages and fatty acid profiles of Navicula spp. diatoms as feed species for N. triangulifer.

Anaerobic biotransformation of these chlorinated compounds was observed in microcosms simulating site conditions, particularly when an electron donor was added. To disentangle specific transformation reactions, subcultures from active anaerobic microcosms were enriched with individual DCA or DCNB isomers. In these single-compound enrichment cultures, DCNB isomers were reduced to the corresponding DCA. Each DCA isomer was stoichiometrically dechlorinated to the corresponding monochloroaniline (CA) isomers. Further dechlorination of CA to aniline was noted. The reduction of DCNB to DCA was sustained by known fermenters and possibly Desulfitobacterium, while Dehalobacter was clearly responsible for the dechlorination of DCAs. These findings helped attribute function to the microbial community data retrieved from field samples to improve the conceptual site model and enable the identification of bioactive zones and rate-limiting conditions at a complex site.

However, the key functional taxa and underlying interactive metabolisms remain unclear due to the high complexity of the periphytic microbiome. Here, we employ DNA-stable isotope probing with metagenomic binning analysis to uncover the critical role of intrinsic trophic interactions in stimulating As methylation within the periphyton in association with soil inorganic carbon. Abundance of As-methylating microorganisms in the periphyton increases by 2.1-fold after bicarbonate addition. Members of phototrophs are predominantly responsible for regulating the stability of the periphytic microbiome, of which photoautotrophs (e.g., Oscillatoriales) initiate carbon fixation and constitute a major portion of As-methylating populations. These phototrophs further offer requisite organic substrates such as polysaccharides for heterotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chitinophagales) that in return foster the growth of the periphytic community, while these taxa simultaneously detoxify As through biomethylation to secure their ecological niches in periphyton. Such a symbiotic metabolism between phototrophs and heterotrophs facilitates carbon sequestration and shapes the functional community, collaboratively determining methylated As production in paddy soils. These findings offer new insights into the influence of trophic interactions within the periphyton on As speciation with potential implications for element cycling and soil remediation in paddy soils."

Copper-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as Cu(II)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS), have been utilized for phosphonate degradation via Cu(III)-mediated oxidation. However, Cu(I) (the crucial intermediate for Cu(III) generation) suffers from sluggish Cu(II) reduction. Herein, we synthesized a copper single-atom catalyst supported on zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) to achieve superior PMS activation and phosphonate degradation via an in situ-formed Zr-phosphonate surface complex. Cu–ZrO2/PMS achieved nearly 100% degradation of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) and 98% conversion to phosphate (PO43–) within 30 min at pH 9, demonstrating high performance and resistance to potential matrix interferences. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations demonstrated the synergy between Cu and Zr sites, where Cu functioned as PMS activation and Cu(III) generation sites and Zr served as favorable HEDP coordination sites for the formation of complexes. This coordination increased the electron density of Cu sites, facilitating Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I) and subsequent production of Cu(III) via further reaction with PMS. Overall, this study provides a promising coordination strategy to enhance HEDP degradation and fundamentally informs the design of Cu-based catalysts to activate PMS for phosphonate-contaminated wastewater treatment."

To accelerate BiCRS deployment, it is crucial to quantify the costs of CCS integration, particularly for small- and medium-scale biorefineries that are representative of early-stage deployment. Existing studies tend to focus on plant sizes that are orders-of-magnitude larger than early-stage installations, possibly underestimating CCS costs for small-to-medium biorefineries. We show that the capture, transport, and storage costs to maximize CO2 removal from a 526 dry tonne per day (tpd) biomass gasification plant (largest existing size) could be 13–47% higher than costs for a typical modeled plant size (2000 dry tpd). The higher cost estimates are driven by less favorable economies of scale and realistic assumptions about the availability of affordable CO2 transport infrastructure with both drivers broadly applicable to other BiCRS technologies. Compliance and voluntary carbon markets could incentivize biorefinery CCS, but both carry a high degree of uncertainty. These findings highlight that sufficient and reliable financial mechanisms would be essential to unlocking the full CO2 removal potential of biorefineries and facilitating BiCRS scale-up."

Compared to previous methods, our multisatellite strategy increased the number of identified industrial point sources by 38%. Fire radiative energy (FRE)-emission response models were developed by linking satellite-derived FRE with emission data from identified sources. These models enabled daily emission estimates with strong performance, especially for SO2 (R2 = 0.895) and NOx (R2 = 0.855). For sources without direct FRP detection, sectoral FRE-based temporal profiles captured emission variability effectively (Pearson’s r > 0.6, mean square errors (MSE) at 10–5 level). This approach successfully identified high-emission industrial sectors, including cement, ceramics, and steel industries, expanding the scope of detectable sources while reducing reliance on CEMS data.

We interpret these observations using the GEOS-Chem global model of atmospheric composition in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) at fine resolution of C180 (∼50 km). The base simulation overestimates the PM2.5 accumulation overnight, leading to excessive diurnal amplitude and earlier PM2.5 morning peaks than observations. These biases are reduced by applying sector- and species-wise diurnal scaling factors on anthropogenic emissions, by resolving the aerosol subgrid vertical gradient within the surface model layer, by applying revised wet deposition, and by revising the mixing coefficient in the boundary layer. Budget analyses indicate that the morning peak of PM2.5 is likely driven by changes in the aerosol subgrid vertical gradient with fumigation after sunrise, that the concentration decrease until late afternoon is driven by boundary layer mixing and thermodynamic partitioning of a semivolatile aerosol to the gas phase, that the concentration increase during evening is driven by enhanced secondary chemical production and persistent primary anthropogenic emissions, and that the consistently high concentration overnight is driven by the balance between emissions, chemical production, and boundary layer mixing and deposition."

This work characterizes the chemical composition and emissions of inhalable aerosol from CEC vaping of the popular synthetic cannabinoids Δ8- and Δ10-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC and Δ10-THC, respectively). Commercial Δ8-THC and Δ10-THC distillates were found to have variable purity, with the Δ10-THC distillate comprising roughly one-third of Δ8-THC. The addition of a commercial terpene oil mixture (rich in d-limonene, β-caryophyllene, β-myrcene, and others) at 0%, 7.5%, and 15% by mass to the Δ8-THC and Δ10-THC distillates significantly increases emissions of carbonyls up to 9-fold, but not those of cannabinoid oxidation products. On average, 6 ± 1 mg of aerosol was produced per puff, which did not significantly vary with added terpenes. Molecular analysis confirmed that a majority of the carbonyl products originate from the chemical oxidation of terpenes during vaping. The most abundantly observed carbonyls were acetone, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and terpene-derived carbonyls. We concluded that high terpene content in CEC products gives rise to more carbonyl emissions in the aerosol due to terpene oxidation, which has adverse implications for inhalation toxicology in an indoor environment."

The detailed dispersion of Lamb waves remains vague due to lack of data, but also to simplifications inherent in existing models. Here, we investigate the pressure perturbations induced by the 2022 Hunga‐Tonga eruption at both global and regional barometric arrays. After correction of the influence of wind and temperature, the group velocity dispersion curves, measured by tracking energy arrival times across different frequencies, show a decreasing trend with frequency which is superimposed by two low‐velocity bands. Regarding the synthetic results, we interpret these low‐velocity bands as the coupling effect between Lamb waves in the lower atmosphere and gravity or acoustic waves in the upper atmosphere, offering profound understandings of surface‐to‐space observations for hazard management and mitigation after extreme atmospheric events."

Here, we calculated sea‐air CO2 flux at a 3‐hourly resolution using a 10‐year mooring data set (2011–2020) from the central California coastal upwelling region. We identified a significant flux of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere due to a positive correlation between seawater pCO2 and wind speed at timescales of hours to days, particularly during the late spring and early summer upwelling season. Accounting for this variability changes the region from a net sink to a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.

Using Van Allen Probes data, we show that electron deep penetration occurs most frequently and deeply, followed by O+ ions, then He+ ions, and finally protons. Most particle deep penetrations occur within several hours. Superposed epoch analysis shows that prior to deep penetration, electrons have the steepest phase space density radial gradients, followed by heavy ions and then protons for the same μ and K.

Despite these fluctuations, the global average emitted thermal power consistently exceeds absorbed solar power, indicating a net energy loss. Assuming no significant seasonal variation in emitted power, we estimate an internal heat flux of 0.078 ± 0.018 W/m2 by analyzing the energy budget over one orbital period. The combination of internal heat and radiant energies indicates substantial global and hemispheric imbalances, with excesses or deficits exceeding 85% of emitted power at the hemispheric scale.

Parker,CMIP6 Representation of Declining Sea Ice and Arctic Cyclones in the Current Climate,"The Arctic climate system is changing rapidly with important implications in the Arctic and beyond. The interaction between the sea ice and Arctic cyclones makes it an important topic to be understood in the warming climate. We analyzed an ensemble of Coupled Multimodel Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) model simulations from 1985 to 2014 to determine model skill in depicting Arctic cyclones and their relationship with sea ice. A comprehensive climatology of Arctic cyclones and sea ice concentrations (SIC) was produced and compared to the ERA5 reanalysis product. The models reproduced the observed sea ice spatial patterns and trend well. However, the models struggled to capture the concurrent patterns and trends in Arctic cyclone characteristics that were evident in the reanalysis data. The models underestimated local cyclogenesis in the Arctic, which led to an overall underestimation of Arctic cyclone counts. Lead/lag analysis of ERA5 data suggests that reduced sea ice in the warm season can drive increased cyclone counts in the following cold season, which then reduces SIC in the next warm season in a feedback cycle that appears to be missing from the CMIP6 models. The results also revealed deviations between CMIP6 and ERA5 cyclone intensities. The magnitude and sign of the intensity differences varied based on model resolution, surface roughness parameterization, and skill in the representation of cyclogenesis location. This work highlights the need to improve sea ice‐atmosphere interactions and the representation of synoptic systems in the next generation of global models."

In this study, we reconstruct flood extents for 78 damaging events in eastern North Carolina between 1996 and 2020 using high‐resolution geospatial data and address‐level National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) records. We train random forest models on NFIP‐based labeled flood presence and absence data and a suite of geospatial predictors. Then, we predict the probability of flood damage at every 30 m grid cell within our model domain. Our models achieve an average Area Under the Curve of 0.76 and outperform flood extent estimates from process‐based and remote sensing models when evaluated against NFIP data for six events. We find that approximately 90,000 (2.3%) buildings in our study area flooded at least once, of which over 20,000 (0.53%) flooded more than once. Our estimate is more than double the number of buildings that filed NFIP claims between 1996 and 2020. Furthermore, 43% of flooded buildings are located outside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Special Flood Hazard Area. Our results illustrate that flood exposure, especially repetitive exposure, is much more widespread than previously recognized. By generating a comprehensive record of past flood extents using address‐level observations of damage, we create a first‐of‐its‐kind geospatial database that can be used to identify locations of repetitive flooding.

Here, authors analyse whole-exome sequencing data from various cancer cohorts, finding that treatment-resistant tumors shift toward neutral evolution, which correlates with worse prognosis, and monitoring this shift may guide treatment decisions. 
 Tumor evolution is shaped by selective pressures imposed by physiological factors as the tumor naturally progresses to colonize local and distant tissues, as well as by therapy. However, the distinction between these two types of pressures and their impact on tumor evolution remain elusive, mainly, due to extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity. To disentangle the effects of these selective pressures, we analyze data from diverse cohorts of patients, of both treated and untreated cancers. We find that, despite the wide variation across patients, the selection strength on tumor genomes in individual patients is stable and largely unaffected by tumor progression in the primary settings, with some cancer-specific signatures detectable in the progression to metastases. However, we identify a nearly universal shift toward neutral evolution in tumors that resist treatment and demonstrate that this regime is associated with worse prognosis. We validate these findings on both published and original datasets. We suggest that monitoring the selection regime during cancer treatment can assist clinical decision-making in many cases.

By disrupting bacterial succinate production, identified mutations steer immunity toward harmful Th17 responses instead of protective Th1, worsening disease. 
 Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) pathogens, remains a global health threat. While bacterial genetic adaptations during host infection are poorly understood, phase variation in genomic homopolymeric tracts (HT) may drive pathogenicity evolution. Here, we demonstrate that M. bovis exploits HT insertion mutations in the fumarate reductase-encoding frd operon to subvert host immunometabolism. In macrophages, wild-type M. bovis secretes FRD-catalyzed succinate, stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to drive glycolytic reprogramming and IL-1β production. This activates IL-1R-dependent Th1 immunity, restraining bacterial replication. Conversely, M. bovis frd HT insertion mutants impair succinate secretion, suppressing HIF-1α/IL-1β signaling and redirecting immunity toward pathogenic Th17 responses that promote neutrophil infiltration and tissue necrosis. Mice infection models reveal that M. bovis frd mutants exhibit enhanced pathogenicity, with higher pulmonary bacterial burdens. IL-1R blockade phenocopies frd HT insertion mutation effects, exacerbating lung pathology. Crucially, conserved frd HT polymorphisms in clinical M. tb isolates suggest shared immune evasion strategies across MTBC pathogens. Our work uncovers the bacterial gene phase variation mechanism of hijacking the succinate/HIF-1α/IL-1β axis to operate host immunity, providing a framework for targeting host metabolic checkpoints in TB therapy.

 The nature of lead zirconate, the historical antiferroelectric material, has recently been challenged. In PbZrO3 epitaxial films, thickness reduction engenders competition among antiferroelectric, ferrielectric and ferroelectric phases. All studies so far on PbZrO3 films have utilized commercially-available oxide single crystals with large compressive lattice mismatch, causing the films to undergo strain relaxation. First-principles calculations have predicted that tensile strain can stabilize antiferroelectricity down to the nanometre scale. Here we use tensile strain imposed by artificial substrates of LaLuO3 to stabilize a pure antiferroelectric phase in PbZrO3. Sharp double hysteresis loops of polarization vs electric field show zero remanent polarization, and polar displacement maps reveal the characteristic up-up-down-down antipolar pattern down to 9 nanometre film thicknesses. Moreover, the electron beam can move this antipolar pattern through the nucleation and annihilation of translational boundaries. These results highlight the critical role of coherent epitaxial strain in the phase stability of PbZrO3.

Here, authors develop non-pathogenic anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria for in situ biosynthesis of ferrous sulfide nanoparticles for tumor-targeted therapy. 
 Anaerobic bacteria-mediated tumor therapy faces multiple challenges, including potential toxic side effects, complex manufacturing processes, and impaired hypoxic targeting. Here, based on the excellent biocompatibility and distinctive metabolic ability of natural anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to dissimilate sulfate into sulfide, we construct in situ-biosynthesized ferrous sulfide nanoparticle-SRB (FeS@SRB) biohybrid to enhance tumor-targeted therapy. Interestingly, SRB acts as both a biosynthesis factory and active tumor-targeted delivery vehicles. Our systematic studies reveal that FeS@SRB has excellent biosafety and tumor targeting capabilities, achieving over 50% tumor delivery efficiency in female mice post-intravenous injection, which is 17 times higher than that of conventional chemically-synthesized FeS@BSA nanoparticles. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation, FeS@SRB hybrids exhibit synergistic photothermal-chemodynamic effect, amplifying oxidative stress to trigger tumor cells ferroptosis and apoptosis, thereby effectively suppressing both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth. This SRB-based therapeutic strategy expands research into tumor-targeting platforms and the biosynthesis of metal sulfide nanoparticles for enhanced tumor therapy.

 The nucleocapsid N is one of four structural proteins of the coronaviruses. Its essential role in genome encapsidation makes it a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 and related diseases. However, the inherent disorder of full-length N hampers its structural analysis. Here, we describe a stepwise method using viral-derived RNAs to stabilize SARS-CoV-2 N for EM analysis. We identify pieces of RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 genome that promote the formation of structurally homogeneous N dimers, intermediates of assembly, and filamentous capsid-like structures. Building on these results, we engineer a symmetric RNA to stabilize N protein dimers, the building block of high-order assemblies, for EM studies. We combine domain-specific monoclonal antibodies against N with chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry to validate the spatial arrangement of the N domains within the dimer. Additionally, our cryo-EM analysis reveals novel antigenic sites on the N protein. Our findings provide insights into N protein´s architectural and antigenic principles, which can guide design of pan-coronavirus therapeutics.

 The spinal cord is essential for processing sensory information and regulating autonomic functions, such as bladder control, which is critical for urinary continence and voiding. Understanding how the spinal cord represents bladder pressure can provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying bladder control and contribute to developing better therapies for bladder dysfunction. However, measuring neural activity in the human spinal cord is notoriously challenging due to its small size and the surrounding bony and fascial enclosures, limiting the effectiveness of traditional neuroimaging techniques. Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a minimally invasive, emerging modality that overcomes these barriers, offering high sensitivity, spatial coverage, and spatiotemporal resolution for studying neural dynamics. Here, we combine fUSI with urodynamically controlled bladder filling and emptying to examine hemodynamic responses in the human spinal cord during one cycle of micturition. Using intravesical bladder pressure recordings, we identify spinal cord regions with hemodynamic signals that strongly correlate with bladder pressure. Furthermore, a linear support vector machine regression model (SVM-r) trained on the fUSI power Doppler signal reveals relevant spinal cord regions and accurately reconstructs bladder pressure changes. Our findings provide evidence of bladder pressure-responsive regions in the spinal cord, where hemodynamic signals strongly correlate with bladder pressure.

 North American glaciers experienced accelerated mass loss over the last decade, yet the degree to which albedo decline drove this mass loss remains uncertain. We use daily summer glacier surface albedo averaged by decade (2000 − 2009 and 2010 − 2019) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer to investigate how snow and ice darkening influenced glacier mass loss for 25 of the largest and most heavily glaciated regions in North America. Here we show that glacier albedo respectively decreased by 0.019 ± 0.019 and 0.018 ± 0.009 in western North America and in the Canadian Arctic. This decrease in albedo coincides with increased geodetically derived glacier mass loss within these regions (R2 = 0.76, R2 = 0.63; p < 0.01). Modelled surface energy balance and melt rates, forced by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation Land reanalysis and regional decadal averages of albedo, indicate that 31% of increased melt rate in Western North America and 41% of increased melt rate in the Canadian Arctic can be attributed to albedo decline. Projected increases in air temperature this century will further reduce glacier albedo, and the resulting positive feedback will further accelerate glacier mass loss.

 Mantle wedge metasomatism is a widespread phenomenon in subduction zones. However, details of early melt generation and the extent of metasomatic processes is unclear. Here we document two distinct types of adakitic felsic rocks within the mantle wedge of the North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic belt. These field observations provide direct evidence for extensive mantle wedge metasomatism. Zircon and apatite U-Pb dating indicates a rapid exhumation and cooling of the subducted plate. Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic analyses, combined with forward phase equilibrium modeling of partial melting, suggest that these adakitic veins formed either through partial melting of a single continental crustal source or by mixing of melts derived from both oceanic and continental crusts. These findings underscore the critical role of melts derived from both oceanic and continental crusts in the growth and evolution of continental crust during collisional orogenic events.

 The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) series onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the EUMETSAT Meteorological Operational Satellite (Metop) polar-orbiting satellites have provided continuous Earth observation data since 1979, which facilitates the development of long-term global climate data records. In this paper, a new version of the algorithm for the retrieval of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over Land (ADL v2.0) using AVHRR data is proposed with improved accuracy, in particular for high AOD values. The surface reflectance estimation scheme is based on a regression model established using simulated AVHRR reflectances spectrally transferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD09/MYD09 product. To address limitations in retrieving high AOD, the surface reflectance is determined using the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during a certain period of time. To this end, a dynamic NDVI search window is proposed to identify the NDVI that is least affected by aerosols. ADL v2.0 has been applied to provide an AOD dataset covering Mainland China (70o-140°E, 15o-60oN) for the years from 1981 to 2000. This dataset has been evaluated by comparing with AOD data available from the application of the broadband extinction method (BEM) to ground-based solar radiation measurements and from the AVHRR Deep Blue (DB) AOD dataset. The AOD variations retrieved using the BEM data at seven stations (two in North China, two in Northeast China, one in East China, one in Central China, and one in the southwest mountainous region) are well reproduced by the ADL v2.0 algorithm. The comparison with the AVHRR DB AOD dataset shows good agreement with ADL v2.0 retrieval results even though with less valid retrievals for high AOD in Eastern China, Sichuan, and the Guanzhong Basin, as well as over North India."

 Accurate and timely mapping of landslides after the event (e.g., earthquake) is crucial for effective rescue operations and comprehensive disaster assessment. While optical images are often obstructed by clouds and fog, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can identify landslides independently of weather conditions. In this study, we propose a deep learning method which exploits a morphological model (DLM) to achieve accurate landslide identification using only a post-event single-temporal polarimetric SAR image. The SAR scattering mechanisms and polarimetric characteristics of various ground objects are thoroughly analyzed to select optimal polarimetric parameters for deep learning. To accurately map landslide shapes and extract boundaries, we introduce a Majority Voting mechanism and a morphological optimization model. We have used one quad-pol ALOS-2 image for landslide mapping and achieved an overall accuracy of 95.24 % with the proposed method. Additionally, considering the limited availability of quad-pol SAR data, we have employed dual-pol ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data to assess the method's usability with dual-pol data. The dual-pol ALOS-2 image achieved an overall accuracy of 89.78 %, while Sentinel-1 image effectively captured the general landslide shape with an overall accuracy of 76.32 %. This demonstrates the high applicability of the proposed method for landslide mapping using a single post-event polarimetric SAR image, enhancing the timeliness of SAR-based landslide mapping and improving emergency response and post-disaster rescue capabilities."

 The accurate extraction and mapping of cage aquaculture are of substantial significance to the sustainable development of bay ecosystems but remain challenging due to diverse aquaculture practices in changing bay environments. Existing methods rely primarily on complex classifiers; however, their generalization capabilities are limited. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification method called Otsu-UNet by integrating the Otsu algorithm with the U-shaped Network method. Based on the Google Earth Engine platform, cage aquaculture data were autonomously extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery using the Otsu technique, and high-quality samples were curated to train the UNet model for cage aquaculture extraction across bay locales.

The fusion of intelligent fire detection with remote sensing improves coverage and mobility, enabling monitoring in remote and challenging areas.

 Alpine zones, located above the treeline in high mountain areas, are highly sensitive to global warming. Topography modulates land surface energy, mass and momentum fluxes and thus can largely influence vegetation growth under a warming climate. However, little is known about the topographical effects on vegetation changes during recent decades, especially in alpine vegetation at the global scale. Here we utilize 30 m spatial resolution Landsat imagery to quantify trends in vegetation greenness and vegetated areas during 1984–2023 in global alpine ecosystems and quantify the effects of topography on vegetation changes. Our results reveal that more than 99 % of the global alpine zones show concurrent significant (p < 0.05) vegetation greening and increasing vegetated areas. Yet, the effects of topography on the two vegetation metrics diverge in 85.49 % of the regions where the magnitude of the rate of vegetation greening decreases with higher elevation whereas the expansion rate of vegetated areas is faster with higher elevations. Moreover, vegetation dynamics also covary with the slope aspect, with polar-facing slopes experiencing higher trend magnitude in vegetation greenness (72.59 %) and vegetated areas (64.50 %) compared to the equatorial-facing slopes. Our findings provide a unified assessment of global alpine vegetation dynamics and highlight the complex impacts of topographic factors on alpine ecosystems under global climate change."

 Landsat series data (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Landsat-9 OLI2) hold significant potential for detecting temporal changes of underwater terrain in optically shallow waters resulting from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, waves, and human activities due to their extensive time series (nearly 40 years) and medium-spatial-resolution (30 m). However, different Landsat series images have different band sets and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) which may impact the consistency of the bathymetry inversion results of optimization-based bathymetry inversion models. Therefore, this study initially quantitatively evaluated the consistency of Landsat series data-derived bathymetry data over the South China Sea, which has a notable distribution of coral islands. The results of 12 images indicated that the root mean square error values of the estimated water depth are generally less than 4 m at Qilian Yu and less than 2 m at Dongsha Dao at depths shallower than 10 m. At depths greater than 10 m, OLI/OLI2 obtained higher accuracy in water depth inversion than did TM/ETM+. The inter-comparison results and temporal results of different geomorphic zones indicated that the Landsat series-derived water depth values in the reef flat and shallow lagoon, where water depth is shallower than 10 m, exhibit high consistency. However, because TM and ETM+ have lower SNRs, for deep lagoons and fore reefs where water depth is greater than 10 m and the substrate is dark, the OLI/OLI2- and TM/ETM+-derived water depth values substantially differ. Then, Landsat series data were applied to detect bathymetric changes in the Nanwei Dao. The temporal results of Nanwei Dao show that the depth of the new port has increased from approximately 2.00 to 10.00 m, whereas the new land in the northeast region has changed from a depth of approximately 7.50 m to land. To date, approximately 584252.74 ± 228884.43 m3 of sediment has been excavated in the port area of Nanwei Dao, with 1010657.21 ± 897737.97 m3 of land reclaimed from the water. Overall, the Landsat series data can be used to detect temporal changes in the underwater terrain of coral islands in the range of approximately 0 to 10 m over the South China Sea for nearly 40 years, and achieving reliable 40-year long-term monitoring of water depths exceeding 10 m remains challenging."

 The formation and scavenging of secondary aerosol under extremely high humidity conditions (relative humidity >80 %) remained as an issue in subtropical urban areas. In order to evaluate the effects of aqueous-phase oxidation and wet removal on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) composition and dynamics, a field campaign, which mainly used a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM) to characterized the non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) composition, was carried out during autumn fog-rain periods (FRPs) in Chongqing, Southwestern China. The chemical composition of PM2.5 was characterized, and the factors impacting SOA formation were analyzed. The effects of regional transport on SOA were also investigated. The results showed that SOA, which included less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) and more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA), dominated OA, contributing 80 % to total OA and 36 % to PM2.5. LO-OOA and MO-OOA concentrations increased with liquid water content (LWC) and oxidant levels (Ox), indicating aqueous-phase and photochemical pathways jointly promoted SOA formation. Compared to PreFRPs and PostFRPs, MO-OOA concentration decreased by 62 % and 1 % during FRPs, highlighting efficient wet scavenging. Notably, SOA exhibited higher removal efficiency than primary organic aerosol (POA), and MO-OOA tended to be more easily scavenged by fog and rain droplets than LO-OOA. Diurnal O/C ratios revealed enhanced nighttime oxidation under high humidity, while backward trajectories identified southern Chongqing as a key SOA source region.
