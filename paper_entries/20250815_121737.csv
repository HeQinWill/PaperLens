Artificial drainage lowers the water table by design but also has inadvertent effects on the watershed-scale hydrologic response with important implications for flood risk and nutrient exports. We investigated the effects of tile drains on watershed-scale hydrologic response in the Portage River, OH, Watershed using a high-resolution physically based integrated surface/subsurface hydrology model with recently developed capabilities to represent artificial drainage. Tile drains were found to enhance streamflow during times of low flow, generally consistent with previous studies. Streamflow flashiness was found to have a non-monotonic dependence on tile spacing with a minimum at intermediate spacings (∼50 m). Flashiness and the event hydrographs for small tile spacing were similar to the situation with no tiles, but flow paths from farm to stream were very different for those two end member cases, emphasizing the limitations of the stream hydrograph in characterizing hydrologic response. For typical tile spacings, peak flow can either be enhanced or attenuated by the presence of tiles, depending on the size of the event and the antecedent meteorological conditions. Tiles enhance peak flow when the event is below a threshold of ∼25 mm or when events arrive in dry conditions. Peak flow is reduced by tiles when events are large and arrive in conditions that are not overly dry. The dependence on event size and antecedent conditions is explained by differences in available storage and flow paths to the streams. These results provide additional insights into how tile drainage modulates event-scale hydrologic response, an important control on flood generation mechanisms and nutrient exports."

Sepulveda Araya;Sylvia C. Sullivan;Aiko Voigt,Ice crystal complexity leads to weaker ice cloud radiative heating in idealized single-column simulations,"Clouds composed of ice crystals are key when evaluating atmospheric radiation. The morphology of the crystals found in clouds is not clear yet, and even less clear is the impact on the cloud heating rate, which is essential to describe precipitation and wind patterns. This motivated us to study how the heating rate behaves under a variety of ice complexity and environmental conditions, finding that increasing complexity in high and dense clouds weakens the heating rate. 
 Ice clouds play an important role in the atmospheric radiation budget, both by reflecting shortwave radiation and by absorbing or emitting longwave radiation. These effects can modulate the cloud radiative heating (CRH) rate, which in turn influences circulation and precipitation. Ice cloud radiative properties depend on the size, shape (or habit), and complexity, including surface roughness or hollowness, of in-cloud ice crystals. To better predict ice cloud radiative effects, there has been a continuous effort to account for more ice crystal habits and complexity in current radiative transfer calculations. Here, we conduct a series of idealized single-column radiative transfer calculations to study how ice CRH responds to including ice crystal complexity. We evaluate four ice optical schemes for a range of ice cloud formation temperatures or altitudes, geometrical depths, ice water paths (IWPs), and ice crystal effective radii. In addition, we present a heating rate sensitivity matrix as a condensed visualization of the CRH response across a broad parameter space. We find that including ice complexity in cold thin clouds with high IWPs can diminish the net in-cloud heating and cloud-top cooling by 2.5 and 15 K d−1, respectively. Furthermore, while temperature-based schemes behave similarly to other schemes at warmer temperatures, they predict net CRH at the cloud bottom more than 10 K d−1 higher than size-dependent schemes at the coldest temperatures. Either weakening of CRH by ice complexity or strengthening by temperature-dependent schemes can alter anvil cloud lifetime and evolution, as well as large-scale atmospheric circulation."

Long-term O3 trends from 16 stations in Saxony, Germany, were compared over three periods, revealing worsened O3 pollution over the last decade. O3 formation has been volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited at traffic and urban sites for the past 20 years. To mitigate O3 pollution, moderate nitrogen oxides and additional VOC controls, particularly in solvent use, should be prioritized in the coming years. 
 Given its importance for human health, vegetation and climate, trends in ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations in eastern Germany were systematically analysed using the long-term O3 data from 16 measurement stations. The findings indicate that despite reductions in oxides of nitrogen (NOx= NO + NO2) concentrations across all sites, O3 pollution in Saxony has in fact worsened over the past decade, especially in densely populated urban areas. The strongest O3 trend is observed at a traffic-dominated station, with an annual ozone increase of 1.2 µg m−3 yr−1 (or 3.5 % yr−1), while urban and rural background stations show more moderate rises of, on average, 0.5 µg m−3 yr−1 (or 1.1 % yr−1) over the last decade.To diagnose O3 formation and the controlling effects of NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over the past decades in this region, for the first time, detailed photochemical box modelling was performed by means of the complex MCM (Master Chemical Mechanism). Analysis of isopleth diagrams for two seasons indicates that O3 formation was predominantly VOC-limited at traffic and urban sites from 2000 to 2019. The observed rise in O3 levels suggests that current efforts to reduce total non-methane volatile organic compound (TNMVOC, including NMVOCs and oxygenated VOCs) emissions and NOx from various sources unfortunately remain insufficient. Based on anthropogenic and biogenic emission data, we recommend that continued NOx abatement and further additional VOC controls, with a focus on solvent use, be implemented in densely populated areas to mitigate O3 pollution in the coming years."

We focused on analyzing the differences in Pb-rich particles between the heating period and non-heating period, as well as the formation mechanism of lead nitrate after coal-to-gas conversion. Our results highlighted the improvement of Pb levels in the particulate as a result of coal-to-gas conversion. 
 Coal-to-gas (CTG) policies are important energy transformation strategies for addressing air pollution issues, but how well they improve atmospheric lead (Pb) pollution remains poorly understood. By the end of 2018, Beijing had achieved coal-free status in urban and plain areas. The mixing state and atmospheric chemical processes of Pb-rich particles in Beijing were monitored using single-particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) in 2019. Based on a large dataset of mass spectra, this study finds that the number fractions of Pb-rich particles, as well as two specific types of Pb-rich particles (K-Na-EC and K-OC, where EC and OC denote elemental and organic carbon, respectively) related to coal combustion during the official Beijing heating period, show lower number fractions than those after the heating period. Based on concentration-weighted trajectory plots, the results indicate that lead aerosols mainly derive from transmission from surrounding provinces. Lead nitrate is one of the important forms of lead in aerosol particles, particularly as a result of photo-chemical reactions in the spring, fall, and winter. Due to nitrate decomposition during high temperatures, the aqueous reaction mechanism contributes more to lead nitrate during the summer. These results improve our understanding of the seasonal distribution, formation mechanisms, and influencing factors of toxic Pb-containing particles after CTG."

Updated simulations reveal insignificant trends but greater variability in lightning NOx emissions, impacting tropospheric NOx, O3, and OH. Lightning generally counteracts non-lightning factors, reducing the inter-annual variability of tropospheric O3 and OH. Variations in global lightning play an important role in understanding the atmospheric methane budget. 
 Lightning is a significant source of nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO+NO2) in the free troposphere. Variations in global lightning activity influence long-term trends (LTTs) and inter-annual variability (IAV) in tropospheric NOx, ozone (O3), and hydroxyl radicals (OH). However, accurately quantifying these impacts is hindered by uncertainties in representing year-to-year fluctuations in global lightning activity in models. Here, we apply Schumann resonance (SR) observations, which are sensitive to changes in global lightning activity, to better constrain inter-annual variations in lightning NOx (LNOx) emissions. By integrating this update into an atmospheric chemical transport model, we assess the contributions of lightning to both LTT and IAV in global atmospheric chemistry from 2013–2021. The updated parameterisation predicts an insignificant trend in global LNOx emissions, contrasting with a significant increase of 6.4 % dec−1 (P<0.05) by the original parameterisation, reducing lightning contributions to LTTs in NOx, O3, and OH. The updated simulation better aligns with satellite-observed trends in global and northern hemispheric NO2 but further underestimates tropospheric O3 increases. The updated parameterisation reveals twice the IAV in global LNOx emissions but 20 % smaller IAVs in global O3 and OH because lightning generally counteracts other sources of natural variability. A ∼10 % decline in lightning in 2020 relative to 2019 led to a ∼2 % decrease in global OH, explaining half of observed annual methane growth.  These findings highlight the value of Schumann resonance observations in constraining global lightning activity, thereby enhancing our understanding of lightning's role in atmospheric chemistry."

Franklin;Steven C. Wofsy;Ritesh Gautam,Detection and quantification of methane plumes with the MethaneAIR airborne spectrometer,"This study presents a data processing scheme for the detection and quantification of methane emissions using the MethaneAIR airborne spectrometer. We show that the proposed methods enable the detection of smaller plumes (compared with those detectable using other existing methods) and improve the potential of MethaneAIR to survey methane point sources across large regions. 
 The MethaneAIR imaging spectrometer was originally developed as an airborne demonstrator of the MethaneSAT satellite mission. MethaneAIR  enables accurate methane concentration retrievals from high-spectral-resolution measurements in the 1650 nm methane absorption feature at a nominal spatial sampling of 5 × 25 m. In this work, we present a computationally efficient data processing chain optimized for the detection and quantification of methane plumes with MethaneAIR. It involves the retrieval of methane concentration enhancements (ΔXCH4) with the high-precision matched-filter retrieval, which is applied to 1650 nm retrievals for the first time. Methane plumes are detected via visual inspection of the resulting ΔXCH4 maps. We evaluated the performance of this processing scheme with simulated plumes, intercomparison with other methods, and controlled methane releases. We applied this processing chain to MethaneAIR data mosaics acquired over the Permian Basin during flights in 2021 and 2023, which resulted in the detection of hundreds of point sources above 100–200 kg h−1, with a conservative detection limit of around 120 kg h−1. Our results show the consistency of MethaneAIR's ΔXCH4 matched-filter retrievals as well as their potential for the detection and quantification of methane point sources across large areas."

Nehrir;Frithjof Ehlers;Dorit Huber,Cross-validations of the Aeolus aerosol products and new developments with airborne high-spectral-resolution lidar measurements above the tropical Atlantic during JATAC,"The study highlights how aerosol measurements from aircraft can be used in synergy with ground-based observations to validate the European Space Agency's Aeolus satellite aerosol product above the tropical Atlantic. For the first time, collocated sections of the troposphere up to 626 km long are crossed. Combining measurements from satellite, aircraft, and ground-based instruments allows characterization of the optical properties of the observed dust particles emitted from the Sahara. 
 The Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC) conducted in 2022 in Cabo Verde has provided quantitative lidar measurements, particularly from the NASA Langley High-Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO) on board DC-8 aircraft, for process-level understanding of tropical dynamics, as well as for satellite validation. For the first time, the optical properties of particles (i.e. backscatter, extinction, attenuated backscatter coefficients, and depolarization ratios) have been measured for extended tropospheric sections collocated with the Aeolus satellite overpasses with limited geolocation and time offsets. This has contributed to the evaluation of the Aeolus Level-2A (L2A) aerosol optical properties product. In addition, localized aerosol profiles were measured by the ground-based multiwavelength Raman polarization and water vapour lidar PollyXT.In this study, we assess the quality of the Aeolus L2A product retrieved with the standard correct algorithm (SCA) and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as part of the September 2022 dataset reprocessed with the L2A processor, version 16. The focus is given to the 355 nm aerosol retrievals given at finer horizontal resolution, i.e. the so-called Aeolus measurement level at ≈ 18 km. They are compared to the 532 nm HALO airborne profiles that are converted to 355 nm using the backscatter Ångström exponent. HALO and PollyXT polarization lidars also provide insights into the L2A algorithm's limitations when looking at non-spherical particles such as Saharan dust. Even though it has no cross-polarized component, the Aeolus measurements can be corrected using collocated observations with such instruments that include both co-polarized and cross-polarized components of the backscattered light. Moreover the cross-validation with independent lidar measurements enables estimation of the lower limits for Aeolus backscatter detection."

These changes can modify the air-sea CO2 fluxes. Here, we present a dataset of air-sea CO2 fluxes for 5996 long lived mesoscale eddies trajectories in the global ocean between 1993 to 2022. These trajectories can be used to understand the processes modifying and controlling the air-sea CO2 fluxes in mesoscale eddies which are supported by a comprehensive uncertainty budget. 
 Mesoscale eddies are prevalent features within the global ocean that modify the physical, chemical and biological properties as they move and evolve. These modifications can alter the air-sea exchange of CO2, and therefore these features may be hotspots for enhanced or reduced CO2 uptake compared to the surrounding environment. The understanding of the global and regional effect of mesoscale eddies on ocean CO2 uptake is however limited and largely based on single eddies or small regional subsets. Here, we provide a global dataset of 5996 long lived eddies trajectories (lifetimes greater than a year) with corresponding air-sea CO2 fluxes all tracked using a Lagrangian approach between 1993 to 2022. The trajectories comprise 3244 anticyclonic (‘warm core’) and 2752 cyclonic (‘cold core’) eddies and the dataset provides the biogeochemical conditions, including the CO2 fluxes, within and outside each eddy. The dataset refines a previous regional methodology with a focus on climate quality environmental parameters and uses a global neural network for estimating the fugacity of CO2 in seawater (fCO2 (sw)) along with a comprehensive air-sea CO2 flux uncertainty budget. These refinements provide a robust foundation for studying the modulation of air-sea CO2 fluxes by mesoscale eddies. As an example use of the dataset, we investigate the role of mesoscale eddies in modifying the global and regional air-sea CO2 fluxes, by comparing the eddy driven air-sea CO2 flux to that of the surrounding environment. We find that globally, long-lived anticyclonic eddies enhanced the CO2 sink by 4.5 ± 2.8 % (95 % confidence), while long-lived cyclonic eddies reduce the CO2 sink by 0.7 ± 2.6 %. Collectively, the long-lived eddies indicate an enhancement of the ocean CO2 sink by 2.7 ± 1.1 Tg C yr-1. Propagating the air-sea CO2 flux uncertainties was found to be a key component needed to fully understand apparent differences between previous regional and global studies.

To address this, we developed a simple model that emulates the response of sea ice to global warming. We find that the remaining carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that will avoid a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean are lower than previous estimates of 821 Gt of CO2. Our model also provides insights into the future of winter sea ice, examining a larger ensemble than previously possible. 
 The high computational expense of complex climate models and their tendency to underestimate observational records of Arctic sea ice sensitivity to anthropogenic forcers challenge our ability to assess the magnitude of forcing that will cause Arctic sea ice loss to cross critical thresholds. To address these limitations, we develop a parameterisation framework for Arctic sea ice emulation, SASIEv.1, that is calibrated to the response of sea ice area to global warming in physically-based CMIP6 models and constrained to observations. Our constrained framework reduces the remaining budget of CO2 that can be emitted while preventing seasonally ice-free conditions from 821 Gt CO2 by CMIP6 multi-model ensemble estimates to 380 Gt CO2. This suggests that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C is sufficient to prevent a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, whereas 2 °C proves insufficient. Our results also provide insight into the future of winter sea ice over a greater ensemble range than previously possible, pinpointing the emission threshold at which the ice pack detaches from land, after which the ice pack rapidly disappears to year-round ice free conditions."

Although analytical techniques have continually advanced, the fate of individual compound classes remains nearly impossible to track with the current technology. Previously, we reported the synthesis of carboxylate-rich alicyclic molecule (CRAM) compounds that shared more similar analytical features with DOM than previously available standards. Here, we adopt an alternative approach to the conventional use of DOM as a bulk material by subjecting our synthesized CRAM compounds to simulated solar irradiation and microbial incubation experiments alongside molecules with chosen biological or chemical relevance. Irradiation experiments typically showed that compounds bearing only carboxylic acids and/or alcohols on a saturated carbon backbone were the most resistant to photochemical degradation but also that some of the investigated CRAM analogues were notably more stable in the presence of DOM. Within microbial incubations, all of our synthesized CRAMs were entirely stable after 8 months in various aquatic settings. These sets of experiments provide support for the proposed stability of CRAM within the environment as well as providing a platform from which a more diverse set of molecules can be used to assist in probing the stability of DOM."

Results reveal widespread racial and ethnic disparities in social and environmental conditions. From 2000 to 2020, environmental inequalities increased, with significant differences in land surface temperature (LST) (Sen’s slope differences: 0.00620 °C/year for Hispanic vs non-Hispanic (ethnic group); 0.00366 °C/year for people of color vs non-Hispanic White (racial group) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) as a proxy for consumptive water use (−0.00167 mm/year for ethnic groups). LST disparities among races/ethnicities grew in warmer regions, while they decreased in temperate and cold areas. Water resource disparities also increased across different ethnic groups in drier neighborhoods, with a slope of ETa differences at −0.00237 mm/year. These findings highlight the linkages between environmental inequality, physiography, and climate change, demonstrating that climate change exacerbates these disparities.

However, traditional experimental methods focus on a single adsorbent under specific mercury removal conditions, making it difficult to obtain universal influencing laws and optimal preparation methods for the adsorbents. This study used machine learning (ML) to predict Max. Hg0 removal efficiency based on the experimental data including adsorbent parameters and removal conditions published over the past 25 years. It shows that the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model has the best prediction effect (test R2 = 0.87). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Cl are important factors affecting the Max. Hg0 removal efficiency, especially within a certain range. By adjusting the BET surface area and the halogen (Cl, Br, and I) ratio, the Max. Hg0 removal efficiencies of carbon-based adsorbents can be improved from 85 to 98.4, 90.7, and 88.6%, respectively. The maximum error between the experimental and predicted values is within 10%, proving the accuracy of the ML model prediction. The finding has important guiding significance for the design and development of high-performance mercury removal adsorbents."

This study identified 12 novel OPEs (NOPEs) in water from the upper reaches of the Yellow River, China. The total concentrations of dissolved OPEs in water ranged from 51 to 1575 ng/L, while the suspended particulate matter associated with the OPEs were 84–8009 ng/g dw, both dominated by four suspected transformation products of the OPAs. Among them, bis(2,4-ditert-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol phosphate phosphite (AO626=O) was first reported in environmental matrices. Interestingly, the concentrations of NOPEs were higher in rural areas than in urban areas, which might be attributed to the extensive application of OPAs in industrial and agricultural activities in rural areas. The significant correlation between the concentrations of bis(2,4-ditert-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (AO626) and AO626=O in water, principal component analysis, and simulated photolysis experiments confirmed that transformation of the OPAs made a great contribution to the total OPEs in the surface water of the Yellow River. Based on the Toxicological Priority Index scheme, four OPA transformation products were identified as high priority. This study provides new insights into the great contribution from the transformation of OPAs to the contamination and environmental risk of OPEs in aquatic environments."

In this work, we introduced a photoswitching strategy that in situ regulates electron transfer in single-atom Co–TiO2 catalysts, optimizing the production of reactive oxidative species during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, thereby improving pollutant mineralization efficiency. Theoretical calculations revealed that the formation of high-valent Co-oxo species during PMS activation was thermodynamically favorable. By modulating photogenerated electron flow, the process dynamically shifted between nonradical and radical pathways. A dark–light interval system derived from this photoswitching approach significantly improved contaminant removal, with bisphenol A mineralization efficiency increasing from 29.50% in the dark and 47.81% under continuous light to 62.62% with the interval system.

Here, we constructed a spatially explicit carbon dioxide (CO2) flux data set covering 2003–2022 for China’s largest floodplain lake (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.49 gC m–2 d–1). The annual fluxes varied from 52.57 ± 4.71 gC m–2 in 2010 to −186.36 ± 7.27 gC m–2 in 2011. Temporal variations in CO2 flux were primarily driven by changes in the hydrological regime and wetland vegetation conditions. Specifically, water rise onset and recession onset emerged as the two most influential factors. A 10-day delay in lake water rise enhanced CO2 uptake by 19.20 gC m–2, whereas a 10-day advance in lake water recession increased uptake by 11.63 gC m–2. However, the enhancement of the CO2 sink can be impaired in the case of excessively early or rapid lake water level decline. For example, the extreme drought in 2022 reduced CO2 uptake by over 20% compared to moderate drought years due to plant water stress and increased ecosystem respiration.

Here, we propose a novel 3M (microflora–microcosm–modeling) framework to assess the risk of antibiotics in promoting bacterial resistance within bacterial flora. Results reveal that aquatic microflora in water environments harbor unexpectedly high antibiotic resistance levels, comparable to clinical settings, despite ambient antibiotic concentrations being orders of magnitude lower, which underscores the rationale for using bacterial resistance as a key indicator in antibiotic risk assessments. Then, building on previous microflora-based studies in lab media, we developed microflora-based microcosm integrated with advanced ecological and pharmacodynamic modeling, establishing the innovative 3M framework.

An Advanced Particle Microphysics model (APM) has been integrated into the USEPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) to improve its representation of aerosol size distribution. CMAQ is a state‐of‐the‐science air quality model simulating the emission, transport, formation, evolution, and deposition of air pollutants. Unlike the original CMAQ's simplified modal approach, the sectional APM model distinguishes primary and secondary particles, keeps track of secondary species coated on each type of primary particle (black carbon, primary organic carbon, dust, and sea salt), and uses flexible binning for different particle types. This introduces 116 new APM‐related tracers increasing computational cost by 83% but enabling high‐size resolution aerosol simulations. The updated CMAQ‐APM incorporates a ternary H2SO4‐H2O‐NH3 ion‐mediated nucleation scheme to investigate particle formation and growth over the United States. Predicted monthly mean nucleation rates, particles larger than 10 nm (CN10), and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at 0.4% supersaturation (CCN0.4) in the surface in summer and winter of 2013 range from ∼0.001 to ∼2 cm−3 s−1, ∼2,000–15,000 cm−3, and ∼300–5,000 cm−3, respectively.

Using observational analysis and numerical simulations, this study explores the main reasons for the differences in the duration of two EPHR events that occurred in similar regions, at similar times, and under comparable low‐level background circulation, but with different durations. Both EPHR events took place in the afternoon over southeast Hainan Island. The development of strong convection is closely related to the convergence between the northeasterly offshore boundary layer jet (BLJ) and the northerly bypass flow generated by the topographic blockage of the Wuzhi Mountain. In Case 1, the offshore BLJ undergoes constant clockwise deflection, gradually shifting from northeast to southeast winds, which enables the strong convergence zone to persist for an extended period. However, in Case 2, the BLJ undergoes constant counterclockwise deflection, evolving from northeast to north winds, which causes the strong convergence zone to gradually disappear. The difference in the direction of deflection of the offshore BLJ is the key reason for the variation in duration between the two EPHR events. Diagnostics revealed that the differences in offshore BLJ deflections are primarily caused by variations in meridional pressure gradient forces. These are influenced by differences in divergence and latent heat release associated with the upper‐level circulation system. The results of this study are crucial for helping forecasters gain a deeper understanding of the maintenance mechanisms of local EPHR events and improve the forecasting capability for local extreme precipitation."

Recently, the combined use of cover cropping plus no‐tillage (CCNT) has been increasingly promoted to achieve its synergistic effectiveness. Yet, how this combined practice affects soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emission remains a topic of debate. Existing studies are predominantly based on research‐managed settings and often fail to assess all three major GHGs of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). To address these knowledge gaps, this study conducted a 30‐month monitoring from producer‐managed fields to quantify the soil greenhouse gas responses to CCNT compared to no‐tillage (NT) alone. The findings showed that CCNT increased the soil global warming potential (GWP) by 15.2% relative to NT. CO2 is the main contributor, accounting for over 91.7% of the total GWP. On average, the daily fluxes of CO2, N2O, and CH4 were increased by 16.2%, 32.3%, and 55.6% under CCNT, respectively. Meteorological variables explained 85.3% of the CO2 increase and 46.1% of the N2O increase associated with CCNT. Furthermore, two types of CCNT practices differed in GHG emission responses, though both strategies significantly reduced nitrogen losses. These quantitative results, derived from actual production systems, provide informed decision‐making among local producers regarding the adoption of cover crops. Moreover, this field‐based evidence offers a robust empirical foundation for future modeling efforts aimed at assessing the ecological benefits of cover crops under varying climatic and soil conditions."

However, their spatiotemporal characteristics and interaction with urban heat island (UHI) are unexplored at the continental scale. Using observational data from over 2000 ground‐based stations over China, we find that CHWs constitute an increasing portion of HW hazard from 1961 to 2021. The increasing trend is especially evident when using the daily minimum temperature to define hot days, suggesting an aggravated thermal environment at night. Urban‐rural contrast of CHW trends illustrates that urbanization contributes substantially to the increased frequency of CHWs in cities, especially in southern China. Results show that mean UHI intensity (UHII) tends to weaken under HW and CHW conditions, which correlates with increased pressure and reduced precipitation. During CHW events, UHII reduces during cool break due to enhanced evaporative cooling in urban areas under precipitation. The interaction between UHI and HW is subject to change with background climate, which is positive for dry regions and negative for wet regions. This study provides insights into CHW evolution over mainland China and demonstrates the need for heat mitigation strategies under climate change."

We observed that growing rice under less flooded conditions decreased CH4 emissions and concentrations of grain total As, grain inorganic As, grain total Hg, and grain inorganic Hg relative to flooded conditions, with more reductions observed as conditions were drier; grain organic As and Hg (MeHg) species also decreased with drier conditions particularly in Year 1. However, the driest conditions tested led to a 50%–97% increase in grain Cd concentrations that exceeded the CODEX limit and grain yield reductions as high as 25% and 40% in Year 1 and 2, respectively. While concentrations of toxic metal(loid)s could be manipulated by water management, micronutrient concentrations were similar or decreased with drier conditions, potentially increasing grain Cd bioaccessibility to humans. Because practices for rice water management are gaining momentum, more research should monitor grain Cd levels along with micronutrients."

 Marine heatwaves, extended periods of elevated sea surface temperature, impact society and ecosystems, and deeper understanding of their drivers is needed to predict and mitigate adverse effects. These events can be particularly severe in the Mediterranean Sea during the summer although the factors that control their occurrence and duration are not fully known. Here we use a comprehensive multi-decadal macroevent dataset and a cluster analysis to investigate the atmospheric dynamics preceding the largest summer marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean Sea. Our study identifies the favourable conditions leading up to marine heatwave peaks and reveals that their main synoptic cause in the Mediterranean Sea is the combined effect of persistent subtropical anticyclonic ridges and associated weakening of prevailing wind systems. When persistent subtropical ridges are established over the region, the resulting decrease in wind speeds causes a substantial reduction in latent heat loss to the atmosphere, which accounts for over 70% of the total heat flux in affected regions. This reduction, combined with a moderate increase in short-wave radiation, generates and intensifies marine heatwaves. This synergistic relationship represents a key mechanism that is critical for skilfully predicting such atmospheric circulation patterns and realistically simulating their impacts on the marine environment. Reduced winds below subtropical ridges are a key factor in the initiation of summer marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean Sea, according to a statistical analysis of large marine heatwave events."

 The high cost and complexity of fabrication limit the large-scale application of flexible inorganic thermoelectric materials. Currently, Bi2Te3-based materials are the only commercially viable option, but the inclusion of Te significantly increases production costs. This study presents a simple and cost-effective method for fabricating flexible Ag2Se films, employing a combination of solvothermal synthesis, screen printing, and spark plasma sintering. The incorporation of a small amount of Te improves film density and facilitates Te diffusion doping, leading to Ag2Se films with a high power factor of 25.7 μW cm−1 K−2 and a figure of merit (ZT) of 1.06 at 303 K. These films exhibit excellent flexibility, retaining 96% of their performance after 1000 bending cycles at a 5 mm bending radius. Additionally, we design a flexible thermoelectric device featuring a triangular p-n junction structure based on these films. This device achieves a normalized power density of 4.8 μW cm−2 K−2 at a temperature difference of 20 K and a maximum cooling of 29.8 K with an input current of 92.4 mA.

 Cross-reactive antibodies targeting multiple epitopes have been identified in Sarbecoviruses, but the precise molecular mechanism(s) behind the crossreactivity remain poorly understood. Here, we isolate 3D1, a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) derived from a human combinatorial antibody library targeting the conserved HR1 domain. 3D1 uniquely recognizes a β-turn fold comprising a 6-mer peptide (pepDVVNQN/Q) that forms during a pre-hairpin transition state, occurring exclusively before membrane fusion during viral infection. 3D1 effectively neutralizes a wide range of live SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strains except for Omicron, which evades neutralization due to a detrimental point mutation (Q954H). Notably, this cryptic epitope reveals a signature motif that extends throughout the core region of coronaviruses and is also present in various RNA viruses, including HIV and Marburgvirus. 3D1 functions as a natural or background antibody capable of binding to a diverse array of non-self antigens. 3D1’s cross-reactivity underscores the effectiveness of the library approach, which encompasses the entire antibody repertoire.

 Mechanical forces acting on ligand-engaged T-cell receptors (TCR) have previously been implicated in T-cell antigen recognition and ligand discrimination, yet their magnitude, frequency, and impact remain unclear. Here, we quantitatively assess forces across various TCR:pMHC pairs with different bond lifetimes at single-molecule resolution, both before and during T-cell activation, on platforms that either include or exclude tangential force registration. For this purpose, we use glass-supported lipid bilayers presenting pMHC conjugated to a molecular force sensor unit at its base, adhesion factors and costimulatory molecules to the approaching T-cells. Our results imply that CD4 + T-cell TCRs experience significantly lower forces than previously estimated, with only a small fraction of ligand-engaged TCRs being subjected to these forces during antigen scanning. These rare and minute mechanical forces do not impact the global lifetime distribution of the TCR:ligand bond. We propose that the immunological synapse is created as biophysically stable environment to prevent pulling forces from disturbing antigen recognition. Mechanical forces at the immunological synapse are believed to influence antigen recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR).

 The Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with expression restricted to the developing nervous system. Most neuroblastomas express native ALK protein on the cell surface and ALK is uniformly overexpressed in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma and in subsets of metastatic colorectal carcinoma, melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and breast carcinoma. Here, we first confirm that ALK RNA, protein, and tumor cell surface expression is elevated in multiple pediatric and adult malignancies with minimal expression in childhood normal tissues. We then demonstrate that a humanized ALK-directed antibody conjugated to pyrrolobenzodiazepine (CDX0239-PBD) is internalized in ALK-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines with cell surface expression-dependent cytotoxicity. Finally, we show that CDX0239-PBD exhibits potent antitumor efficacy including maintained complete responses in ALK-expressing patient and cell line-derived neuroblastoma, fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, and colorectal carcinoma xenograft models. These data support the clinical development of a first-in-class ALK-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for multiple pediatric and adult ALK-expressing malignancies.

Here, authors substitute the p-site of cations with halogen for tuning distortion degree of inorganic layer and electric dipole moment of aromatic spacer, achieving ferroelectric anomalous photovoltaic effect of 38.2 V. 
 Halogen substitution effect, as one of the most feasible chemical strategies for exploiting new ferroelectric materials, holds a promise to optimize spontaneous polarization (Ps) and improve potential phase transition energy barrier. However, it is challenging to rationally regulate the photoferroelectric properties, e.g., ferroelectric photovoltaics. Through the p-site halogen substitution of spacer cations, we have obtained a series of two-dimensional hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics, (4x-benzylammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3Br10 ((4x-BA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10, abbreviated as 4x-BEB, x = F/Cl/Br/I), featuring the typical trilayered perovskite architecture. The p-site halogen-substituted BA+ cations enable precise tuning of both the distortion degree of inorganic layer and the electric dipole moment of aromatic spacer. This molecular engineering not only drives a progressive enhancement of Ps but also facilitates Br- ion migration, which are the driving forces for the ferroelectric anomalous photovoltaic effect (APVE). The member 4I-BEB shows a giant APVE of 38.2 V, exceeding other inorganic oxides and representing the highest value within the family of hybrid semiconductors. This halogen substitution strategy of spacer cations provides an effective way to design APV-active ferroelectric materials.

 Variations in cloud condensation nuclei number concentration (NCCN) significantly influence cloud microphysics, yet direct NCCN measurements remain challenging. Here, we present an NCCN ensemble learning (NEL) model utilizing ensemble learning and interpretability analysis on aerosol optical parameters. Validated at two land sites, two ocean sites and one polar site within the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program, the mean absolute percentage error range of the NEL model across different environments is from 12% to 36%, demonstrating high accuracy. Key findings reveal that aerosol optical parameters can serve as predictors for NCCN. Aerosol scattering and backscattering coefficients, absorption coefficient, backscatter fraction (BSF), and Ångström exponent (AE) are positively correlated with NCCN, while single scattering albedo shows negative correlations. NCCN prediction at land sites is highly sensitive to BSF, largely driven by the backscattering coefficient, as fine particles dominate in these sites. At ocean sites, NCCN prediction is more sensitive to AE, primarily influenced by the scattering coefficient, due to the higher proportion of larger particles. At the polar site, NCCN prediction shows sensitivity to both BSF and AE, mainly driven by the scattering coefficient, as polar sites are cleaner and contain larger particles. These differences reflect the variation in particle size and number concentration across different environments."

Four regions where MY La Niñas amplify SY La Niñas’ impacts on soil moisture were identified: North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the Sahel. SY La Niñas typically cause soil moisture drying in the Middle East and North America and wetting in Australia and the Sahel. MY La Niñas enhance these effects in the second DJF due to the strengthening of precipitation anomalies or the accumulation of precipitation-induced soil moisture anomalies, except in the Sahel where wetting is driven in part by evapotranspiration anomalies. Soil moisture variations are linked to La Niña-induced sea surface temperature changes in the Indian Ocean (for Australia and the Middle East) and the Pacific Ocean (for North America). These amplified effects are largely supported by the observed MY La Niña events from 1948 to 2022.

Barotropic energy conversion supplies eddy kinetic energy (EKE) to the first mode from lower-level climatological confluent westerlies downstream of the Somali Jet and over the BOB–western North Pacific. In contrast, the second mode derives EKE from the subtropical westerly confluence induced by Tibetan Plateau topography. Baroclinic energy conversion, extracting eddy available potential energy (EAPE) from the mean thermal structure, sustains the second mode while dampening the first. Convective heating generates EAPE for both modes, acting as feedback. Further analyses suggest these modes likely stem from internal dynamics. Our findings highlight the importance of internal energetic processes in SASM modulation."

 The spatial extent of an extreme heat event influences the total exposure of people and natural systems to heat-related stresses, straining water, energy, and emergency management resources. Here, we quantify how the contiguous area of individual heat wave events varies across heat wave types, time of year, and in response to observed climate change within the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Dataset. Across the mid-high latitudes, cold season heat waves cover areas that are 1.25 to 3 times larger than warm season events, and daytime heat waves impact 1.25 to 2 times the area of nighttime heat waves. The reverse relationship is found throughout tropical regions. Average heat wave size, regardless of type or season, has increased across most land in recent years, often by 1.5 to 2 times in the mid-latitudes. The contiguous spatial extent of dry soil anomalies and lower tropospheric subsidence events have also increased in some locations, potentially contributing to the increases in heat wave size.

 Tropical sea surface temperature warming displays distinct regional patterns, but its influence on Madden-Julian Oscillation propagation remains unclear. Here we investigate how a shift toward La Niña-like conditions around 1999 has affected Madden-Julian Oscillation propagation by comparing two periods: 1979–1998 and 2003–2022. Using satellite observations and reanalysis data, we show that propagation accelerated over the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent but slowed over the western Pacific in the later period. These contrasting responses are linked to changes in sea surface temperature patterns and associated atmospheric conditions. Over the Indian Ocean, enhanced low-level horizontal moisture gradients and increased upper-tropospheric stability facilitate propagation, while weakened moisture gradient and suppressed convection hinder it over the western Pacific. Despite complex terrain and atmospheric interactions over the Maritime Continent, background changes still favor enhanced propagation. These findings highlight the sensitivity of Madden-Julian Oscillation behavior to regional ocean–atmospheric conditions, with implications for improving subseasonal prediction.

 Forests play a crucial role in providing important ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and biomass production, while supporting the livelihoods of millions of people globally. Understanding the spatial relationship between human populations and forests is vital for assessing how these socio-environmental systems interact and evolve over time. However, a global scale understanding of these spatial relationships remains limited. Here, we address this gap by examining the joint global trends in human population and forest dynamics from 1975 to 2020. We assess two indicators of spatial and temporal trends: forest area per person (FAP) and forest proximate people (FPP), illustrating how the spatial interplay between humans and forests has changed over time. We then introduce the forest human nexus (FHN), a spatial indicator that integrates forest area per capita, forest accessibility, and population density to provide a geospatial assessment of human–forest relationships. Our analysis reveals an uneven distribution of FHN trends worldwide, reflecting severe ecological stress in many tropical regions and highlighting the need for targeted interventions. By offering detailed spatiotemporal insights and a new spatial metric for human–forest interactions, this study aims to inform policymakers, conservationists, development practitioners, and researchers in fostering more sustainable human–forest relationships.

 Reservoirs are widely recognized as sediment sinks, but the role of silted-up reservoirs as sediment sources remains poorly understood. This study presents quantitative assessments on episodic erosion effects of reservoirs in the Yellow River. Here we showed that sediment erosion during the 2019 flooding was 112 and 265 million tons at the Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi reservoirs, respectively. Nearly all the Sanmenxia erosion was attributable to natural floods, whereas only ~40% of the Xiaolangdi erosion resulted from natural floods with the rest from drawdown and artificial flooding. These erosions contributed ~1/4 of decadal fluvial sediment flux. Reservoir erosion increased downstream suspended sediment concentration by over two orders of magnitude. Threshold siltation ratios (sedimentation volume/storage capacity) for initial erosion in the studied reservoirs ranged from 28% to 87%, averaging 60% ± 21%. Considering many reservoirs experiencing >30% capacity loss and intensifying floods under global warming, reservoir erosion will become more frequent worldwide.

 The present-day distribution of surface and subsurface water on Mars reflects a complex history of exchange between the planet’s surface and interior since its formation. Constraining the water content of the deep mantle is essential for estimating the planet’s total water budget and understanding its long-term geologic and hydrologic evolution. Yet, the abundance of water at depth remains loosely constrained. Here, we analyze seismic data from global tectonic marsquakes and meteorite impacts recorded by the InSight mission, and identify evidence for weaker attenuation in Mars’ deep mantle (500–1500 km), in contrast to Earth. This low attenuation likely reflects fundamental differences in mantle properties between the two planets, including water content, grain size, oxygen fugacity, and/or temperature. Isolating the role of water from other parameters is key to quantifying Mars’ deep water reservoir and provides new constraints on the volatile inventory and interior evolution of the red planet.

 Fine-resolution maps of forest carbon and aboveground biomass (AGB) effectively represent spatial patterns and can be flexibly aggregated to map subregions by computing spatial averages or totals of pixel-level predictions. However, generalized model-based uncertainty estimation for spatial aggregates requires computationally expensive processes like iterative bootstrapping and computing pixel covariances. Uncertainty estimation for map subregions is critical for enhancing practicality and eventual adoption of model-based data products, as this capability would empower users to produce estimates at scales most germane to management of the landscape: individual forest stands and ownership parcels. In this study we produced estimates of standard error (SE) associated with spatial averages of fine-resolution AGB map predictions for a stratified random sample of ownership parcels (0–2023 hectares) in New York State (NYS). This represents the first model-based uncertainty estimation study to include all four types of uncertainty (reference data, sample variability, residual variability, and auxiliary data), incorporate spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, and use methods compatible with algorithmic modeling (machine learning or nonparametric). We found that uncertainty attributed to residual variance, largely resulting from spatial correlation of residuals, dominated all other sources for all of the parcels in the study. These results suggest that improvements to model accuracy will yield the greatest reductions to total uncertainty in regions like the northeastern and midwestern United States where forests are divided into smaller spatial units. Further, we demonstrated that log–log regression relating parcel characteristics (area, perimeter, AGB density, forest cover) to parcel-level SE can accurately estimate uncertainty for map subregions, thus providing a convenient means to empower map users. These findings support transparency in future model-based forest carbon accounting and monitoring efforts."

 Quantitative information on fracture distributions across Antarctic ice shelves is crucial for improving the predictability of ice shelf calving and retreat. Satellite imagery acquired by various optical and radar sensors provides a valuable resource for studying fracture processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Retrieving high-resolution fracture information at extended spatial and frequent temporal scales is particularly important for understanding the complex dynamics of ice shelves and improving the predictive modeling of their evolution. To efficiently retrieve spatiotemporal fracture information, we developed a novel multitask learning U-shaped network architecture (MLU-Net) for automatic and accurate fracture detection (including fracture areas and lines) from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We evaluated the performance and generalizability of MLU-Net through comprehensive experiments on the Amery, Thwaites Eastern, and Brunt ice shelves. Our results show that MLU-Net successfully maps the multitemporal fracture distributions over the three ice shelves in Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-1 SAR images, and that fusing the optical- and SAR-derived results enhances fracture detection. Quantitatively, MLU-Net achieves the highest F1 scores of 0.955 and 0.928 on the optical and SAR images, respectively, with a mean overall accuracy of 0.905 and a mean intersection over union of 0.792 across both image types. Beyond extracting fracture areas and lines, we formulated two fracture indices (fracture area-to-area and length-to-area ratios) that account for fracture distributions to characterize structural damage. Our findings indicate that the fracture area-to-area ratio is more sensitive to rift widening, while the fracture length-to-area ratio more effectively captures newly formed fractures with minimal sensitivity to image types and imaging conditions. Therefore, the proposed algorithm and fracture indices provide a promising framework for measuring ice shelf fractures at a continental scale, advancing the monitoring and modeling of ice shelf dynamics."

 Variations in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) significantly influence flooding patterns, particularly through alterations in forest and cropland. However, existing flood prediction studies rarely utilize LULC maps as direct training inputs, typically generating probabilistic rather than spatially explicit flood distribution maps. This study addresses this gap by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with multi-source remote sensing data to predict flood distribution from LULC maps. We focus specifically on “Returning Cropland to Forest” initiative of China using 2020 remote sensing data from the Poyang Lake region. Flood impact ranges were extracted through Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data fusion, producing 3,972 LULC-flood map pairs for model training and validation. The multi-source fusion approach achieved substantial improvements in flood extraction accuracy. User accuracy increased from 60% (SAR-only) to 90% (SAR-optical fusion), while overall classification accuracy reached 89.76% with an F1 score of 94.58%. Model performance validation through Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores demonstrated high-quality flood map generation, with FID decreasing from 81.5 to 53 at epoch 45. Analysis revealed that reforestation ratios exceeding 50% significantly reduce flood occurrence. Optimal effectiveness was observed when forests are strategically positioned along rivers and lake edges rather than randomly distributed. These findings provide actionable guidance for planners to prioritize riparian zones for initial reforestation, then systematically achieve 50% reforestation ratios in flood-prone watersheds, integrating these targets within existing regulatory frameworks. This research contributes a robust framework for integrating LULC data into predictive flood models, advancing sustainable flood management and enhancing water resource security strategies."

 To better monitor global water resources, and understand how they will vary in the future, it is critical to track the extent and intensity of irrigated agriculture. Within the past decade, there has been increased interest in the satellite-based detection of anomalous soil moisture (SM) and/or evapotranspiration (ET) signals associated with irrigation. However, little comparative information is available concerning the relative merits of available ET versus SM satellite products for this purpose. Such uncertainty has hampered the development of optimal monitoring strategies that appropriately integrate information acquired across a range of remote sensing resources. Here, using relatively more mature irrigation products derived from a combination of ground data and visible/near-infrared remote sensing as a reference, we compare the skill of microwave (MW) SM and thermal-infrared (TIR) ET satellite products for mapping coarse-scale (36-km) spatial variations in the proportion of land irrigated across the conterminous United States. Results suggest that, while spatial mapping skill exists in both products, the irrigation signal in satellite-based ET products is stronger, and easier to interpret, than the analogous signal in SM products. Since MW-based SM and TIR-based ET products appear to possess approximately equal spatial precision (i.e., spatial correlations with respect to true SM and ET, respectively), this difference is attributed to the stronger impact of irrigation on spatial ET patterns versus surface SM.Plain Language Summary: To better monitor global water resources, and understand how they will vary in the future, it is important to track the extent and intensity of irrigated agriculture. To do this, different satellite-based methods have been proposed to track irrigation from space. Unfortunately, there has been little comparison of these methods, and it is unclear which ones work best. Here, we compare methods for monitoring irrigation based on two different remote sensing techniques: thermal infrared and passive microwave. While information derived from both types of remote sensing is useful for irrigation monitoring, results show that thermal-infrared remote sensing contains more information. This insight will help improve future efforts to globally monitor irrigation using satellite-based sensors."

 Under cloudy and rainy conditions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can provide essential data support for large-scale and high-timeliness flood monitoring. Although an optimal combination for Sentinel-1 VV-VH polarization data has been selected for flood mapping, its performance on complex terrains is not satisfactory, and it is unknown whether it can be further extended to generalize co- and cross-polarization data (not only VV-VH but also HH-HV). Therefore, we propose a shadow-robust unsupervised flood mapping method, called Topography and Dual-polarization Flood Mapping (TODFLOM). This method initially utilizes topography features to identify safe areas where floods are unlikely to occur in complex scenarios. Then, a Generalized Dual-Polarization Flood Index (GDPFI), based on the microwave scattering characteristics of complex inundation scenarios, is constructed to highlight flood features. Finally, GDPFI coupled with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used for generating the flood map, enabling the method to effectively suppress mountain shadows in areas with slopes below 30°. The integration of topography features and GDPFI-GMM empowers TODFLOM to remove shadows impact with a 5° safety threshold. Experiments reveal that TODFLOM achieves an F1 score greater than 0.88 across all four flood datasets, outperforming other advanced methods in large-scale complex inundation scenarios."

 Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), such as poultry farms, contribute significantly to air pollution, particularly ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Vegetative environmental buffers (VEBs) offer a sustainable, cost-effective, and low-maintenance solution for mitigating NH3 and PM emissions from CAFOs, and some previous studies showed that pollutant concentrations behind the VEBs were substantially reduced compared with concentration directly from the source. However, due to the lack of a controlled dataset for non-VEB situations, the net effect of VEBs could hardly be assessed. Thus, the dataset from the previous study was used to develop a methodology for quantitatively evaluating the efficacy of VEBs in reducing NH3 and PM emissions from a poultry house, and to distinguish the net pollutant reduction achieved by VEBs from those resulting merely from atmospheric dilution and dispersion. The results showed that VEB can effectively mitigate air pollutants emissions and attributes enhanced ground-level reductions of NH3 (72.7 % ± 9.1 %), total suspended particle (TSP) (61.9 % ± 10.0 %), PM10 (62.5 % ± 9.9 %) and PM2.5 (94.6 % ± 6.5 %). In addition, VEB demonstrated better mitigation performance during daytime. Meteorological conditions showed no correlation with pollutant concentrations or enhanced reduction ratios while significant positive correlations between reductions of NH3 and PM were also observed. These results demonstrated that VEBs are effective in reducing NH3 and PM emissions from poultry houses. The results from this study will inform conservation practice guidelines and assist land managers in employing VEBs for poultry house emitted air pollution reductions."

We found that maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG), ingested in the first week of life, restrained microbiota-dependent adaptive immune responses weeks later, after weaning. This activity was linked to maternal antibodies that could bind bacteria in the neonatal gut and the ability of microbe-IgG complexes to engage Fc and complement-dependent effector functions in offspring. Ingestion of microbiota-specific maternal IgG also limited aberrant neonatal responses to dietary antigens encountered at weaning. These discoveries suggest that maternal IgG engages the immune system of offspring in early postnatal life to tune mucosal responses and reinforce intestinal homeostasis in the face of dynamic shifts in food and bacterial antigens during development."
