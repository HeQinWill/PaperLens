10.1021/acsestair.4c00141,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究利用多模式化学成像和高分辨率质谱技术，对休斯顿市区有机气溶胶的分子组成进行了研究。研究重点关注了有机硫酸盐（CHOS）和有机硝酸盐（CHNO）等分子官能团，这些官能团是二次有机气溶胶（SOA）的重要示踪剂。研究发现，SOA的组成在一天中存在显著变化，并与风速/方向、相对湿度（RH）和温度等气象因素有关。研究结果揭示了休斯顿市区SOA组成的季节性和时间分布特征，为城市大气环境监测和空气质量管理提供了重要参考。,"['organic aerosols', 'secondary organic aerosols', 'SOA', 'molecular composition', 'chemical imaging', 'high resolution mass spectrometry', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Tania Gautam;Gregory W.

Steiner;Swarup China,"Chemical Insights into the Molecular Composition of Organic Aerosols in the Urban Region of Houston, Texas","Molecular functional groups, such as organosulfates (CHOS) and organonitrates (CHNO) are important tracers for field observations of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). While CHOS and CHNO are prevalent in the atmosphere, there is a lack of knowledge regarding daily and day- and night-time variations in these species in the urban atmosphere. Meteorological factors such as wind speed/direction, relative humidity (RH), and temperature can influence the formation of CHOS/CHNO. To investigate these trends, we utilized multimodal chemical imaging and advanced high resolution mass spectrometry techniques to acquire particle speciation and molecular formulas (MFs) associated with day and night sampling periods. Back trajectory analyses revealed the oceanic influence of southern wind airmasses in later June sampling periods with organic fractions <10%. Conversely, northern winds in early June sampling periods contributed to the episodic emergence of extremely low volatile organics (ELVOCs) and organic factions up to 41%. The observed unique MFs to June 3 (223 MFs) and to June 4 (144 MFs) were largely found to be of biogenic rather than anthropogenic origin. Our findings reveal episodic prevalence and temporal distribution of SOA constituents across the urban region of Houston, Texas."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00130,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究利用卫星观测的PM2.5浓度数据，结合人口变化和基线死亡率，评估了2001年至2021年间加拿大PM2.5暴露导致的死亡人数。研究发现，尽管PM2.5暴露水平下降，但人口增长和老龄化导致基线死亡率上升，最终导致PM2.5相关死亡人数略有增加。这项研究表明，卫星遥感技术在空气质量监测和健康影响评估方面发挥着重要作用。,"['ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5)', 'satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations', 'air quality monitoring', 'health impact analysis']",Elysia G.

Burnett,"Mortality Attributable to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter Exposure in a Changing Canadian Population, 2001 to 2021","We aim to understand how changes in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the last two decades have influenced PM2.5-attributable mortality in a Canadian population experiencing both growth and changing baseline health status. We conducted a health impact analysis using dynamic estimates of population, baseline mortality rates, and satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations to estimate mortality attributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure every five years between 2001 and 2021, applying risk estimates from the 2006 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) to the population aged 25 and older. We conducted a decomposition analysis to examine the influences of population exposure, size, and health status on trends in PM2.5-attributable mortality. Between 2001 and 2021, population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 declined by 18% in Canada, with improvements occurring in most urban areas. In recent years, these changes have led to 4,400 (95% CI: 3,700–5,000) to 4,700 (95% CI: 4,100–5,400) fewer PM2.5-attributable deaths annually based on log–linear and log–log shapes of concentration–response. However, a growing population alongside higher baseline mortality risks in several regions, likely due to aging, has led to a small net increase in total PM2.5-attributable deaths between 2001 and 2021. These findings suggest that the Canadian population has benefitted broadly from air quality management strategies implemented in North America over recent decades."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00128,True,ACS ES&T Air,这篇论文研究了利用美国环保署的社区多尺度空气质量模型（CMAQ）进行的伴随建模，以提供北美范围内控制主要 PM2.5 和 PM2.5 前体物（NOx、SO2 和 NH3）带来的位置特异性货币化健康益处。该研究使用每吨效益（BPT）指标量化了源到健康效益关系，并考虑了长期暴露于细颗粒物导致的过早死亡的影响。论文对基础分析中使用的模型分辨率、代表性事件选择、排放年份和流行病学模型等因素进行了敏感性分析，以评估这些选择对结果的影响。研究发现，伴随建模方法对模型选择具有鲁棒性，能够提供高度细粒度的 BPT 估计值，涵盖了不同地点和排放物质。,"['air quality', 'emissions', 'modeling', 'health benefits', 'PM2.5', 'precursors', 'sensitivity analysis']",Amir Hakami;Shunliu Zhao;Petros Vasilakos;Anas Alhusban;Yasar Burak Oztaner;Alan Krupnick;Howard Chang;Armistead Russell,Spatiotemporally Detailed Quantification of Air Quality Benefits of Emissions–Part II: Sensitivity to Study Parameters and Assumptions,"Adjoint modeling, using U.S. EPA’s Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), has been performed to provide location-specific monetized health benefits from the controls of primary PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (NOx, SO2, and NH3) across North America. Source-to-health benefit relationships are quantified using a benefit-per-ton (BPT) metric, accounting for the impacts on premature mortality due to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter. In the base analysis, the approach used a 12 km resolution, four 2-week episodes chosen to capture annual responses, emissions for 2016, and the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to link exposures to premature mortality. Here, we investigate the impacts those choices have on results using a range of sensitivity analyses. The choice of four representative episodes led to relatively little bias and error. Finer model resolution, investigated by comparing 36, 12, 4, and 1 km simulations over two urban areas, tended to increase BPT estimates, though the impact was inconsistent between different regions. While BPTs and burden estimates were consistent across resolutions over New York City, they sharply increased for Los Angeles, particularly for NOx and ammonia, leading to 90% increase in burden estimates at 1 km resolution. We find that, for primary PM2.5 emissions, better resolved population distribution is the main contributing factor to higher BPTs, but for secondary precursor emissions (ammonia and NOx), higher model resolution that avoids dilution in coarser grids is more important. Changing emissions from 2016 to 2001 and 2028 resulted in fairly consistent primary PM2.5 BPTs but impacted the BPTs for NOx and ammonia more significantly due to changes in SO2 emissions. We found that BPTs tend to stabilize, as emission changes in 2028 lead to a lower deviation from 2016 BPTs compared to changes from the 2001 episode. The role of the epidemiological model also led to relatively modest uncertainties, 15–30% depending on the species, even when different shapes of concentration–response functions were employed. We found the impact of the choice of CRF to be larger or comparable in size to the reported epidemiological model uncertainties for log–linear CRFs. The adjoining approach proved robust to modeling choices in providing BPT estimates that are highly granular across locations and emitted species."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00120,True,ACS ES&T Air,这篇论文研究了利用卫星观测数据（VIIRS）和地面监测数据（PurpleAir）来估算阿拉斯加野火季期间地表PM2.5浓度的方法。研究发现，利用气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）与地表PM2.5浓度之间的转换因子来估算地表PM2.5存在误差，因为气溶胶的垂直分布会影响估算结果。论文提出了一种基于观测数据的分段函数，可以更准确地估算地表PM2.5浓度，并验证了该方法的有效性。,"['aerosol optical depth', 'PM2.5', 'wildfire', 'satellite observations', 'VIIRS', 'air quality monitoring']",Tianlang Zhao;Jingqiu Mao;Pawan Gupta;Huanxin Zhang;Jun Wang,Observational Constraints on the Aerosol Optical Depth–Surface PM2.5 Relationship during Alaskan Wildfire Seasons,"Wildfire is one of the main sources of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm) in the Alaskan summer. The complexity in wildfire smokes, as well as limited coverage of ground measurements, poses a big challenge to estimate surface PM2.5 during wildfire season in Alaska. Here we aim at proposing a quick and direct method to estimate surface PM2.5 over Alaska, especially in places exposed to strong wildfire events with limited measurements. We compare the AOD–surface PM2.5 conversion factor (η = PM2.5/AOD; AOD, aerosol optical depth) from the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (ηGC) and from observations (ηobs). We show that ηGC is biased high compared to ηobs under smoky conditions, largely because GEOS-Chem assigns the majority of AOD (67%) within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) when AOD > 1, inconsistent with satellite retrievals from CALIOP. The overestimation in ηGC can be to some extent improved by increasing the injection height of wildfire emissions. We constructed a piecewise function for ηobs across different AOD ranges based on VIIRS-SNPP AOD and PurpleAir surface PM2.5 measurements over Alaska in the 2019 summer and then applied it on VIIRS AOD to derive daily surface PM2.5 over continental Alaska in the 2021 and 2022 summers. The derived satellite PM2.5 shows a good agreement with corrected PurpleAir PM2.5 in Alaska during the 2021 and 2022 summers, suggesting that aerosol vertical distribution likely represents the largest uncertainty in converting AOD to surface PM2.5 concentrations. This piecewise function, η′obs, shows the capability of providing an observation-based, quick and direct estimation of daily surface PM2.5 over the whole of Alaska during wildfires, without running a 3-D model in real time."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00113,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究提出了一种新的机器学习模型，用于预测大气气溶胶组分的饱和蒸气压。饱和蒸气压是描述环境毒素和污染物迁移、分布、传质和归宿的重要物理性质。该模型使用COSMO模型的σ-谱作为分子描述符，并分别针对液态和固态化合物进行训练。该模型在预测固态化合物的升华压方面优于所有基团贡献模型。研究表明，该模型可以用于预测大气相关物质的饱和蒸气压，并与新的实验方法获得的结果进行比较。该模型为更好地描述这一关键性质提供了工具，并提高了测量结果的置信度。,"['atmospheric aerosol constituents', 'saturation vapor pressures', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Noora Hyttinen;Linjie Li;Mattias Hallquist;Cheng Wu,Machine Learning Model to Predict Saturation Vapor Pressures of Atmospheric Aerosol Constituents,"We present a novel machine learning (ML) model for predicting saturation vapor pressures (psat), a physical property of use to describe transport, distribution, mass transfer, and fate of environmental toxins and contaminants. The ML model uses σ-profiles from the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) as molecular descriptors. The main advantages in using σ-profiles instead of other types of molecular representations are the relatively small size of the descriptor and the fact that the addition of new elements does not affect the size of the descriptor. The ML model was trained separately for liquid and solid compounds using experimental vapor pressures at various temperatures. The 95% confidence intervals of the error in the liquid- and solid-phase log10(psat/Pa) are 1.02 and 1.4, respectively. Especially our solid-phase model outperforms all group-contribution models in predicting experimental sublimation pressures of solid compounds. To demonstrate its applicability, the model was used to predict psat of atmospherically relevant species, and the values were compared with those obtained from a new experimental method. Here, our model provided a tool for a better description of this critical property and gave a higher confidence in the measurements."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00095,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究主要关注室内外空气中全氟烷基和多氟烷基物质（PFAS）的浓度和分布，通过对不同时间和地点的空气样品进行分析，研究了PFAS的时空变化规律以及气相和颗粒相的分配情况。研究结果表明，FTOHs和FOSA/E在室内空气中的浓度明显高于室外空气，并且PFAS的浓度在温暖月份高于寒冷月份。该研究为室内空气中新兴PFAS的基线浓度提供了数据，并有助于理解PFAS的气相-颗粒相分配。虽然该研究没有直接使用卫星遥感技术，但其对PFAS在空气中的浓度和分布的研究结果，可以为大气环境遥感技术提供重要的参考数据，例如，可以用于改进大气模型中PFAS的排放和传输模拟，以及开发新的遥感方法来监测PFAS污染。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'PFAS', 'indoor air', 'outdoor air']",Wen-Long Li and Kurunthachalam Kannan,Determination of Legacy and Emerging Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Indoor and Outdoor Air,"Despite increasing awareness of health risks associated with exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), studies on analysis of these chemicals in air are limited. In this study, an extensive sampling of indoor and outdoor air (at a residential neighborhood) was performed to determine the occurrence, temporal variation, and gas/particle partitioning of PFAS. Among 58 PFAS analyzed in air (sum of gas and particulate phases), fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) were found at the highest concentrations (1900 ± 2000 pg/m3). The concentrations of FTOHs and perfluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSA/E) were 4.9−5.9 times higher in indoor air than those in residential outdoor air (p < 0.05). Emerging PFAS such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), chlorinated polyfluoroether sulfonate (Cl-PFESA), and ADONA were detected at average concentrations ranging from 0.10 to 4.4 pg/m3. We found significant temporal variations in PFAS concentrations, with concentrations higher in warmer than colder months. The majority of ionic PFAS (>50%) such as PFOS were detected in the particulate phase, whereas FTOHs partition predominantly to the vapor phase. This study establishes baseline indoor air concentrations of emerging PFAS and contributes to the understanding of gas−particle partitioning of PFAS."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00093,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究关注城市空气污染物中细颗粒物（PM2.5）的氧化潜势（OP）的季节性变化。研究者通过分析PM2.5中可溶性铁和铜的含量，以及有机物和酸度的变化，结合肺部氧化化学动力学模型，预测了不同季节下PM2.5的氧化潜势。研究发现，夏季高有机配体浓度和低气溶胶pH值导致OP最高，而冬季则相反。该研究强调了大气化学老化对城市空气污染物氧化负荷的影响，并揭示了季节性变化对人群健康的潜在影响。,"['air quality monitoring', 'PM2.5', 'oxidative potential', 'transition metals', 'seasonal changes', 'chemical composition', 'aerosol', 'emission sources']",Pourya Shahpoury;Steven Lelieveld;Deepchandra Srivastava;Andrea Baccarini;Jacob Mastin;Thomas Berkemeier;Valbona Celo;Ewa Dabek-Zlotorzynska;Tom Harner;Gerhard Lammel;Athanasios Nenes,Seasonal Changes in the Oxidative Potential of Urban Air Pollutants: The Influence of Emission Sources and Proton- and Ligand-Mediated Dissolution of Transition Metals,"The inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major contributor to adverse health effects from air pollution worldwide. An important toxicity pathway is thought to follow oxidative stress from the formation of exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body, a proxy of which is oxidative potential (OP). As redox-active transition metals and organic species are important drivers of OP in urban environments, we investigate how seasonal changes in emission sources, aerosol chemical composition, acidity, and metal dissolution influence OP dynamics. Using a kinetic model of the lung redox chemistry, we predicted ROS (O2•–, H2O2, •OH) formation with input parameters comprising the ambient concentrations of PM2.5, water-soluble Fe and Cu, secondary organic matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone across two years and two urban sites in Canada. Particulate species were the largest contributors to ROS production. Soluble Fe and Cu had their highest and lowest values in summer and winter, and changes in Fe solubility were closely linked to seasonal variations in chemical aging, the acidity of aerosol, and organic ligand levels. The results indicate three conditions that influence OP across various seasons: (a) low aerosol pH and high organic ligand levels leading to the highest OP in summer, (b) opposite trends leading to the lowest OP in winter, and (c) intermediate conditions corresponding to moderate OP in spring and fall. This study highlights how atmospheric chemical aging modifies the oxidative burden of urban air pollutants, resulting in a seasonal cycle with a potential effect on population health."

Smith,Optical Properties of Biomass Burning Aerosols from Simulated Wildfires and Prescribed Fires with Representative Fuel Beds from the Southeast United States,"We report measurements of the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) and single scattering albedo (SSA) of biomass burning aerosol from the combustion of fuel beds representing three eco-regions of the Southeast U.S. (Piedmont, Coastal Plain, and Blue Ridge Mountains) with moisture content representative of wildfires and prescribed fires. We find a strong correlation between the AAE and SSA for both simulated wildfires (low fuel moisture) and prescribed fires (higher fuel moisture). For wildfires, the AAE and SSA are strongly dependent on the eco-region of the fuel bed and span a much wider range (AAE = 1.3–4.2, SSA = 0.75–0.97) than they do for prescribed fires (AAE = 2.4–3.1, SSA = 0.88–0.96). The AAE and SSA are also found to be correlated with the fraction of total carbon that is elemental carbon (fEC) for both wildfires and prescribed fires, but the range of fEC observed (0.02–0.14) from the fuel beds is much smaller than that reported previously from laboratory studies using individual fuels. The observations from the present study suggest that fuel-bed composition and moisture content are significant factors in determining the relative amount of organic material in biomass burning aerosols and, consequentially, their optical properties."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00089,True,ACS ES&T Air,这篇论文研究了生物质燃烧产生的棕色碳（BrC）的光吸收特性，特别是模拟野火和计划火灾条件下的情况。研究人员通过改变燃料床的含水量来模拟不同类型的火灾，并分析了不同燃烧条件下产生的BrC的光吸收特性。研究发现，BrC的光吸收特性与燃烧条件密切相关，例如燃料床的含水量和组成。这对于大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测和空气质量监测，具有重要意义，因为BrC的光吸收特性会影响大气辐射平衡，进而影响气候变化和空气质量。,"['brown carbon', 'aerosol', 'light absorption', 'wildfire', 'satellite observation', 'air quality']",Chase K.

O’Brien;Rawad Saleh,Brown Carbon Emissions from Biomass Burning under Simulated Wildfire and Prescribed-Fire Conditions,"We investigated the light-absorption properties of brown carbon (BrC) as part of the Georgia Wildland-Fire Simulation Experiment. We constructed fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in the Southeastern U.S. and varied the fuel-bed moisture content to simulate either prescribed fires or drought-induced wildfires. Based on decreasing fire radiative energy normalized by fuel-bed mass loading (FREnorm), the combustion conditions were grouped into wildfire (Wild), prescribed fire (Rx), and wildfire involving duff ignition (WildDuff). The emitted BrC ranged from weakly absorbing (WildDuff) to moderately absorbing (Rx and Wild) with the imaginary part of the refractive index (k) values that were well-correlated with FREnorm. We apportioned the BrC into water-soluble (WSBrC) and water-insoluble (WIBrC). Approximately half of the WSBrC molecules detected using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry were potential chromophores. Nevertheless, k of WSBrC was an order of magnitude smaller than k of WIBrC. Furthermore, k of WIBrC was well-correlated with FREnorm while k of WSBrC was not, suggesting different formation pathways between WIBrC and WSBrC. Overall, the results signify the importance of combustion conditions in determining BrC light-absorption properties and indicate that variables in wildland fires, such as moisture content and fuel-bed composition, impact BrC light-absorption properties to the extent that they influence combustion conditions."

The resolution dependence of simulated η warrants further investigation. In this study, we calculate geophysical PM2.5 with simulated η from the GEOS-Chem model in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) at cubed-sphere resolutions of C360 (∼25 km) and C48 (∼200 km) and satellite AOD at 0.01° (∼1 km). Annual geophysical PM2.5 concentrations inferred from satellite AOD and GCHP simulations at ∼25 km and ∼200 km resolutions exhibit remarkable similarity (R2 = 0.96, slope = 1.03). This similarity in part reflects opposite resolution responses across components with population-weighted normalized mean difference (PW-NMD) increasing by 5% to 11% for primary species while decreasing by −30% to −5% for secondary species at finer resolution. Despite global similarity, our results also identify larger resolution sensitivities of η over isolated pollution sources and mountainous regions, where spatial contrast of aerosol concentration and composition is better represented at fine resolution. Our results highlight the resolution dependence of representing near-surface concentrations and the vertical distribution of chemically different species with implications for inferring ground-level PM2.5 from columnar AOD."

Measured time series of trace gases and radical concentrations are compared to zero-dimensional box model calculations, based on the Master Chemical Mechanism (agreement within 30%) and complemented by state-of-the-art structure–activity relationships (SAR). Including RO2 isomerization reactions from SAR, validated with theoretical calculations, improves particularly the model–measurement agreement by ∼20% for n-hexane. The photooxidation of the chosen compounds generates different types of peroxy radicals (RO2) which produce HO2 after one or multiple RO2+NO reaction steps, depending on the formed alkoxy radical (RO). Measurements show that the HO2/RO2 ratio is up to ∼40% lower and the number of odd oxygen (Ox = O3+NO2) formed per OH+VOC reaction (P(Ox)VOC) is up to ∼30% higher if RO regenerates RO2 instead of forming HO2 directly. Though, the formation of organic nitrates nearly completely compensates for the ozone production from the second NO reaction step for nitrate yields higher than 20%. Measured and modelled HO2/RO2 ratios agree well as does P(Ox)VOC, derived from measured/modelled radical concentrations and calculated from measured Ox."

Veres,Online Calibration of a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer for Multifunctional Biogenic Organic Nitrates,"Multifunctional organic nitrates derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds are important for understanding ozone and secondary organic aerosol production from oxidation reactions in the presence of nitrogen oxides. Their measurement is challenging, in part because the quantification of these compounds is difficult and time consuming due to the techniques required to synthesize and purify authentic standards. We describe a novel online synthesis and separation technique and demonstrate its use for calibration of a chemical ionization mass spectrometer using iodide reagent ions (I– CIMS) to measure four isomers of isoprene hydroxy nitrate (IHN; C5H9NO4), two isomers of methyl vinyl ketone hydroxy nitrate (MVKHN; C4H7NO5), and four isomers of monoterpene hydroxy nitrate (MTHN; C10H17NO4). We further apply our separation technique to an isoprene + NO3 + HO2 online reactor to calibrate for six isomers of isoprene hydroperoxide nitrate (C5H9NO5). We find a large range of detection sensitivities and ion molecule reactor (IMR) temperature dependencies among the reported analytes measured as iodide (I–) clusters. We report a wide range of normalized sensitivities (normalized Hz pptv–1; nHz pptv–1) normalized by the [I·H2O]− reagent ion signal for this class of analytes (0.2–82 nHz pptv–1). The (4,3)-MVKHN isomer is exceptional for its high sensitivity with this ion chemistry (82 ± 5 nHz pptv–1), which can lead to an inaccurate representation of the organic nitrate budget if a moderate sensitivity is assumed. The I– CIMS demonstrates a much smaller range of sensitivities to IHNs (10–34 nHz pptv–1), with the two most abundant isomers having similar sensitivities ((1,2): 24 ± 3 nHz pptv–1; (4,3): 30 ± 4 nHz pptv–1). These calibrations reveal a significantly different distribution of organic nitrates than would be determined assuming uniform sensitivity for measurements with an I– CIMS at a ground site in Pasadena, CA, during the summer of 2021. A comparison with another calibrated CIMS (using CF3O– reagent ions) for select compounds showed good agreement for IHN and MVKHN."

Their aqueous extracts were nebulized simultaneously to an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and a recently developed extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) mass spectrometer, for bulk and near-molecular organic aerosol (OA) composition, respectively. Carbonate was quantified using EESI and a total organic carbon analyzer to separate inorganic carbon from dust. Via isotopically-labelled internal standards and positive matrix factorization, seven water-soluble sources were quantified separately using the AMS- and EESI-based analyses, with consistent types, concentrations, and correlations. These include dust, solid fuel combustion (SFC)-related, nitrogen- (and sulfur-) containing, summer/winter oxygenated OAs, and a cigarette-related OA only in EESI. When accounting for water-solubility, SFC-related OAs were the largest (53%) sources in Chongqing, while dust (consisting of 77% OA and 23% carbonates) was the largest (30%) source in Xi’an. Overall, this study presents one of the first times that complementary mass spectrometric techniques independently resolved consistent OA sources─with added chemical information─over multiple seasons and locations of complex pollution. The methods and quantified sources are essential for subsequent chemical, modelling, and health studies, and policy making for air pollution mitigation."

Sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are two of the largest contributors to PM2.5 in Mexico City, but uncertainties exist regarding their sources, distribution across individual particles, and ability to form organosulfates. Herein, we show using electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy that only 41 ± 1% and 25 ± 1% of particles (aerodynamic diameter, 0.32–0.56 μm) by number at two sites in Mexico City, respectively, contain sulfur. Vibrational spectroscopy (Optical-Photothermal Infrared + Raman Microspectroscopy) shows that these sulfur-containing particles consist of inorganic sulfate (SO42–) and organosulfates (ROSO3–). In addition, we unexpectedly measured abundant isoprene-derived SOA from low nitric oxide reaction pathways, specifically organosulfates (methyltetrol sulfates = avg. 50 ng/m3, max. 150 ng/m3) and polyols (methyltetrols = avg. 70 ng/m3, max. 190 ng/m3) using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Differences in SO2 and NOx concentrations between sites likely contribute to these spatial differences in sulfate, organosulfate, and SOA formation. These findings improve understanding of sulfur distribution and sources of SOA in Mexico City, which can inform efforts to improve air quality."

Although it is generally assumed that deposition is the major sink, aqueous reactions in aerosols and clouds may be possible but have yet to be considered. Here, we report a study of the aqueous reactions of urea with methylglyoxal as a function of pH using optical property measurements as a proxy for reaction. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy is used to monitor bulk-phase browning while cavity ringdown and photoacoustic spectroscopies are used to measure the aerosol optical properties. We observe the reaction of urea with methylglyoxal produces brown carbon at low and high pH, with little absorption at mid-pH ranges. The urea brown carbon products absorb well into the visible range, providing a greater overlap with the solar emission spectrum than previously studied brown carbon systems including that of methylglyoxal and ammonium. These experiments suggest that urea could be chemically transformed in aqueous aerosol with the products contributing to aerosol absorption."

Daun,Estimation and Applications of Uncertainty in Methane Emissions Quantification Technologies: A Bayesian Approach,"An accurate understanding of uncertainty is needed to properly interpret methane emission estimates from upstream oil and gas sources in a variety of contexts, from component-level measurements to yearly jurisdiction-wide inventories. To characterize measurement uncertainty, we examine controlled release (CR) data from five different technology providers including quantitative gas imaging (QOGI), tunable diode laser-absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS); and airborne near-infrared hyperspectral (NIR HS) imaging. We introduce a novel empirical method to develop probability distributions of measurements given a true emission rate using the CR data. The approach includes flexible likelihoods which capture complex relationships in the data. An algorithm which provides the distribution of the true emission rate given a measurement is also developed, which synthesizes the measurement with the CR data and external information about the possible true emission rate. The results show that flexible models that accommodate complex nonlinear behavior are needed to adequately model measurement error. We also show that measurement error can vary under different conditions. We demonstrate that measurement uncertainty can be reduced by performing repeated measurements. A limitation of the study is that the collected CR data is collected under controlled conditions that may differ from those in industrial settings. As new CR data become available, the models presented in this paper can be refit to consider more diverse scenarios. The methodology can be extended to explicitly model different conditions to improve performance."

Burns were conducted under conditions representative of wildfires, which are common unplanned occurrences in Southeastern forests (low fuel moisture content), and prescribed fires, which are commonly used in forest management (higher fuel moisture content). Upon exposure to radiation from UV lamps equivalent to approximately 5 h in the atmosphere, the absorption spectra of all six samples exhibited up to 40% photobleaching in the UV range (280–400 nm) and as much as 30% photo-enhancement in the visible range (400–500 nm). Together, these two effects reduced the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), a measure of the wavelength dependence of the spectrum, from 6.0–7.9 before photolysis to 5.0–5.7 after. Electrospray ionization ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry analysis shows the potential formation of oligomeric chromophores due to aqueous photolysis.

There is limited knowledge of how NO2 inequalities vary in urban air quality contexts, in part from the lack of time-varying neighborhood-level NO2 measurements. First, we demonstrate that daily TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs) resolve a major portion of census tract-scale NO2 inequalities in Houston, comparing NO2 inequalities based on TROPOMI TVCDs and spatiotemporally coincident airborne remote sensing (250 m × 560 m) from the NASA TRacking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment–Air Quality (TRACER-AQ). We further evaluate the application of daily TROPOMI TVCDs to census tract-scale NO2 inequalities (May 2018–November 2022). This includes explaining differences between mean daily NO2 inequalities and those based on TVCDs oversampled to 0.01° × 0.01° and showing daily NO2 column-surface relationships weaken as a function of observation separation distance. Second, census tract-scale NO2 inequalities, city-wide high O3, and mesoscale airflows are found to covary using principal component and cluster analysis. A generalized additive model of O3 mixing ratios versus NO2 inequalities reproduces established nonlinear relationships between O3 production and NO2 concentrations, providing observational evidence that neighborhood-level NO2 inequalities and O3 are coupled. Consequently, emissions controls specifically in Black, Latinx, and Asian communities will have co-benefits, reducing both NO2 disparities and high O3 days city wide."

Focusing on non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) properties measured by high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS), the research extends to organic aerosol (OA) sources identified via positive matrix factorization of high-resolution MS data. The models achieved good predictive accuracy (R2 > 0.90) for all species concentrations, except for hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) due to frequent concentration fluctuations. The model outcomes aligned well with those previously achieved using conventional methods (chemical transport model and correlational analysis), confirming that relative humidity is associated with nocturnal nitrate concentration and photochemistry associated with sulfate concentration in the summertime in Seoul. Importantly, the models revealed mostly nonlinear relationships between atmospheric factors, such as temperature and particulate matter (PM) components, thereby deepening the understanding of formation processes. Notably, different potential formation mechanisms were discerned for more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) and oxidized primary OA (OPOA). For MO-OOA, SHAP analysis showed a plateau in SHAP values at an Ox concentration of 0.085 ppm, which suggested potential fragmentation from further oxidation and agreed with previous chamber experiments. Conversely, the lack of a plateau in the Ox values for OPOA implied potential ongoing oxidation, suggesting a higher and longer atmospheric oxidation potential. This approach offers rapid and potential insights into complex atmospheric aerosol formation processes. It is essential to acknowledge that SHAP values do not establish causality, and knowledge of the underlying physical and chemical processes was required to conclude valid and comprehensive interpretations of the ML results."

Nitrate (NO3–) is one of the most abundant inorganic compounds and has been found to coexist with amines in ambient particles. The photolysis of NO3– can produce oxidants such as the OH radical, NO2, O(3P), and N(III), which can lead to the decay of particulate EA. Moreover, the degradation of EA forms carbonyl species, which are precursors to brown carbon (BrC) formation. In this study, we investigated the aging of EA-containing particles mediated by NO3– photolysis under different relative humidity (RH) and initial pH conditions under 300 nm UV irradiation. The more acidic (pH 0.0, 0.2, and 0.6) particles (EA:H+ molar ratio = 4:4.25, 4:4.5, 4:5 at 70% RH) exhibited an increase in pH, while the less acidic (pH 5.0, 4.8, 4.7, and 5.1) particles (EA:H+ = 4:4 at 40%, 55%, 70%, and 85% RH) showed a decrease in pH as a result of photooxidation. We attributed these contrary pH changes to the combination of the HONO evaporation, which increases the pH, and the EA reactions, which decrease the pH. The decay rates of NO3– and EA appear not to be sensitive to RH and pH within experimental uncertainties. We proposed EA reaction pathways in the presence of oxidants produced from NO3– photolysis based on product speciation. We also observed the formation of water-soluble organics (BrC and an organic phase) as a potential secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This study sheds light on the particulate sink of EA and its potential in BrC and SOA formation mediated by NO3– photolysis in the atmosphere, providing new insights into the aging of amines in atmospheric aerosols."

Organic aerosol (OA) is often the bottleneck of further reducing PM pollution. To devise effective control measures, the sources of OA must be identified and quantified first. This study expanded the capability of cutting-edge iodide-based chemical ionization mass spectrometry in a source apportionment study by measuring a variety of oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs). A workflow was developed to find suitable tracers from these OOMs. The source apportionment research of OAs was advanced by incorporating these OOM tracers with traditional nonpolar/polar organic tracers. The OOMs-incorporated positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to two unique groups of aerosol samples collected in an inland megacity and an ocean expedition. PMF without OOM tracers overestimated the OA contribution from fossil fuel combustion, plastic burning, and monoterpene SOA. On average, PMF with OOM tracers assigned 28.8% and 44.1% of OA in inland megacity and marine samples, respectively, to 4 new factors: aliphatic SOA, highly oxidized aromatic SOA, sulfur-containing SOA, and nitrogen-containing SOA.

However, the key factors affecting OS formation in nearly dry and weakly acidic aerosol conditions remain elusive. This topic was resolved by examining the composition and formation of OSs in PM2.5 collected in Urumqi (dry and dusty) over a one-year period. Anthropogenic OSs accounted for 49 ± 8% of the total OSs, indicating a large anthropogenic contribution to OS formation in Urumqi (particularly in winter). The low aerosol liquid water (ALW) concentration (2 ± 2 μg m–3) and weak particle acidity (pH = 7 ± 2) during the summer were important factors limiting anthropogenic OS formation. However, increased ALW (100 ± 70 μg m–3) and particle acidity (pH = 5 ± 1) during the winter significantly promoted anthropogenic OS production. The formation of most of isoprene- and monoterpene-derived OSs during summer was also constrained by unfavorable ALW concentration and particle acidity, resulting in biogenic OS levels being lower in summer than in winter.

The condensed-phase chemistry shows an increase in formation of organic nitrate (RONO2) from the downstream RO2+NO reaction, which is attributed to potential collisional and solvent-cage stabilization of the RO2–NO complex. We further observe an enhancement in the yield of carbonyl relative to hydroxy carbonyl products in the condensed phase, indicating changes to RO radical kinetics.

One potentially important source is catalytic heaters, which  have largely escaped attention in regulatory and mitigation efforts despite being ubiquitous at upstream production sites in cold climate regions. This study reports direct in situ measurements of the exhaust streams of 38 natural gas-fired catalytic heaters at upstream production sites in British Columbia, Canada. All heaters in the sample showed consistently poor methane conversion with mean destruction efficiencies of 61 ± 5% while releasing 235 [+31/–28] g of methane per cubic meter of fuel. Although individual units are generally small methane sources (mean of 0.28 ± 0.04 kg/h), their prevalence means they could represent 6% of the total provincial upstream methane inventory and as an aggregate methane source could be 5× more significant than abandoned wells. Notably, these heaters are seasonal sources whose emissions would be missed in measurement campaigns occurring solely in summer months. However, additional measurements from a small number of heat medium burners demonstrate that, where feasible, methane emissions can be reduced by approximately 425× by replacing catalytic heaters with centralized heat systems."

However, detected OSs cannot fully account for the sulfur content released from reacted 2-MTS, indicating the existence of sulfur in forms other than OSs such as inorganic sulfates. This work investigated the formation of inorganic sulfates through heterogeneous •OH oxidation of 2-MTS aerosols. Remarkably, high yields of inorganic sulfates, defined as the moles of inorganic sulfates produced per mole of reacted 2-MTS, were observed in the range from 0.48 ± 0.07 to 0.68 ± 0.07. These could be explained by the production of sulfate (SO4•–) and sulfite (SO3•–) radicals through the cleavage of C–O(S) and (C)O–S bonds, followed by aerosol-phase reactions. Additionally, nonsulfated products resulting from bond cleavage were likely volatile and evaporated into the gas phase, as evidenced by the observed aerosol mass loss (≤25%) and concurrent size reduction upon oxidation. This investigation highlights the significant transformation of sulfur from its organic to inorganic forms during the heterogeneous oxidation of 2-MTS aerosols, potentially influencing the physicochemical properties and environmental impacts of isoprene-derived SOAs."

Our results find considerable impacts of NO3– photolysis on surface SO42–, especially over India and other coastal regions (up to 15% increment of annual average concentrations), which were previously unaccounted for in most models. The effects are mainly due to S(IV) oxidation by OH, H2O2, and O3 following renoxification, which outcompetes aqueous oxidation by N(III), contrary to previous laboratory and modeling studies. Further analysis suggests that past studies might have underestimated the particle-to-gas transfer of N(III) in ambient aerosols. We suggest that future modeling works should use experiment-derived parameters with caution and a thorough understanding of the mechanism before implementing them into models, especially when dealing with those from large particles or bulk solutions involving mass transfer."

Our findings indicate that the size and shape of the microplastics together with the soil type and moisture levels are major determinants of the microplastic enrichment ratio (ER) in dust, overshadowing the role of polymer types. Notably, microplastic pellets larger than 20 μm do not enrich in dust, while microplastic fibers, even those as large as 500–5000 μm in length, do enrich in dust. Based on our ER measurement, the global microplastic size distribution in soil and dust aerosol production flux, we made a preliminary bottom-up assessment of global soil microplastic emissions of 48[0.4–1217] kilotons/year. Our pioneering findings on the global atmospheric soil–air microplastic flux provide insights that could guide the future development of a more precise microplastic emission inventory."

This study examines the effect of low-level air pollution exposure on a subclinical biomarker of hyperglycemia (i.e., HbA1c) in pregnant people without diabetes before conception. We measured HbA1c in 577 samples repeatedly collected from 224 pregnant people in Rochester, NY, and estimated residential concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 using high-resolution spatiotemporal models. We observed a U-shaped trajectory of HbA1c during pregnancy with average HbA1c levels of 5.13 (±0.52), 4.97 (±0.54), and 5.43 (±0.40)% in early-, mid-, and late pregnancy, respectively. After adjustment for the U-shaped trajectory and classic GDM risk factors, each interquartile range increase in 10 week NO2 concentration (8.0 ppb) was associated with 0.09% (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.16%) and 0.18% (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.28%) increases in HbA1c over the entire pregnancy and in late pregnancy, respectively.

However, endeavors to mitigate air pollution and health benefits have displayed considerable heterogeneity across different regions. Therefore, comprehending the changes in air pollutant concentrations and health impacts within an urbanization context is imperative for promoting environmental equity. This paper uses gross domestic product (GDP)- and population-weighted methods to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from urban and non-urban areas in China and quantified their contributions to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in 2010 and 2019. Anthropogenic emissions from urban and non-urban (outside urban) regions decreased by 26 and 44% from 2010 to 2019, respectively, resulting in 31 and 28% reductions of PM2.5 in China. PM2.5-related premature mortality attributed to non-urban and urban anthropogenic emission decreases by 8%. Non-urban anthropogenic activities are the main contributor to PM2.5 (56% in 2010 and 2019) and its associated premature mortality (59%), which also predominantly affects non-urban premature mortality (37–42% in 2010–2019). Population changes increase the proportion of premature mortality in urban populations (7–19%) from 2010 to 2019.

However, the current understanding of the source of NO2–/HONO is insufficient and therefore hinders the accurate quantification of atmospheric oxidation capacity. Herein, we highlighted an overlooked HONO source by the reaction between nitrophenols (NPs) and •OH in the aqueous phase and provided kinetic data to better evaluate the contribution of this process to atmospheric HONO. Three typical NPs, including 4-nitrophenol (4NP), 2-nitrophenol (2NP), and 4-nitrocatechol (4NC), underwent a denitration process to form aqueous NO2– and gaseous HONO through the •OH oxidation, with the yield of NO2–/HONO varied from 15.0 to 33.5%. According to chemical composition and structure analysis, the reaction pathway, where the ipso addition of •OH to the NO2 group on 4NP generated hydroquinone, can contribute to more than 61.9% of the NO2–/HONO formation. The aqueous photooxidation of NPs may account for HONO in the atmosphere, depending on the specific conditions. The results clearly suggest that the photooxidation of NPs should be considered in the field observation and calculation to better evaluate the HONO budget in the atmosphere."

The products result from a redox process that takes place at the liquid–solid interface through contact electrification, where no external potential is applied. Oxidation is initiated by superoxide radical anions (O2–) that originate from the oxygen in the air surrounding the microdroplets and from the hydroxyl radicals (OH•) originating from the water–air interface. Two spin traps (TEMPO and DMPO) capture these radicals as well as NH2OH+•, HNO, NO•, NO2•, and NOOH, which are detected by mass spectrometry. We also directly observed N2O2–• by the same means. We found that the hydrogen atom from the ammonia molecule can be set free not only in the form of H• but also as H2, which is detected using a residue gas analyzer. The oxidation process can be significantly enhanced by a factor of 3 when the sprayed microdroplets are irradiated with ultraviolet light (265 nm, 5 W). 35% of 300 μM ammonia can be degraded within 20 μs, and the nitrate conversion rate is estimated to be 15 nmol·mg–1·h–1."

We adopted a sibling-matched case-control design to analyze 9332 stillbirths and 17,421 live births. We associated the risk of stillbirth simultaneously with dust and nondust components of PM2.5 and developed a nonlinear joint exposure–response function. Next, we estimated the burden of stillbirths attributable to the PM2.5 mixture. The concentration index was used to evaluate whether the burden of PM2.5-related stillbirths was disproportionally distributed among pregnancies exposed to dust-rich particles. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in dust PM2.5 was associated with a 14.5% (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 24.2%) increase in the odds of stillbirth. Based on the risk assessment across 137 countries, sand dust contributed to about 15% of the PM2.5 exposure but to about 45% of the PM2.5-related stillbirths during 2003–2019. In 2015, 30% of the PM2.5-related stillbirths were concentrated within 15% of pregnancies exposed to the dust-richest PM2.5. The index increased in subregions, such as South Asia, suggesting the growth of health inequality due to exposure to dust PM2.5.

Pelletized biomass fuels are promoted as a cleaner alternative, particularly for those who cannot afford the high costs of gas/electricity, but their emission characteristics and potential effects remain poorly understood. The present laboratory-based study evaluated pollution emissions from pelletized biomass burning, including CH4 (methane), NMHC (nonmethane hydrocarbon compounds), CO, SO2, NOx, PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm), OC (organic carbon), EC (element carbon), PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), EPFRs (environmentally persistent free radicals), and OP (oxidative potential) of PM2.5, and compared with those from raw biomass burning. For most targets, except for SO2 and NOx, the mass-based emission factors for pelletized biomass were 62–96% lower than those for raw biomass. SO2 and NOx levels were negatively correlated with other air pollutants (p < 0.05). Based on real-world daily consumption data, this study estimated that households using pelletized biomass could achieve significant reductions (51–95%) in emissions of CH4, NMHC, CO, PM2.5, OC, EC, PAHs, and EPFRs compared to those using raw biomass, while the differences in emissions of NOx and SO2 were statistically insignificant. The reduction rate of benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent emissions was only 16%, much lower than the reduction in the total PAH mass (78%). This is primarily attributed to the more PAHs with high toxic potentials, such as dibenz(a,h)anthracene, in the pelletized biomass emissions. Consequently, impacts on human health associated with PAHs might be overestimated if only the mass of total PAHs was counted. The OP of particles from the pellet burning was also significantly lower than that from raw biomass by  96%. The results suggested that pelletized biomass could be a transitional substitution option that can significantly improve air quality and mitigate human exposure."

In this process, carbon loss is controlled by lignin, but the mechanisms of production of CO2 and CH4 during lignin photolysis are ambiguous. In this study, the photomineralization of plant litter and the lignocellulosic component collectively indicate that lignin is a major source of CO2 and CH4 emissions. Characterization and free radical analysis reveal that the production of CO2 is due to the oxidation and ring-opening reaction of the coniferyl alcohol unit, with the subsequent decarboxylation of carboxylic acid as an oxidation product. This reaction involves o-quinone formation by the reactions between O2, superoxide radical (O2·–), and persistent free radicals (PFRs)-bearing lignin. Of this, O2·– contributes to 43.2% of the photogenerated CO2, as a new pathway, derived from the electron transfer from PFRs to O2. Interestingly, photoinduced demethylation of the dimethoxybenzene-type compounds as the photolysis products of lignin results in a never-before-reported CH4 formation chemical route independent of that of O2. This mechanistic insight into the role of lignin in volatile carbon production from the irradiative plant litter will contribute to a deeper understanding of carbon balance in water-limited ecosystems."

Total suspended particulates (TSP) further promoted the CTF in combination with WSIIs or PAHs. Under WSII and PAH exposure, gene expression levels related to oxidative stress, cell membrane, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were upregulated. WSIIs predominantly induced cellular contact, while PAHs triggered ATP formation and membrane damage. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that WSIIs and PAHs reduced membrane lipid fluidity and increased membrane permeability through interactions with the phosphatidylcholine bilayer. DSM filtering performance decreased, and the CTF of ARGs increased with the wearing time. The gut simulator test showed that ARB disrupted the human gut microbial community and increased total ARG abundance but did not change the ARG abundance carried by ARB themselves.

By applying an integrated analysis framework that consists of a detailed emission inventory, a chemical transport model, a multisource fused dataset, and epidemiological concentration–response functions, we systematically evaluate the contribution of emissions from 390 sources (30 provinces and 13 socioeconomic sectors) to PM2.5-related health impacts and CO2 emissions, as well as the marginal health benefits of CO2 abatement across China. The estimated source-specific contributions exhibit substantial disparities, with the marginal benefits varying by 3 orders of magnitude. The rural residential, transportation, metal, and power and heating sectors emerge as pivotal sources for co-control, with regard to their relatively large marginal benefits or the sectoral total benefits.

However, quantifying hydroxyl radicals (•OH), essential for H2O2 formation, remains challenging due to their short lifespan and low concentration. This study addresses this gap by presenting a highly sensitive and selective surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensor specifically designed for quantifying •OH within water microdroplets. Utilizing a phthalhydrazide (Phth) probe, the SERS technique enables rapid, interference-free detection of •OH at nanomolar concentrations. It achieves a linear detection range from 2 nM to 2 μM and a limit of detection as low as 0.34 nM. Importantly, the SERS sensor demonstrates robustness and accuracy within water microdroplets, paving the way for comprehensive mechanistic studies of H2O2 generation in the atmosphere.

Bertram,Microplastic Particles Contain Ice Nucleation Sites That Can Be Inhibited by Atmospheric Aging,"Recent research has shown that microplastics are widespread in the atmosphere. However, we know little about their ability to nucleate ice and their impact on ice formation in clouds. Ice nucleation by microplastics could also limit their long-range transport and global distribution. The present study explores the heterogeneous ice-nucleating ability of seven microplastic samples in immersion freezing mode. Two polypropylene samples and one polyethylene terephthalate sample froze heterogeneously with median freezing temperatures of −20.9, −23.2, and −21.9 °C, respectively. The number of ice nucleation sites per surface area, ns(T), ranged from 10–1 to 104 cm–2 in a temperature interval of −15 to −25 °C, which is comparable to that of volcanic ash and fungal spores. After exposure to ozone or a combination of UV light and ozone, simulating atmospheric aging, the ice nucleation activity decreased in some cases and remained unchanged in others. Our freezing data suggest that microplastics may promote ice formation in cloud droplets. In addition, based on a comparison of our freezing results and previous simulations using a global transport model, ice nucleation by microplastics will impact their long-range transport to faraway locations and global distribution."

However, accurately measuring the fine-mode aerosol optical depth (fAOD) is highly uncertain in most existing satellite-based aerosol products. Deep learning offers promise for inferring fAOD, but little has been done using multiangle satellite data. We developed an innovative angle-dependent deep-learning model (ADLM) that accounts for angular diversity in dual-angle observations. The model captures aerosol properties observed from dual angles in the contiguous United States and explores the potential of Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite-2’s (GOSAT-2) measurements to retrieve fAOD at a 460 m spatial resolution. The ADLM demonstrates a strong performance through rigorous validation against ground-based data, revealing small biases. By comparison, the official fAOD product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) during wildfire events is underestimated by more than 40% over western USA. This leads to significant differences in estimates of aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) from wildfires. The ADLM shows more than 20% stronger ARF than the MODIS, VIIRS, and MISR estimates, highlighting a greater impact of wildfire fAOD on Earth’s energy balance."

Woehl,Imaging Dissolution Dynamics of Individual NaCl Nanoparticles during Deliquescence with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy,"Water vapor condensation on hygroscopic aerosol particles plays an important role in cloud formation, climate change, secondary aerosol formation, and aerosol aging. Conventional understanding considers deliquescence of nanosized hygroscopic aerosol particles a nearly instantaneous solid to liquid phase transition. However, the nanoscale dynamics of water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence remain obscure due to a lack of high spatial and temporal resolution single particle measurements. Here we use real time in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of individual sodium chloride (NaCl) nanoparticles to demonstrate that water adsorption and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence is a multistep dynamic process. Water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution was investigated for lab generated NaCl aerosols and found to occur in three distinct stages as a function of increasing relative humidity (RH). First, a < 100 nm water layer adsorbed on the NaCl cubes and caused sharp corners to dissolve and truncate. The water layer grew to several hundred nanometers with increasing RH and was rapidly saturated with solute, as evidenced by halting of particle dissolution. Adjacent cube corners displayed second-scale curvature fluctuations with no net particle dissolution or water layer thickness change. We propose that droplet solute concentration fluctuations drove NaCl transport from regions of high local curvature to regions of low curvature. Finally, we observed coexistence of a liquid water droplet and aerosol particle immediately prior to deliquescence. Particles dissolved discretely along single crystallographic directions, separated by few second lag times with no dissolution. This work demonstrates that deliquescence of simple pure salt particles with sizes in the range of 100 nm to several microns is not an instantaneous phase transition and instead involves a range of complex dissolution and water condensation dynamics."

However, the impact of this policy on particle size distribution and composition characteristics remains unclear. Measurements were conducted on nine different vessels (ocean-going vessels, coastal cargo ships, and inland cargo ships) to determine the impact of fuel upgrading (S < 0.1% m/m marine gas oil (MGO) vs S < 0.5% m/m heavy fuel oil (HFO)) on elemental carbon (EC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted by ships. (1) Fuel improvement significantly reduced EC and PAH emission, by 31 ± 25 and 45 ± 38%, respectively. However, particle size distributions showed a trend toward finer particles, with the peak size decreasing from DP = 0.38–0.60 μm (HFO) to DP = 0.15–0.25 μm (MGO), and the emission factor of DP < 100 nm increased. (2) Changes in emission characteristics led to an increase in the toxicity of ultrafine particulate matter. (3) Ship types and engine conditions affected the EC and PAH particle size distributions. Inland ships have a more concentrated particle size distribution. Higher loads result in higher emissions.

Here, we integrated a comprehensive observation database of foliar Hg concentrations and machine learning algorithms to predict the first spatial distribution of foliar Hg concentrations on a global scale, contributing to the first estimate of global Hg pools in foliage. The global average of foliar Hg concentrations was estimated to be 24.0 ng g–1 (7.5–56.5 ng g–1), and the global total in foliar Hg pools reached 4561.3 Mg (1455.2–9062.8 Mg). The spatial distribution showed the hotspots in tropical regions, including the Amazon, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia. A range of 2268.5–2727.0 Mg yr–1 was estimated for annual foliar Hg assimilation accounting for the perennial continuous assimilation by evergreen vegetation foliage.

This phenomenon has been well-documented for glaciers near emission sources. However, less is known about polar ice sheets and ice caps. Radionuclides are one of the contaminants that can be remobilised through ice melting and accumulate in cryoconite material on the surface of glaciers. To understand the cycling of radionuclides in polar glacial contexts, we evaluate the radioactivity of cryoconite samples from Flade Isblink, a High Arctic ice cap in northeast Greenland. The measured radioactivity is among the highest reported across the High Arctic and the highest from Greenland. The high variability observed among the samples is explained by considering the different macroscopic features of single cryoconite deposits. The radioactivity source is compatible with the stratospheric reservoir established during atmospheric nuclear tests and with weapons-grade fissile fuel, likely originating from Novaya Zemlya proving grounds. This study shows that the ability of cryoconite to accumulate radioactivity in remote areas is undisputed, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the remobilisation of radioactive species in polar glacial contexts."

While many studies have developed empirical models to elucidate the effects of meteorology on ozone variability, they predominantly focus on local weather conditions, overlooking the influences from high-altitude and broader regional meteorological patterns. Here, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a technique typically applied to image recognition, to investigate the influence of three-dimensional spatial variations in meteorological fields on the daily, seasonal, and interannual dynamics of ozone in Shenzhen, a major coastal urban center in China. Our optimized CNNs model, covering a 13° × 13° spatial domain, effectively explains over 70% of daily ozone variability, outperforming alternative empirical approaches by 7 to 62%. Model interpretations reveal the crucial roles of 2-m temperature and humidity as primary drivers, contributing 16% and 15% to daily ozone fluctuations, respectively. Regional wind fields account for up to 40% of ozone changes during the episodes. CNNs successfully replicate observed ozone temporal patterns, attributing −5–6 μg·m–3 of interannual ozone variability to weather anomalies. Our interpretable CNNs framework enables quantitative attribution of historical ozone fluctuations to nonlinear meteorological effects across spatiotemporal scales, offering vital process-based insights for managing megacity air quality amidst changing climate regimes."

 Urbanization has exerted considerable impacts on urban water systems and ecological environments, yet its effects on local meteorological drought remain under-explored. The primary challenge to local-scale drought analysis is the scarcity of meteorological datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. To address the research gap, we initially proposed a two-step fusion framework, integrating both surface (i.e., gridded data)-surface and point (i.e., in-situ data)-surface fusion. The framework was applied to generate daily precipitation and average/maximum/minimum air temperature at a 1 km resolution through the integration of high-resolution remotely sensed datasets across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China. The final fused data demonstrated excellent performance, achieving a PCC (RMSE) of 0.806 (5.414 mm/day), 0.993 (1.138 °C), 0.987 (1.443 °C), and 0.988 (1.376 °C) for precipitation and average/maximum/minimum air temperature, respectively. A comparison of our fused data with CPC, ERA5-Land, CMFD, CHIRPS, IMERG, and TMPA products confirmed its capability in capturing local-scale meteorological dynamics by improving spatial resolution from 0.1°-0.25° to 1 km. Utilizing these high-resolution datasets, we quantified urbanization's impacts on local drought across 52 major cities in the YRB. We found that urbanization significantly magnified extreme Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and drought severity in 69.2% and 61.5% of these cities, respectively. The effects of urbanization on extreme SPEI were amplified by the increase of urbanization rates, with a slope of −0.24 (p < 0.05). To further examine the spatial patterns of urbanization-induced local drought, we proposed a drought spatial field identification method, utilizing it in three representative urban regions: Chengdu, Wuhan, and the Yangtze River Delta. Our findings revealed that urbanization led to more intense peak drought intensity and average drought severity. In addition, urban drought fields showed lower effective radius, indicating more concentrated drought towards urban regions. While urbanization is projected to continue alongside rapid population growth in the future, the advanced application of remote sensing data and technology in this study not only improves our understanding of urban water resource challenges but also equips urban planners with the necessary data to develop effective drought mitigation strategies."

 Changes in the net carbon sink of boreal forests constitute a major source of uncertainty in the future global carbon budget and, hence, climate change projections. The annual net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) controlling the terrestrial carbon stock results from the small difference between respiratory CO2 release and the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by vegetation. The boreal forest, and the boreal biome in general, is regarded as a persistent and even increasing net carbon sink. However, decreases in photosynthetic CO2 uptake and/or concurrent increases in respiratory CO2 release under a changing climate may turn boreal forests from a net sink to a net source of CO2. Here, we assessed the interannual variability of the boreal forest net CO2 sink-source strength and its two component fluxes from 1981 to 2018. Our remote sensing approach - trained by net CO2 flux observations at eddy covariance sites across the circumpolar boreal forests - employs satellite-derived retrievals of snowmelt timing, landscape freeze-thaw status, and yearly maximum estimates of the normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for peak vegetation productivity. Our results suggest that for the period 2000–2018, the mean annual evergreen boreal forest CO2 photosynthetic uptake (gross primary productivity) was 2.8±0.2 Pg C y−1 (1.6±0.1 Pg C y−1 for Eurasia and 1.2±0.1 Pg C y−1 for North America). In contrast to earlier studies results obtained here do not indicate a clear increasing trend in the circumpolar evergreen boreal forest CO2 sink. The increase in photosynthetic CO2 uptake is compensated by increasing respiratory releases with both component fluxes showing considerable interannual variabilities."

 Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a new technique to provide L-band bistatic measurements for ocean wind speed retrieval, in which traditional geophysical model functions (GMFs) or shallow neural networks (NNs) are normally used. However, it is still challenging to identify and consider all relevant parameters in the GMF. Meanwhile, NN models face limitations due to the degradation problem, which restricts their depth and consequently their performance. Furthermore, the interpretation of NN models for GNSS-R wind retrieval is another issue. To this end, we propose a residual fully connected network (RFCN) fusing auxiliary information such as geometry, receiver gain, significant wave height, and current speed with track-wise corrected σ0. Referred to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 wind product, the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of RFCN winds are 1.031 m/s and -0.0003 m/s, respectively, with a 6% improvement in RMSE compared to debiased NOAA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) Version 1.2 (V1.2) wind speed retrieval. Moreover, in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) area with large current speeds, the RMSE and bias are 1.006 m/s and -0.022 m/s: an improvement of 11.6% and 87.9% compared to debiased NOAA CYGNSS V1.2 winds. The bias ‘strips’ in these areas are nearly eliminated. Daily averaged error analyses also demonstrate that RFCN winds are more robust and consistent with ECMWF winds. For wind speeds larger than 20 m/s, referred to Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 3 final wind products, the RMSE and bias of fine-tuning RFCN (FT_RFCN) winds are reduced by 25.7% and 91.5% compared to NOAA winds. Finally, the RMSE and bias of retrievals in tropical cyclones, measured by Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) during 2021-2022, reveal an improvement of 3.5% and 21.2% compared to NOAA winds. Through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) models developed for RFCN and FT_RFCN, the contribution of each feature is quantitatively evaluated, while providing insights into their interactions within the ‘black-box’ NN models with clear physical meanings."

In addition, the global pixel-to-pixel intercomparisons of the aerosol products (AOD, fine/coarse mode AOD and SSA) are performed over different surfaces, i.e., ocean and land surface with different NDVIs. Besides, we compared the S5P/TROPOMI GRASP, MODIS MCD43 surface BRDF/albedo as well as OMI, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY Lambertian-Equivalent Reflectivity (LER) albedo climatology developed by Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) with the surface reference dataset generated based on the synergetic retrieval of AERONET and S5P/TROPOMI measurements. Finally, the intercomparisons of the surface BRDF and albedo datasets were performed globally at the UV, VIS, NIR and SWIR parts of the spectrum. Overall, generally good agreement was observed between independent aerosol and surface datasets with a high percentage of pixels satisfying the Optimal and Target requirements. We would emphasize two advantages for TROPOMI/GRASP aerosol and surface products: (i) it provides spectral AOD together with detailed aerosol properties, such as fine/coarse mode AOD, spectral AAOD and SSA at UV, VIS, NIR and SWIR wavelengths, which are important for constraining aerosol environmental and climate effects; (ii) the TROPOMI/GRASP aerosol and surface products are globally retrieved simultaneously in a fully consistent manner."

 The launch of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in 2015 has resulted in significant achievements in global soil moisture mapping. Nonetheless, spatiotemporal discontinuities in the soil moisture products have arisen due to the limitations of its orbit scanning gap and retrieval algorithms. To address these issues, this paper presents a physics-constrained gap-filling method, PhyFill for short. The PhyFill method employs a partial convolutional neural network technique to explore spatial domain features of the original SMAP soil moisture data. Then, it incorporates variations in soil moisture induced by precipitation events and dry-down events as penalty terms in the loss function, thereby accounting for monotonicity and boundary constraints in the physical processes governing the dynamic fluctuations of soil moisture. The PhyFill model was applied to SMAP soil moisture data, resulting in continuous spatially daily soil moisture data on a global scale. Three validation strategies are employed: visual inspection through global pattern, simulated missing-region validation, and soil moisture validation with in situ measurements. The results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture achieved a higher spatial coverage with satisfactory spatial continuity with neighbouring pixels. The simulated validation of the missing regions revealed that the averaged unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and correlation coefficient (R) were 0.01 m3/m3 and 0.99, respectively versus the gap filled SMAP product. The core validation sites demonstrated that the reconstructed soil moisture data has a consistent ubRMSD compared with the original SMAP soil moisture data (0.04 m3/m3 vs. 0.04 m3/m3). The PhyFill method can generate globally continuous, high accurate soil moisture estimates, providing remarkable support for advanced hydrological applications, e.g., global soil moisture dry-down events and patterns."

 Seasonal snow plays a crucial role in society and understanding trends in snow depth and mass is essential for making informed decisions about water resources and adaptation to climate change. However, quantifying snow depth in remote, mountainous areas with complex topography remains a significant challenge. The increasing availability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations from active microwave satellites has prompted opportunistic use of the data to retrieve snow depth remotely across large spatial and frequent temporal scales and at a high spatial resolution. Nevertheless, these novel SAR-based snow depth retrieval methods face their own set of limitations, including challenges for shallow snowpacks, high vegetation cover, and wet snow conditions. In response, here we introduce a machine learning approach to enhance SAR-based snow depth estimation over the European Alps. By integrating Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, optical snow cover observations, and topographic, forest cover and snow class information, our machine learning retrieval method more accurately estimates snow depth at independent in-situ measurement sites than current methods. Further, our method provides estimates at 100 m horizontal resolution and is capable of better capturing local-scale topography-driven snow depth variability. Through detailed feature importance analysis, we identify optimal conditions for SAR data utilization, thereby providing insight into future use of C-band SAR for snow depth retrieval."

 Transparent, accurate, and affordable monitoring of CO2 emissions from power plants is crucial for realization of transition away from fossil fuels. Satellite remote sensing has emerged as a recent research focus, enabling emission estimation without the cooperation of emitters. In 2022, China launched the world's first CO2 monitoring satellite based on laser detection, DQ-1. Equipped with ACDL, it enables accurate detection even under nighttime and high aerosol load conditions, serving as a significant complement to existing optical satellite systems. However, the feasibility of laser detection with narrow swath width for monitoring power plant emissions remains uncertain. This work presents, for the first time, the practical capability of using spaceborne LIDAR to estimate CO2 emissions from power plants. We employ the Gaussian dispersion model as the transport model and quantify emission rates using genetic and trust-region algorithms. Through satellite observations from June to December 2022, we conducted emission estimation experiments for 15 globally distributed power plants. Results indicate that using ACDL's XCO2 yields approximately unbiased estimates (∼2%) of power plant emissions overall, despite a single-overpass uncertainty of 18%. This performance is comparable to OCO-2/3, suggesting consistent benchmarks for different satellite mechanisms in reporting power plant emissions. Consequently, combining their results enhances monitoring of global power plants. We advocate the joint use of diverse CO2 monitoring satellites employing various detection mechanisms to gather a more comprehensive XCO2 dataset, aiming to achieve routine satellite-based verification of power plant emissions."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) which can be estimated from appropriate measurements of the surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiance. LST varies on a very short time scale and closely depends on the illumination and scan angles considered. To fully exploit LST products, a method for reconstructing the temporal profile and the angular dependence at the same time is proposed here. A combined visible-thermal envelope method (VT-KDTC) is built using kernel-driven (KD) and diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models, referring to the surface structure and thermal factors, respectively. To demonstrate the reliability of the approach, TIR data from the geostationary satellite Himawari 8 are combined with visible and near-infrared (VNIR) data from the polar orbit satellite Sentinel-3A/3B. In addition to satellite observations, a synthetic dataset from the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model is also generated. Considering an anisotropy model in addition to the DTC model leads to a method displaying a better ability to simulate LSTs with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.48 K against the original satellite results, compared to only the DTC model up to 1.44 K. By utilizing the field measurements as a reference, the reconstructed results are improved with a total bias of 0.72K and an RMSE of 2.58 K. Compared to the original results without correction, approximately 41% and 10% decreases are obtained in bias and RMSE, respectively. Our proposed method can also achieve LST downscaling supported by the higher spatial resolution of VNIR data when the temperature difference is assumed to be homogeneous within the coarse pixels. Thus, a simple achievable solution can be used for temperature reconstruction to enhance the quality of the LST product."

 The choice of ice particle model is critical for microwave remote sensing of ice clouds. Using a model-observation closure method, the global applicability of a series of single crystal and aggregate ice particle models is evaluated based on satellite-based microwave measurements from the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) high-frequency channels. The results indicate that the ice water path (IWP) retrievals from radar observations are highly dependent on the ice particle model, with the maximum difference between models exceeding a factor of 13. Although aggregate models generally perform better than single crystals, none of them can be well adapted to retrievals for all types of ice clouds on the global scale. A columnar single crystal works better for low IWP clouds, while a small block aggregate for high IWP. Consequently, a mixing scheme combining both with weighting by IWP is then proposed for global ice cloud measurements. By using this double-model mixing scheme, the simulations can well reproduce simultaneous active and passive microwave observations, regardless of the IWP. Specifically, the differences between CPR radar reflectivity simulations and observations do not exceed 0.1 dBZ, while the mean biases of brightness temperatures on all high-frequency channels of GMI are <1.5 K. This is expected to improve the retrieval accuracy of global ice clouds."

 Atmospheric aerosols have strong impact on climate, environment, and health. To account correctly for such impact, extended aerosol characterization, including spectral Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), spectral Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) etc., are required to be derived globally from space-borne observations. Together with the aerosol, the Earth's surfaces are an important component of climate system, reflecting and absorbing solar and atmospheric radiation and being sources of emission of different natural aerosol, for example, sea-salt, mineral dust or organic aerosol.Since the beginning of space-borne atmospheric observation it was recognized that the most comprehensive extended aerosol and surface characterization can be achieved from multi-angular polarimetric measurements. In this paper, we show that the extended aerosol characterization can be obtained even from single viewing radiance only satellite measurements when several crucial conditions are fulfilled both for the observations and retrieval algorithm: (i) wide spectral range (for example, covering UV, VIR, NIR and SWIR spectra) providing rich spectral information about aerosol and surface; (ii) wide swath of measurements ensuring frequent overpassing over the same ground pixel to account for the different temporal variability of aerosol and surface properties as well as for angular dependence of surface reflectance; (iii) applied algorithm should be able to treat multi-temporal and multi-spatial observation accounting for spatial and temporal dependencies of aerosol and surface characteristics.The new possibilities of retrieval of aerosol and surface properties are investigated by applying the advanced GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties) algorithm to the space-borne S5P/TROPOMI observations. The most optimal for these purposes forward and inversion approaches are discussed, and the quality of retrieved aerosol and surface properties is evaluated. The possibilities of TROPOMI/GRASP approach for aerosol extended characterization are demonstrated on several aerosol events including dust storms, biomass burning and anthropogenic aerosol pollution outbreaks in worldwide locations."

 Human-transformed agricultural and aquacultural ponds, collectively referred to as “dike-pond systems”, play a crucial role in ensuring food security but also contribute to the widespread loss of natural wetlands. However, spatially and temporally explicit patterns of dike-pond systems have not been thoroughly documented globally. Here, we map the distribution of dike-pond systems over both global inland and coastal regions during three periods (1984 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, 2011 to 2020) using 30-m resolution satellite observations.

From 1984 to 2020, the net gain of inland dike-pond systems (26,385 km2 or 92.7%) was 1.6 times that of coastal wetlands (16,371 km2 or 83.3%), due primarily to reduced coastal dike-pond systems in the last decade. We identified significant contributions of dike-pond systems to fishery production, and further revealed occurrences of dike-pond systems within protected areas.

 Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is the main energy source for the Earth's system and a dominant component of the radiation budget. Although many algorithms have been proposed for estimating DSR, most models only consider either the radiative effects of terrain or atmosphere, and no research has considered the conditions of clouds on the mountainside. In this paper, a high-resolution Mountain Radiative Transfer model with Clouds (MRTC) is proposed to characterize the cloud-terrain coupling effects on DSR under different surface positions relative to the clouds. To operate the MRTC, a look-up table is employed to obtain initial radiative parameters. The comparison with Monte-Carlo based radiative transfer indicates that MRTC can be applied to conditions of clouds on the mountainside. And the reliability of MRTC under conditions when clouds are above mountains is also validated against in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 149.9 W/m2, a bias of 28.3 W/m2, and an R2 of 0.74. By using more accurate cloud cover data extracted from All-Sky images, the accuracy of MRTC has improved, with the RMSE decreasing to 115.8 W/m2, and the R2 increasing to 0.8. This suggests that the uncertainty in satellite cloud products significantly contributes to errors in DSR estimations. MRTC is expected to more accurately represent cloud-terrain coupling effects on DSR, and improve the accuracy of DSR estimation over rugged terrain under cloudy skies."

 River ice plays a crucial role in hydrology, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems in mid-to-high latitude regions. However, there is a notable gap in the analysis of patterns and trends in river ice phenologies and their influence factors at the river level. In this study, we developed a practical method to identify river ice phenologies by leveraging Landsat observations from 2000 to 2021, and established a comprehensive dataset encompassing 7970 river segments across the entire Northern Hemisphere. Our results revealed that the mean freeze-up date, break-up date, and ice duration for these river segments were October 24, May 4, and 192.1 days, respectively. Notably, 56% of the river segments exhibited a warming trend, with the average freeze-up date delayed by 2.7 days per decade, break-up date advanced by 2.5 days per decade, and ice duration shortened by 5.5 days per decade—nearly five times the documented decrease rate over the past 150 years. Furthermore, high-latitude polar regions and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau demonstrated the most pronounced decreases in ice duration, exceeding 7.0 days per decade on average. We observed a substantial relative contribution, reaching up to 70%, of surface air temperature (SAT) in middle and low latitude regions characterized by relatively high winter temperatures. However, as winter temperatures decrease, the relative influence of SAT diminishes, while the contributions of precipitation, solar radiation, and residuals increase. Our dataset provided essential baseline for further understanding the fundamental physical processes within river systems, offering crucial insights for river management, hydrological disaster risk control, climate change research, and ecosystem conservation efforts."

 The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) onboard the Aeolus wind mission was the first High Spectral Resolution Lidar operating in the Ultra Violet (UV) region deployed in space. This study explores and documents the feasibility of deriving ocean optical properties using data from ALADIN. A three steps (i.e. data screening, analytical estimation of the total in-water signal contribution, Look Up Table-based estimation of the in-water attenuation) retrieval algorithm was developped combining data analysis and signal simulations from a radiative transfer model. The algorithm has been implemented using the signal acquired by the Mie channel, and tested for 1-year of Aeolus observations. This approach allowed estimating the first Aeolus derived Ocean Color (OC) products in terms of the total in-water signal contribution and the in-water attenuation term in a spectral region (355 nm) not covered, during Aeolous lifetime, by operational OC products. The validation process involved comparing these products with both Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) field measurements and satellite OC dataset distributed by ESA Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative across a set of 7 selected oceanic regions representing diverse open-ocean scenarios. These validation exercises attested the general accordance between OC reference measurements and the proposed Aeolus OC parameters. Thus, this study was able to provide statistical evidence of the sensitivity of the retrieved Aeolus in-water lidar attenuation term to the CDOM variability on a temporal/seasonal and spatial/regional basis. A preliminary estimation of the uncertainty associated to the retrieved quality controlled Klid, was performed assuming the radiometric noise as unique source of uncertainty. As a result, a median/average value of absolute relative percent difference of about 50/80% was obtained. Limits of the developed technique, possible improvements, potential adaptation to planned/future space lidar missions are discussed."

 Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter affecting global climate, weather disasters, and marine resources. Acquiring SST data that covers large areas and spans over long periods is one of the most essential tasks for various scientific research. During the past decades, meteorological satellites (e.g., the Himawari 8) have been able to provide large-scale, high-resolution continuous observations (via a number of visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands), but have always been affected by active atmospheric activities (i.e., clouds). A detailed literature review on SST analysis or estimation shows that limitations or challenges associated with the existing tools and the state-of-the-art approaches have not been fully resolved yet. Through integrating the knowledge from interdisciplinary domains, hence, we proposed a physically-informed machine learning approach (i.e., a physically-consistent, virtual-gauge approach in the machine learning framework) to elegantly reconstruct daily SSTs under both cloud and cloud-free areas. By this central idea, we developed the TS-RBFNN (i.e., Temporal-Spatial Radial Basis Function Neural Network) and suggested an adequate procedure (with artificial clouds) for model assessment since the data in the cloudy region was unavailable. A systematic study in terms of model implication (i.e., the meaning of network architecture), model validation (i.e., the performance of learning and generalization), and model applications (i.e., in open ocean and coastal seas with different cloud coverage over the four seasons) was conducted. In particular, a pattern similarity analysis (examining SST distributions for several selected sections) and a daily-based error analysis (presenting the variations and distributions of RMSEs for each season) were carried out to clarify the relationship between varying cloud conditions and model performances (inferenced by sunny areas). Overall, the TS-RBFNN would better perform full SST reconstruction with significant improvement up to 60%, compared to the DINEOF (i.e., Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Function). Currently, the TS-RBFNN model is being implemented into the operational system of Taiwan's Central Weather Administration to provide all-weather SST products.

 The maximum carboxylation rate of plant leaves (Vcmax) at 25 °C (Vcmax25) is a fundamental parameter in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) to estimate carbon assimilation of C3 biomes. It has been reported that ignoring the seasonal variations in Vcmax25 induces considerable uncertainties in TBMs. Recently, a model was developed to estimate Vcmax25 of C3 biomes mechanistically from climate data based on eco-evolutionary optimality hypotheses, which hypothesized that plants acclimate to the environment to achieve maximum carbon assimilation with minimum related costs. However, uncertainties of this optimality-based model (EEO model) have been found to correlate to leaf nitrogen content, partly due to the lack of parameterization on how the acclimation of Vcmax25 is constrained by photosynthetic nitrogen other than that in RuBisCO. This constraint could be parametrized by remote sensing methods globally. In this study, we developed remote sensing methods to estimate leaf absorptance of radiation based on MODIS LCC (leaf chlorophyll content) data and the ratio of the maximum electron transport rate of plant leaves (Jmax) to Vcmax at 25 °C (rJV25) based on TROPOMI SIF (solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence) data (RS-rJV25). These two parameters contain photosynthetic nitrogen information related to light harvesting, electron transport, and carboxylation, and they were then incorporated into the EEO model to constrain how Vcmax25 acclimates to the environment. The simulated Vcmax25 constrained by MODIS LCC and RS-rJV25 agreed well with seasonal variations in field-measured Vcmax25 at 18 sites (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 13.40 μmol·m−2·s−1), showing better accuracy than the simulation without incorporating leaf absorptance and rJV25 (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 31.59 μmol·m−2·s−1). Our results indicated that variations in leaf absorptance and rJV25 constrained the acclimation of Vcmax25 to the environment and contributed to the variation in Vcmax25 that cannot be fully captured by environmental factors alone in the EEO model. The remote-sensing-based leaf absorptance and rJV25 captured the sensitivity of these two parameters to environmental conditions on the global scale. The influence of leaf absorptance on Vcmax25 was primarily affected by the irradiance level, while rJV25 was determined by the growing season mean temperature. The simulated Vcmax25 had large spatiotemporal variations on the global scale, and the environment drove the variation pattern more greatly than the biome distribution. With reasonably accurate seasonal variations in Vcmax25, this study can help improve the global carbon cycle and leaf trait modelling."

 Satellite observations from instruments such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) show significant potential for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of NO2, however they typically provide vertically integrated measurements over the tropospheric column. In this study, we introduce a machine learning approach entitled ‘S-MESH’ (Satellite and ML-based Estimation of Surface air quality at High resolution) that allows for estimating daily surface NO2 concentrations over Europe at 1 km spatial resolution based on eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) model using primarily observation-based datasets over the period 2019–2021. Spatiotemporal datasets used by the model include TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column density, night light radiance from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), observations of air quality monitoring stations from the European Environment Agency database and modeled meteorological parameters such as planetary boundary layer height, wind velocity, temperature. The overall model evaluation shows a mean absolute error of 7.77 μg/m3, a median bias of 0.6 μg/m3 and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.66. The model performance is found to be influenced by NO2 concentration levels, with the most reliable predictions at concentration levels of 10–40 μg/m3 with a bias of <40%. The spatial and temporal error analyses indicate the spatial robustness of the model across the study area, with better prediction accuracy during the winter months and the associated higher NO2 concentrations. Despite the complexity and the continental scale of the study area, the XGBoost-based model shows fast execution potential in providing daily estimates of surface NO2 concentrations over Europe. The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis highlights TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric column density as the main source of information in deriving surface NO2 concentrations, indicating its significant potential for such studies. The SHAP values also indicate the importance of anthropogenic emission proxy inputs such as VIIRS night lights, in complementing TROPOMI NO2 values for deriving higher resolution and detailed spatial patterns of NO2 variations."

 Satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) have been extensively used in monitoring vegetation dynamics at local, regional, and global scales. While numerous studies have explored various factors influencing VIs, a remarkable knowledge gap persists concerning their applicability in mountain areas with complex topographic variations. Here we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the topographic effects on ten widely used VIs. We used three evaluation strategies, including: (i) an analytic radiative transfer model; (ii) a 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer model; and (iii) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The two radiative transfer models provided theoretical evaluation results under specific terrain conditions, aiding in the first exploration of the interactions of both shadow and spatial scale effects on VIs. The MODIS-based evaluation quantified the discrepancies in VIs between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over flat and rugged terrains, providing new insights into real satellite data across different temporal scales (i.e., from daily to multiple years). Our evaluation results were consistent across these three strategies, revealing three key findings. (i) The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generally outperformed the other VIs, yet all VIs did not perform well in shadow areas (e.g., with a mean relative error (MRE) of 14.7% for NDVI in non-shadow areas and 26.1% in shadow areas). (ii) The topographic impacts exist at multiple spatiotemporal scales. For example, the MREs of NDVI reached 28.5% and 11.1% at 30 m and 3 km resolutions, respectively. The quarterly and annual VIs deviations between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua also increased with slope. (iii) We found the topography-induced interannual variations in multiple VIs both in simulated data and MODIS data. VIs trend deviations between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020 increased as the slope steepened (i.e., NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) trend deviations generally doubled). Overall, the sun-target-sensor geometry changes induced by topography, causing shadows in mountains along with obstructions in sensor observations, compromised the reliability of VIs in these terrains. Our study underscores the considerable impacts of topography, particularly shadow effects, on multiple VIs at various spatiotemporal scales, highlighting the imperative of cautious application of VIs-based trend calculation in mountains."

 In this era of global warming, the regular and accurate mapping of vegetation conditions is essential for monitoring ecosystems, climate sustainability and biodiversity. In this context, this work proposes a physics-guided data-driven methodology to invert radiative transfer models (RTM) for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables. A hybrid paradigm is proposed by incorporating the physical model to be inverted into the design of a neural network architecture, which is trained by exploiting unlabeled satellite images. In this study, we show how the proposed strategy allows the simultaneous probabilistic inversion of all input PROSAIL model parameters by exploiting Sentinel-2 images. The interest of the proposed self-supervised learning strategy is corroborated by showing the limitations of existing simulation-trained machine learning algorithms. Results are assessed on leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) in-situ measurements collected on four different field campaigns over three European tests sites. Prediction accuracies are compared with performances reached by the well-established Biophysical Processor (BP) of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). Obtained overall accuracies corroborate that the proposed methodology achieves performances equivalent to or better than the state-of-the-art methods."

 Downward Surface Shortwave Radiation (DSSR) plays a crucial role in ecological, hydrological, and solar photovoltaic studies. The estimation of DSSR at higher spatial resolutions is increasingly popular. However, the impact of increasing spatial resolution on spatial information content and accuracy of DSSR estimates is not well understood. Addressing this knowledge gap, an all-sky DSSR dataset at varying spatial resolutions (0.8° to 0.01°) in China was estimated using MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance data. Subsequently, the spatial heterogeneity and accuracy of the DSSR dataset as well as its driving factors were analyzed. The results indicate that the magnitude of the increase in spatial heterogeneity varies across different regions as the spatial resolution increases. On the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the spatial heterogeneity experiences the most significant increase. To quantify the factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of DSSR, the Correlation Coefficients (CC) were calculated between the Coefficient Of Variation (COV) of DSSR and the COVs of relevant factors. In cloudy-sky conditions, the CC between the COV of DSSR and cloud optical thickness ranged from 0.54 to 0.62, whereas the CC between DSSR COV and Column Water Vapor (CWV) COV was between 0.72 and 0.78. Under clear-sky conditions, the COV of CWV, aerosol optical depth, and PM2.5 showed more significant correlations with DSSR COV compared to altitude COV. Validation using ground-based measurements revealed that the accuracy of DSSR decreased at coarser spatial resolutions due to the presence of mixed pixel samples. Moreover, it was demonstrated that a spatial resolution of 0.05° offered the highest cost-effectiveness when estimating DSSR. These insights significantly advance our understanding of the role of spatial resolutions in DSSR estimation and are instrumental in guiding the selection of optimal resolutions for such studies."

 Global warming has shown an “Arctic amplification effect” in recent decades, leading to pronounced changes in pan-Arctic soil surface temperature (SST). SST plays a direct role in energy exchange between soil and atmosphere and serves as an indicator of the land–atmosphere energy balance. Remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) data is able to indicate near-surface temperature, but influences from environment factors, such as vegetation and snow, can introduce biases between LST and SST. In this study, the importances of five environment factors (vegetation, snow, surface soil composition, topography, and solar radiation) to monthly mean SST estimation from MODIS LST in pan-Arctic were analyzed. Then a method for pan-Arctic monthly mean SST estimation from MODIS LST by incorporating these environment factors and monthly-based modeling based on random forest (RF) algorithm was proposed. The results reveal that all the selected environment factors contribute to monthly-based modeling, with vegetation exerting the greatest importance from May to October and snow in March and April. The root mean square error (RMSE) of pan-Arctic monthly SST estimated by the proposed method from 2003 to 2022 ranges from 0.89 to 1.88 °C, which is a 42.95–––53.35 % reduction compared to the widely used season-based multivariate linear regression (MLR) models based solely on LST (RMSE between 1.56 and 4.03 °C). The accuracy is notably improved in areas with lower and no vegetation (grassy woodlands, grasslands, permanent wetlands, and barrens) in the cold season (September to the following April), and in higher vegetation (forests) areas in the warm season (May to August). The proposed method can contribute to producing high-precision monthly mean SST data from LST, estimating permafrost extent and active layer thickness, and understanding the land–atmosphere energy balance in pan-Arctic."

 Multispectral remote sensing image-based sea fog detection (SFD) is both important and challenging. Deep learning methods for SFD have become mainstream due to their powerful nonlinear learning capabilities and flexibility. However, existing methods have not fully utilized the physical difference priors in multispectral images (MSI) for SFD, making it difficult to skillfully capture the shape and appearance characteristics of sea fog, thus leading to uncertainties in SFD. We propose the spatial–spectral difference network (S2DNet), a deep encoding–decoding framework that merges inter-spectral and intra-spectral heterogeneous difference features. Specifically, inspired by physics-based difference threshold methods, we developed a physics-inspired inter-spectral difference module (PIDM) that combines feature-level difference with deep neural networks to capture the shape characteristics of sea fog. We designed the intra-spectral difference module (ISDM) using difference convolution to represent sea fog’s fine-grained and dynamic appearance information. Furthermore, inspired by multi-view learning, we propose heterogeneous feature mutual learning (HFML) that seeks robust representations by focusing on semantically invariant aspects within heterogeneous difference features, adapting to the dynamic nature of sea fog. HFML is achieved through global feature mutual learning using an adversarial procedure and local feature mutual learning supported by a novel information-theoretic objective function that links maximizing statistical correlation with expectation maximization. Experiments on two SFD datasets show that integrating physical difference priors into deep learning improves SFD. In both continuous temporal and high spatial resolution SFD tasks, S2DNet outperforms existing advanced deep learning methods. Moreover, S2DNet demonstrates stronger robustness under degraded remote sensing image conditions, highlighting its potential usefulness and practicality in real-world applications."

 Snow depth (SD) is essential for studying climate change and hydrological cycle on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Despite the effectiveness of passive microwave remote sensing for large-scale SD measurement, its low spatial resolution and scanning gaps limit its application, particularly in the TP region where the terrain is complex and snow distribution exhibits obvious heterogeneity. This study developed Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SD downscaling models for the TP using ensemble learning methods and AMSR2 brightness temperature data from October 1, 2012, to April 30, 2021. We employed five ensemble methods—AdaBoost, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest—with LightGBM achieving the highest accuracy (RMSE=2.66 cm). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was applied to the LightGBM model, optimizing factor selection and maintaining high accuracy. The models excelled in estimating shallow snow areas (SD<5 cm) with an RMSE of 1.60 cm. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to quantify global and local contributions of each factor in the modeling process. Key factors included snow cover days, meteorological influences, and brightness temperature (BT) at 89 GHz with horizontal polarization, although their contributions varied significantly across the TP due to environmental gradients. The resulting 500 m SD estimates offer detailed and accurate snow distribution information in complex mountainous regions.

 Thin cloud interference presents a significant challenge for the semantic segmentation of optical satellite imagery, which directly degrades the model accuracy and causes difficulties in sample selection. This paper generated a dataset named Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis discrimination (PTD), containing both cloudless and thin cloud scenarios. Based on this PTD dataset, an enhanced Atmospheric Scattering Model with Nonlinear Optimization (ASM_NL) was proposed to simulate high-fidelity thin clouds by incorporating two vital nonlinear terms: the point spread function and the Perlin noise. Additionally, we adopt a strategy of mixing simulated thin cloud-covered images (STCI) into the training set at a certain proportion to improve the semantic segmentation accuracy in thin cloud-covered scenarios. The conclusions are as follows: 1) ASM_NL can simulate high-fidelity clouds at an average Jensen-Shannon distance of 0.0699. 2) When dealing with medium- and high-cloud density datasets, mixing STCI proved to be more effective than cloud removal in mitigating thin cloud interference, resulting in average macro F1 score improvements of 0.164 and 0.094, respectively. 3) The semantic segmentation accuracy improved significantly by mixing STCI with a minimal proportion of 1/60, demonstrating the activation of model transfer capabilities.

 Aerosols are crucial constituents of the atmosphere, with significant impacts on air quality. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is critical in assessing solar resources and modeling sky radiance. However, comprehensive aerosol studies at a continental scale are limited, and existing methodologies need to consider spatial characteristics. This study develops a spatio-temporal unmixing with heterogeneity (STUH) model to evaluate spatial patterns and temporal trends of atmospheric aerosols across the African continent. The spatio-temporal AOD data cube, comprising monthly averaged MODIS-derived AOD data from 2001 to 2015, was decomposed using spatially non-negative matrix variabilization to explore the spatial determinants and the impacts of their interactions to AOD using a geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model. Our findings reveal an increasing trend of aerosol levels across Africa in the past 15 years, combined with the spatio-temporal AOD pattern explained by five abundance variables. We find that in different regions across Africa, the impact of natural variables on AOD was 1.56 to 3.01 times the impact of human variables, with significant spatial variations. These results are essential for understanding the climatic implications of atmospheric aerosols in Africa."

 It is crucial to clarify the nonlinear effects of urban multidimensional characteristics on land surface temperature (LST). However, the combined consideration of the urban green space (UGS), water bodies, buildings, and socio-economic factors is limited. And the diurnal differences in their thermal effects have been less considered. In this study, central Beijing was taken as study area. Local climate zones (LCZ) were firstly applied to reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LST. Then, the interpretable machine learning methods were utilized to quantitatively reveal nonlinear thermal effects of urban multidimensional characteristics, i.e., the UGS, water bodies, and building landscape features, and socio-economic features. The results indicated that built type LCZs have a higher average LST compared to natural type LCZs. And the LST of built type LCZs is simultaneously influenced by buildings’ density and height characteristics. Daytime LST is mainly affected by the landscape proportions of UGS, buildings, and trees, while nighttime LST is more influenced by socio-economic and building characteristics. The thermal effects of key factors exhibit nonlinear characteristics. Whether during the day or night, the impact of building coverage on LST is greater than that of building height, consistently exhibiting a warming effect. While, the building height and water body edge density factors both exhibited a reversal trend in their thermal impact between day and night.

 Although high-resolution satellite and in situ airborne observations are becoming a common data source for fire monitoring, reconstruction of the historical fire record is based on less suitable data. In many regions, managers and policy-makers rely solely on coarse resolution global fire datasets. This study assessed the suitability of readily available products to accurately depict several fire metrics by comparing them to the manually derived fire scars within three natural reserves in South Africa (2003–2020). Contrary to previous findings, we showed that MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 products detected the majority of the burned area (70–97 %) within protected areas and showed high temporal consistency. Additionally, active and burned area products accurately detected the length and the peak of the fire season. Nonetheless, we found neither medium nor coarse resolution data suitable for evaluating long-term changes in fire size distribution. Coarse resolution burned area products demonstrated a very limited capacity to detect fires smaller than 100 ha, while a lack of sufficient non-cloudy Landsat images led to substantial gaps in fire reconstruction, bringing an unknown level of uncertainties in fire metrics estimates. Similarly, the only available medium-resolution burned area product (GABAM) was unsuitable for fire monitoring since unmapped areas were classified as unburned, making no distinction between regions with an absence of data and an absence of fires. Meanwhile, the performance of FireCCILT11 was ranked the lowest among all the available fire products. Given the lack of resources in many protected areas in South Africa and the pressing need to evaluate current and historical fire management practices and policies, we conclude that, in the absence of a more accurate higher-resolution alternative, MCD64A1 was the most suitable product for capturing year-to-year fluctuations in fire activity and a combination of MODIS and VIIRS active fire products for monitoring changes in fire seasonality."

 The Himawari-8 satellite has the capability to rapidly retrieve sea surface temperature (SST) data at a high frequency of 10 min, demonstrating significant potential for various scientific applications. However, the presence of cloud often results in missing SST data at cloud locations, or can reduce the accuracy of retrieved SST. In contrast to the method of reconstructing missing SST data, this study focuses on exploring the potential of inverting SST under all-sky conditions. This study proposes a three-layer stacked machine learning model (TLSM), specifically designed for SST under all-sky conditions. The model integrates cloud properties into its input features to effectively account for the influence of cloud cover. Validation using 30 % match-up pairs generated an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.71 °C, a Bias of −0.01 °C, and an R2 of 0.91 based on 6383 samples. For clear-sky conditions, TLSM demonstrates a noteworthy enhancement in SST inversion accuracy (R2 = 0.98, RMSE=0.35 °C) compared to the official SST product (R2 = 0.86, RMSE=0.88 °C). In cases of optically thin clouds and clouds with low cloud top pressure, TLSM exhibits commendable proficiency in the inversion of SST. The Bias and RMSE for these cloud types indicate better performance compared to the official clear-sky SST data. While including cloud samples may reduce the overall accuracy of the TLSM, it substantially enhances the spatial coverage of the inverted SST. Considering the performance for each cloud type, TLSM may serve as an alternative approach for SST retrieve under thin clouds."

 There is an urgent need for accurate and effective Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWS). Most LEWS are currently based on temporally-aggregated measures of rainfall derived from either in-situ measurements or satellite-based rainfall estimates. Relying on a summary metric of precipitation may not capture the complexity of the rainfall signal and its dynamics in space and time in triggering landslides. Here, we present a proof-of-concept for constructing a LEWS based on an integrated spatio-temporal modelling framework. Our proposed methodology builds upon a recent approach that uses a daily rainfall time series instead of the traditional scalar aggregation. Specifically, we partition the study area into slope units and use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to process satellite-derived rainfall time series and combine the output features with a second neural network (NN) tasked with capturing the effect of terrain characteristics. To assess if our approach enhances accuracy, we applied it in Vietnam and benchmarked it against a modelling counterpart where we replaced the rainfall time series with the corresponding scalar representative of the cumulated precipitation. The corresponding duration was set at 14 days as it proved to produce the best performance. Our results show that our protocol leads to better performance in hindcasting landslides when making use of the rainfall as a continuous signal over time. While not tested here, our approach can be extended to rainfall obtained from weather forecasts, potentially leading to actual landslide forecasts."

 Since the arid regions of Central Asia (ACA) are located in the interior of Eurasia, water resources play a vital role in the stability of its ecosystem and economic development. Based on the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we analyze the observed characteristics of the TWSA over the ACA during 2003–2014. Results indicate that the terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the region showed an overall declining trend from 2003 to 2014, and the autumn TWS in this region is the smallest compared to other seasons and exhibits a strong decreasing trend at least −4.5 cm/decade. This means water resources over the ACA are scarcer and more vulnerable in autumn. The Distance between Indices of Simulation and Observation (DISO) method is employed to evaluate the performance of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) models in simulating the autumn TWSA over the ACA. Compared with observational results, the autumn TWSA values captured by CMIP6 models are larger and the declining TWS trends are weaker. Using the optimal CMIP6 models, the statistical downscaling method constrains the projection results of autumn TWSA values over the ACA using the GRACE datasets. It shows autumn TWS will continue to decrease in most parts of the ACA in the future, and water scarcity will be the most severe in Tajikistan and southwestern Kazakhstan. Under SSP126, Tajikistan’s TWSA is projected to decrease by 11.0 cm in the long term. This study reveals the current situation and possible future changes in TWS over the ACA in autumn, providing references for water resource management and sustainable development policies in this area to avoid losses caused by water scarcity."

Simis;Jean-François Cretaux;Clement Albergel;Andrew Tyler;Evangelos Spyrakos,"Impacts of droughts and human activities on water quantity and quality: Remote sensing observations of Lake Qadisiyah, Iraq","•La Niña events led to droughts in the Lake Qadisiyah catchment. •Lake water level declined to a minimum 10 months after a drought. •Lake water quality deteriorations were observed during droughts. •Human activities presented impacts on water level and water qualities. 
 Water quantity and quality in lakes are closely linked to the compounding effects of climate change and human activities in their catchments, especially for lakes located in semi-arid and arid regions where water resources are scarce. Whilst knowledge gaps exist for these effects in semi-arid and arid region lakes due mainly to the lack of long-term in situ monitoring data. By using satellite remote sensing data, this study firstly investigated the variations of water level, chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and turbidity in Lake Qadisiyah, Iraq between 2000 and 2019. Results showed that the average water level was 138.3 m in 2000–2019, it decreased clearly in 2001, 2009, 2015 and 2018 with the lowest value of 120 m in July 2015. The mean Chl-a was 6.3 mg/m3 and it showed an overall increasing trend during 2000 and 2019. Turbidity showed extremely high values (>10 NTU) in 2009 and 2017–2018 compared to the mean value of 3.6 NTU in 2000–2019. The boosted regression tree (BRT) was then used to explore the relationship between those variations and El Niño-Southern Oscillation, droughts, meteorological factors and land use land cover changes in the catchment. Results revealed that water level declines were mainly associated with droughts led by La Niña events. Chl-a increase in the lake were mainly explained by built-up area increase and water area decrease in the catchment, with a relative contribution of 29.2 % and 28.6 % respectively. Water area changes in the catchment were the main factor influencing turbidity explaining 55.3 % of the variation. An exception water level decline in 2014–2016 was also observed when there was no drought, which was most likely caused by the cut off of water flow upstream and the release of water from the dam during periods of war. The findings in this study underscored the impacts of climate and human activities on water quantity and quality in semi-arid region lakes. Actions such as improving water use efficiency, establishing water storages, and enhancing cross-border cooperation are therefore recommended to deal with extreme events. Pollution control measures in the catchment are also suggested to prevent water quality deterioration in the lake."

 Shrub encroaching on grasslands threatens grassland ecosystems and negatively affects human land use and livelihood. However, existing research on this subject is limited, having focused on small areas, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of the diverse patterns of large-scale shrub invasions into grasslands. In recent decades, a significant encroachment of shrubs into Xilin Gol grassland has been observed in China, resulting in considerable damage to the grasslands. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the rapid expansion of shrub-encroached grassland (SEG) from 1990 to 2020 in the Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, using long-term Landsat images. The spatial distribution characteristics of the new SEG areas were analyzed. The main factors driving the shrub encroachment in the study area were identified using a geographic detector. Our results revealed a continuous expansion of SEG in the study area over the past three decades, marked by an increase of 48.76 × 103 km2 and an average annual gain rate of 9.41 %. The increased SEG was primarily owing to grassland transition. The sprawl of the SEG was the most prominent in the western and northern regions of the study area, extending to gentle slopes of approximately 5° and low-middle elevations between 600–1300 m above mean sea level. Shrub encroachment was primarily influenced by surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity, with elevation, slope, and precipitation exerting relatively weaker influences. Rather than being driven by a singular factor, the expansion was a result of the combined influence of various factors. This study provides a valuable case study for understanding shrub invasion dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions globally."

 Due to the rapidly changing climate conditions, precipitation nowcasting poses a daunting challenge because it is impossible to make accurate short-term forecasts due to the rapid fluctuations in weather conditions. There are limitations to traditional methods of forecasting precipitation, such as the use of numerical models and radar extrapolation, when it comes to providing highly detailed and timely forecasts. With the help of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, including deep neural networks, transformers and generative models, complex precipitation nowcasting tasks can be performed in an efficient way. To address this critical task and enhance proactive emergency disaster management, we propose an innovative method based on transformer-based generative models for precipitation nowcasting. Our study area is the Soyang Dam basin in South Korea, located upstream of the Han River, characterized by a monsoon climate with approximately 1200 mm of annual precipitation. To develop a precipitation nowcasting model, radar composite data from 10 weather radars across South Korea is used. By utilizing radar reflective data in order to train our model, we are able to effectively predict future precipitation patterns, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic weather conditions caused by heavy rainfalls. This dataset covers reflectivity data from 2018 to 2022, with a spatial resolution of 1km over a 960 × 1200 grid. Normalization using the min–max scaler method is applied to this reflectivity data, which is then transformed into grayscale images for uniform comparison. We enhance performance effectively by employing transfer learning with pre-trained Transformer models. Initially, we train the model using a comprehensive dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tune it for precipitation nowcasting using radar reflective data. This adaptation improves the accuracy of rainfall forecasting by capturing crucial features. Leveraging prior task knowledge through transfer learning not only enhances prediction accuracy but also increases overall efficiency. In terms of predictive accuracy, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based nowcasting model outperforms related approaches, including conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), U-Net, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), pySTEP. As a result of this research, disaster preparedness and response will be greatly improved through improved weather prediction."
