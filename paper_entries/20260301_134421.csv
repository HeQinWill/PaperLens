To address this, we developed an economical and high-throughput New Approach Methodology (NAM) framework that integrates leave-one-out method with dose-dependent yeast functional genomic analysis (DYFGA). We applied this framework to investigate environmentally prevalent benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers (BUVSs: UV-326, UV-327, UV-328, UV-329, UV-P, and UV-PS). Results demonstrated that UV-PS contributed most significantly to the mixture’s antagonistic effect, as evidenced by the lowest point-of-departure (POD) similarity between the “Leave_UV-PS” and the “All” mixture, followed by UV-P and UV-328. The joint toxicity of the six BUVSs exhibited antagonistic interactions, indicated by a higher POD value for the “All” mixture compared to others. This antagonistic interaction was consistently observed in binary and ternary mixtures of the main antagonism contributors (UV-P, UV-PS, and UV-328) and was validated by conventional cytotoxicity assays. Mechanistic insights from the genomic analysis suggest these effects are potentially mediated through disruption of the cell cycle and DNA replication. These findings not only enhance understanding of the complex toxicology of BUVS mixtures but also present a robust methodological framework for evaluating the health risks posed by more intricate chemical mixtures in real-world settings."

Moor,Singlet Oxygen Quantum Yields: Comparing Chemical Probe and Time-Resolved Phosphorescence,"Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an important reactive intermediate in aquatic photochemical reactions, altering the fate and transformation of pollutants. Past work has primarily quantified 1O2 generation in aquatic systems using the chemical probe furfuryl alcohol (FFA). An alternative method to quantify 1O2 is to directly observe 1O2 through its phosphorescence emission. While this method is receiving growing interest, there has yet to be a direct comparison of measured 1O2 generation efficiencies (i.e., quantum yields) between the FFA and 1O2 phosphorescence methods. In this study, we compared the 1O2 quantum yields (ΦΔ) between these two methods for a broad set of samples, including small molecule sensitizers, dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolates, and pyrogenic DOM (PyDOM). FFA and 1O2 phosphorescence methods yielded significantly different ΦΔ values for many small molecule sensitizers and DOM/PyDOM samples. For DOM/PyDOM, the 1O2 phosphorescence method yielded 1.4 – 3.8 times higher ΦΔ. We additionally explored potential FFA-mediated triplet excited state quenching processes using laser spectroscopy. While we observed that FFA effectively quenched and/or chemically reacted with triplets of small molecule sensitizers, we observed minimal quenching of the triplet excited state DOM/PyDOM by FFA. This suggests that for DOM/PyDOM, FFA-triplet reactions are not major side reactions in FFA-based 1O2 measurements at 365 nm. Results from this study illuminate the potential issues of FFA interacting with sensitizer triplet excited states and advance the understanding of 1O2 phosphorescence-based ΦΔ measurements."

SOA particles evaporate more slowly than expected at nearly size-independent rates, but the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Here, we apply kinetic multilayer modeling to simulate evaporation of α-pinene SOA, demonstrating that surface crust formation, emerging from accumulation of low-volatility compounds at the particle surface, leads to slow evaporation and reduced size dependence of the evaporation rate. While evaporation induced by decomposition of oligomers would naturally lead to size-independent evaporation rates, we observe and simulate nearly size-independent slow evaporation of polyethylene glycol mixture particles containing polymeric species that do not decompose, confirming the relevance of composition-dependent diffusivity for size-independent, slow evaporation. Slow evaporation of limonene SOA was also observed in environmental chamber experiments, and model simulations demonstrate strong surface crust formation with bulk diffusivity being depressed by up to 5 orders of magnitude compared to the inner bulk. We present experimental evidence using a surface-based mass spectrometry technique that shows that the particle surface becomes enriched in high molecular weight compounds upon evaporation of monomers. Our findings imply that viscous surface crusts may also limit the growth and chemical transformation of SOA particles, influencing their impacts on air quality and climate."

We employed nanopore-based long-read and Illumina-based short-read sequencing techniques for metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, respectively, on samples collected from an integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) bioreactor run in the conventional A2O mode under low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions.

Some Candidatus Accumulibacter strains encoded for either full or partial denitrification. Ca. Accumulibacter were very efficient in aerobic and anoxic inorganic phosphorus (Pi) uptake, while the second highly enriched Ca. Accumulibacter was as competitive for denitrification metabolism. The potential of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in both the floc and biofilm communities was nearly 20 times higher in the aerobic zone than in the anoxic zone. As opposed to our initial hypothesis that slow growers will mostly reside in biofilms, the expression of ammonium monooxygenase (amoABC) was higher in flocs than in biofilm communities."

However, the key drivers and causal mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the design of biochar strategies for carbon sequestration. This study integrated machine learning (ML) and partial least-squares path modeling (PLS–PM) to establish an interpretable causal framework. Using a global data set, a high-precision random forest model quantified the primary drivers. Soil properties dominated the predictions (60.27%), with phosphorus (P) (optimal level: <0.7 g/kg) and pH emerging as the most critical factors. Nonlinear thresholds showed that the Cd role shifted from positive to insignificant beyond 5.8 mg/kg. PLS–PM quantified the causal pathways: (i) physicochemical interactions (e.g., P competitive adsorption reduced SOC by β = −0.62, p < 0.001); (ii) climate-mediated cascades; and (iii) biochar aging feedback. Validation of the model using independent data sets beyond the training scope demonstrated a reasonable relative ΔSOC prediction error range (±6%–20%). SOC accumulation increased with higher pH, Cd content, and biochar dosage. Site-specific design should prioritize (i) inherent soil properties (pH and P), (ii) Cd gradients, and (iii) tailored biochar parameters. The framework enhances biochar design to optimize SOC sequestration and synergistic Cd management."

Cusick;Shannon Yee;Jeremy S. Guest,The Potential of Thermomechanical and Thermochemical Processes to Enable Sustainable Household Sanitation,"Biological processes underpin centralized wastewater treatment but are difficult to deploy at a small scale. Thermomechanical and thermochemical approaches could enable household-level sanitation, yet their economic and environmental potential remains unclear. We assessed two prototype household reinvented toilets (HRTs), with either pasteurization mechanical dewatering (PMD) and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) treatment processes, using integrated process simulation, techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment under uncertainty. The total annualized expenditures (including capital and operating) are 1.41–1.87 (5th to 95th percentiles) and 1.85–2.45 USD·cap–1·day–1 for PMD and SCWO, respectively, placing both at the high end of global centralized treatment prices. The life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions span 321–452 and 362–520 kg CO2-eq·cap–1·year–1 for PMD and SCWO, respectively, with the grid electricity contributing 87–90% in both HRTs. Poor solid–liquid separation disproportionately increases costs and GHG emissions for SCWO relative to PMD. In the short term, optimizing a few levers─number of users, flush water volume, and the detailed design of the SCWO unit─can significantly reduce cost and emissions. In the long term, operating at maximum efficiency reduces both cost and emissions by approximately 70%. Deployment in locations with low wage, low-carbon electricity, low price levels, and large household sizes offers the greatest potential, positioning HRTs as viable advanced decentralized sanitation options in specialized settings."

Lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxides (NCM), the predominant cathode materials in modern LIBs, are of particular concern because of their high content of redox-active transition metals (TMs). Nevertheless, their dissolution behavior and underlying molecular mechanisms under environmentally relevant conditions are poorly understood. In this study, we systematically examined four commercial NCM compositions (NCM111, 523, 622, and 811) under environmentally relevant variables, including pH, temperature, salinity, and organic ligands. Lithium ions (Li+) exhibited high solubility across all conditions (>80%), whereas nickel ions (Ni2+), cobalt ions (Co2+), and manganese ions (Mn2+) demonstrated low but environmentally sensitive release (∼2%). Compared with temperature, salinity, and humic acid, metal dissolution was governed primarily by pH and citric acid. Density functional theory (DFT), combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, revealed that environmental factors influence the dissolution free energy (ΔG) through proton attack, ligand binding, ionic strength, and lattice destabilization. Experiments conducted in six representative waters further confirmed enhanced Ni2+ and Co2+ release in acidic, organic-rich leachates. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insights into NCM dissolution pathways and contribute to risk assessment and sustainable management strategies for spent LIBs."

Using qPCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and multivariate analysis, we demonstrated that the PUF–PASs detected higher bacterial biomass, as evidenced by significantly elevated gene copy numbers and estimated bacterial cells per m3 of air volume, but exhibited lower diversity compared to Hi-Vol samplers. Hi-Vol samplers recovered a more taxonomically diverse community, including transient and rare taxa, during sampling periods of 1 day and 1 week. Hi-Vol detected genera not detected in long-term PUF–PAS sampling, while PUF–PAS detected species not observed in short-term Hi-Vol. PUF–PAS samples were enriched with environmental and spore-forming persistent genera. Hi-Vol samples were enriched with opportunistic and human-associated episodic spikes in a range of bacterial species. PCoA analysis confirmed a substantial divergence in bacterial community structure by sampler type and duration. Temporal analysis results showed a progressive shift in bacterial community composition with increasing sampling duration in PUF–PAS. The findings highlight the complementary benefits of both sampler types: active air sampling for capturing short-lived human-associated bioaerosols and taxonomic richness, while passive air samplers favor biomass accumulation and chronic exposure profiling, enabling exposure assessment and ecological surveillance."

Using quantum mechanical methods and quantitative structure–activity-relationship (QSAR) tools, accurate temperature-dependent octanol/air partition coefficients (KOA) and vapor pressures (PL) of the subcooled liquid were calculated. Under the pessimistic greenhouse gas emissions scenario SSP5–8.5 as projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an annual shift in the SVOC equilibrium concentration between gas phase, particle phase, and surface by up to 30% is expected until 2100. The SSP5–8.5 scenario leads to higher SVOC emission rates and changes in the organic film thickness on surfaces. However, since primarily annual averages are considered, these temperature-related changes are small. Nevertheless, a model calculation for the emission rate of DINCH, taking into account extreme daily indoor temperatures, was performed. Since many developments up to 2100 can only be estimated, simplifying assumptions were made for emission rates, film thickness, and other parameters."

Jimenez;Joost de Gouw,Measurements and Modeling of GUV222-Driven Increases in SOA Concentrations in an Unoccupied Office,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to heightened interest in germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) lamps, which can deactivate bacteria and viruses in infectious aerosols. Recently, lamps using 222 nm (GUV222) light to disinfect occupied spaces have become more popular and available, as that wavelength is safer for human exposure compared to 254 nm lamps. However, GUV222 produces ozone, which drives the formation of other pollutants. Previous work in a controlled Teflon chamber with GUV222 has shown the production of ozone, followed by the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from limonene ozonolysis, and developed a model of this process. This work adapts that model to newly obtained measurements in an unoccupied office. The model is able to accurately predict SOA formation and yield given a continuous source of limonene, and we use it here to show how GUV222 lamps increase SOA exposure in indoor spaces. SOA yields from limonene in the office were found to be similar to those measured in a Teflon chamber. However, SOA formation resulting from briefly emitted limonene was harder to capture in the model. Typically, these limonene injections led to the formation of many ultrafine particles, which did not result in a significant increase in SOA mass, although they can still pose a risk to human health. GUV222 also had other impacts on room chemistry; concentrations of most VOCs increased under GUV222, potentially driven by gas and surface-phase ozone reactions as well as direct surface emissions."

Here, we combusted six Chinese coals and six biomass fuels at 500 °C (LIT) and 800 °C (HIT). We measured PM and particle-phase PACs (16 parent PAHs and 9 oxygenated PAHs) in 14 size bins ranging from 0.016 to 10 μm. Higher ignition temperature shifted PAC composition toward more toxic species, with biomass showing a stronger shift than coal. Submicron particles (0.10–0.60 μm) carried most of the PAC burden and toxicity, accounting for >60% of total PACs and dominating the equivalent toxicity. Ultrafine particles (UFPs, <0.10 μm) contributed only ∼3% of PM mass but carried up to ∼20% of total PACs. Their mass-specific toxicity (equivalent toxicity per unit PM mass) was 2–10 times higher than that of submicron particles. Respiratory deposition modeling showed clear age dependence: under the same exposure scenario, children had ∼40% higher total respiratory deposition of particulate PACs than adults. About 70% of UFP-bound PACs deposited in the pulmonary region, with their contribution to pulmonary deposition being higher in children than in adults."

However, research on the specific mechanism remains extremely limited. In this study, a multi-methodological framework integrating network toxicology, machine learning, and molecular docking was adopted to explore the potential toxicity and molecular mechanisms of PFAS-induced NAFLD. Key molecular targets were identified by integrating transcriptomic data with toxicological databases such as CTD, ToxCast, and GeneCards. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) was constructed using integrated PFAS–gene–phenotype evidence, and the interaction network was visualized via Cytoscape. The AOP was further validated through in vitro experiments, QWoE assessment, and clinical sample analysis. We determined that the downregulation of THBS1 serves as the molecular initiating event (MIE) in PFAS-induced NAFLD. This downregulation leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which subsequently triggers lipid metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory responses, ultimately resulting in hepatic steatosis. HFPO-TA causes more pronounced lipid accumulation than PFOA or HFPO-DA at the same concentration, suggesting a higher adipogenic potential. It is particularly worth noting that alternative PFASs may have greater metabolic toxicity than traditional compounds like PFOA. This study clarifies the mechanistic foundation of the AOP of PFAS-induced NAFLD, thus providing support for risk assessment and the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Cord blood samples are frequently employed in epidemiological studies to evaluate the links between contaminant exposure and birth outcomes. However, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding the presence of QACs in cord blood and their potential associations with birth outcomes. In this study, QACs were analyzed in 235 cord blood samples collected in a hospital in Jinan, Shandong Province, from February 2017 to January 2022. QACs were detected in the investigated cord blood samples, with total concentrations reaching up to 47.3 ng/mL. Benzylalkyldimethyl ammonium compounds (BACs) accounted for the largest proportion, with BAC-C12 and BAC-C14 being the most abundant QACs. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were developed to explore the relationships between QACs exposure and newborn birth outcomes. Results showed that BAC-C10, BAC-C16, and octyl decyldimethyl ammonium-8:10 were positively associated with birth weight and ponderal index (p for trend < 0.05), suggesting an obesogenic hypothesis. Furthermore, these three QAC structures can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ, the core adipogenesis receptor). The margin of exposure results indicated that the obesogenic risks of QACs were limited under current exposure distributions, but ongoing attention is warranted due to uncertainties and sensitive life stages."

Barron,Communicating Confidence in the Reliability of Micro- and Nanoplastic Identification in Human Health Studies,"Accurately quantifying and characterizing human internal exposure to micro- and nanoplastics are critical for assessing potential health risks. However, the detection of these particles in human tissues, fluids, cell systems, and relevant models remains a major analytical challenge. There is an urgent need for robust, selective, sensitive, and high-throughput methods capable of generating reliable quantitative data. Equally essential is the transparent reporting of methodological limitations and uncertainties, supported by rigorous data collection and standardized practices. These challenges are compounded by the ubiquity of plastic particles, and therefore the risk of sample contamination and their diverse properties (e.g., size, shape, composition), all adding to the complexity of identifying and quantifying them in biological matrices. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates orthogonal analytical techniques to enhance the data reliability. Commonly used analytical techniques for the analysis of micro- and nanoplastics are assigned a category based on their specificity when identifying plastic particles. The framework proposes minimum data requirements from orthogonal techniques for the identification of plastic particles at various confidence levels. Clear communication of analytical confidence is vital, and we present a structured approach to support this. We emphasize the importance of scientific integrity, rigorous study design, and transparent reporting in health research. Finally, we call for the universal adoption of harmonized confidence criteria for reporting the presence of plastics in humans, an essential step toward informed decision-making."

Herein, we conducted a comprehensive NHANES analysis to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of earlier menopause associated with PFOA exposure and further investigated the underlying mechanisms through a prenatal mouse model and complementary cell-based assays. Higher serum PFOA levels were significantly associated with earlier age at natural menopause (2nd tertile: HR = 1.220, P = 0.004; third tertile: HR = 1.262, P = 0.002). In mice, prenatal PFOA exposure caused persistent ovarian dysfunction in middle-aged F1 offspring, characterized by ovarian cyst formation, a premature decline in ovulatory capacity, increased follicular atresia, and disrupted estrous cyclicity. PFOA induced granulosa cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, increasing the arrested population from 84.9% to 87.6%, thereby reducing proliferation as a key contributor to ovarian cyst formation. Transcriptomic profiling and qPCR validation demonstrated that PFOA activated PPARγ signaling, with PPARγ and ANGPTL4 upregulated by 1.6-fold and 12.6-fold, respectively. PFOA exposure further induced upregulation of ANGPTL4 as revealed by siRNA-mediated knockdown assays, which mediated reduced granulosa cell proliferation. Our findings link prenatal PFOA exposure to long-term ovarian toxicity through granulosa cell dysfunction mediated by PPARγ–ANGPTL4 signaling, providing new evidence and potential targets for adverse reproductive outcomes on PFOA."

Traditional detection methods, albeit important, are limited by single analytical indicators and time-consuming procedures, which lead to distorted detection results for biomarkers with high metabolic rates. Herein, a multiplexed electrochemical sensing array was designed based on nanozyme capsules; this metal-porphyrin-structured covalent–organic framework embedded with enzymes simultaneously detected H2O2, acetylcholine (ACh), and glucose (Glu). The nanozyme capsule not only exhibits peroxidase-like activity for the sensitive detection of H2O2 but also serves as a carrier to encapsulate enzymes within its cavities, forming a cascade catalytic system for the specific recognition of ACh or Glu. This sensor features a broad detection range, low detection limits, and a strong anti-interference capability. More importantly, it can rapidly quantify three easily degradable biomarkers in neuronal lysates within 3 min without pretreatment. With the sensor, we multidimensionally assessed and differentiated the effects of different microplastics (MPs) based on the ability of neurons to produce ACh and H2O2 as well as their glucose uptake capacity.

While carboxyl surface modification is known to reduce NP toxicity in some systems, its protective efficacy in intestinal environments remains unclear. This study investigated the comparative effects of pristine PS and PMMA versus their carboxylated derivatives (PS-COOH and PMMA-COOH) on gut dysbiosis in zebrafish larvae. Pathological examination revealed that PS induced the most severe intestinal epithelial damage, which was effectively mitigated by carboxylation. Conversely, PMMA triggered robust gut inflammation, evidenced by significant upregulation of proinflammatory markers IL-1β and NOS2A, effects that persisted despite carboxylation. These differences were correlated with microbiota shifts: PMMA groups significantly enriched opportunistic pathogens (Vibrio and Morganella), while PS-COOH only partially restored microbial balance. Functional analyses identified that carboxylation disrupts key microbial pathways, including amino acid metabolism and NOD-like receptor signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The roles of gut microbes were further verified by challenging the microbiota-depleted model with Morganella morganii. Our results demonstrate that polymer composition dictates carboxyl modification efficacy─protective for PS but ineffective for PMMA─highlighting the need for material-specific NP safety assessments."

Among these, perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) have been reported to exert male reproductive toxicity, yet comparative risks across individual PFAS remain unclear. In this study, we employed an innovative systematic review strategy, the Targeted Risk Assessment of Environmental Chemicals (TRAEC) strategy, integrating all available evidence from 25 epidemiological studies, 75 in vivo, and 43 in vitro experiments, alongside independent experiments, to assess the effects of multiple PFAS on semen quality and sex hormone levels. The integrated evidence indicated that PFAS exposure posed a moderate risk level to male reproductive health with a comprehensive risk score of 6.47. Among individual PFAS, exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, risk score: 7.43) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, risk score: 6.38) presented the highest risk of sperm abnormalities, followed by perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDoA, risk score: 6.29), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, risk score: 5.83), and perfluorohexyl sulfonic acid (risk score: 4.87), all of which are at moderate risk levels. And the risk of these PFAS compounds causing reproductive hormone abnormalities was at a low to moderate level, with the risk scores ranging from 3.79 (PFOA) to 6.74 (PFDoA). Additionally, PFAS exposure showed a relatively high risk of adversely affecting sperm progressive motility (risk score range: 5.23–5.62), particularly for PFOS (risk score: 5.57) and PFNA (risk score: 5.62). Risk for other sperm parameters was relatively lower (risk score range: 4.01–5.49). Notably, independent in vivo experiments confirmed that PFNA exposure significantly impaired sperm routine parameters and sperm dynamics across multiple mouse strains (including C57BL/6J, CC002, CC037, and CC057 strains). Our study identified PFOS and PFNA as particularly detrimental to male reproductive health across multiple dimensions, underscoring the urgent need for measures to reduce PFAS exposure and mitigate risks to male fertility."

However, its expanding application in diverse fields has raised concerns about inadvertent environmental release, which might lead to potential ecological and health risks. Herein, mice were continuously exposed at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day (possible acceptable daily intake dose, ADI) and 1 mg/kg/day (possible occupational exposure dose) to BPNSs for 28 days. Using hyperspectral imaging and Evans blue fluorescence chromogenic assay, we confirmed that partial BPNSs penetrated the blood–testis barrier (BTB) and distributed throughout the spermatogenic microenvironment of testes. Mice exposed to BPNSs exhibited significant reproductive toxicity, evidenced by abnormal sperm parameters, disordered spermatogenic cell layers, sloughed germ cells, and disrupted sex hormone levels. Further, BPNSs promoted the steroid synthesis pathway and inhibited testosterone aromatization, leading to testicular endocrine homeostasis disorders. BPNSs also damaged germ cells in the testes via the apoptosis pathway. In conclusion, our study not only highlights the male reproductive toxicity of BPNSs but also demonstrates that BPNSs can penetrate the BTB and have bioaccumulation potential in the male reproductive system, which provides new insights into the toxicological implications of 2D nanomaterials for mammalian fertility."

Woodruff,Unraveling Plastic-Related Chemical Exposures during Pregnancy and Their Associations with Pregnancy Outcomes Using Suspect Screening Analysis,"Plastic production has increased sharply in recent decades, releasing numerous chemicals through degradation and additive leaching. We evaluated prenatal exposure to plastic-related chemicals and their associations with pregnancy outcomes using suspect screening analysis in 200 pregnant participants recruited between 13 and 27 weeks of gestation. We detected 441 chemicals in maternal serum samples (9 identified at confidence level 1 and 432 tentatively identified at level 2), using liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) with an in-house database of 5267 plastic-related chemicals. We compiled the in-house database with predicted spectra and RTs for 4272 chemicals without available spectra, improving the reliability of suspect screening. Three level 1 chemicals─1,3-diphenylguanidine, undecanedioic acid, and 1-octyl-2-pyrrolidone─and 230 level 2 chemicals have not been widely reported, with fewer than 10 publications in the existing literature. Among level 1 chemicals, an interquartile range increase in acetyl tributyl citrate, progesterone, diisobutyl phthalate, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and PFOS was associated with higher odds of preterm birth. PFOS and undecanedioic acid were associated with increased odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in logistic regression models adjusted for maternal age and race/ethnicity. We observed associations between four level 2 chemicals and GDM, and eight were associated with gestational hypertension. Exposure levels varied significantly by education, race/ethnicity, and nativity, with higher PFOS observed in participants with higher educational attainment and in non-Hispanic White groups. Our findings highlight novel chemical exposures and their associations with pregnancy complications, raising concerns about gaps in the monitoring of plastic-related chemicals and their potential impacts on maternal health."

In a graded observational cohort with documented occupational noise histories, we integrated serum metabolomics, lipidomics, and immunophenotyping with interpretable machine learning. Mediation analysis suggested that a panel of metabolites, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), fumaric acid, and sphingolipids, accounted for a substantial proportion of the association between noise exposure and tinnitus severity (indirect effect = 92%, p < 0.001). Lipidomic profiling indicated early sphingolipid perturbations, followed by patterns consistent with T helper 1 (Th1)–skewed immune activation and lower circulating GABA, outlining a putative “Exposure–Metabolism–Immunity” cascade. A CatBoost predictive model trained on these features stratified tinnitus severity with 84.8% accuracy and a mean absolute error of 0.174. In summary, our findings identify specific biomarker associations that link occupational noise exposure to the metabolic and immune signatures of tinnitus and generate hypotheses implicating GABAergic tone and sphingolipid metabolism as candidate pathways for future mechanistic and interventional studies."

We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the dynamic changes in pharyngeal and gut microbiota before, during, and after acclimatization to the Mount Qomolangma region (high-altitude, 4300–5200 m above sea level, m.a.s.l.). Twenty healthy participants underwent four health visits: at baseline level (Beijing, 50 m.a.s.l.), upon arrival at the high altitude, after a week of acclimatization, and upon return to the baseline level. Throat swabs and fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to assess microbial composition and diversity. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to estimate the altitude-associated variations in pharyngeal and gut microbes compared to the baseline. Pharyngeal microbial diversity showed statistically significant alterations after 1 week at high altitude, with the Shannon index decreasing by 12.0% (95% CI: −21.8 to −2.9%) and the Simpson index increasing by 2.6% (1.3 to 4.0%). In contrast, gut microbial diversity decreased upon initial high-altitude exposure but tended to revert to baseline after 1 week of acclimatization. Beta diversity analyses revealed significant differences in pharyngeal microbiota across visits, while gut microbiota differences were less pronounced. Using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method, we identified 11 pharyngeal and four gut microbes that were differentially abundant across visits, which could shape the host’s resilience to high-altitude challenges. Our study reveals that high-altitude exposure disrupts pharyngeal and gut microbial diversity over time and modulates the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens. These shifts may mediate host responses to hypoxic environments, underscoring the microbiomes’ role in physiological acclimatization."

Health (CPH) Study Group",Temperature Variability and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: The China Pulmonary Health Study,"While the health effects of ambient temperature have been widely studied, temperature variability (TV), which is a critical aspect of climate change, has received limited attention. This study investigated the associations and potential mediating effects of long-term TV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a national scale. COPD was identified based on lung function data from the China Pulmonary Health Study (N = 50,991). Long-term TV was defined as the standard deviation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the year prior to the spirometry test. Logistic regression and multivariable linear models were used to quantify the associations of long-term TV with COPD and lung function parameters, respectively. Mediation analyses examined the roles of mental health and blood biomarkers. Each 1 °C increase in temperature variability was associated with a higher risk of COPD (OR (odds ratio): 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.14). TV was also significantly associated with reductions in both pre- and postbronchodilator lung function, particularly in small-airway function such as FEF25–75 (−58.38 mL/s, 95% CI: −69.62, −47.14). Mediation analyses indicated that a slight proportion of the TV effect on COPD (1.56–9.55%) was mediated through mental health (anxiety or depression) and blood biomarkers (neutrophil rate, red blood cell count). Long-term TV is an independent risk factor for COPD and impaired lung function. The results suggested that these effects may be mediated in parts through psychosocial and inflammatory pathways. Climate-adaptive public health strategies should incorporate temperature variability to protect respiratory health."

Chronic overexposure to Mn can cause a Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study combined in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 axis in regulating the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway in the process of Mn-induced Tau aggregation leading to neurotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that MnCl2 exposure significantly activated both the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis and the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway, accompanied by increased Tau expression. Genetic ablation of cGAS, STING, or NLRP3 attenuated Mn-induced Tau upregulation, indicating that the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis mediates Tau expression. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that the decreased Tau expression in knockout cells is associated with the MAPK/NF–κB signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or NF–κB markedly downregulated cGAS–STING signaling, inflammatory cytokine release, and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) levels. Moreover, we observed colocalization and interaction among p-p38, p-p65, and p-Tau. Overall, these findings reveal that Mn activates the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis regulated by the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway, driving pathological Tau aggregation."

This review systematically integrates current evidence on the formation and transformation of MNPs under mechanical, photochemical, thermal, oxidative, and biological processes, highlighting that environmental MNPs are predominantly aged rather than pristine particles. Aging significantly reshapes particle shape, size, surface chemistry, and reactivity, thereby altering mobility, persistence, and interactions with copollutants, biota, and humans. By adopting a source─transformation─exposure─risk framework, this review clarifies the critical importance of understanding transformation pathways for tracing pollution origins, revealing exposure routes and doses, and improving health risk assessment. Particular attention is directed toward nanoplastics, whose elevated reactivity and bioavailability remain poorly understood due to analytical limitations. Strategic research priorities are identified, including the development of multifactorial aging simulation models, advanced detection and characterization techniques, and lifecycle-oriented mitigation strategies. This work advances a forward-looking perspective that connects mechanistic understanding with risk governance, providing a scientific foundation for more accurate prediction, monitoring, and control of MNP pollution."

In this study, the effects of FCDs and glucose CDs on feeding behavior in mice were elucidated from the perspectives of gut microbiome, metabolic flow monitoring, and metabolomics. The results demonstrated that persistent intake of FCDs (25 mg/kg/day) for 30 days significantly caused diminished appetite. Mechanistic findings suggested that FCDs were involved in the regulation of appetite reduction through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. FCDs induce perturbations in the gut microbiota, leading to increased levels of intestinal inflammation. In addition, the intake of FCDs was directly involved in microbial metabolism to generate SCFAs, activate intestinal GPR-41/43, promote the release of glucagon-like peptide, and further stimulate the hypothalamus to significantly downregulate the expression of AGRP and upregulate the expression of POMC, ultimately leading to the reduction of appetite. Moreover, intake of FCDs regulates intestinal fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and other factors affecting the level of health of the organism.

We measured trihalomethanes in blood and haloacetic acids and oxidative stress markers in urine samples. In adjusted models, each 2.7-fold increase in urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) concentrations was associated with a greater PSQI score of 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.50). A clear dose–response relationship was observed when TCAA concentrations were included as quartile variables (P for trend = 0.01). In the analyses of individual PSQI components, TCAA was associated with a greater risk of difficulty in falling asleep, short sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction (odds ratios = 1.33 (1.04, 1.70), 1.35 (1.03, 1.78), and 1.39 (1.08, 1.78), respectively, per 2.7-fold increase in TCAA concentrations).

This study integrates human epidemiological data with experimental models to elucidate these pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets. First, in a cross-sectional study of Mn-exposed workers, we observed elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysregulated expression of mRNAs related to AA metabolism, both of which were identified as important mediators between Mn exposure and cognitive impairment. In mouse models, multilevel analyses combining behavioral assays, striatal transcriptomics, and oxidized lipid metabolomics demonstrated that Mn exposure triggers microglial activation, disrupts AA metabolic pathways, and drives neuroinflammation, culminating in cognitive impairment. A central finding was the downregulation of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an endogenous PPARγ ligand with strong anti-inflammatory properties, in both human serum and the mouse striatum following Mn exposure. Furthermore, bioinformatics and molecular docking nominated MMP9 (Matrix metalloproteinase-9) as a potential key target, which we functionally validated by showing that MMP9 knockdown in BV2 microglia attenuated Mn-induced inflammatory responses. Finally, we confirmed the therapeutic potential of 15d-PGJ2 by demonstrating its efficacy in suppressing these adverse outcomes in vitro. Our findings establish that 15d-PGJ2 deficiency and AA metabolic dysregulation are important mechanisms in Mn neurotoxicity, and we identify MMP9 as a contributor to this process, revealing potential targets for intervention."

During pregnancy and early life, developing organisms are particularly vulnerable due to immature biological barriers and the dynamic nature of organogenesis. This review summarizes current evidence on maternal and early life exposure routes to MPs and NPs, including oral ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and transplacental transfer. Laboratory and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that microplastics can cross the placental barrier, potentially impairing placental function, altering fetal growth, and compromising pregnancy outcomes. Experimental data from animal models and in vitro systems suggest that maternal MP exposure may contribute to adverse neonatal development via multiple mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic alterations. These toxicological pathways have been implicated in neurodevelopmental abnormalities, reproductive dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, often in a sex-dependent manner. Despite increasing experimental evidence, major knowledge gaps remain regarding human exposure levels, dose–response relationships, and long-term health implications. Future research should focus on improving detection sensitivity, establishing standardized exposure models, and developing targeted risk assessment frameworks to evaluate microplastic-associated health risks during pregnancy and early development."

We obtained daily mortality counts for all renal diseases, acute renal failure (ARF), and chronic kidney diseases (CKD) from 47 prefectures in Japan from 1979 to 2019. Heatwaves and cold spells were defined based on duration (2, 3, and 4 consecutive days) and intensity (95th, 97.5th, and 99th percentile thresholds for heatwaves and 5th and 2.5th percentile thresholds for cold spells) using prefecture-specific daily mean temperature percentiles. A two-stage time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted. Prefecture-specific estimates were derived in the first stage by comparing the risk on extreme event days to nonevent days, and the national-level estimate was obtained from a univariate random-effect meta-analytical model in the second stage. Added effects of heatwaves and cold spells were estimated by adjusting for mean temperatures in the first-stage models. Subgroup analyses by age (0–64, 65–84, and >85) and sex and temporal analyses across four subperiods were also conducted. The statistical significance of changes over time was checked by conducting pairwise comparisons between the risk estimates from the first (1979–1988) with the subsequent subperiods. Our study included 300,506 renal deaths during summer and 367,663 during winter. Heatwaves were associated with increased renal disease-related mortality where the highest relative risks (RRs) for renal mortality were observed at the 99th percentile threshold lasting for ≥4 days (99th, 4 days): RR = 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.17) for all renal causes, 1.17 (1.07–1.28) for ARF, and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) for CKD. Cold spells showed stronger effects, with the highest RRs at the 2.5th percentile threshold and 2-day duration: RR = 1.18 (1.11–1.25) for all renal mortality, 1.26 (1.01–1.58) for ARF, and 1.12 (1.01–1.25) for CKD. Added effects of heatwaves were observed, but not in the case of cold spells. Older adults aged 65 years and over are particularly vulnerable. Temporal analysis revealed a significant reduction in heatwave-associated mortality risk over time, suggesting possible adaptation. In conclusion, heatwaves and cold spells affect renal disease-related mortality, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the health impacts of changing climate on renal health."

Among 811 GMGs, we observed that PRKCE rs4953292 G > A was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.37, Padj = 1.87 × 10–2] and exhibited an interaction effect with cigarette smoking (Pinteraction < 0.05). Smokers with rs4953292 A allele had higher bladder cancer risk than nonsmokers with G allele (Ptrend < 9.09 × 10–3). We performed functional experiments using 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP)-treated bladder cancer cells and found that the rs4953292 A allele combined with 4-ABP decreased PRKCE expression levels in bladder cancer cells, which could upregulate PKG and phosphorylate VASP within the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, enhance glucose uptake, lactate generation, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to reprogram glycolysis, thus promoting bladder cancer susceptibility. This study elucidates that cigarette smoking-regulated PRKCE facilitates bladder cancer susceptibility by mediating glycolytic reprogramming through activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The findings provide valuable predictors for bladder cancer susceptibility, aiding in prevention strategies."

ARGs can spread along the food chain via the soil-plant system, ultimately impacting human health. Agricultural practices, particularly the application of manure, wastewater, and sludge, constitute major anthropogenic sources driving the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs in soils. Understanding ARG transmission within soil-plant systems is crucial for developing control strategies to mitigate associated human health risks in agroecosystems. This review synthesized the primary sources of ARGs in the soil-plant system, elucidates their transmission pathways and key influencing factors, and systematically analyzed their potential health effects alongside attenuation strategies. Finally, current research gaps and future priorities were discussed. By providing a comprehensive overview of ARG environmental behavior, fate, and risks within the soil-plant system, this work aims to inform the development of control strategies and risk mitigation measures for researchers and environmental policymakers."

This study quantified 10 UVA congeners in urinary samples from 254 Beijing residents aged 19–44 years, revealing pervasive exposure to UVAs. The specific gravity-adjusted concentrations of 10 UVAs (∑10UVAs) ranged from 1.90 ng/mL to 2.03 × 103 ng/mL (geometric mean: 43.7 ng/mL), with UV-P (20.3 ng/mL), UV-360 (11.2 ng/mL), and UV-329 (6.34 ng/mL) as dominant compounds, indicating substantial environmental bioavailability. Women showed 2.7-fold higher ∑10UVAs in the summer (80.0 vs 29.3 ng/mL) and 1.7-fold higher ∑10UVAs in the winter (48.6 vs 28.0 ng/mL) than men, revealing sex-dependent and season-dependent exposure. Congener-specific detection patterns indicated multiple exposure sources and differential bioaccumulation behaviors. Critically, UVA exposure showed congener-specific and nonlinear associations with oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs). UV-329, in particular, exhibited dual pro-oxidative and antioxidant effects across all four measured urinary OSBs. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) analyses further revealed significant effect modifications by sex, season, and alcohol consumption, underscoring interactions between chemical coexposure and individual susceptibility. These results illuminate the pathways of UVA exposure, its associated health impacts, and the underlying susceptibilities in reproductive-age populations, thereby providing critical evidence to support enhanced risk management strategies for this vulnerable population."

However, the impact of cold spells, a common ETE, on adolescent mental health remains unclear. The study aims to explore the impacts of cold spells, defined with different intensities and durations, on adolescent mental health across China while also establishing risk-driven thresholds for cold spells and identifying vulnerable subpopulations. The data was derived from the 2019 survey cycle of the Chinese National Surveillance on Students’ Constitution and Health, conducted between September and December and encompassing 149,697 adolescents aged 10–18 from 30 provinces. Cold spells were defined by using a series of cutoff temperature thresholds and durations. We assessed cold spell frequency and average cold intensity during the 12 months prior to the survey based on 0.1° × 0.1° gridded apparent temperature data. Troubled symptoms were measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. We applied generalized linear mixed models to estimate the associations, and risk-driven thresholds for cold spells were determined based on the distribution of risk estimates. Among participants, 10.9% reported troubled symptoms. Higher cold spell frequency and average cold intensity were associated with increased odds of troubled symptoms. Risk-related thresholds were set using daily apparent temperatures at or below the fifth percentile for ≥3 days (P5_3d) or the 2.5 percentile for ≥2 days (P2.5_2d). Early warning and avoidance of cold spell exposure could potentially prevent 2.8–3.5% of troubled symptoms. Younger adolescents, female adolescents, rural residents, and those in lower GDP regions were more vulnerable. Our findings suggest that cold spells exceeding certain thresholds may adversely impact adolescent mental health, emphasizing the need for targeted cold-health early warning systems."

Here, we sought to clarify the potential promoting effects of PS-NPs on ovarian cancer. Our results first showed that ovarian cancer cells could internalize 50 nm PS-NPs, with significant internalization observed at concentrations starting from 20 μg/mL, which aligns with environmental exposure levels. RNA-seq and subsequent experiments indicated that treatment with 20 μg/mL PS-NPs significantly promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation, and this phenotype was closely associated with CDK4/6-dependent cell cycle regulation. The CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib effectively reverses the cell proliferation induced by PS-NPs. An oral exposure model in mice found tissue deposition of PS-NPs in the ovaries, kidneys, heart, and lungs. In vivo models further confirmed that mice exposed to PS-NPs had larger subcutaneous tumor weights and volumes compared to the control group, while Palbociclib could successfully block these effects. In conclusion, our research revealed that low-dose PS-NPs could stimulate ovarian tumor progression both in vivo and in vitro in a CDK4/6-dependent manner. Taken together, our study provides potential evidence for risk management of exposure to nanoplastics related to cancer development."

They can cause hepatic lipid interventions, but the underlying mechanisms require investigation. This study assessed the retention of polypropylene microplastics in mouse liver and determined the intercorrelations between hepatic lipid fluctuations and transcriptomic changes. Microplastic-induced liver dysfunction was confirmed by the variations of transamination, cholesterol metabolism, biotransformation, and redox state. Chronic high-dose treatment induced distinct pathological changes, including regional fibrotic remodeling and ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities. Raman biospectra of liver slice proposed vital peaks of 1060, 1132, 1168, 1340, 1446, 1618, and 1670 cm–1, representing the liver biomolecule landscapes. Transcriptomic changes were mainly involved in mRNA transcription, multicellular organism development, various stimuli response, cell differentiation, and lipid metabolic process. Microplastic exposure dosage exerted more profound effects than exposure duration on gene expressions of oxidation–reduction process, signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. WGCNA analysis proposed 47 hub genes involved gene expression orchestration, cell fate monitor, and mitochondria translation modulation. Nine differentially expressed genes associated with lipid biomarkers were related to mitochondria transcription (Mrps12 and Mrpl53), cell differentiation (Bbc3, Lrrc15 and Gdf15), lipid catabolism (Etnppl and lipg) and tRNA methyltransferase (Trmt112), and Raman peak at 1670 cm–1 intimately connected with aggregated forms of protein.

While regulatory bodies deem these chemicals unlikely to pose significant risks, emerging evidence highlights their potential neurotoxic effects. In this study, we evaluated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of TBBPA and TBBPA-BHEE in zebrafish embryos exposed to nonlethal (94–470 μg/L for TBBPA, 610–2030 μg/L for TBBPA-BHEE) and environmentally relevant concentrations (0.094–0.47 μg/L for TBBPA, 0.061–0.203 μg/L for TBBPA-BHEE) for up to 120 h postfertilization (hpf). Our findings show that at nonlethal concentrations, both TBBPA and TBBPA-BHEE impaired craniofacial development, induced apoptosis, reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and disrupted motor behavior, with significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in GABAergic signaling and synaptic plasticity. Transcriptomic and miRNA profiling revealed that downregulation of GABA receptor genes and miRNAs (e.g., let-7i, miR-192,) contributed to neurodevelopmental defects through disruption of CREB signaling and synaptogenesis. In contrast, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations induced similar phenotypes (craniofacial malformations and apoptosis) without major changes in neurotransmitter levels, suggesting that low-dose neurotoxicity might be mediated by alternative, less understood mechanisms, possibly involving epigenetic modifications or compensatory neuronal adaptations. These findings underscore the complexity of low-dose toxicity and the need for further research into the molecular pathways underlying the neurotoxic effects of TBBPA and its derivatives, particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations."

Here, we demonstrate that robust quasi‐periodic behavior (QPB) emerges during TC genesis with idealized numerical simulations. The QPB is an internal mode of the TC precursor, whose underlying mechanism is a convectively coupled inertia‐gravity oscillation. With typical environmental parameters and the spatial scale of TC precursors, the period of oscillation is around daily timescale. When the phase of the QPB and the solar diurnal cycle match, the coupling between the two oscillations accelerates TC genesis due to the state‐dependent responses of precursors to diurnal radiation. This research unveils a potentially important mechanism for TC genesis in the real world: the diurnal cycle partially strengthens the TC seeds with matched phases among those from natural variability. Thus, our results have significant implications for understanding TC dynamics and improving predictions."

Few studies have reported increased atmospheric water vapor and turbulent mixing during this event in this region, where the availability of surface measurements is challenging due to its remoteness and extreme conditions. Here, we used atmospheric estimates from a network of 13 GNSS receivers deployed on the RIS during the austral summer of 2015–2016. We estimated a spatiotemporally varying structure function across the network to quantify the relative strength of atmospheric turbulence, which exceeded values during non‐melting periods in the RIS by a factor of about 4.

Observational KE regression patterns show that warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Kuroshio‐Oyashio Extension (KOE) enhance local surface evaporation and lower‐tropospheric diabatic heating, accompanied by downstream cyclonic circulation anomalies over the North Pacific. In coupled models, a stronger latent heat flux response is linked to better simulation of these mechanisms and circulation patterns, whereas models with cold SST biases over the KOE region systematically underperform. Increasing resolution does not consistently alleviate these biases, reflecting structural issues across models that may obscure the potential benefits of higher resolution."

However, the transfer function describing how lake‐microseism noise covaries with ice cover has not been quantified. We use seismic data from a long‐operating station near Lake Superior and satellite‐derived lake ice cover from 2009 to 2024 to determine their covariance. A linear model calibrated using annual ice cover averaged during the coldest months (15 February–9 March) explains ∼87% of the variance in 0.5–2 Hz seismic noise averaged during the same period. This 15‐year‐calibrated model is used to predict daily ice cover during the 2014 Polar Vortex with reasonable accuracy, explaining ∼58% variance in the daily 0.5–2 Hz noise. One season of daily lake ice cover data is sufficient to calibrate the model. During unfrozen periods, 0.25–0.5 Hz lake‐wave power explains ∼75% of the variance in the daily averaged 0.5–1 Hz seismic noise, consistent with the secondary microseism mechanism."

Results suggests that a high CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ scenario (300–450 ppm before 2 million years ago) is most consistent with the new climate reconstructions. When radiative forcing from the high CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ scenario and land‐ice albedo derived from the new GMSL reconstruction are corrected for other forcings and feedbacks, but ignoring any state‐dependency, these results for the past 4 million years suggest an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.8–1.9 K which is just below the 5%–95% confidence range of recent estimates using other approaches (2.1–4.0 K)."

The wind response to submesoscale SST anomalies exhibits a strong seasonal cycle, with larger coupling in summer and pronounced spatial heterogeneity—significant north of the Gulf Stream but weak to the south. We furthermore show that the DMM dominates the coupling. Background atmospheric stability and wind speed control the seasonal modulation by driving the sensitivity of winds to SST perturbations. The spatial heterogeneity arises from the weak SST gradients south of the Gulf Stream. Two distinct regimes are found: (a) unstable conditions and weak winds, favoring a primarily divergent response, and (b) near‐stable conditions with moderate to strong winds, yielding both divergent and rotational response."

Radar reflectivity, attenuation, and birefringence are used to infer subsurface hydrology, englacial temperature, water content, and crystal orientation fabric. However, conventional radar sounding analyses either ignore melt or use classical mixing models which assume spherical melt inclusions, obscuring anisotropic contributions of melt. Here, we use geometric mixing models to calculate the reflectivity, attenuation, and birefringence of temperate ice containing anisotropic melt. We find that anisotropic melt can introduce significant deviations in radar measurements. For instance, melt anisotropy may impact reflectivity‐based estimates of water content by up to 30% volume fraction, while attenuation‐based estimates may vary by up to 43%. Critically, a melt volume fraction of just f∼10−5 $f\sim 1{0}^{-5}$ can reproduce birefringence signals previously attributed to ice fabric.

ENSO forecasts show consistently high skill for El Niño events, whereas La Niña forecasts exhibit greater uncertainty. Specifically, first‐year La Niña events demonstrate prediction skill comparable to that of El Niño events; however, most consecutive La Niña events display much lower predictability. This asymmetry is related to differences in ENSO dynamics. El Niño and first‐year La Niña events typically follow the linear recharge–discharge oscillator framework, supporting their high predictability. In contrast, consecutive La Niña events tend to deviate from this framework, likely due to enhanced nonlinear processes that constrain their forecast skill.

The spatial structure of the spring AO exhibits pronounced interdecadal variation, primarily characterized by a shift of the midlatitude circulation center from the North Pacific Center (NPC) to the North Atlantic Center (NAC). Using reanalysis data sets, this study investigates the causes of the interdecadal change in the AO spatial structure, focusing on the variation in the SAV and its regionally confined downward influence, the NAC‐related teleconnection wave trains, and midlatitude local air‐sea interactions. Results show that since the 1990s, the stratospheric Arctic vortex (SAV) intensifies notably and primarily influences the circulation over the North Atlantic through downward propagation of planetary waves, thereby strengthening the NAC. Similar downward signals are absent over the North Pacific, indicating a regional asymmetry influence of the stratospheric anomalies on the two centers. The enhanced NAC can trigger a Rossby wave train that propagates eastward along the westerly jet across the Eurasian continent and extends into the midlatitude North Pacific, inducing negative geopotential height anomaly over the midlatitude North Pacific, and thus weakening the NPC. Meanwhile, sea surface temperature anomalies in the midlatitude North Pacific and North Atlantic modulate low‐level atmospheric baroclinicity and transient eddy activities, particularly through transient eddy vorticity forcing, further contributing to the maintenance of the interdecadal evolution of both the NPC and NAC. This study advances our understanding of the driving mechanisms of interdecadal changes in the spatial structure of the spring AO."

The widely used BC emission inventories were developed using either bottom‐up or top‐down approaches, both of which have large uncertainties. The challenges of the bottom‐up approach include uncertainties in emission factors for different fuel types and combustion technologies. Conversely, top‐down BC emission inversion relies primarily on satellite‐retrieved aerosol absorption optical depth, which has significant limitations in quantifying BC‐specific contributions. The China Atmospheric Monitoring Network, established by the China Meteorological Administration, provides ground‐based hourly BC observations and a valuable opportunity to constrain BC emissions. This study presents the first application of these nationwide BC observations in emission inversion during the Clean Air Action (2013–2017), achieved using the 4DEnVar assimilation technique. Validation against independent observations demonstrates significant improvements in posterior estimates, reducing the root mean square error by 36.7%. Compared to the posterior, widely used bottom‐up inventories (e.g., MEIC) overestimate China's total BC emissions by 36.7%, with overestimations ranging up to 80.6% in the North China Plain (averaged between 2013 and 2017). In terms of climate impact, MEIC‐based estimates yield an 18.7% higher direct radiative effect on average, while CMIP6 historical estimates further exaggerate BC‐induced forcing by a factor of 1.7. Additionally, our inversion reveals that annual total BC emissions declined markedly by 28.1% during the Clean Air Action, from 1.24 to 0.89 Tg. These findings are critical for quantifying the role of BC in the regional and global climate."

This study estimates the mass of erupted tephra that may be structurally or electromagnetically affected by the lightning, based upon lightning peak current, channel length, and ash plume particle concentration. The lightning channels totaled 1.67 million m3 in volume and contained 548 kg of volcanic ash at a calculated plume concentration of 0.328 g/m3. From this total, 54.8 kg of ash may display physical evidence in the form of lightning‐induced textures, such as lightning‐induced volcanic spherules, but this is an insignificant fraction of the total airfall deposit (10−8%). However, the total mass of ash exposed to magnetic flux densities exceeding Earth's ambient surface values is 2.24 × 1014 g, corresponding to just over a third (34.9%) of the calculated mass of total airfall (5.21 × 1014 g). This study reveals that even though physical evidence of volcanic lightning may be limited, ash particles will still be affected by the electromagnetic fields generated by the lightning discharge. The extent of these effects will be a function of lightning properties, ash properties, and location of the ash in relation to the discharge channel."

Through N4-acetylation regulation of DYRK1A, NAT10 promotes intestinal senescence, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for elderly-onset colitis. 
 Intestinal aging characterized by imbalance between cell senescence and mucosal self-renewal, increases susceptibility to the elderly-onset ulcerative colitis (UC), while the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify mRNA N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification and its specific writer, N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), as critical regulators of human colonic epithelial cell senescence. Knockdown of NAT10 significantly alleviates human colonic epithelial cell senescence in vitro and colonoid and intestinal aging in vivo in aged mice. Using ac4C-modified transcriptome sequencing, we reveal that NAT10 stabilizes DYRK1A mRNA through ac4C modification, thereby driving colon epithelial senescence. Moreover, NAT10 and DYRK1A are markedly upregulated in ulcerative colitis tissues from elderly patients and positively correlate with disease severity. Knockdown of NAT10, treatment with Nat10 or Dyrk1a inhibitor, alleviates colitis in aged mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that modulating NAT10-mediated RNA ac4C modification could rejuvenate intestinal aging and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for elderly-onset colitis.

 In the field of neuromorphic computing, time-series prediction poses a significant challenge to recurrent neural network architectures, often requiring task-specific customization that limits the development of general-purpose computing platforms. In this work, we implement a physical echo-state network (ESN) using ambipolar organic–inorganic heterostructure transistors to form its reservoir layer. Leveraging the ambipolar nature of the transistor, its variable-resistance region enables sparse matrix operations, while the saturation region provides tanh-like nonlinearity, making it well-suited for implementing both synaptic weighting and neuronal activation in an ESN. Additionally, its dynamic response naturally introduces temporal attributes. Thus, it can serve as a neuromorphic computing model for time-series tasks. Without the involvement of dynamic mechanisms, it is capable of performing image recognition, time-series prediction, and multimodal recognition tasks. When dynamic mechanisms are incorporated, the model achieves an accuracy of 96.98% on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and 86.67% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

 Lithium halide solid electrolytes have garnered significant attention owing to their high ionic conductivity and positive electrode compatibility. However, achieving target ionic conductivity typically requires high lithium concentration (>4.3 wt%) within optimal structure, which raises costs and exacerbates air sensitivity.

 Lactate accumulation is a hallmark and contributing factor of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), while the role of protein lactylation caused by lactate accumulation in IVDD remains unclear. Via metabolomics, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, and lactylation proteomics, we reveal the lactylome landscape in IVDD and identified superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) lactylation at lysine 123 (SOD1K123la) as crucial for IVDD aggravation. Using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, in vivo generation of SOD1K123R mutant male rats, and in silico molecular dynamics simulations, we find that SOD1K123la alters SOD1 conformation and impairs its enzymatic activity, and induces oxidative damage, and activates p53 pathway in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). Notably, we identify a small molecule ZL-01 that inhibits SOD1K123la.

 It is very difficult to prepare vertical nanodiamond (VND) dominated sheets compared with vertical graphene (VG) sheets. Here, we describe the preparation of VNDs by phase transformation from Ta-loaded VGs via argon/oxygen plasma treatment with varied oxygen percentage. As the oxygen percentage increases to 5%, the height of VGs decreases, accompanied by high capacitance and low Hall mobility. When the oxygen percentage increases to 10%, the VGs transform to nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) grains with trans-polyacetylene (TPA) contents in grain boundaries increasing significantly. These VNDs exhibit both high capacitance (1452 μF cm−2) and n-type Hall mobility (846 cm2 V−1s−1). With the oxygen percentage increasing to 20%, NCD grains grow larger and the TPA content reduces, while the capacitance decreases considerably, but Hall mobility remaining high, suggesting that the performance improvement results from the synergistic effect of NCDs and TPA. These exhibit significant applications of VNDs in energy storage, high performance sensors, high-frequency and high-power electronic devices.

Here authors show that neurons in the SC support visual spatial attention by enhancing perceptual sensitivity and motor bias, without reflecting internal perceptual decisions or choice accuracy, revealing its unique role in transforming attention into action. 
 Neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), like those in cortex, are modulated by shifts in attention but contribute differently from visual cortex neurons. It remains debated whether SC attention-related activity represents enhanced perceptual sensitivity, decision criterion shifts, or motor bias linked to saccade planning at neurons’ response fields. We dissociated these components by independently controlling behavioral sensitivity, perceptual decision criterion, and motor response criterion in a visual spatial attention task in two male rhesus monkeys. SC activity correlated strongly with behavioral sensitivity and motor criterion for selecting a saccade target within the response field, independent of saccade execution. In contrast, SC responses remained unchanged despite large shifts in decision criterion when motor bias was excluded. Notably, SC activity did not predict trial-by-trial choice accuracy. These results demonstrate that the SC specifically supports components of attention related to heightened perceptual sensitivity and response selection, while being largely independent of internal perceptual decision criterion and trial outcome.

 Previous studies suggested that atmospheric water vapor, as a greenhouse gas, can amplify surface warming by enhancing downwelling longwave radiation (DLR), thereby potentially intensifying extreme heatwaves. However, the atmospheric water vapor anomalies associated with heatwaves and their radiative effects remain poorly quantified. Here, using radiative kernels to decompose DLR anomalies, we demonstrate that atmospheric water vapor exerts a substantial influence on summertime interannual-scale heatwave-related DLR across the Northern Hemisphere, despite DLR being largely dominated by near-surface air warming. This influence exhibits pronounced regional contrasts: mid‑ to high‑latitude heatwaves are typically accompanied by moist air, which enhances DLR, whereas heatwaves in India and western North America often coincide with drier conditions that reduce DLR and thereby partially offset the positive DLR anomalies caused by air warming. The dryness over India is linked to an interannual weakening of the Indian summer monsoon, while that over western North America is associated with soil‑moisture deficits. Our findings provide a quantitative assessment of the contribution of atmospheric moisture to extreme heatwaves."

 Demand for accurate forecasts of long-lasting heatwaves is increasing, yet the processes that fundamentally limit their predictability remain poorly understood. Here we study the predictability of the August 2022 Yangtze River Valley (YRV) heatwave using real-time subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecast ensembles, which systematically underestimate this event’s intensity. To identify factors limiting predictability, we analyze processes across multiple scales, including large-scale circulation anomalies, local convection, and soil-moisture conditions. Analysis shows that regional precipitation effectively separates high- and low-skill forecasts of surface maximum temperature. Quantitative attribution analysis indicates that precipitation, rather than the local highs, explains most of the ensemble spread in surface temperature, suggesting precipitation–soil moisture coupling as the dominant limiting factor. Numerical experiments using a simple heatwave model demonstrate that increased precipitation reduces surface warming by up to ~4 °C, whereas reduced precipitation amplifies warming by ~2 °C. These findings underscore the importance of improving representation of precipitation processes to enhance heatwave predictability.

 Climate adaptation must be intensified globally to keep up with increasing climate change impacts. To date, adaptation is mostly driven by climate risks that need to be reduced and little by opportunities. We identify opportunity windows -i.e. favourable conditions for new or upgraded measures- by constructing an evidence-based dataset from qualitative and quantitative sources, and discuss how they can help to progress adaptation. Here we find evidence of past, present and future adaptation opportunity windows throughout Europe. Present and past triggers for opportunity windows include the implementation of European Union Directives and post-disaster recovery funds, and societal support after floods, droughts and wildfires. Future opportunities relate to aging dams and storm surge barriers. Opportunities also emerge from innovations (e.g. through pilots) which could inform new forms of adaptation. Decision-makers can operationalise and seize adaptation opportunities through adaptive pathways planning, but would need to anticipate opening and closing windows.

 Glacier retreat, a consequence of climate warming, raises concerns about the release of tracemetals previously locked within ice, yet the global patterns and governing mechanisms of their mobilization remain unclear. Here we present dissolved trace metal data from 14 mountain glaciers and 2 polar ice sheets to quantify how glacier-type governs elemental mobilization. Both glacier classes release meltwaters with concentrations that often exceed global riverine and open-ocean means by one to two orders of magnitude, yet their chemical signatures differ. Mountain-glacier meltwaters are enriched in essential micronutrients such as Zn, Co, Ni, Cd, and Cu relative to ice sheets. These disparities reflect enhanced weathering, lithological diversity, and greater availability of freshly ground particles in alpine systems. These fluxes fertilize nutrient-limited ecosystems yet also elevate metal toxicity. This contrast underscores that differences between glacier type will determine how ice loss reshapes the future balance between micronutrient supply and contaminant release under accelerating glacier and ice-sheet retreat.

 Soil fauna is essential in mediating the formation and turnover of soil organic matter, the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon, yet remains absent from nearly all existing biogeochemical conceptual frameworks. Soil fauna impacts element cycling via trophic (microbivory, herbivory, detritivory, predation) and non-trophic (bioturbation, dispersal, waste products) pathways. These effects should be integrated into multitrophic biogeochemistry by considering the environmental context (abiotic constraints, quality and quantity of carbon inputs), by including soil food web structure, and by accounting for the role of soil fauna as agents of connectivity. We highlight the need for better quantification of soil fauna and consideration of carcasses and feces as substantial carbon flows. Based on a soil food web approach, these concepts will improve the quantification of the impact of soil fauna on carbon cycling and help to predict how soil fauna will affect carbon cycling under future global change scenarios.

 Wastewater management is undergoing a paradigm shift from pollution control towards resource recovery. However, techno-economically feasible pathways to synergize resource recovery with net-zero emissions in the wastewater sector remain underexplored. Targeting municipal and industrial wastewater across Chinese provincial regions, we design a transformative life cycle wastewater treatment system integrating energy recovery and conversion, wastewater reclamation, biofertilizer production, and carbon capture. The system delivers net energy output and reduces net greenhouse gas emissions from 99.8 to −10.0 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, but raises total cost by varying amounts across scenarios. Economically and technically feasible pathway for synergistically enhancing resource recovery while delivering lower residual greenhouse gas emissions are identified.

 Meteorological drought can propagate to soil and ecological droughts, triggering cascading disruptions in ecosystem functioning. However, whether the ecohydrological damage—the sum of standardized vegetation greenness and soil moisture losses—is disproportionately amplified through drought propagation has not been systematically assessed. Using multiple global datasets, we found that ecohydrological damage reached 162% to 310% of the initial meteorological drought intensity. Once meteorological drought intensity exceeded the standardized threshold of 2.18, ecohydrological damage escalated nonlinearly. Externally, soil and ecological droughts were more sensitive to precipitation deficits and potential evapotranspiration surpluses, respectively. Internally, vegetation–soil feedbacks promoted the propagation from soil to ecological drought, while dampened the reverse process, resulting in the greatest ecohydrological damage along the meteorological–soil–ecological drought propagation pathway. Declining ecosystem resilience and increasing climate variability may exacerbate future drought propagation and its damage. These insights are critical for advancing early warning systems and mitigating cascading drought losses.

CAN increased long-term N retention in woody biomass, with stems becoming the dominant sink, accounting for up to 34.9% of 15N recovered after one year. UAN promoted short-term N retention in understory layer and long-term N retention in soil. 15N recovery increased with soil depth under CAN but decreased under UAN from 120 to 365 days. Trees absorbed more 15NO3- than 15NH4+, whereas soil retained the two forms similarly. These findings indicate that N manipulation methods affect N retention magnitude and spatial distribution. Nitrogen deposition on forest canopies enhances long-term nitrogen retention in woody biomass, whereas deposition on the understory favors retention in understory vegetation and soil, as demonstrated by a UAV-based nitrogen addition experiment using an isotopic tracer approach."

 Retrieving the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aphy; m−1), one of the most spectrally rich inherent optical properties, remains challenging in optically complex coastal waters worldwide. Leveraging NASA's new hyperspectral mission, PACE, we introduce Hyper-MoE-VAE, a deep-learning architecture that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts with a Variational Autoencoder to retrieve high-dimensional aphy and subsequent estimation of phytoplankton community composition (PCC) from PACE-OCI hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). Pre-trained on global hyperspectral bio-optical datasets and fine-tuned using regional field Rrs–aphy pairings from inland– estuarine–coastal waters, Hyper-MoE-VAE demonstrated strong transferability and effective adaptation across regions. Validation with in-situ Rrs showed accurate aphy retrievals in Lake Erie (NRMSE = 0.12, ε = 17.10), Lake Pontchartrain (NRMSE = 0.11, ε = 37.12), and the Barataria–Terrebonne Estuary (NRMSE = 0.14, ε = 38.89). Using same-day PACE-OCI Level 2 Rrs, the model achieved comparable performance in Lake Erie (NRMSE = 0.19, ε = 55.19), Lake Pontchartrain (NRMSE = 0.14, ε = 51.39), and the Barataria–Terrebonne Estuary (NRMSE = 0.17, ε = 47.92). Hyper-MoE-VAE derived PACE-OCI hyperspectral aphy was further decomposed against mass-specific absorption spectra to estimate group-specific contributions to total chlorophyll a. The resulting PCC showed strong agreement with HPLC–CHEMTAX in Lake Erie (R2= 0.692) and Gulf estuarine–coastal systems (R2 = 0.732). Monte Carlo noise experiments further revealed group-dependent sensitivities, with diatoms and dinoflagellates showing moderate susceptibility to noise, while cyanobacteria and cryptophytes exhibited narrow uncertainty distributions. These results demonstrate Hyper-MoE-VAE's capability for regional, operational water-quality monitoring with PACE-OCI and its adaptability to current and future hyperspectral missions."

 Conservation tillage practices play critical roles in sustainable agriculture and have become more popular in the United States (US). Accurate spatial and temporal maps about tillage practices are essential to monitoring conservation tillage adoption and assessing its impacts on soil water and nutrient loss and greenhouse gas emissions. We built a dynamic feature threshold framework utilizing satellite data, environmental variables, and machine learning to map out tillage practices for corn and soybean fields in the Midwest from 2000 to 2022. The framework can effectively consider the confounding impact from local soil, vegetation, and environmental effects on crop residues. We compared tillage mapping accuracy using dynamic feature threshold or fixed feature threshold with either broadband angle index (BAI) or normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) as the key feature for tillage. The results showed that the dynamic feature threshold framework paired with BAI feature can accurately estimate tillage percentage for three categorical practices (no-till, reduced-till, and conventional-till), with R2 of 0.84, 0.62, and 0.76 for no-till, reduced-till, and conventional-till in corn fields, and corresponding R2 of 0.84, 0.52, and 0.70 in soybean fields, respectively. The dynamic feature threshold framework achieved better performance with the BAI-based feature than the NDTI-based feature, with R2 increasing by 0.03–0.12 for different corn tillage practices and by 0.05–0.10 for soybean. The temporally fixed feature threshold framework has a much lower performance than the dynamic feature threshold framework (R2 reduced by 0.23–0.61 for the accuracy to map different categories of tillage for corn and soybean), mainly because it does not consider the confounding factors. Based on the results from the dynamics feature threshold framework with BAI, we found significant regional differences of tillage adoption in the US Midwest. We also found that the adoption of conservation tillage (no-till or reduced-till) increases slowly from 2000 to 2022 across the U.S. Midwest. Northern counties in Dakotas, southern Minnesota, eastern Nebraska, and Iowa showed an increase trend in no-till percentage, which largely were converted from reduced-till percentage. Some counties in Indiana and Ohio showed an increase trend in reduced-till percentage, mainly converted from conventional- and no-till practices. The proposed framework based on remote sensing leads to much improved tillage information in space and time as demonstrated in the US Midwest, and provides a highly applicable and cost-effective way for regional tillage practice mapping."

 We demonstrate a near-real time forest disturbance alerting system for Europe using Sentinel-1 radar data. Sentinel-1 radar can penetrate clouds and offers high spatial (∼20 m) and temporal (3- to 6-day) detail. We directly integrated near-real time ERA5-Land temperature and Copernicus forest type data into the disturbance detection framework to address freezing temperatures and seasonal phenology, both of which influence the Sentinel-1 backscatter signal and thus need to be accounted for. This facilitates year-round monitoring across a range of environmental conditions (sub-zero, wet and dry) and forest types (coniferous, deciduous) throughout the boreal, temperate, and Mediterranean forests of Europe. Validation across Europe showed high accuracy, with a user accuracy of 91.2% (±1.3%) and producer accuracy of 74.5% (±6.0%). User accuracy increased to 99% (±0.4%) when excluding errors in the European-scale forest cover mask primarily caused by local overestimation of forest height and density. Disturbances were detected with a median delay of 27 days relative to the first high-resolution optical Planet reference image, which can further be reduced to 1 day through retrospective event-based correction of late detection bias. Compared to existing annual optical-based products, our method improves the detection of small-scale disturbances such as group fellings in Romania. We generated European-scale estimates of intra-annual disturbance seasonality, capturing variation in forest management practices and disturbance regimes such as winter harvesting in northern Europe, spring sanitation cutting in central Europe, and summer wildfires in southern Europe. Overall, this alerting system provides timely and detailed forest disturbance information in support of sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation, carbon accounting, and law enforcement efforts across Europe.

 Accurate river mapping in steep mountains is essential for disaster warning, water resources, and ecological management, yet remains challenging due to complex terrain and dynamic hydrology. Conventional methods provide limited spatial coverage, while optical remote sensing is often hindered by cloud and fog. Although Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather observation, current water extraction techniques perform poorly in mountains owing to three major challenges: backscatter heterogeneity, layover, and shadow distortions. To address these issues, this study proposes an optimized water extraction method using dual-polarization SAR data. Our method combines: (1) A window-adaptive Otsu thresholding method based on the Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized Water Index (SDWI) to mitigate spatial backscatter heterogeneity; (2) The synergistic use of ascending and descending orbit SAR data to reduce the layover effect; and (3) DEM-based edge detection combined with blocking elevation thresholding to eliminate shadows. Based on this framework, we achieved high-precision water body extraction for a 768-km reach of the lower Jinsha River mainstream. Comparative analyses with traditional water extraction methods (threshold segmentation and Otsu’s method) and machine learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) demonstrate the superior accuracy of our framework. It achieved the highest performance, with a user’s accuracy and Kappa coefficient reaching 96.99% and 95.53%, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss how the proposed method effectively mitigates the impacts of SAR geometric distortion and spatial heterogeneity in backscattering coefficients. Ablation experiments were also conducted to validate the contribution of different modules within the framework. This study developed a technical framework for high-precision automatic extraction of river water body in steep mountainous regions using SAR, which holds significant value for flood risk assessment."

 Accurately forecasting sea level maxima (SLM) and extremes, is vital for maritime management, engineering, and navigation. Most Machine learning (ML) models focus on moderate surges and often underestimate extremes. We use a two-fold forecasting framework: ML/DL for short-term daily SLM forecasting and extreme value theory (EVT) for long-term extremes (<100 years). ML models include Random Forest, Extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer perceptron, CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU. Long-term extremes are analysed via EVT using a block maximum method. The Baltic Sea, a semi-enclosed micro-tidal basin prone to extremes, serves as case study. The analysis used six tide gauge stations (Narva, Ristna, Oulu, Kungsholmsfort, Władysławowo, and Greifswald). Key features—wind speed, surface air pressure, Baltic Sea Index (BSI), and significant wave height (SWH), were selected using a mutual information and models’ hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization.Neural networks models, specifically the CNN-GRU and MLP, performed best (RMSE 7–15 cm) with strong generalization. Most models captured storm events, but underestimated extreme peaks (>150 cm), due to the rarity in the training, incomplete meteorological representation, and missing local physical processes. CNN-GRU excelled in RMSE, recall, and F1, while MLP led in R2 and precision. EVT analysis showed winter extremes have ∼ 5–7 years in the north-east (Narva and Oulu). Explainability analysis of CNN-GRU showed prefilling dominates SLM at all stations; BSI, pressure, and winds drive west, south, and north, while local pressure, wind, and SWH dominate in the east. The framework supports early warning and long-term risk assessment, though forecasting rare extremes remains challenging."

 Efficient and effective pose estimation and 3D point clouds reconstruction from low-altitude UAV images is crucial for digital twins and geospatial applications. However, conventional divide-and-conquer SfM pipelines remain constrained by the high computational cost of incremental reconstruction. While global SfM, though faster, often suffer from instability due to outlier sensitivity in translation averaging. To address these limitations, we propose a feature track enhanced global SfM within divide-and-conquer framework. To deal with outliers, a cluster consistency constrained outlier filtering method is proposed, which combines distribution-aware scene partition and cluster consistency to remove false matches. Furthermore, we propose a geometry-constrained alignment optimization strategy in sub-models merging process to eliminate misalignments and ghosting artifacts, obtaining complete and accurate 3D models. Extensive experiments on ETH3D and SYSU UAV large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method outperforms established baselines, with comparable accuracy to the incremental SfM but half of the computation time. The reconstructed 3D models demonstrate notable enhancements in both structural integrity and level of detail, proving the method’s high applicability in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks.

 Unstable slopes are highly susceptible to external triggers, representing a critical challenge for disaster risk management. However, few studies have systematically developed approaches for their regional-scale identification, and even fewer have explored their controlling factors in mining-affected regions with strong anthropogenic disturbances. To address this gap, this study investigates the composite factors influencing unstable slopes in the Datong Coalfield, China. Specifically, we used the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to measure line-of-sight (LOS) surface deformation and subsequently identified unstable slopes as those with significant deformation velocities within a slope-unit framework. To examine the spatiotemporal effects of factors influencing slope instability, we conducted multivariate modeling at both long- and short-term scales. The results reveal that long-term modeling captures broadly consistent contributions of these factors across different periods, whereas short-term modeling highlights distinct seasonal associations with slope instability. Furthermore, cross-wavelet coherence analysis revealed that intermittently unstable slopes exhibit periodic lagged responses to dynamic environmental forcing, underscoring the significant role of environmental forcing in driving deformation of intermittently unstable slopes. Overall, this work provides new insights into the mechanisms of slope instability in mining-affected coalfields and proposes a transferable framework for regional-scale slope monitoring and risk management."

 River network selection is essential for generating multiscale river network datasets used in earth observation (EO) applications, such as hydrological analysis and terrain modeling. However, how individual river features influence selection decisions, especially across different drainage patterns, remains unclear. To address this gap, this study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence framework that integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover feature contributions for river network selection across different patterns. First, river strokes were constructed as analytical units and multiple geometric, topological, and hydrological features were extracted. Then, XGBoost-based selection models were trained for the parallel and rectangular drainage networks. Finally, the macro-, meso-, and micro-level SHAP analysis was conducted over the trained selection models. The experimental results reveal that features fall into three categories for the two types of patterns considered here: universal features (represented by upstream cumulative area, Horton code) that dominate selection regardless of pattern; pattern-sensitive features (represented by confluence angle, river proximity distance) whose influence varies with drainage patterns; and low-contribution features with negligible contribution. These findings explain why certain rivers are retained or removed across different drainage patterns, providing explainable insights to support automated, pattern-preserving generation of multiscale river networks."

 Black carbon (BC) particles influence climate by both direct (light absorption) and indirect (modulating cloud condensation nuclei activity) radiative forcing. However, their seasonal variations in chemical composition and mixing state during the aging process introduce uncertainties in the estimation of the light absorption enhancement (Eabs) and hygroscopicity (kchem-BC). Here, field observations were conducted using a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) in Shenzhen, during summer and winter to comprehensively characterize the aging mechanisms of BC particles. The results show that summer was characterized by a lower bulk coating to BC ratio (MR_bulk = 2.74) and shorter pollution episodes driven by rapid photochemical processes. These processes yielded secondary components with high sensitivity to Ox (O3 + NO2), including secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and nitrate mainly formed during daytime. The carbon oxidation state (OSc) of organics increased at a max daily growth rate of 0.39 h−1, which was calculated for the first time. Conversely, winter was characterized by prolonged pollution episodes with a higher MR_bulk (7.06), governed by slower coupled photochemical-aqueous reaction mechanism with substantial nocturnal contributions from N2O5 uptake and aqueous-phase SOA formation. Winter regime resulted in a lower max OSc growth rate (0.32 h−1). It was found that although the increasing rate of Eabs and kchem-BC during the daytime were higher in summer, the prolonged aging process in winter resulted in higher apparent Eabs and kchem-BC. This study highlights the seasonal difference of BC aging pathways and their implications for accurate modelling of the climate effect of BC particles."

 Black carbon (BC) aerosols in urban areas affect human health and climate, leading to increased monitoring efforts.This study presents a comprehensive assessment of equivalent BC (eBC) in a Mediterranean urban environment (Rome, Italy).Harmonized protocols by ACTRIS and RI-URBANS were adopted to enhance data comparability.The study examined: (i) temporal eBC variability contributing to submicrometer aerosol mass; (ii) source apportionment into fossil fuel (eBCff) and biomass burning (eBCbb) using the “aethalometer model”; (iii) local Mass Absorption Cross-section (MACexp); (iv) eBC trend analysis with and without MAC corrections.Results indicate traffic emissions are the primary source, with eBCff approximately 70% of the total eBC mass. The findings underscore the importance of considering the local MAC to assess eBC: the difference between eBC estimated using MACexp (eBCMACexp ) and uncorrected eBC varies with time. The decline in eBC inferred using a constant MAC (−10% yr−1, p<0.001) disappears when accounting for MAC variability, while MACexp itself decreases at an exceptional rate of −12% yr−1 (-1 m2g−1yr−1) . The intraannual eBCMACexp-to-eBC ratio is on average close to 1, but it ranges from 0.7 in summer to 1.2 in winter. Temporal changes in meteorological conditions and emission patterns were found to influence both MACexp and BC aerosol properties. The eBCff -to -eBC ratio showed a significant positive trend (+0.01yr−1), linked to increased vehicle numbers and complemented by the eBCbb-to-eBC ratio exhibiting a similar but negative trend, associated with a +1.2 ∘C rise in temperature (+0.3∘Cyr−1). Accordingly, the observed decrease in MACexp is coherent with a negative trend in the absorption Å ngström exponent (AAE) (−0.018yr−1).These findings highlight BC dynamics in urban areas, aiding efforts to harmonize measurements and improve climate and air quality models, guiding public health strategies."

Our mechanism shows that, relative to direct oxidation of MG, aqueous oxidation of MG readily occurs via its hydrates such as diols and tetrol, which is dominated by H-abstraction pathways. Kinetic analysis reveals that the calculated rate constants for the OH-initiated reactions follow the ratio of KDL : TL : ADL ≈ 1 : 0.005 : 0.001, indicating that the OH-initiated KDL oxidation is of major importance in the atmosphere. Subsequent transformations mainly yield organic acids rather than oligomers under typical atmospheric conditions. Combined with dynamic simulations, it can be found that pyruvic acid is the major product, and thus, microdroplet acidity is enhanced at the higher initial MG concentrations or under less acidic conditions. These results provide mechanistic and kinetic insights into the aqueous oxidation of MG and highlight its key role in organic acid formation. Our work underscores the importance of including the OVOC oxidation pathways when evaluating aqueous-phase chemistry and its impacts on aerosol acidity and composition."

 This study examines seasonal variations of raindrop size distribution (DSD) characteristics in heavy rain core region over the Southwest Coast of China, using eight years (2017–2024) of disdrometer observations. The monsoon period exhibited the broadest size spectrum characterized by substantial medium- and large-sized drops, while the post-monsoon period had the narrowest size spectrum dominated by small-sized drops, and pre-monsoon period displayed intermediate features. Convective rain (CR) contributed over 83% of total rainfall, with medium and large drop concentrations 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than in stratiform rain. The monsoon CR displayed the highest mass-weighted mean diameter Dm (1.92 mm) with normalized intercept parameter log10Nw (3.81) comparable to pre-monsoon, tending toward continental-like convection characteristics. Microphysical principal component analysis and vertical structure profiles revealed that the underlying mechanism was enhanced ice-based processes under conditions of high instability, upward motion and mixed-phase clouds. Conversely, low instability and shallow clouds during post-monsoon period resulted in warm-rain process dominance with maritime-like convection characteristics. A Rain Parameter Diagram was implemented to visualize the connection between radar reflectivity-rainfall rate relationship and Dm-Nw pairs, effectively distinguishing precipitation types and revealing the seasonal shifts of microphysics along continental-like and maritime-like convection characteristics. These findings provide a foundation for the key physical mechanisms underlying seasonal DSD variability, with implications for microphysical parameterization and quantitative precipitation estimation in monsoon-dominated coastal regions."
