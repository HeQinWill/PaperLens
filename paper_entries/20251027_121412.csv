As air quality improved, secondary species became more dominant. The changes in chemical composition led to the reductions in aerosol acidity, liquid water content and light extinction coefficient. Our results help to improve understanding of the secondary species formation under decreasing anthropogenic emissions. 
 Long-term data on PM2.5 chemical composition provide essential information for evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution control measures and understanding the evolving mechanisms of secondary species formation in the real atmosphere. This study presented field measurements of PM2.5 and its chemical composition at a regional background site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) from 2007 to 2020. PM2.5 concentration declined significantly from 87.1 ± 15.5 to 34.0 ± 11.3 µg m−3 (−4.0 µg m−3 yr−1). The proportion of secondary species increased from 57 % to 73 % with the improvement in air quality. Among these species, sulfate (SO42-) showed a sharp decline, while nitrate (NO3-) exhibited a moderate decrease. Consequently, the proportion of NO3- in 2020 doubled relative to 2007. In addition, we further found that SO42- reduction (−10 % yr−1) lagged behind SO2 reduction (−13 % yr−1), while NO3- reduction (−6 % yr−1) outpaced that of NO2 (−3 % yr−1). These contrasting trends were associated with an increase in sulfur oxidation rate (SOR) and a decrease in nitrogen oxidation rate (NOR). Changes in PM2.5 chemical composition also influenced aerosol physicochemical properties, such as aerosol pH (0.04 yr−1), aerosol liquid water content (ALWC, −1.1 µg m−3 yr−1), and the light extinction coefficient (−21.44 Mm−1 yr−1). Given important roles of aerosol acidity and ALWC in the heterogeneous reactions, these changes may further inhibit the formation of secondary species in the atmosphere, particularly secondary organic aerosols."

The correlation coefficient between early autumn BKS SIC and the EAWM index dropped from −0.521 during 1979–2007 to −0.101 during 2008–2023. This dramatically weakened linkage is attributed to the continuous and substantial reduction in BKS SIC that has led to nearly ice‐free conditions and a marked decrease in its interannual variability.

In this study, the potential link of Eurasian snow with TP snow is detected. Excessive October–November (ON) north Asian snow cover can boost the upward wave activity and thus heat the stratospheric polar atmosphere, which subsequently gives rise to an attenuated stratospheric polar vortex (SPV). Meantime, the downward propagation of this SPV anomaly in boreal winter when the troposphere–stratosphere interaction is active induces an anomalous horizontal wave train in the middle troposphere. Such a wave train generates an anomalous anticyclone around the TP, facilitating the decreased local snowfall and snow depth in January. These processes indicate a connection of the mid‐latitude Asia–Arctic–TP via the vertical and horizontal wave activity and effectively supply a predictive indicator for the mid‐winter TP snow depth."

Elevated dissolved Ge/Si signatures relative to bedrock in this young system are associated with formation of high‐Si amorphous phase(s) that preferentially exclude Ge. Over several years, dissolved Ge/Si ratios decrease, approaching those of natural watersheds, consistent with a shift toward formation of Ge‐enriched secondary phases. Our study points to the critical control of secondary phase speciation on Ge/Si partitioning, while in contrast, stable silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) in the same samples show fractionation comparable to natural systems. Paired consideration of Ge/Si and δ30Si tracers may thus offer a previously unrecognized means of interrogating the progression of secondary phase speciation in young landscapes, for example, following deglaciation, volcanism, and landslides, and in engineering applications such as enhanced weathering."

This study focuses on forest and grassland ecosystems and uses theoretical recovery rate as a measure to assess climate impacts on their resilience over China. Our findings reveal that vegetation resilience varies across aridity‐dependent climate zones, with each zone showing different resilience–aridity relationships. Particularly, semi‐arid zones exhibit the lowest vegetation resilience, where the forest resilience declines as inter‐annual temperature and precipitation variability increases. In zones with sufficient water, the forest resilience remains stable. Grassland resilience decreases with increasing precipitation variability, but is insensitive to inter‐annual temperature variability. Future projections highlight the potential threat of climate change to regions encompassing more than 20% of vegetated areas, particularly in the forest‐grassland ecotones of North China.

We classified 812 historical AR events into Gusty‐Wet, Gusty‐Dry, Calm‐Wet, and Calm‐Dry groups to evaluate differences in precipitation behavior. ARs with stronger winds and higher moisture content exhibit higher precipitation efficiency (PE) and greater integrated water vapor (IWV). Regionally, Calm ARs show higher IWV accumulation due to slower inland transport and reduced PE. Projections indicate increases in storm‐total (sub‐Clausius‐Clapeyron (CC) scaling) and maximum 3‐hourly precipitation (super‐CC scaling) across all groups, with the most pronounced changes in Gusty‐Wet and Calm‐Wet ARs.

During its positive phase, the cold tongue warming, triggering atmospheric Rossby wave train, weakens the St. Helena anticyclone, which enhances wind and cools sea surface temperature over the Southwestern Atlantic, leading to the positive phase of the South Atlantic Ocean Dipole. Meanwhile, the weakened anticyclone reduces the transport of the subtropical cell, suppressing the equatorial upwelling, which amplifies the initial cold tongue warming. The phase shift of the decadal ATL is attributed to an eastward propagation of thermocline displacements at 3°S–15°S, induced by a propagation of local wind stress curl anomalies in response to combined effects of the equatorial and mid‐latitude air‐sea coupling."

Logarithmic reflectivity has also been used for data assimilation without being questioned or well validated. However, fundamental limitations exist with directly assimilating logarithmic reflectivity, such as strong nonlinearity of the observation forward operator and the fact that the impacts of small reflectivity values are amplified, leading to exaggerated increments when mapped back into physical space. In this study, we power‐transform both reflectivity and hydrometeor mixing ratios to alleviate the aforementioned issues with using conventional logarithmic reflectivity. Forecast evaluation across eight severe convection events demonstrates that applying the Box‐Cox power transformations to both reflectivity and hydrometeor mixing ratios effectively reduces the nonlinearity between the observations and control variables.

These isotope patterns are thought to reflect oscillations in atmospheric and shallow‐marine O2, which promoted animal diversification events. However, the driver for oxygenation pulses is unclear. Here we show that these synchronous carbon‐sulfur isotope cycles and marine oxygenation pulses can be driven by long‐period orbital forcing through effects on continental weathering and nutrient delivery. The impact of orbital forcing is explored using a combined climate‐biogeochemical model. When forced with latitudinally‐resolved insolation signals, the model produces long‐term variations in nutrient weathering and carbon burial, which reproduces the co‐variation of carbon‐sulfur isotopes. We conclude that the oxygen‐driven evolutionary changes in the early Cambrian can be explained by recurrent nutrient inputs to the ocean, resulting from climate change caused by long‐period orbital cycles."

Although watershed processes link terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, the environmental influences on their productivity synchronization remain insufficiently quantified. To address this, we analyzed coupling strength (CS), defined as the annual correlation between daily terrestrial and riverine GPP, across 142 U.S. watersheds. Using interpretable machine learning, we found that water temperature, reach width, watershed area, and terrestrial leaf area index were the strongest predictors of CS, with non‐linear, context‐dependent effects and interactions among factors. Clustering analysis based on interpreted predictor effects revealed four distinct coupling regimes, reflecting contrasting combinations of watershed attributes such as climate, land cover, and anthropogenic impacts.

This study comprehensively clarifies what locks the position of the nighttime CI center in Hainan Island. The nighttime CI occurrence over Hainan Island requires warm and moist environmental winds, which primarily generate strong convergence in the southwestern‐to‐eastern offshore region, where nighttime CI occurrence is first locked. Concurrently, the intrinsically phase‐locked inertial oscillation of sea breezes over the South China Sea causes strong convergence between sea breezes and land breezes in the southern‐to‐eastern offshore region, where nighttime CI occurrence is second locked. Ultimately, the coupling between upper‐level easterlies and low‐level environmental winds induces strong vertical wind shear over the southwestern and southern sides of the island, where CI development is highly suppressed.

Here, we extend this analysis to the Alaska subduction zone, using 2,567 high‐quality teleseismic SWS measurements from 195 broadband stations. As was found in Japan, the observed SWS patterns in Alaska depend on earthquake backazimuth. The fast‐S polarization directions are either trench parallel or perpendicular in southeastern Alaska and form a prominent circular pattern in central Alaska. We found that a dipping anisotropic slab following the Slab 2.0 geometry, with 30% shear anisotropy, and exhibiting tilted transverse isotropy with a symmetry axis normal to the slab interface, predicts both the fast‐S polarizations and delay times (δt = 1.0–1.5 s).

We develop here a linearized scaling theory to quantify the potential role of ozone in determining the secondary circulation, and validate it against a radiative/photochemical/convective equilibrium column model that reproduces the observed temperature and ozone anomalies of the QBO. Although the potential for radiative heating due to ozone to affect the secondary circulation is generally appreciated, theoretical discussions of the secondary circulation have not included an explicit representation of the ozone budget. For realistic parameter values, ozone heating can play a dominant role in determining the strength and structure of the secondary circulation. In particular, the photochemical sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone is conventionally thought to be determined by transport is key to obtaining a realistic circulation: in its absence the theory predicts a much weaker circulation in which vertical motion is aligned with the core of the jets rather than the shear zones. The photochemical sink (and thus the secondary circulation) depends nonlocally on the ozone column above. We further apply this theory to estimate the component of the secondary circulation that is due to ozone heating, confirming a previously inferred over‐estimate of the secondary circulation in ERA 5.

However, understanding of how these actors interact with the institutions and infrastructure systems in which they are embedded to drive change is still limited. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to understand factors shaping actors' political behavior and how power dynamics influence their ability to create change. This study addresses this gap by combining analysis of actors' narratives about water issues and governance with dynamical systems modeling of the socio‐hydrologic system in the context of California's San Joaquin Valley. Through interviews and focus groups with growers, advocacy groups, and rural residents, distinct narratives emerge around water issues and power dynamics. Modeling strategies that would maximize each actor's water access reveals that existing structures incentivize strategies that would mainly benefit larger growers, and thus conflict with the goals of environmental justice narratives. Comparing these modeled strategies with actors' actual strategies also reveals disparities in different actors' ability to pursue the “optimal” strategy. These findings highlight how system structures entrench certain interests as well as the potential of narratives for shaping strategies aimed at long‐term transformation."

Examining health disparities separately by each demographic factor revealed that race/ethnicity was associated with the largest disparities (209 new cases per 100,000 schoolchildren), followed by educational attainment (128) and poverty (85).

This study investigates the spatiotemporal changes in water features and quality of three key drinking water source lakes‐Rawal, Simly, and Khanpur (RSK), located in and around Islamabad, Pakistan. Using Level 2 Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data from 1991 to 2020, changes in lake surface area were assessed through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Thresholding and geospatial analysis in ArcGIS 10.8 were used to extract and visualize water bodies and surface feature changes. The study found that lake surface areas were directly linked to rainfall levels and decreased with rising temperatures especially during 1991, 2000 2010, and 2020. Water quality was assessed using standard laboratory procedures. Notably, higher bacterial counts were recorded during the wet season, indicating increased microbial contamination likely due to surface runoff. Among the heavy metals analyzed (Fe, F, As, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Pb, Ni, B, Cd, P, Hg), only boron (B), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) were detected above background levels, though within permissible limits. The study highlights the significant influence of climatic variables on both the physical extent and microbial quality of drinking water lakes. These findings offer critical insights for policymakers and water resource managers, providing a replicable framework for monitoring and managing similar reservoirs in other climate‐sensitive regions."

10.1038/s43247-025-02852-7,False,Communications Earth & Environment,该研究论文主要关注地缘政治风险对全球航运脱碳进程的影响。它使用自然语言处理分析了52个国家的新闻媒体数据，发现地缘政治风险会显著降低各国脱碳的意愿，导致各国更倾向于优先考虑经济利益而非环境问题。研究还通过分析全球船舶导航的二氧化碳排放量来验证这一结论。虽然该研究涉及碳排放，但其核心在于地缘政治和经济因素对航运业脱碳的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['shipping decarbonization', 'geopolitical risk', 'maritime trade', 'carbon emissions', 'economic efficiency']",Pengjun Zhao;Tianyu Ma;Tong Zhao;Renrong Xiao;Tingting Kang,Geopolitical risks impede global shipping decarbonization progress,"Geopolitical risks curb shipping decarbonization as countries under pressure often prioritize profit over climate goals, according to a natural language processing analysis of news media across 52 countries. 
 Decarbonizing global shipping is crucial to achieving international climate goals. However, efforts in this field may be inhibited by geopolitical risks that profoundly affect global shipping. Here, we use natural language processing on an over 500-million-word corpus to quantify the shipping decarbonization attitudes of 52 countries. Using a causal inference approach, we provide evidence that geopolitical risks exert a substantial and statistically significant negative impact on national decarbonization willingness. This dampening effect threatens to delay the International Maritime Organization’s timeline for zero-carbon shipping. Causal evidence also reveals that countries facing geopolitical tend to prioritize economic efficiency over environmental concerns, particularly those with high levels of maritime trade, economic development, and carbon intensity. We further validated these shifts by analyzing carbon dioxide emissions of global vessel navigation. This study highlights the urgent need to bridge geopolitical divides to achieve the ambitious target of zero-carbon emissions in global shipping by mid-century.

Wuite;T. Nagler;M. Hetzenecker;H. Rott,Ten years of polar ice velocity mapping using Copernicus Sentinel-1,"•Sentinel-1 provides ice velocity at unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage. •We developed enhanced processing lines to generate optimized ice velocity products. •The processing includes combinations of offset tracking and SAR interferometry. •Examples from a 10-year portfolio of Sentinel-1 ice velocity products are shown. •These range from single glaciers to full ice sheet extent at various timescales. 
 The Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, launched in 2014, has provided a step change in the capabilities of polar satellite earth observation, addressing the challenge of limited Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data availability over ice sheets that existed previously. Since its launch, S1 has provided regular acquisitions every 6 to 12 days in Greenland, Antarctica, and other polar regions. This has enabled the set-up of an operational monitoring system for generating time series of key glaciological variables, such as ice velocity and ice discharge, with high spatial and temporal resolution. Leveraging the extensive S1 SAR archive, we have developed algorithms to generate detailed maps and dense time series of glacier and ice sheet velocity now spanning more than 10 years. Here we describe the processing pipeline and highlight some of the key results. The velocity maps can be and have been used for a wide range of applications in various studies. Our results demonstrate the S1 mission's exceptional ability for comprehensive monitoring of flow velocities on glaciers and ice sheets, thereby providing crucial data for ice dynamics and climate modelling."
