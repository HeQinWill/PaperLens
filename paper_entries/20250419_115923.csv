Pseudomonas brassicacearum NFM421, a root-isolated bacterium, produces two different siderophores in the form of pyoverdine and ornicorrugatin. We studied the interaction between this bacterium and biotite─a natural iron-bearing phyllosilicate─to assess the factors governing siderophore-mediated biogenic weathering. We demonstrated that bacterial Fe is an essential factor driving biotite weathering. Our findings suggested that the lipopeptidic siderophore ornicorrugatin might be more effective than pyoverdine as an iron-bearing mineral weathering agent. This secondary siderophore’s production is maintained even when the iron requirement of the bacteria is fulfilled. Moreover, we observed that another mechanism requiring direct physical contact might enable P. brassicacearum to acquire iron structural ions from soil minerals."

These polyesters are thus viable substitutes for conventional, persistent polymers (e.g., polyethylene) in specific applications for which the transfer of some of the polymers into the soil is inevitable. While polymer biodegradability is often assessed in laboratory incubations using respirometric analysis of formed CO2, approaches to accurately quantify biodegradable polyesters in soils and to track their mass loss in field incubations over time remain missing. This study first introduces an analytical workflow combining Soxhlet extraction with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the accurate, high-throughput, and chemically selective quantification of eight commercially important biodegradable polyesters (i.e., poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), polylactic acid, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), polycaprolactone, polybutylene adipate, polybutylene azelate, and polybutylene succinate), and the nonbiodegradable polymer polystyrene, in six soils spanning a range of types and physicochemical properties. This work introduces an effective sample deployment–retrieval approach that, combined with the analytical method, allows the biodegradation of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) and polylactic acid from a biodegradable mulch film in three agricultural soils to be monitored. In combination, the two parts of this work lay the foundation to accurately quantify and monitor biodegradable polymers in soils."

This transition requires a high purity regenerant for pure product recovery (e.g., ammonium recovery from urine) because the long-lasting direct contact regeneration directly mixes the eluted target ions with the regenerant. Direct contact regeneration prevents using impure regenerants such as electrochemically produced acid (containing electrolyte salts) from making a pure product, hindering the advancement of electrified ammonium recovery via ion exchange. We demonstrated a new concept of indirect contact regeneration leveraging the “proton leakage” from an anion exchange membrane to achieve tandem proton separation and resin regeneration, which enabled the recovery of pure ammonium  by an impure acid. A weak acid cation exchange resin enabled multicycles over 80% regeneration efficiency by the limited proton leakage from mild acids with pH 2–3. Investigating the effects of acid purity, pH, and resin dosage revealed the critical role of aqueous pH and the dynamic balance of proton leakage and consumption in governing regeneration efficiency and kinetics. Critical insights on salt types and target pH were provided to minimize the trade-off between electrochemical acid production energy and regeneration efficiency."

However, the lack of cascading risk modeling techniques makes it challenging to determine how disruptions in one economic sector propagate to others through the supply chain. In this study, we construct a national multilayer cascading risk model using 2017 multiregional input–output data from China and simulate shock propagation. Our results show that the originating sector and geographic location of a shock are critical in determining the collapse’s effects. The probability of a large avalanche (>1000 collapsed nodes) varies from 2 to 80% across provinces and from 1 to 96% across layers. Food production and processing, chemical smelting, and energy supply are critical layers that amplify the cascade effects of shocks. Grain regions like Henan and Hunan, manufacturing hubs such as Guangdong, and water and energy suppliers like Sichuan and Hubei face high cascading risks. Our scenario analyses show that reducing output dependence on nodes decreases the system’s avalanche size by 20–40% while improving water production efficiency reduces it by 10–22%. These results highlight the importance of diversifying supply sources and optimizing water use efficiency to enhance network resilience."

However, the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions, including interactions with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), remain largely unquantified. In this study, we combine laboratory data with a thermodynamic model to predict the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions. Our results suggest that BBOA with a H2SO4-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.37─an estimated upper limit for pyroCb smoke in the lower stratosphere after two months of aging─is highly viscous and frequently exists in a glassy state. Even at a higher H2SO4-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.79─an estimated upper limit after nine months of aging─BBOA can still transition to a glassy state under certain stratospheric conditions. In the glassy state, bulk reactions are suppressed, and multiphase chemistry may be limited to the particle surfaces. We also highlight key areas for future research needed to better constrain the viscosity and phase state of BBOA in the stratosphere and its subsequent impact on ozone."

Mitrano,Exploring the Essential Use Concept for Primary Microplastics Regulation in the EU,"With the increasing prevalence of plastic pollution, including microplastics (MPs, particles <5 mm), the pursuit of safer and more sustainable alternatives gains increasing traction. While a substantial portion of MPs in the environment arises from the degradation of plastic litter and the wear of polymer-containing materials (secondary MPs), deliberate incorporation of MPs in certain products (primary MPs) also represents a considerable source, and targeted measures can be implemented to minimize human exposure and environmental releases. Improved policies for managing macroplastic waste help mitigate secondary MPs, but addressing primary MPs requires distinct strategies. Globally, various approaches, such as bans or restrictions on primary MPs, have been proposed, including the recent EU regulation under REACH, which groups intentionally added MPs together based on their diverse uses and properties. However, applying the Essential Use Concept (EUC) provides a more refined regulatory approach; balancing environmental health, technical feasibility, and innovation. This perspective explores the potential, challenges, and limitations of implementing the EUC for primary MPs. By examining four use cases─controlled-release medicines, agricultural seed coatings, personal care products, and artificial turf infill─we highlight how the EUC can prioritize essential and beneficial applications while phasing out nonessential uses."

Lee;Brian P. Chaplin,Matrix Effects on Electrochemical Oxidation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Sludge Centrate,"This study investigated the electrochemical oxidation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) using a Ti4O7 anode in centrate from sludge dewatering. Synthetic solutions containing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), other PFAS, and inorganic constituents (phosphate, ammonium, chloride, carbonate, and acetate salts) found in centrate were studied to assess their impact on the oxidation process. PFOA removal decreased from 95% in a stable electrolyte (NaClO4) to 81% in a Na2HPO4 electrolyte and 30% in a solution mimicking concentrated centrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy detected phosphate and nitrogen species on the electrode surface. At potentials required to oxidize PFAS (>3.0 V/SHE), phosphate and ammonium were oxidized to radicals that blocked electrode sites, inhibiting PFAS removal and shifting PFOA oxidation from first-order kinetics. The kinetics were accurately modeled using a Langmuir–Hinshelwood approach with a transient inhibition term. Results suggested that phosphate, ammonium, and bicarbonate ions reduced hydroxyl radical availability, thereby limiting PFOA defluorination. In concentrated centrate, 95% of the chemical oxygen demand and 93% of total PFAS were removed after 233 s of electrolysis at 30 mA cm–2. However, partial degradation of perfluorohexanoic acid and accumulation of perfluoroheptanoic acid, attributed to inorganic electrode fouling, suggested the need for a multistage reactor system for more complete PFAS mineralization."

Traditionally, the presence of coexisting nitrate in water has always been regarded as a major inhibitory factor for PFASs defluorination. However, this study observed an unexpected promotive effect of nitrate on defluorination, challenging the previous phenomenon. Notably, the addition of 100 μM nitrate resulted in a remarkable 54% enhancement in PFOA defluorination. A novel mechanism was discovered that nitrate-derived reactive nitrogen species (RNS) activated the decarboxylation–hydroxylation–elimination–hydrolysis (DHEH) process, an important degradation pathway for PFASs in UV/sulfite ARP. Induced by eaq–, the PFAS molecule first became a perfluorinated radical and then was transformed into unstable perfluorinated alcohol by reacting with water. Due to the high reactivity driven by unpaired electrons of RNS, water molecules were destabilized with the H–O bond stretched from 0.98 to 1.04 Å. This effectively enhanced the spontaneity of the reaction between perfluorinated radical and water molecules and consequently made the whole DHEH process more thermodynamic favorable (ΔG, −23.53 → −376.28 kJ/mol). Such a process breaks through the view that the nitrate directly reacts with eaq– to affect PFASs defluorination in ARP systems. This finding offers an innovative perspective for optimizing PFAS defluorination by strategically regulating nitrate levels in water bodies."

The aim of this study was to investigate the emissions of fine particles, coarse particles, and CO2 under realistic driving conditions. Passenger car brake control was reproduced in an indoor experiment using the Los Angeles City Transit (LACT) cycle as the test cycle. The experiments were performed in a laboratory with a brake dynamometer under realistic braking temperature conditions using one front brake of a midsize passenger car. The preliminary results indicated that particle emission factors were higher than CO2 emissions, with a driving distance-based CO2 emission factor per brake axle of 1.7 ± 0.15 mg/km/brake and a particulate matter of 10 μm or less (PM10) emission factor of 10.1 ± 2.3 mg/km/brake. Although CO2 emissions were less than PM10, the results of this study showed that CO2 emissions and nucleation-mode particles (<20 nm in diameter) are formed even at final braking temperatures of 40–90 °C, which are considerably lower than the commonly accepted critical braking temperature. This research highlights the importance of further study to establish an emission inventory and to analyze the toxic effects of brake wear particles with combustion-like brake wear processes that require consideration of the emissions of nucleation-mode particles and gaseous compounds."

Here, we investigated the potential SA‐MSA‐HIO3‐HIO2 quaternary nucleation mechanism by exploring the formation of (SA)w(MSA)x(HIO3)y(HIO2)z (0 ≤ w + x + y ≤ 3, 1 ≤ z ≤ 3) clusters with quantum chemical calculation and kinetics modelling. The results indicate that SA‐MSA‐HIO3‐HIO2 can effectively nucleate under marine atmospheric conditions. The nucleation rate is up to 7 orders of magnitude higher than that of SA/MSA‐HIO3‐HIO2, SA‐MSA‐HIO2 ternary mechanisms, and SA/MSA/HIO3‐HIO2 binary mechanisms at some specific conditions. The nucleation is mainly driven by acid‐base reaction (HIO2 as base) and halogen bonds besides hydrogen bonds, with the three acids showing both competitive and cooperative roles. More importantly, it was found that the contribution of MSA to the aerosol nucleation is comparable to SA at equal concentrations. The unexpectedly high contribution of MSA is attributed to its higher halogen‐bonding capacity than SA. This study highlights the need to consider the multicomponent nucleation mechanism in the marine atmosphere for accurate aerosol and climate projections, and may serve as important proof that MSA as weak acid can effectively nucleate even coexisting with SA."

The focus is on short‐term convective precipitation forecasts influenced by the Northeast China cold vortex (NCCV). Four assimilation experiments were designed to compare the warm rain scheme with the full‐hydrometeor scheme, as well as to examine the differences between assimilating hourly surface rain gauge data and multi‐source integrated precipitation products. Nine cases of intense convective precipitation related to NCCV were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the initial analysis of ice‐phase hydrometeors was satisfactory across the three experiments utilizing the full‐hydrometeor 4D‐Var assimilation scheme. The assimilation of precipitation data using the full‐hydrometeor scheme in WRF 4D‐Var effectively adjusted atmospheric thermodynamic properties and decreased model spin‐up time, leading to improved precipitation forecasts, especially for the 0–3 hr period.

Xiong,Uncertainty Analysis of Surface Downward Longwave Radiation Models Based on Cloud Base Temperature,"Cloud base temperature (CBT) is a crucial factor determining the surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) under cloudy conditions. Theoretically, CBT‐based parameterized models offer more accurate representations of cloud radiation effects and SDLR compared to simplistic models. However, they have poor performance in practical retrievals and have less development and application than other models. This study aims to pinpoint the shortcomings of existing CBT‐based models, quantify model errors, and evaluate the impact of key parameter errors on SDLR retrieval results. Using simulated datasets based on radiative transfer models and ground‐based remote sensing datasets, we conducted a detailed analysis of four CBT‐based models. Our findings reveal that current model formulations inadequately capture the contributions of the atmosphere and cloud, leading to overestimation of the former and underestimation of the latter. However, these errors can partially offset each other. Under accurate parameter conditions, mean SDLR errors are within 10 W/m2 for Diak, Gupta‐Cal, and Wang models, and approximately −5 W/m2 for the Schmetz model. The influence of cloud base height (CBH) and cloud fraction (CF) is significant and complex. When errors in CBH and CF are combined, CF error exerts a dominant influence. Surface downward longwave radiation error is insensitive to CBH error when CF is underestimated, while the impact of CBH error on SDLR estimation is notable when CF is overestimated. Regardless of CBH error, SDLR error is sensitive to CF error. Furthermore, when model errors are combined with cloud parameter errors, model errors may amplify or partially offset the impacts of parameter errors."

Non‐floodplain wetlands (NFWs) are hydrologically dynamic and globally prevalent inland wetlands distal to fluvial flowpaths, lacustrine‐fringing areas, and geomorphic floodplains; >50% the world's remaining wetlands have been reported as NFWs. Quantifying NFW carbon stores and dynamics represents a substantive global carbon‐budget gap. We analyze conterminous‐US (CONUS) field‐based data collected from nearly 2000 wetland sites sampled by the National Wetlands Condition Assessment (NWCA) representing ∼38 Mha CONUS wetlands, asking: What is the mean soil organic carbon density and total carbon storage in different hydrogeomorphically classified wetland types? To what extent does soil organic carbon density and total carbon in NFWs differ from other wetland types? How does NFW soil organic carbon density and total carbon vary between altered and intact NFWs? We find that relative to other wetland types, NFWs are carbon‐storing powerhouses, containing approximately 1.5x soil organic carbon per ha than other wetland types sampled. CONUS‐wide, NFWs store more total carbon across every depth increment: ∼2.0x than other wetland types. Further, wetland condition affects carbon dynamics: least impaired NFWs had 1.6x the soil organic carbon density found in intermediately disturbed wetlands and 1.8x the density of most‐disturbed NFWs. These NWCA data, plus waning societal protections, suggests that carbon releases from NFW destruction across CONUS landscapes are likely to increase—perhaps markedly—in the coming years (e.g., through altered hydrology affecting atmospheric release of NFW‐stored carbon as well as dissolved carbon export)."

However, designing deployment strategies is complicated by the lack of plant‐level response between power generation and climate variables with the constraint of economic and social factors. Here, we develop three random‐forest (RF) response models that accurately capture the nonlinear relationship between renewable energy generation (hydro, solar, and wind power) and climate parameters at the plant level, using a 17‐year historical data set. These RF models enable projections of renewable energy generation from both existing and newly built power plants under the Representative Concentration Pathways and the Shared Social‐Economic Pathways (RCP‐SSP) scenarios, as well as deployment strategies. Our analysis reveals that renewable energy generation from existing plants is projected to decrease significantly by 6%–8% (57–72 TWh) in 2045–2060 compared to the period 2002–2017. The impact of climate change on renewable energy generation varies spatially, suggesting optimizing the deployment of newly built power plants could mitigate adverse effects. Compared to the strategy maintaining the original deployment, national renewable energy generation can be increased by 24%–28% through optimized deployment tailored to future climate. The optimized deployment can lead to synergistic reductions in carbon emissions by 25%–28% and air pollutants by 42%–97%. These findings underscore the significance of considering plant‐level heterogeneity and climate risk in the strategic deployment of renewable power systems."

 The subduction of pelagic sediments and altered oceanic crust modulates the global cycle of volatile elements. Sulfate and carbonate fluids released when one plate descends beneath another modify the redox state of the mantle, and generate the return of water and reactive gases to the atmosphere and hydrosphere via arc volcanism, affecting planetary habitability over geologic timescales. However, the timing of the onset of subduction remains uncertain, hindering our understanding of how deep geochemical cycles operated on the early Earth. Here we measure sulfur and neodymium isotope data on Eoarchaean mantle-derived rocks of the Innuksuac Complex in northern Québec, Canada, with petrological characteristics of arc magmas. These rocks exhibit anomalous sulfur isotopic compositions originally produced by photochemical reactions in the atmosphere more than 3.8 Gyr ago. Combined sulfur and neodymium isotope data suggest that these signatures were transferred to the Innuksuac mantle through devolatilization and partial melting of terrigenous sediments derived from a Hadean (4.3–4.4 Gyr ago) continental source, providing a record of an early continental margin subduction environment. This result pushes back direct evidence of a subduction-driven volatile cycle to the onset of the terrestrial rock record, approximately 1 Gyr earlier than previously inferred from diamond inclusions.

 Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.

 Climate change is widely recognized as one of the main threats to biodiversity1 and predicting its consequences is critical to conservation efforts. A wide range of studies have evaluated the effects of future climate using taxon-based metrics3,4, but few studies to date have applied a phylogenetic approach to forecast these impacts. Here, we show that future climate change is expected to significantly modify not only species richness, but also phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism of Neotropical frogs. Our results show that by 2050, the ranges of 42.20% (n = 213) of species are projected to shrink and the range of 1.71% of species (n = 9) are projected to disappear. Furthermore, we find that areas of high SR and PD are not always congruent with areas of high PE. Our study highlights the projected impacts of climate change on Neotropical frog diversity and identifies target areas for conservation efforts that consider not just species numbers, but also distinct evolutionary histories.

Here the authors show that, in experimental models of cell competition, hemocytes are recruited independently of cell death and in fact participate directly in cell killing. 
 In epithelial tissues, juxtaposition of cells of different phenotypes can trigger cell competition, a process whereby one type of cell drives death and extrusion of another. During growth and homeostasis, cell competition is thought to serve a quality control function, eliminating cells that are “less fit”. Tissues may also attack and eliminate newly arising tumor cells, exploiting mechanisms shared with other instances of cell competition, but that differ, reportedly, in the involvement of the immune system. Whereas immune cells have been shown to play a direct role in killing tumor cells, this has not been observed in other cases of cell competition, suggesting that tissues recognize and handle cancer cells differently. Here, we challenge this view, showing that, in the fruit fly Drosophila, innate immune cells play similar roles in cell killing during classical cell competition as in eliminating tumors. These findings suggest that immune suppression of cancer may exploit the same mechanisms as are involved in promoting phenotypic uniformity among epithelial cells. In the fruit fly Drosophila, juxtaposition of phenotypically different cells can lead to cell competition, resulting in killing of one of the two cell types, followed by removal of the dead cells by phagocytic immune cells known as hemocytes.

Here, the authors introduce a syngas-induced dispersion method to anchor ZnO species onto ZnCr2O4, forming monodispersed ZnOx active sites that enhance catalytic performance in direct syngas conversion to light olefins. 
 ZnCrOx oxides coupled with zeolites (OXZEO) allow direct conversion of syngas into light olefins, while active sites in the composite oxides remain elusive. Herein, we find that ZnO particles physically mixed with ZnCr2O4 spinel particles can be well dispersed onto the spinel surfaces by treatment in syngas and through a reduction-evaporation-anchoring mechanism, forming monodispersed ZnOx species with uniform thickness or dimension on ZnCr2O4 up to a dispersion threshold ZnO loading of 16.0 wt% (ZnCr2O4@ZnOx). A linear correlation between CO conversion and surface ZnO loading clearly confirms that the ZnOx overlayer on ZnCr2O4 acts as the active structure for the syngas conversion, which can efficiently activate both H2 and CO. The obtained ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst combined with SAPO-34 zeolite achieves excellent catalytic performance with 64% CO conversion and 75% light olefins selectivity among all hydrocarbons. Moreover, the ZnOx overlayer is effectively anchored on the ZnCr2O4 spinel, which inhibits Zn loss during the reaction and demonstrates high stability over 100 hours. Thus, a significant interface confinement effect is present between the spinel surface and the ZnOx overlayer, which helps to stabilize ZnOx active structure and enhance the catalytic performance. Identifying active sites on oxide catalysts is often challenging.

 The antibiotic resistance protein FusB rescues protein synthesis from inhibition by fusidic acid (FA), which locks elongation factor G (EF-G) to the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. Here, we present time-resolved single–particle cryo-EM structures explaining the mechanism of FusB-mediated rescue. FusB binds to the FA-trapped EF-G on the ribosome, causing large-scale conformational changes of EF-G that break interactions with the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. This leads to dissociation of EF-G from the ribosome, followed by FA release. We also observe two independent binding sites of FusB on the classical-state ribosome, overlapping with the binding site of EF-G to each of the ribosomal subunits, yet not inhibiting tRNA delivery. The affinity of FusB to the ribosome and the concentration of FusB in S. aureus during FusB-mediated resistance support that direct binding of FusB to ribosomes could occur in the cell. Our results reveal an intricate resistance mechanism involving specific interactions of FusB with both EF-G and the ribosome, and a non-canonical release pathway of EF-G.

This reveals a non-genetic mechanism for floral asymmetry. 
 Many animals and plants show left-right (LR) asymmetry. The LR asymmetry of mirror-image flowers has clear functional significance, with the reciprocal placement of male and female organs in left- versus right-handed flowers promoting cross-pollination. Here, we study how handedness of mirror-image flowers is determined and elaborated during development in the South African geophyte Cyanella alba. Inflorescences of C. alba produce flowers with a largely consistent handedness. However, this handedness has no simple genetic basis and individual plants can switch their predominant handedness between years. Rather, it is the direction of the phyllotactic spiral that predicts floral handedness. Style deflection is driven by increased cell expansion in the adaxial carpel facing the next oldest flower compared to the other adaxial carpel. The more expanding carpel shows transcriptional signatures of increased auxin signaling and auxin application can reverse the orientation of style deflection. We propose that a recently described inherent LR auxin asymmetry in the initiating organs of spiral phyllotaxis determines handedness in C. alba, creating a stable yet non-genetic floral polymorphism. This mechanism links chirality across different levels of plant development and exploits a developmental constraint in a core patterning process to produce morphological variation of ecological relevance. Here it is shown that the handedness of mirror-image flowers in Cyanella alba is not genetically determined but linked to the spiral arrangement of leaves and asymmetric auxin activity.

 Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a versatile three-dimensional (3D) material platform to explore quantum phenomena and functionalities that emerge from an intricate interplay among magnetism, band structure, and electronic correlations. Here, we report the observation of a nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior and collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM) in V1/3NbS2. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify a commensurate, collinear AFM order formed by intercalated V moments. In the magnetically ordered state, the spontaneous AHE is tenfold greater than expected from empirical scaling with magnetization, and this strongly enhanced AHE arises in the NFL regime that violates the quasiparticle picture. V1/3NbS2 challenges the existing single-particle framework for understanding AHEs based on one-body Berry curvature and highlights the potential of magnetically intercalated TMDs to unveil new electronic functionalities where many-body correlations play a critical role.

 Spin-valley magnetic ordering is restricted to layered van der Waals type transition-metal dichalcogenides with ordering temperatures below 55 K. Recent theoretical studies on non-van der Waals structures have predicted spin-valley polarization induced semiconducting ferromagnetic ground states, but experimental validation is missing. We report high-Curie temperature (TC ~ 225 K) metallic ferromagnetism with spontaneous spin-valley polarization in monolayer Cr2Se3 on graphene. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals systematic temperature-dependent energy shifts and splitting of localized Cr 3 d↑-t2g bands, accompanied by occupancy of the itinerant Cr 3d-eg valleys. The t2g-eg spin-valley coupling at the K/K’ points of hexagonal Brillouin zone leads to ferromagnetic ordering. Circular dichroism in ARPES shows clear evidence of spin-valley polarized states. Comparison with bilayer and trilayer Cr2Se3 reveals the crucial role of valley carrier density in enhancing TC and provides a guiding principle to realize 2D ferromagnetism at higher temperatures in non-van der Waals materials.

 The current study, leveraging large ensemble high-resolution atmospheric model simulations (d4PDF) with three warming scenarios, uncovers potential shifts in tropical cyclone (TC) tracks within the western North Pacific (WNP) under future warming. Both northward and eastward migrations are detected in projected TC tracks. TC tracks north of 40°N are projected to surge by 25% and 65%, respectively, under the future 2 K and 4 K warming scenarios. Meantime, TC tracks south of 40°N and east of 160°E are projected to increase by 15% and 36%, respectively, under the two warming scenarios. These changes in TC tracks are intimately linked to shifts in TC genesis locations and alterations in large-scale steering flows. Specifically, the increase in TC tracks north of 40°N is attributed to a slowdown of the TC movement due to slow-down of westerly steering flows. The increase in TC tracks east of 160°E is closely associated with the rise in TC genesis east of 160°E due to an anomalous cyclone. Additionally, there is a decrease in projected TC landfalling along the East Asian coast, predominantly attributable to the reduced TC genesis west of 160°E. Our findings emphasize the heightened vulnerability of high-latitude regions in China and Japan to TC hazards under future warming conditions."

 Heatwaves are causing catastrophic consequences on natural and socioeconomic systems yet they remain under-investigated in permafrost regions. Using simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we present a comprehensive assessment of recent and future heatwaves across the permafrost regions of the Northern Hemisphere (PRNH). Our focus is on the characteristics of summer and winter heatwaves as well as their potential implications for infrastructure stability. Results show that the PRNH has experienced increasing heatwaves over the past decades and is projected to face more frequent and intense heatwaves, especially under higher warming levels. Globally, summer heatwaves occur more frequently, whereas winter heatwaves exhibit higher intensity, with distinct regional behaviors. Both summer and winter heatwaves in the Arctic and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) occur more frequently than that in mid-latitude regions. The mid-latitudes present the strongest summer heatwaves, while the Arctic endures the most severe winter heatwaves. Historically, the Arctic and the QTP have been more affected by winter heatwaves due to their longer heatwave days and stronger intensity compared to summer heatwaves. Under warming scenarios, the Arctic is projected to continue facing greater winter heatwave pressure on account of the quick-enhancing intensity. Conversely, the QTP will be more affected by summer heatwaves due to their longer and rapidly growing heatwave days. Further analyses indicate that permafrost regions with high geohazard potential (GP) will come under greater summer heatwave stress, particularly in the Arctic and QTP, associated with longer heatwave days. The high-GP regions in Eurasia, however, are expected to bear more severe winter heatwaves driven by higher intensity. These findings deepen our understandings of heatwaves in PRNH and highlights the potential impacts of heatwaves on geohazards in permafrost regions."

 Evidence has emerged that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) may be predictable on decadal timescales, which may greatly benefit society given the significant climate impacts that accompany the NAO. However, the mechanisms behind the apparent decadal predictability of the NAO, including the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions, have not yet been pinned down. In this study, the decadal prediction skill for the NAO and the interactions with the underlying ocean are assessed in retrospective forecasts spanning 1960–2020 using eight different decadal prediction systems (DPSs) and observation-based data. We find considerable spread in NAO skill across the DPSs and critically, that this is linked to differences in the representation of ocean-NAO interactions between the systems. Evidence is shown that NAO skill is related to positive feedback between subpolar SSTs and the NAO, which varies in strength between DPSs yet may still be too weak even in the most skillful systems compared to an observational estimate.

 Understanding the impact of urbanization on extreme precipitation is crucial for promoting sustainable urban development in the context of global warming and rapid urban expansion. Here we found the highest impacts in humid regions such as the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, where urbanization amplifies extreme rainfall intensities, varying with the rate of urbanization across the representative cities. Moreover, the impact is greater at the 3-hourly scale compared to the daily scale in most cities in humid regions. However, we found no significant impact of urbanization on extreme rainfall across continental climate regions like the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Furthermore, we also found that urbanization alters the trends of heavy rainfall during daytime and nighttime, with significant regional variations linked to impervious surface coverage. Our findings provide essential scientific evidence to assist cities in designing targeted disaster mitigation policies, especially for those with diverse contexts and development patterns.

 Triple junctions, where three tectonic plates meet, play a critical role in geodynamics. The Azores Triple Junction is critical in the study of triple junctions, challenging traditional models of triple junction stability. Unlike the established rift-rift-rift framework, the Azores Triple Junction exhibits notable complexities, including a sigmoidal rift arm and a directional shift in velocity vectors. Our state-of-the-art 3-D thermo-mechanical simulations reveal critical similarities between model and nature in terms of timing, transient grabens distribution, rift and triple junction jump, diffuse plate boundary, depth of the main rift, and rift shoulder uplift, and indicate that the Azores Triple Junction became unstable because of the sigmoidal shape of the precursor Azores-Gibraltar fault zone and how Nubia has moved relative to Eurasia in the last 3 millions of years. A northward jump of the rift transferred the Azores block from Eurasia to Nubia, without forming a distinct Azores microplate. The findings underscore the importance of pre-existing tectonic structures in triple junction evolution, challenging the necessity of a thermal mantle plume in explaining the current dynamics and topography of the Azores Triple Junction.

 Maritime transportation is a substantial contributor to anthropogenic NOx emissions and coastal air pollution. Recognizing this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has steadily implemented stepwise stricter emission standards for ships in recent years. However, monitoring emissions from sea-bound vessels poses inherent challenges, prompting the exploration of satellite observations as a promising solution. Here we use TROPOMI measurements of NO2 plumes together with information on ship position and identity, and atmospheric models to quantify the NOx emissions of 130 plumes from individual ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in 2019. Because most of the emitted NOx is in the form of NO, which is not immediately converted into detectable NO2, plumes show their NO2 maximum some 15-30 km downwind of the ship’s stack. Further downwind NO2 decreases because of plume dispersion and photochemical oxidation. Background ozone and wind speed play a significant role both in detectability of the NO2 plume and the relationship between NOx emissions and observed NO2, explaining the good detection conditions in the eastern Mediterranean summertime, where ozone levels are high. Taking such effects of emissions, dispersion, entrainment, and in-plume chemistry in full account, we find emission strengths of 10-317 g (NO2) s−1. We then calculate emission factors of the detected ship plumes using AIS and ship specific data and find that newer Tier II ships have higher emission factors compared to older Tier I ships. This is especially the case when running at lower engine loads, which is the most frequently observed mode of operation in our ensemble. Additionally, at the time of detection around half of the emission factors detected for Tier II ships lie above the IMO weighted average limits. The presented method sets the stage for automated ship emission monitoring at sea, contributing to better air quality management."

 Ocean remote sensing data is crucial in understanding the global climate system. Due to satellite orbital coverage gaps and cloud cover, satellite ocean remote sensing products have significant data gaps. This paper introduces a Generalized Data Completion Model (GDCM) based on deep learning to reconstruct gap-free and cloud-free key oceanic variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, water vapor, cloud liquid water, and precipitation rate derived from polar-orbiting satellite sensors including Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms, the GDCM model effectively leverages spatio-temporal information within remote sensing data to fill in missing regions accurately. We use reanalysis data to simulate various data missing scenarios during model training for model development. We tested the model with the US East Coast region's global-coverage AMSR2/SSMI and local-coverage MODIS datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the GDCM model successfully and precisely completes the data for different satellites and types of missing data. To enable the model to capture enough data for the dynamical change patterns, we used seven consecutive days of observation data as inputs to improve the model's data-completion ability, significantly enhancing the handling of MODIS SST missing data due to cloud cover. When the input data's duration increased from one day to seven days, the model's R2 value improved from 0.062 to 0.93, and the Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) decreased from 6.58 to 0.92. Besides the model framework design, we implemented the incremental learning training strategy to enhance the model's data completion capability for different types of missing data, especially for SST data from AMSR2 satellites. The model's completed SST data R2 value improved from 0.93 to 0.99, and the RMSD decreased from 2.64 °C to 0.50 °C. The Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) of water vapor data decreased from 0.88 kg/m2 to 0.76 kg/m2, and the RMSD decreased from 1.39 kg/m2 to 1.27 kg/m2.

 Accurate estimation of impervious surface area (ISA) at the subpixel level is essential for understanding urbanization and its environmental impacts. In recent years, point-of-interest (POI) data has demonstrated unique value for urban studies. However, its potential for improving subpixel ISA estimation has yet to be fully realized. This research seeks to overcome the challenges of fusing POI data with remote sensing imagery and improve subpixel ISA estimation. To form an integrated sample dataset for subpixel ISA estimation, POI data were processed using kernel density analysis and transformed into continuous raster layers compatible with remote sensing imageries. The proposed method was tested in two study areas with distinctly different urban land patterns: Shenzhen, China, and Chicago, USA. Two widely used machine learning models, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were developed based on the integrated sample dataset. The results show POI data significantly improved both models. Incorporating POI data reduced MAE by 52.75% for CART and 56.68% for CNN, and RMSE by 45.39% and 48.54%, respectively, compared to models without POI data. The fully trained POI-integrated CNN achieved the highest accuracy (MAE: 2.95, RMSE: 5.12, R2: 0.99).

 Mangroves are critical for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation, yet their spatiotemporal dynamics and physiological responses to hydrometeorological drivers remain poorly understood. This study extracted three essential biodiversity variables (area distribution, phenology, and physiological traits) and further revealed their dependencies on hydrometeorological conditions. We developed a continuous time-series monitoring method (CTSM) to enhance the Detect-Monitor-Predict detection framework for accurately tracking mangrove spatial succession in the Beibu Gulf from 2000 to 2021. We combined Continuous Change Detection and Classification with Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) methods to capture the seasonal changes of physiological traits of dominant mangrove species. This study utilized HANTS-PLSR (partial least squares regression) response models and structural equation models to explore the seasonal responses of physiological trait to hydro-meteorological factors. The results indicated that (1) the improved detect component delineated fine-scale expansion patterns of mangroves, with area-hydrometeorology coupling evolving from uncoordinated to highly coordination during 2000–2021.

 Tourism activities can have a significant impact on air quality in forest scenic areas. In this work, we measured the levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including carbonyls and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), in the national forest park of Mountain Laoshan (Mt. Laoshan) in Qingdao, China, and evaluated the impact of these levels on air quality in this specific area. We found that during the May Day holidays (May 1–5, 2021), when the number of tourists is typically high, the average of VOCs total concentration was around 23.8 ± 22.6 ppbv, about 1.5 times higher than during periods with fewer tourists, ≈16.3 ± 15.2 ppbv. Most VOC species exhibited a bimodal profile diurnal variation during lunch and dinner periods. Using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, five anthropogenic sources were identified, with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage and traffic emissions being the two primary sources of VOCs in the Mt. Laoshan forest scenic area, respectively. The results indicate that tourism has a significant impact on atmospheric VOCs levels in the investigated area. Based on a 0-D model, we studied the effects of additional emissions from human activity on the atmospheric chemistry in the Mt. Laoshan forest scenic area. It was found that the additional NOx and VOCs emissions from tourism obviously increased the NO3 reactivity during the night and OH formation during the daytime, which significantly increases the local atmospheric oxidation capacity. Therefore, this study emphasizes the significant impact of tourism activities, such as catering and traffic emissions, on the local air quality in forest scenic areas."

We find that, during stress, mitochondrial messenger and ribosomal RNA are sequestered in mesoscale bodies containing mitoribosome components, concurrent with suppression of active translation. Stress bodies are triggered by proteotoxic stress downstream of double-stranded RNA accumulation in cells lacking unwinding activity of the highly conserved helicase SUPV3L1/SUV3.

Using the green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtiias a model system, we identified dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) as the key metabolite regulating TOR in response to carbon and light cues. Metabolomic analyses of synchronized cells revealed that DHAP levels change more than any other metabolite between dark- and light-grown cells and that the addition of the DHAP precursor, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), was sufficient to activate TOR in the dark. We also demonstrated that TOR was insensitive to light or inorganic carbon but not to exogenous DHA in aChlamydomonasmutant defective in the export of DHAP from the chloroplast. Our results provide a metabolic basis for the mode of TOR control by light and inorganic carbon and indicate that cytoplasmic DHAP is an important metabolic regulator of TOR."

Patients with mtRC dysfunction often present reduced skeletal growth as a sign of premature cartilage degeneration and aging, but how metabolic adaptations contribute to this phenotype is poorly understood. Here we show that, in mice with impaired mtRC in cartilage, reductive/reverse TCA cycle segments are activated to produce metabolite-derived amino acids and stimulate biosynthesis processes by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation during a period of massive skeletal growth and biomass production. However, chronic hyperactivation of mTORC1 suppresses autophagy-mediated organelle recycling and disturbs extracellular matrix secretion to trigger chondrocytes death, which is ameliorated by targeting the reductive metabolism. These findings explain how a primarily beneficial metabolic adaptation response required to counterbalance the loss of mtRC function, eventually translates into profound cell death and cartilage tissue degeneration. The knowledge of these dysregulated key nutrient signaling pathways can be used to target skeletal aging in mitochondrial disease."

We show that the Sindbis virus (SINV) opal codon outperforms other stop codons in primate cells at 37°C due to optimal translational readthrough. However, increased readthrough of all stop codons reduces opal preference at 28°C in primate and mosquito cells. Opal also outperforms all sense codons because opal-to-sense substitutions lead to excess polyprotein production at 37°C, disrupting orderly polyprotein processing and production of viral genomic RNAs (gRNAs) required for virus production. Increased readthrough at 28°C dampens the fitness advantages of opal codons. Unexpectedly, we find that a naturally occurring SINV mutation restores sense-codon fitness by further delaying polyprotein processing, allowing adequate time to produce gRNAs. Similar temperature-dependent mechanisms occur in the distantly related dual-host alphavirus, Ross River virus. Our work highlights sophisticated strategies dual-host alphaviruses use to optimize replication in divergent temperatures through a single codon."

In rodents, degradation of the hippocampal perineuronal net (PNN) replicates this overactivity, but uncertainty over rodent/human prefrontal homology limits translation to humans. Here, we test the hypothesis that aHipp PNN degradation in a species with a human-like prefrontal cortex, the marmoset, alters aHipp-striatal and aHipp-OFC circuitry. Microdialysis and [18F]-fluoro-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography identified increased dopamine synthesis in the associative striatum, but not the nucleus accumbens, as is seen in schizophrenia, and elevated dopamine and noradrenaline in the OFC. Behaviorally, activity was elevated in a marmoset version of the amphetamine-induced activity test, and impaired probabilistic discrimination learning was seen in an OFC/striatum-dependent task that computational modeling suggests was due to loss of goal-directed behavior. Together, these findings demonstrate that a loss of primate aHipp PNNs is sufficient to induce striatal and prefrontal dysfunction consistent with that observed in humans with schizophrenia."

Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers many applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a mechanism for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically nontrivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this leads to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking reciprocity. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect."

Here, geometry-inspired strategies along with programmable DNA interactions are combined to achieve structural control of colloidal cocrystal assemblies. Coassembling polyhedral and spherical NPs with complementary DNA yields two classes of cocrystals: one where both components order, and another where polyhedral NPs form a periodic lattice, while spherical NPs remain disordered but spatially correlated with polyhedral edges and corners. The size ratio of the building blocks can be used to control the ordering of spherical NPs—smaller octahedral-to-sphere size ratios favor fully ordered cocrystals. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidate the role of NP shapes and dimensions in the structural outcome of the cocrystal.

But which enzyme in this pathway is better to serve as an antitumor target remains unclear. Here, we revealed that targeting GFAT1, the rate-limiting enzyme in hexosamine synthesis, exhibits limited inhibitory effects on glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal brain tumor. This outcome is due to the compensation of NAGK-mediated hexosamine salvage pathway. Unexpectedly, inhibiting PGM3, which controls the flux of both de novo hexosamine synthesis and salvage pathways, down-regulates the expression of other enzymes in this pathway and suppresses SREBP-1, a critical lipogenic transcription factor, effectively inhibiting GBM growth. Unexpectedly, SREBP-1 transcriptionally up-regulates the expression of hexosamine synthesis enzymes, while inhibition of these enzymes in turn down-regulates SREBP-1 activation via reducing N-glycosylation of its transporter, SCAP. Our study identified PGM3 as a promising target for treating GBM. Its inhibition disrupts the SREBP-1 activation-hexosamine synthesis positive feedback regulation to effectively eliminate GBM cells."

However, the associated biochemical and physiological responses that confer herbivory resistance remain unknown. We used engineered isoprene-emitting (IE) and non-emitting (NE) control tobacco plants to interpret isoprene-mediated defense against herbivory in plants. Hornworm larvae raised on IE plants exhibited stunted growth compared to those raised on NE plants. Worms preferred to feed on NE rather than IE leaves, indicating deterrent effects of isoprene on insect feeding. Worm feeding induced a greater increase in jasmonic acid (JA), a crucial hormone for insect resistance, in IE leaves compared to that in NE leaves. Assimilation rates were stably maintained in IE plants, suggesting a protective role of isoprene in preserving photosynthetic efficiency during insect herbivory. Wound-induced increase in isoprene emission correlated with the elevation of key metabolites of the isoprene biosynthesis pathway. Our results highlight JA-priming functions of isoprene and provide insights into isoprene-mediated defense against insect herbivory."

Here, we report that pyrite, a widespread and highly stable iron sulfide mineral in anoxic, low-temperature environments, can support the growth and metabolic activity of anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria by serving as the sole iron source under iron-depleted conditions. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that pyrite addition substantially up-regulated genes and protein expression involved in photosynthesis, sulfur metabolism, and biosynthesis of organics. Anoxic microbial oxidation of pyritic sulfur and consequent destabilization of the pyrite structure were postulated to facilitate microbial iron acquisition. These findings advance our understanding of the survival strategies of anaerobes in iron-depleted environments and are important for revealing the previously underappreciated bioavailability of pyritic iron in anoxic environments and anoxic weathering of pyrite."

This study investigates how much future tropical cyclone risks are driven by climate and socioeconomic changes, quantifies uncertainty from propagating alternate representations of these systems through the risk modeling chain, and evaluates how strongly each model input contributes to output uncertainty. By comparing these three elements—drivers, uncertainty, and sensitivity—across four distinct tropical cyclone models, we derive findings generalizable beyond individual model setups. We find that average tropical cyclone risk will increase 1 to 5% by 2050 globally, with maximum increases ranging from 10 to 400% by 2100, depending on tropical cyclone model choice, region, and risk model inputs, while the dominant source of uncertainty shifts with modeling choices.

In this study, we identified that OV6+tumor cells exhibit stem-like characteristics and are notably enriched in patients with non–major pathological response, closely associated with resistance to combination therapies. Hypoxia and HIF1α were found to drive the formation of OV6+CSCs. METTL3, a methyltransferase, was revealed as a critical regulator of OV6+CSCs by stabilizing NFE2L3 messenger RNA via anN6-methyladenosine–dependent manner, thereby up-regulating NFE2L3 and activating the intrinsic WNT signaling pathway essential for maintaining stemness. OV6+tumor cells promoted M2 macrophage infiltration and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

To functionally test theSMAD7variant, we generated aDrosophilamodel possessing theLMNAmutation and theSMAD7variant in the orthologous fly genes. TheSMAD7variant increased SMAD signaling and enhanced muscle defects caused by the mutant lamin. Conversely, overexpression of wild-typeSMAD7rescued muscle function. These findings were extended to humans by showing that SMAD signaling is increased in muscle biopsy tissue from individuals withLMNA-MD compared to age-matched controls. Collectively, our findings supportSMAD7as the first functionally tested genetic modifier forLMNA-MD and suggest components of the SMAD pathway as therapeutic targets."
10.1126/sciadv.adv9640,False,Science Advances,该研究论文主要关注RNA病毒的RNA依赖性RNA聚合酶（RdRP）的结构和功能，特别是其启动元件（PE）在RNA合成起始和延伸过程中的作用。论文通过对登革热病毒2（DENV2）和烟曲霉多粘菌病毒-1（AfuPmV-1）的RdRP结构进行分析，揭示了PE在不同病毒中的双重功能保守性。这与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等领域没有直接关系。,[],Hengxia Jia;Shunli Liu;Guibo Rao;Qiaojie Liu;Jiqin Wu;Sheng Cao;Peng Gong,An evolutionarily unique viral RdRP suggests a common dual-function feature of the priming element,"Many RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by RNA viruses use de novo initiation strategy to start RNA synthesis, and they usually contain a priming element (PE) to interact with template RNA and priming nucleoside triphosphate to facilitate initiation. Upon transition to elongation in dengue virus 2 (DENV2) RdRP, PE refolds and contributes to elongation complex stability by interacting with the upstream RNA duplex. However, whether this PE dual-function feature commonly exists in viral RdRPs remains elusive, as PE is highly diverse among the entire RNA virus group. Here, a more complexed PE refolding is observed in RdRP crystal structures ofAspergillus fumigatuspolymycovirus-1 (AfuPmV-1), a polymycovirus evolutionarily connecting positive-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses. Although structural details and enzymology features are very different in transition from initiation to elongation in DENV2 and AfuPmV-1 RdRPs, what is in common is the PE dual-function feature that demonstrates functional conservation beyond sequence and structure."
