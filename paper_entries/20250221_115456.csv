10.5194/acp-25-2243-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文评估了同化卫星臭氧及其前体物观测数据对改进全球对流层臭氧分析的影响。使用了五个全球化学再分析数据集，通过观测系统实验（OSEs）来评估不同再分析系统下，卫星观测数据对地表和自由对流层臭氧分析的相对影响。结果表明，卫星臭氧及其前体物测量对于改善整个对流层的臭氧分析非常重要，尤其是在改进低层对流层臭氧分析方面，其中NO2柱的测量起着关键作用。该研究还强调了在评估观测系统影响时，考虑预报模型性能和数据同化配置的重要性，以提供对卫星系统的公正评估，并指导未来观测系统的设计。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等领域。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'satellite ozone observations', 'precursor measurements (NO2)', 'chemical reanalysis', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'ozonesonde observations']",Takashi Sekiya;Emanuele Emili;Kazuyuki Miyazaki;Antje Inness;Zhen Qu;R.

Cheng;Vincent Huijnen;Gerbrand Koren,Assessing the relative impacts of satellite ozone and its precursor observations to improve global tropospheric ozone analysis using multiple chemical reanalysis systems,"Five global chemical reanalysis datasets were used to assess the relative impacts of assimilating satellite ozone and its precursor measurements on tropospheric ozone analyses for 2010. The multiple reanalysis system comparison allows an evaluation of the dependency of the impacts on different reanalysis systems. The results suggested the importance of satellite ozone and its precursor measurements for improving ozone analysis in the whole troposphere, with varying magnitudes among the systems. 
 Chemical reanalysis products have been produced by integrating various satellite observational data to provide comprehensive information on atmospheric composition. Five global chemical reanalysis datasets were used to evaluate the relative impacts of assimilating satellite ozone and its precursor measurements on surface and free-tropospheric ozone analyses for the year 2010. Observing system experiments (OSEs) were conducted with multiple reanalysis systems under similar settings to evaluate the impacts of reanalysis system selection on the quantification of observing system values. Without data assimilation, large discrepancies remained among the control runs owing to model biases. Data assimilation improved the consistency among the systems, reducing the standard deviation by 72 %–88 % in the lower troposphere through the lower stratosphere, while improving agreement with independent ozonesonde observations. The OSEs suggested the importance of precursor measurements, especially from tropospheric NO2 columns, for improving ozone analysis in the lower troposphere, with varying influences among the systems (increases in global lower-tropospheric ozone by 0.1 % in GEOS-Chem and 7 % in Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis version 2 (TCR-2), with only NO2 assimilation). Adjustments made by direct ozone assimilation showed similar vertical patterns between the TCR-2 and IASI-r systems, with increases of 6 %–22 % and decreases of 2 %–21 % in the middle and upper troposphere, respectively, reflecting the biases of the forecast models. These results suggest the importance of considering the effects of the forecast model performance and data assimilation configurations when assessing the observing system impacts to provide unbiased evaluations of satellite systems and to guide the design of future observing systems."
10.5194/acp-25-2269-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了卫星观测几何角度对平流层臭氧长期变化趋势的影响。论文重点关注了卫星观测中使用的宽泛的垂直平均核函数对臭氧趋势的影响，发现这些平均核函数可能导致趋势估计的误差，并影响趋势特征的检测。研究表明，由于平均核函数对信息的垂直重新分配，趋势不确定性可能被低估。这项研究强调了在使用具有宽平均核函数的仪器记录来量化趋势及其不确定性时需要谨慎，并为协调不同观测平台之间的差异提供了一个框架。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测、大气成分分析（尤其是臭氧）以及空气质量监测中的长期趋势分析。,"['stratospheric ozone', 'satellite observations', 'nadir-viewing geometry', 'ozone trends', 'averaging kernels', 'trend detection', 'atmospheric composition']",Louis Rivoire;Marianna Linz;Jessica L. Neu;Pu Lin;Michelle L. Santee,Satellite nadir-viewing geometry affects the magnitude and detectability of long-term trends in stratospheric ozone,"The recovery of the ozone hole since the 1987 Montreal Protocol has been observed in some regions but has yet to be seen globally. We ask how long it will take to witness a global recovery. Using a technique akin to flying a virtual satellite in a climate model, we find that the degree of confidence we place in the answer to this question is dramatically affected by errors in satellite observations. 
 The continued monitoring of the ozone layer and its long-term evolution leans on comparative studies of merged satellite records. Comparing such records presents unique challenges due to differences in sampling, coverage, and retrieval algorithms between observing platforms, all of which complicate the detection of trends. Here we examine the effects of broad nadir averaging kernels on vertically resolved ozone trends, using one record as an example. We find errors as large as 1 % per decade and displacements in trend profile features by as much as 6 km in altitude due to the vertical redistribution of information by averaging kernels. Furthermore, we show that averaging kernels tend to increase (by 10 %–80 %, depending on the location) the length of the record needed to determine whether trend estimates are distinguishable from natural variability with good statistical confidence. We conclude that trend uncertainties may be underestimated, in part because averaging kernels misrepresent decadal to multidecadal internal variability, and in part because the removal of known modes of variability from the observed record can yield residual errors. The study provides a framework to reconcile differences between observing platforms and highlights the need for caution when using records from instruments with broad averaging kernels to quantify trends and their uncertainties."

O'Brien,"A new metrics framework for quantifying and intercomparing atmospheric rivers in observations, reanalyses, and climate models","A metrics package designed for easy analysis of atmospheric river (AR) characteristics and statistics is presented. The tool is efficient for diagnosing systematic AR bias in climate models and useful for evaluating new AR characteristics in model simulations. In climate models, landfalling AR precipitation shows dry biases globally, and AR tracks are farther poleward (equatorward) in the North and South Atlantic (South Pacific and Indian Ocean). 
 We present a new atmospheric river (AR) analysis and benchmarking tool, namely Atmospheric River Metrics Package (ARMP). It includes a suite of new AR metrics that are designed for quick analysis of AR characteristics via statistics in gridded climate datasets such as model output and reanalysis. This package can be used for climate model evaluation in comparison with reanalysis and observational products. Integrated metrics such as mean bias and spatial pattern correlation are efficient for diagnosing systematic AR biases in climate models. For example, the package identifies the fact that, in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6) models, AR tracks in the South Atlantic are positioned farther poleward compared to ERA5 reanalysis, while in the South Pacific, tracks are generally biased towards the Equator. For the landfalling AR peak season, we find that most climate models simulate a completely opposite seasonal cycle over western Africa. This tool can also be used for identifying and characterizing structural differences among different AR detectors (ARDTs). For example, ARs detected with the Mundhenk algorithm exhibit systematically larger size, width, and length compared to the TempestExtremes (TE) method. The AR metrics developed from this work can be routinely applied for model benchmarking and during the development cycle to trace performance evolution across model versions or generations and set objective targets for the improvement of models. They can also be used by operational centers to perform near-real-time climate and extreme event impact assessments as part of their forecast cycle."

However, their roles in the association between fetal growth and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure remain unclear. In this study, the levels of 34 PFAS, IGF1, and insulin were measured in 258 paired mother–infant serum samples collected from a nested case–control study in Maoming city. Isomeric perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) exposure significantly increased the preterm birth or low birth weight (PTB/LBW) risk, and the odds ratios for ∑2m, 3+4+5m, iso, and branched PFOS were 1.50, 1.72, 1.61, and 1.77, respectively.

These organisms can cause a serious problem in, for example, the offshore oil industry, due to the production of sulfide. Thus, it is of fundamental and practical importance to identify potent and selective inhibitors of SRB. In this study, neutral red was identified as a previously unrecognized selective inhibitor of SRB, with several orders of magnitude higher potency than most commonly used industrial biocides and inorganic oxyanions. Neutral red remained a potent inhibitor of SRB growth under fermentative conditions and was tolerated by nitrate-reducing bacteria. After 30 days of exposure to 14.2 μM neutral red, the sulfidogenesis activity of SRB-enriched biomass was reduced by 98.3%, and the abundance of SRB populations declined from 25.5% to 0.76%. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the inhibition of the central sulfate reduction pathway was implicated in the mechanism of neutral red toxicity against SRB growth. Furthermore, downregulation of two electron transport complexes (QmoABC and DsrMKJOP), ATP synthase, as well as cytoplasmic/periplasmic hydrogenase suggested the collapse of the proton gradient. These findings have implications for environmental control of SRB and may enhance economic benefits in industrial operations."

However, the consequences of prolonged exposure to environmentally relevant chlorine concentrations on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) evolution and its driving mechanism in bacteria remain unclear. Therefore, this study utilized a combination of phenotypic and genotypic analyses, revealing that chlorination at concentrations of 0.2–0.4 mg/L induced enduring cross-resistance to both chlorine and multiple antibiotics (β-lactams, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and chloramphenicol) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 3 days of exposure. Both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa exhibited outer membrane (OM) damages, evidenced by adenosine triphosphate and reactive oxygen species, though P. aeruginosa displayed stepwise OM resilience over prolonged exposure. Transcriptomic analyses of resistant P. aeruginosa unveiled heightened metabolic activity and a reinforced OM barrier after exposure. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis highlighted the pivotal role of a fortified bacterial OM, featuring activated efflux systems and modified lipopolysaccharides, in developing cross-resistance. Overexpression and mutation in mexXY–OprM and muxABC–OpmB efflux systems, along with reduced membrane electronegativity, confirmed that hereditary genetic adaptation drove AMR evolution.

We present new fluvial incision‐rate histories and terrain analyses of the Colorado River system through the central Colorado Plateau to understand what has caused the variable erosion across this post‐orogenic landscape. Results from new cosmogenic and luminescence dating of fluvial terrace and upland gravel deposits in Glen and Meander Canyons establish incision‐rate histories that are marked by an Early‐Middle Pleistocene erosion hiatus, followed by ∼200 m of rapid incision over the last ∼350 kyr. Projection of fluvial topography from above knickzones of the Colorado River drainage system roughly agree with the observed magnitude of recent incision and reflect a common baselevel fall from Pliocene river integration through Grand Canyon, which is still propagating through the drainage. A response‐time model indicates that baselevel fall from integration likely took 2–4 Myr to reach the central Colorado Plateau and 100s kyr to travel across the study area, potentially accounting for incision rate changes in the fluvial terrace records of Meander and Glen Canyons. The upstream‐migrating incision has likely been partitioned into multiple waves across the landscape due to the local geologic controls of lava damming, salt tectonics, and heterogenous bedrock. As baselevel fall from Pliocene Colorado River integration diffuses upstream, it can only account for perhaps a quarter of the total ∼2 km of exhumation in the central Colorado Plateau, demanding an unknown driver for significant erosion in the Pliocene."

While it is widely recognized that Eo may increase in a warming climate, recent studies have reported a diminished increase in the global water vapor since ∼2000s, raising doubts about recent changes in Eo. Using satellite observations, here we show that while global Eo strongly increased from 1988 to 2017, the upward trend reversed in the late 2000s. Since then, two‐thirds of the ocean have experienced weakened evaporation, leading to a slight decreasing trend in global‐averaged Eo during 2008–2017. This suggests that even with saturated surface, a warmer climate does not always result in increased evaporation. The reversal in Eo trend is primarily attributed to wind stilling, which is likely tied to the Northern Oscillation Index shifting from positive to negative phases.

Using multiple ocean CO2 data products and an advanced ocean biogeochemical model, we identified significant asymmetries in ocean carbon magnitude, spatial distribution, and duration in the tropical Pacific Ocean. La Niña enhances ocean CO2 outgassing (0.1–0.2 PgC/yr) with a broader poleward extension (15°S–15°N) for up to 3 years, while El Niño reduces outgassing (0.2–0.4 PgC/yr) with a narrower poleward extension (10°S–10°N) for up to 1 year.

Accurate ship emission inventories are the key for developing pollution control strategies, but simulating the operating power of a ship under different navigational conditions is a challenge in ship emission estimation. Here, to improve the accuracy of the traditional power model and to establish framework for ship emissions in the port area, an improved load factor‐based power model considering the impact of hull shape on the ship's resistance was proposed and applied to estimate the ship pollutant emissions. A series of data preprocessing methods were constructed based on automated identification system (AIS) high‐precision measured data, including filling gaps and outliers, identifying vessel's operating mode with geofencing, and assigning fuel information by navigation area. The proposed power model and the AIS data preprocessing method were applied to estimate the ship pollutant emissions within Qingdao Port, China, in 2020.

While past research has focused on the regional driver, this study reveals a novel co‐occurrence phenomenon between the northwest Pacific (NWP) and northwest Atlantic (NWA) during summer seasons (JJAS) from 1982 to 2022. We find significant correlations in MHW occurrence and intensity across these regions using three independent SST data sets. Concurrent high‐pressure anomalies, reducing cloud cover and enhancing net shortwave radiation, are identified as the key driver of this co‐occurrence. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) emerges as the large‐scale modulator. During negative PDO phases, tropical Pacific cooling weakens the meridional temperature gradient and westerlies around 30°N, inducing anomalous easterlies and subtropical high pressure. The Coriolis effect steers these easterly anomalies southward, generating anomalous southerlies and upper tropospheric convergence, ultimately triggering strong mid‐latitude subsidence. This co‐occurrence of high pressure and subsidence leads to reduced cloud cover, and amplified net shortwave radiation, driving rapid SST warming and the observed co‐occurring MHWs in the NWP and NWA. Our North Pacific pacemaker experiment successfully replicates these PDO‐induced features, including anomalous easterlies, high‐pressure systems, and vertical motions in the subtropics, providing strong support for the proposed mechanisms.

This analysis demonstrates that while regional ammonia levels are largely controlled by known terrestrial anthropogenic sources, lacustrine surfaces with an emission potential of only 200 increase summertime (July–September) monthly average ammonia (NH3) levels by 5%–8% over the largest regional urban centers, with daily increases of up to 10%–20%. Supplemental water measurements collected from within 1 km offshore of the Greater Toronto Area were found to have an emission potential of 2000, suggesting that lacustrine emissions offshore of large urban areas could be significantly larger than those predicted by GEM‐MACH.

The cloud top pressure in most cloud areas near the center of Lekima is around 140 hPa, whereas in some rainbands far from the center is approximately 700 hPa. A high correlation in horizontal distributions of all‐sky TB simulations with relative vorticity fields during the 24‐hr period of WRF model forecasts suggests a potential relationship between dynamic and thermodynamic variables. The farther from the center of Lekima, the greater the proportion of high‐wavenumber structures within both TB and relative vorticity fields. Within the radius of maximum wind speed, the azimuthal wavenumbers 0, 1, and 2 shown in TB and relative vorticity fields have greater comparability.

We selected two mega‐cities with contrasting profiles: more developed Wuhan in central and less developed Guiyang in southwest China. Urban PM2.5 in both cities exhibited an ε123Sb value of 1.84 ± 0.79‱, with a distinct seasonal pattern, that is, heavier isotopes in spring/winter and lighter in summer/autumn. Isotopic source apportionment revealed waste incineration as the predominant anthropogenic Sb source in PM2.5 for both cites at 34.0–39.1%, despite their massive economic and industrial differences. Brake wear emerged as the second major anthropogenic source, especially in Wuhan, where vehicle ownership is greater, accounting for 21.2%. Complementary analyses using enrichment factor, elemental ratios, positive matrix factorization modeling, and backward trajectory analysis corroborated the isotopic findings. This study offers a novel isotopic approach to identify PM2.5‐bound Sb sources, unveiling waste incineration and brake wear as major anthropogenic contributors from a new isotopic perspective."

While the chemical reactions carried out by these enzymatic domains are well defined, how the dimeric FASN with an open architecture continuously catalyzes such reactions to synthesize a complete fatty acid remains elusive. Here, using a strategy of tagging and purifying endogenous FASN in HEK293 for single particle cryogenic electron microscopy studies, we characterized the structural dynamics of endogenous human FASN. We captured the conformational snapshots of various functional substates in the condensing cycle and developed a procedure to analyze particle distribution landscape of FASN with different orientations between its condensing and modifying wings. Together, we reveal that FASN function does not require large rotational motion between its two major functional domains during the condensing cycle, and that the catalytic reactions in condensing cycle carried out by two monomers are unsynchronized.

 The three-dimensional folding of chromosomes is essential for nuclear functions such as DNA replication and gene regulation. The emergence of chromatin architecture is thus an important process during embryogenesis. To shed light on the molecular and kinetic underpinnings of chromatin architecture formation, we characterized biophysical properties of cohesin and CTCF binding to chromatin and their changes upon cofactor depletion using single-molecule imaging in live developing zebrafish embryos. We found that chromatin-bound fractions of both cohesin and CTCF increased significantly between the 1000-cell and shield stages, which we could explain through changes in both their association and dissociation rates. Moreover, increasing binding of cohesin restricted chromatin motion, potentially via loop extrusion, and showed distinct stage-dependent nuclear distribution. Polymer simulations with experimentally derived parameters recapitulated the experimentally observed gradual emergence of chromatin architecture.

Here they show that heparan sulfate plays essential roles in lung myofibroblasts to maintain MAPK signaling and the alveolar niche. 
 Postnatal respiration requires bulk formation of alveoli that produces extensive surface area for gas diffusion from epithelium to the circulatory system. Alveolar morphogenesis initiates at late gestation or postnatal stage during mammalian development and is mediated by coordination among multiple cell types. Here we show that fibroblast-derived Heparan Sulfate Glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG) is essential for maintaining a niche that supports alveolar formation by modulating both biophysical and biochemical cues. Gli1-CreER mediated deletion of HS synthase gene Ext1 in lung fibroblasts results in enlarged and simplified alveolar structures. Ablation of HS results in loss of a subset of PDGFRαhi αSMA+ alveolar myofibroblasts residing in the distal alveolar region, which exhibit contractile properties and maintain WNT signaling activity to support normal proliferation and differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells. HS is essential for proliferation while preventing precocious apoptosis of alveolar myofibroblasts. We show that these processes are dependent upon FGF/MAPK signaling and forced activation of MAPK/ERK signaling partially corrected alveolar simplification and restored alveolar myofibroblast number and AT2 cell proliferation in HS deficient mice. These data reveal HS-dependent myofibroblast heterogeneity and function as an essential orchestrator for developing alveolar niche critical for the generation of gas exchange units. The alveoli of the lung are formed through the coordination of multiple cell types to yield a large surface area for gas exchange. Here they show that heparan sulfate plays essential roles in lung myofibroblasts to maintain MAPK signaling and the alveolar niche."

 Finding suitable characterizations of quantum chaos is a major challenge in many-body physics, with a central difficulty posed by the linearity of the Schrödinger equation. A possible solution for recovering non-linearity is to project the dynamics onto some variational manifold. The classical chaos induced via this procedure may be used as a signature of quantum chaos in the full Hilbert space. Here, we demonstrate analytically a previously heuristic connection between the Lyapunov spectrum from projection onto the matrix product state (MPS) manifold and the growth of entanglement. This growth occurs by squeezing a localized distribution on the variational manifold. The process qualitatively resembles the Cardy-Calabrese picture, where local perturbations to a moving MPS reference are interpreted as bosonic quasi-particles. Taking careful account of the number of distinct channels for these processes recovers the connection to the Lyapunov spectrum. Our results rigorously establish the physical significance of the projected Lyapunov spectrum, suggesting it as an alternative method of characterizing chaos in quantum many-body systems, one that is manifestly linked to classical chaos. Recent work explored the connection between quantum thermalization in closed many-body systems and classical chaos by projecting quantum dynamics onto classical dynamics.

Here, the authors show that chimpanzees, like humans, tailor their exploration depending on their environment. 
 Exploration is an important strategy for reducing the uncertainty that pervades daily life. Yet the evolutionary roots of adaptive exploration are poorly understood. We harness and adapt the human decisions-from-experience paradigm to investigate exploration under uncertainty in chimpanzees. In our study, chimpanzees (N = 15; eight females) are simultaneously confronted with an uncertain option (with outcome variance) and a safe option (without outcome variance) and tested in both stable and changing environments. Results reveal that, as in human exploration, how and how much chimpanzees explore depends on the environment. One key environmental property is change: Chimpanzees explore more across trials in changing than in stable conditions. Consistent with the assumption of classic economic models that variance indicates risk, chimpanzees also explore more when they experience variance in the options’ outcomes. Individual risk and uncertainty preferences did not have a statistically significant effect on exploratory efforts. These findings suggest that chimpanzees and humans share key similarities in the way they respond to risk and uncertainty. Exploration helps reduce uncertainty in daily life, but the evolutionary roots of adaptive exploration are unclear.

Here, the authors show that a recurrent neural network that controls its output using error-based feedback can learn to counteract a persistent perturbation using a biologically plausible plasticity rule, recapitulating key neural and behavioural features of motor adaptation. 
 Animals use feedback to rapidly correct ongoing movements in the presence of a perturbation. Repeated exposure to a predictable perturbation leads to behavioural adaptation that compensates for its effects. Here, we tested the hypothesis that all the processes necessary for motor adaptation may emerge as properties of a controller that adaptively updates its policy. We trained a recurrent neural network to control its own output through an error-based feedback signal, which allowed it to rapidly counteract external perturbations. Implementing a biologically plausible plasticity rule based on this same feedback signal enabled the network to learn to compensate for persistent perturbations through a trial-by-trial process. The network activity changes during learning matched those from populations of neurons from monkey primary motor cortex — known to mediate both movement correction and motor adaptation — during the same task. Furthermore, our model natively reproduced several key aspects of behavioural studies in humans and monkeys. Thus, key features of trial-by-trial motor adaptation can arise from the internal properties of a recurrent neural circuit that adaptively controls its output based on ongoing feedback. How the brain adapts our movements to new conditions remains unclear.

 Populations of many migratory taxa have been declining over recent decades. Although protected areas are a cornerstone for conservation, their role in protecting migratory species can be incomplete due to the dynamic distributions of these species. Here, we use a pan-European citizen science bird occurrence dataset (EurobirdPortal) with Spatiotemporal Exploratory Modelling to assess how the weekly distributions of 30 passerine and near passerine species overlap with protected areas in Europe and compare this to range adjusted policy protection targets. Thirteen of our 30 species were inadequately covered by protected areas for some, or all, of the European part of their annual cycle under a target based on the 2020 Convention on Biodiversity framework and none were adequately covered under a target based on the 2030 Convention on Biodiversity framework. Species associated with farmland had the lowest percentage of their weekly distribution protected. The percentage of a species’ distribution within protected areas was positively correlated with its long-term population trend, even after accounting for confounding factors, suggesting a positive influence of protected areas on long-term trends. This emphasises the positive contribution that an informed expansion of the European protected area system could play for the future conservation of migratory land birds.

Raymond,Warming-induced retreat of West Antarctic glaciers weakened carbon sequestration ability but increased mercury enrichment,"This study reveals that Holocene warming and glacial retreat in West Antarctica reduced carbon sequestration but enhanced mercury burial in Ross Sea sediments, suggesting future warming could further accelerate carbon loss and mercury accumulation. 
 The Southern Ocean, one of Earth’s most productive areas, is widely recognized as a major sink for atmospheric carbon and mercury, tightly coupling primary production with the sedimentary sequestration of these elements. The impacts of climate warming on these processes, however, remain unclear. Here, we utilize 20 sediment cores from the Ross Sea, a representative ice-shelf sea in West Antarctica, to examine how Holocene warming and extensive glacial retreat influenced carbon and mercury sequestration. We find that organic carbon (OC) burial has been relatively constant over the past 12,000 years, whereas mercury burial in the Ross Embayment and open ocean exhibited three- and eightfold increases, respectively. Carbon isotopes and accumulation profiles suggest warming boosted glacial- and terrestrial-derived OC inputs to the ocean, while trace elements and biomarkers reveal a declining contribution offshore. Biomarker ratios further indicate greater remineralization of this OC in the open ocean. Consequently, enhanced OC degradation, coupled with rising external mercury inputs, drives mercury enrichment in marine sediments before reaching the seafloor. These findings imply that ongoing warming could trigger a positive feedback loop, accelerating OC degradation into CO2 and amplifying the impacts of anthropogenic mercury on Southern Ocean ecosystems.

We use statistical models based on 1.2 million stream nutrient measurements (from 2005 to 2013) and find global human enrichment of river total nitrogen and total phosphorus is 35% and 14% respectively. The greatest enrichment is in Europe (86 and 30% respectively) and the least in Oceania (9 and 2% respectively). The levels of enrichment translated into an almost doubling of the catchment areas with rivers predicted to have anthropogenically elevated levels of potentially harmful or nuisance algae, affecting ~40% of the world’s population.

Here, we investigate this type of ocean forcing the atmosphere by analysing several high- and low-resolution coupled climate models, ocean observations and reanalyses products of ocean and atmosphere. We find that in observations and about 50% of the coupled climate models, an ocean-forced negative North Atlantic Oscillation occurs at a lag of 5 years after the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation peaks. Climate models with a strong cold temperature bias in the subpolar gyre and a positive sea-ice cover bias in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean are unable to correctly simulate the heat flux pattern, resulting from the northward propagation of warm ocean temperatures, that forces the atmosphere.

 Non-destructive methods are widely used for field measurement of leaf area index (LAI). However, the above-ground woody components of trees and shrubs, i.e., trunks and branches, largely affect the measured gap fraction, thus hindering the accurate measurement of LAI. Many efforts have been made to correct for the woody component effect and estimate LAI, but there is a lack of research to systematically compare and analyze current methods, which mainly include: 1) correcting using woody-to-total area ratio (α), 2) transforming the leaf-on images into leaf-only images using artificially selected thresholds to determine whether woody components blocked leaves (TRM method), and 3) establishing the regression relationship between LAI and image features and/or other measured parameters using random forests (RFRM method) or 4) neural networks (NNRM method). We used rich data generated from 4734 scenes and 39 tree species to compare and analyze these methods. Additionally, considering the problems with the existing methods and the increasing requirements of LAI measurement, we proposed a new method (P2PLAI) using an image-to-image translation neural network (i.e., Pixel2Pixel) to transform the leaf-on images into leaf-only images. The effective LAI (LAIe) was estimated using the translated leaf-only images, and then the LAIe was converted into LAI using the clumping index. The results showed that the traditional method using α was limited by the accuracy of the α estimation, with the RMSE from 0.34 to 0.92 and the absolute percentage error (Bias%) from 9.56 % to 22.29 %. The TRM method could not stably and accurately transform the leaf-on images and underestimated LAI, with the RMSE from 0.13 to 0.78 and Bias% from 3.39 % to 21.13 %. The regression methods (i.e., RFRM and NNRM) had strong limitations since the accuracy of these two methods was related to the tree species and viewing zenith angles (VZAs) with RMSE up to 3.12 and Bias% up to 84.74 %. The P2PLAI method achieved the best agreement with the reference LAI. The RMSE and Bias% of P2PLAI respectively ranged from 0.05 to 0.26 and from 1.27 % to 7.70 % and were not influenced by tree species and VZAs. This study cautions against applying regression methods such as RFRM and NNRM for the indirect measurement of LAI in forests due to the complicated structures of vegetation components.

 Several methods were developed in Ocean Colour remote sensing over the last 25 years to model the anisotropy of the upwelling radiant field with respect to observation and solar-illumination geometries, also denoted as bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). These methods are necessary to produce normalized, or “BRDF-corrected,” marine reflectance representative of the seawater's inherent optical properties (IOPs) independently of the measurement conditions. Each scheme relies on specific modeling assumptions and implementation solutions, which can lead to different results depending on the actual combination of the seawater IOPs with the illumination and viewing geometry. The first aim of this study is to analyze the principles and methods of the reference BRDF schemes presented by Morel et al. (denoted as M02), Park and Ruddick (P05), Lee et al. (L11), He et al. (H17), and Twardowski and Tonizzo (T18). Acknowledging the direct applicability of M02, P05, and L11, their performance has been verified under a variety of conditions, including in situ measurements, matchup observations, and space-borne images. Comparisons between non-corrected and normalized data clearly confirm the need to account for the BRDF effect. In particular, the analysis of the results indicates 1) a substantial equivalence of M02, P05, and L11 in clear waters and 2) the tendency to obtain better results with M02 and L11 as the optical complexity increases. Although M02 was conceived for Case 1 waters, the underlying Chlorophyll-a overestimation tendency in some optically complex conditions is likely the reason for its extended applicability. Since L11 is based on a more comprehensive and flexible framework for all water types, the design of this method is suggested for revisions and BRDF correction improvements."

 Reservoir landslides are the focus of geohazards associated with mega hydropower projects and have been extensively studied by monitoring their post-impoundment deformation. However, how landslide deformation changes before, during, and after impoundment is rarely known. Using satellite radar interferometry, we map 200 active landslides with their time-series deformation spanning the impoundment of Baihetan, the second-largest hydropower project globally. We define the amplitude of seasonal fluctuation (ASF) to analyze the impact of rainfall and water level on seasonal landslide velocities before and after impoundment. Interestingly, although landslides are overall accelerated, a reduction in seasonal fluctuation is apparent after the impoundment. We argue that the project elevated water levels during the dry season, only promoting landslide motion when they were kept stable before impoundment. We also find the 32 newly formed landslides are more likely to develop on slopes with structures related to river flow direction, emphasizing the role of the raised water in triggering new landslides.

 Fueled by both terrestrial and marine inputs, estuaries worldwide are important biogeochemical reactors, strongly susceptible to natural and anthropogenic, episodic, or compounding disturbances. Satellite sensors provide a unique vantage point to capture estuarine processes at scales not feasible with in situ sampling alone; yet, remote sensing retrievals of estuarine biogeochemical dynamics remain challenging. Here, we developed new algorithms for high spatial resolution satellite retrievals of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)—two key indicators of estuarine water quality and biogeochemical state. CDOM algorithms were optimized for Long Island Sound—one of the world’s most heavily urbanized estuaries—and included retrievals of CDOM absorption at 300 nm (aCDOM(300)), a proxy for CDOM amount, as well as absorption spectral slope in the 275–295 nm range (S275-295), a proxy for CDOM quality.

 Remote sensing observations of green vegetation (GV), impervious surface (IS), and bare soil (BS) fractional cover are essential for understanding climate change, characterizing ecosystem functions, monitoring urbanization process. As an important indicator of urbanization, the continuous increase of impervious surfaces alters the radiative transfer process at the surface, causing a series of environmental problems. Therefore, timely and accurate monitoring of the spatial and temporal changes in impervious surfaces and their impact on the ecological environment is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the process of urbanization as well as for the planning and construction of future cities. This study aims to propose a generalized method for the accurate estimation of GV, IS, and BS coverage. In this study, the visible impervious surface index (VISI), (Br-Bg)/(Br+Bg), was developed using measured spectral data of GV, IS, and BS, and analyzing their spectral characteristics to determine the spectral bands where they can be distinguished. Furthermore, the VISI combined with the NDVI was utilized to establish a triangular space for linear unmixing of the satellite image data to estimate the coverage of its GV, IS, and BS.

 Forest type classification is essential for the monitoring and management of forests, with significant implications for environmental protection and the mitigation of climate change. However, challenges such as multiscale variations, heterogeneous boundaries, mountainous terrain, and unbalanced data sets hinder progress. This study aims to improve forest type classification through three approaches: (1) Multimodal geospatial data fusion; (2) transfer learning using the ImageNet 22K dataset to improve accuracy and address class imbalances; (3) a novel Gated Graph Convolution Neural Network (GGCN). Experiments were conducted at two study sites with varying tree species, management strategies, and climates. The results indicated that very high-resolution aerial photographs outperform open-source Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets. The fusion of the original remote sensing bands with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) feature demonstrates the best composition across all datasets. This approach, which combines the original Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands with the EVI, significantly improves the performance of open-source remote sensing data sets. It provides a cost-effective alternative to expensive high-resolution images, which is particularly beneficial for rural areas and global applications. Furthermore, utilizing ImageNet 22K transfer learning improved accuracy in addressing class imbalances. The GGCN effectively preserved multiscale and spatial features at both study sites. In general, this integrated approach shows promising potential for achieving high precision in large-scale forest type classification."

 Glacial lakes are vital indicators of climate change, offering insights into glacier dynamics, mass balance, and sea-level rise. However, accurate mapping remains challenging due to the detection of small lakes, shadow interference, and complex terrain conditions. This study introduces the U-ViT model, a novel deep learning framework leveraging the IBM-NASA Prithvi Geo-Foundation Model (GFM) to address these issues. U-ViT employs a U-shaped encoder–decoder architecture featuring enhanced multi-channel data fusion and global-local feature extraction. It integrates an Enhanced Squeeze-Excitation block for flexible fine-tuning across various input dimensions and combines Inverted Bottleneck Blocks to improve local feature representation. The model was trained on two datasets: a Sentinel-1&2 fusion dataset from North Pakistan (NPK) and a Gaofen-3 SAR dataset from West Greenland (WGL). Experimental results highlight the U-ViT model’s effectiveness, achieving an F1 score of 0.894 on the NPK dataset, significantly outperforming traditional CNN-based models with scores below 0.8. It excelled in detecting small lakes, segmenting boundaries precisely, and handling cloud-shadowed features compared to public datasets. Notably, the U-ViT demonstrated robust performance with a 50% reduction in training data, underscoring its potential for efficient learning in data-scarce tasks. However, its performance on the WGL dataset did not surpass that of DeepLabV3+, revealing limitations stemming from differences between pre-training and input data modalities.

 As global urbanization intensifies, conflicts between humans and urban infrastructure increasingly affect socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Recently, using image data and deep learning to investigate the interactions between humans and urban infrastructure has been a popular approach since the fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the convergence of data fusion, deep learning, and human-urban infrastructure interaction studies remains underexplored. Here we systematically analyze 3,552 papers from 2013 to 2023 that use image data to investigate the intersection area of data fusion, deep learning, and human and urban infrastructure interactions, aiming to elucidate the relationships among these three key elements. We found that the cross-applications of deep learning in the papers reviewed are not standardized. Given the trend of diversified data fusion, data fusion about real-world dynamic interactions is scarce. Lastly, four potential future research directions are identified: (1) understanding the dynamic and complex interaction processes; (2) exploring the potential and standards for the application of deep learning; (3) focusing more on research concerning cities in the Global South; (4) establishing suitable training datasets for the interaction between urban infrastructures and humans, which may provide valuable insights for applying foundation models in future urban studies."

 Solving geospatial tasks generally requires multiple geospatial tools and steps, i.e., tool-use chains. Automating the geospatial task solving process can effectively enhance the efficiency of GIS users. Traditionally, researchers tend to design rule-based systems to autonomously solve similar geospatial tasks, which is inflexible and difficult to adapt to different tasks. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), some research suggests that LLMs have the potential for intelligent task solving with their tool-use ability, which means LLMs can invoke externally provided tools for specific tasks. However, most studies rely on closed-source commercial LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4, whose limited API accessibility restricts their deployment on local private devices. Some researchers in the general domain proposed using instruction tuning to improve the tool-use ability of open-source LLMs. However, the requirement of tool-use chains to solve geospatial tasks, including multiple data input and output processes, poses challenges for collecting effective instruction tuning data. To solve these challenges, we propose a framework for training a Geospatial large language model to generate Tool-use Chains autonomously (GTChain). Specifically, we design a seed task-guided self-instruct strategy to generate a geospatial tool-use instruction tuning dataset within a simulated environment, encompassing diverse geospatial task production and corresponding tool-use chain generation. Subsequently, an open-source general-domain LLM, LLaMA-2-7B, is fine-tuned on the collected instruction data to understand geospatial tasks and learn how to generate geospatial tool-use chains. Finally, we also collect an evaluation dataset to serve as a benchmark for assessing the geospatial tool-use ability of LLMs. Experimental results on the evaluation dataset demonstrate that the fine-tuned GTChain can effectively solve geospatial tasks using the provided tools, achieving 32.5% and 27.5% higher accuracy in the percentage of correctly solved tasks compared to GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro, respectively."

 Over the past few decades, global warming has significantly impacted permafrost regions, reflecting the amplification in Arctic temperature changes. To better understand climate variability and the changes in permafrost regions, in this study, we examined the changes in the surface air temperature (SAT) in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia, Russia) from 1971 to 2022. The data from 18 meteorological stations were considered to assess the SAT trends, percentage change (PC), and dominant periodic components across the region. Additionally, the trends of the snow depth (SD) and energy budget components (EBCs), including the net radiation (NR) and latent and sensible heat (LH and SH, respectively), were investigated to elucidate the possible reasons for the SAT trends. The results confirmed a significant increase in the SAT at all stations at both the monthly and seasonal timescales. The monthly SAT trends ranged from 0.002 °C/month to 0.007 °C/month, with considerable variations in the autumn and spring seasons. The dominant periodicity components that affected the SAT monthly trends were the 16- and 32-month across all the stations. For individual seasons, the 4- and 8-year periodic components were identified as the most dominant periodic components to affect the SAT, EBC, and SD trends. Our study can serve as a foundation for future investigations on the changes in dominant periodic components and energy budgets in subarctic regions due to global warming, thereby supporting the ongoing efforts toward climate change mitigation."

 The West Sumatra region experienced devastating floods and landslides due to intense rainfall on March 7–8, 2024, with precipitation ranging from 200 to 394 mm/day exceeding the extreme rainfall threshold of 150 mm/day. We investigated the atmospheric dynamics to understand the mechanisms underlying this event. We used satellite data from Himawari-8 and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and ground-based observations to analyze cloud development and rainfall distribution. Wind velocity, Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT), Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), Convective Inhibition (CINH), K-Index, Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux Convergence (VIMFC), and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from ERA5 reanalysis datasets are used to analyze convective instability and identify Equatorial waves. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was employed to assess moisture transport. Our findings indicate that extreme rainfall was driven by the Mesoscale Convective System (MCS), as confirmed by cloud observations from Himawari-8. Further analysis revealed that moisture convergence, intensified by a Westerly Wind Burst (WWB) from the Indian Ocean, interacted with local topography and atmospheric circulations over West Sumatra. This interaction was associated with an active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in Phase 4, strengthening the westerly winds, transporting moisture and fueling convection. Before the event, MJO activity in Phase 3 over the Indian Ocean coincided with an atmospheric Kelvin wave, intensifying low-level convergence, enriching the Indian Ocean region with moisture, and transporting it to West Sumatra via the WWB. The interplay of the MJO, WWB, and Kelvin waves likely amplified the event. This study provides insights into the atmospheric processes behind this event and highlights their importance in developing early warning systems for future events."

Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction.

Antoni;Richard Goddard;Max M. Hansmann,Spiro-C(sp3)-atom transfer: Creating rigid three-dimensional structures with Ph2SCN2,"The introduction of a single C-atom into organic substrates typically results in the formation of flat molecules containing unsaturated C(sp)-centers. Adding a single C(sp3)-atom surrounded by four σ-C–C bonds, which opens up the three-dimensional space, is an unresolved problem in synthetic chemistry. We report the synthesis and application of the diazosulfur ylide Ph2S=C=N2reagent that combines the reactivity of both sulfur ylides and diazo compounds to create carbon spiro-centers in a general fashion by the sequential or single-step installation of a C(sp3)-atom. New C–C and C–X (where X is O or N) bonds can be created around the C(sp3)-atom, which can ultimately be extended to four C–C σ-bonds in one step without resorting to transition metal catalysis. Ph2SCN2can also be used to access highly strained frameworks containing (oxa)spiro[2.2]pentanes as well as tricyclic spiro-compounds."

Sykes,Nickel promotes selective ethylene epoxidation on silver,"Over the last 80 years, chlorine (Cl) has been the primary promoter of the ethylene epoxidation reaction valued at ~40 billion USD per year, providing a ~25% selectivity increase over unpromoted silver (Ag) (~55%). Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O2) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O2on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity."

We address these challenges by using an extrusion-based 3D printing technique to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials. Our ink formulations ensure the integrity of the 3D-printed structure and effective particle bonding during sintering, achieving record-high figure of merit (zT) values of 1.42 for p-type bismuth antimony telluride [(Bi,Sb)2Te3] and 1.3 for n-type silver selenide (Ag2Se) materials at room temperature. The resulting TEC demonstrates a cooling temperature gradient of 50°C in air. Moreover, this scalable and cost-effective method circumvents energy-intensive and time-consuming steps, such as ingot preparation and subsequently machining processes, offering a transformative solution for thermoelectric device production and heralding a new era of efficient and sustainable thermoelectric technologies."

Hawkes,Material-like robotic collectives with spatiotemporal control of strength and shape,"The vision of robotic materials—cohesive collectives of robotic units that can arrange into virtually any form with any physical properties—has long intrigued both science and fiction. Yet, this vision requires a fundamental physical challenge to be overcome: The collective must be strong, to support loads, yet flow, to take new forms. We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight."

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations."

Here, we show that language models trained at scale on evolutionary data can generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to alignment to improve its fidelity. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at a far distance (58% sequence identity) from known fluorescent proteins, which we estimate is equivalent to simulating 500 million years of evolution."
