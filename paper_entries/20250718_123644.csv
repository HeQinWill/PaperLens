Tropical dry forests (TDFs), in particular, are key ecosystems for unraveling the mechanisms driving phenological dynamics, given their crucial role in biodiversity conservation and carbon balance. Although phenological research has advanced rapidly in recent decades in tandem with new methodological innovations, TDFs remain underrepresented. Consequently, the extent to which recent approaches have improved our understanding of leaf changes is still poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of phenology in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) in the Neotropics using Web of Science and Scopus databases up to December 2024. We aimed to synthesize methodological advances, environmental drivers, and functional traits related to phenology, providing insights about mechanisms underlying phenological shifts in Neotropical SDTFs. We documented a significant expansion in phenology research in Neotropical SDTFs over the last decade, with a concentration of studies in South America, particularly Brazil, followed by Central America. Despite these advances, long-term studies remain scarce, limiting our ability to detect interannual variability and long-term trends. The integration of high-resolution monitoring tools, such as phenocameras, has enhanced data collection across spatial and temporal scales, improving our ability to track phenological changes. Furthermore, plant functional traits such as wood density and leaf characteristics associated with deciduousness are key for understanding drought adaptation strategies in dry forests. Given the strong dependence of SDTFs phenological patterns on climate variability, predictive models that incorporate phenological observations, plant functional traits, and climate data will be further crucial for refining our understanding of adaptive mechanisms and improving forecasts of vegetation responses in dry forests. By highlighting research gaps and future directions, this synthesis provides a foundation to improve conservation efforts and climate resilience assessments in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems."

Ziemke;Mark Weber,Intercomparison of tropospheric ozone column datasets from combined nadir and limb satellite observations,"Tropospheric ozone affects air quality and climate, being a pollutant and a greenhouse gas. We analyze satellite data of tropospheric ozone columns obtained by combining two types of observations: one providing stratospheric and the other total ozone. We compare common climatological features and study the influence of the tropopause (troposphere to stratosphere boundary) on the results. We also examine trends over the last 20 years and compare satellite data with ozonesondes to identify drifts. 
 This paper presents an intercomparison between existing tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) datasets obtained using combined limb and nadir observations, i.e., exploiting collocated stratospheric profile and total column information retrieved from limb and nadir satellite observations, respectively. In particular, seven datasets have been considered, covering the past 2 decades and consisting of monthly-averaged time series with nearly global coverage. We perform a comparison in terms of climatology and seasonality, investigate the tropopause height used for the construction of each dataset and the related biases, and finally discuss long-term TrOC drifts and trends. The overall goal of the study is to assess the consistency between the datasets and explore possible strategies to reconcile the differences between them. Despite uncertainties associated with the limb–nadir residual methodology and large biases between the mean values of the considered datasets, we identify an overall agreement of TrOC distribution patterns. The different tropopause height definitions used to construct the datasets did not show a relevant role in explaining the biases between them. We demonstrate that a thorough investigation of the drifts with respect to ground-based observations is needed to evaluate TrOC trends from satellite data and that long-term trends in specific regions can be consistently detected, e.g., a positive trend of up to 1.5 DU per decade over China for the 2005–2021 period."

The optimal COP for liquid water cloud is parameterized in terms of effective diameter (Deff) and the COP for ice cloud developed by the Space Science and Engineering Center, with Deff for ice cloud parameterized in terms of ice water content and temperature. The findings will benefit the remote sensing and data assimilation community. 
 Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) is a commonly used forward-operator software package for the data assimilation (DA) of satellite visible  reflectance data. However, the wide choice of cloud optical parameterizations (COPs) in RTTOV poses challenges in discerning the optimal configuration. In this study, the performance of different COPs was evaluated by comparing the observed and synthetic visible satellite images. Observed images (O) were provided by Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) and Himawari-9, two operational geostationary meteorological satellites covering East Asia. Synthetic images (B) were generated by RTTOV (v12.3) with the discrete ordinate method (DOM) and the Method for FAst Satellite Image Simulation (MFASIS). The inputs to RTTOV were provided by the 3 h forecasts of the China Meteorological Administration Mesoscale (CMA-MESO) model and the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5) data. On average for the domain, B was smaller than O, especially in cloudy situations. The minimum O−B bias was revealed for the COP of liquid water clouds in terms of effective diameter (Deff) in combination with the COP of ice clouds developed by the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC), with the Deff for ice clouds parameterized in terms of ice water content and temperature. Compared with the O−B biases, the standard deviations of the O−B departure were less sensitive to COPs. In addition, histogram analysis of reflectance indicated that the synthetic images with the minimum O−B bias resembled the observed images best. Therefore, the optimal cloud optical parameterization was proposed to be the “Deff + SSEC” suite."

The OLIGOTREND database comprises multi-decadal chlorophyll a and nutrient time series from rivers, lakes, and estuaries with 4.3 million observations from 1894 unique measurement locations. The database provides empirical evidence for oligotrophication responses with a spatial and temporal coverage that exceeds previous efforts. 
 Reversed eutrophication, called oligotrophication, has been widely documented globally over the last 30 years in rivers, lakes, and estuaries. However, the absence of a comprehensive and harmonized dataset has hindered a deeper understanding of its ecological consequences. To address this data gap, we developed the OLIGOTREND database, which contains multi-decadal time series of chlorophyll a, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and related physicochemical parameters, totalling 4.3 million observations. These data originate from 1894 unique monitoring locations across estuaries (n = 238), lakes (687), and rivers (969). Most time series cover the period from 1986–2022 and comprise at least 15 years of chlorophyll a observations. Each location is associated with catchment and hydroclimatic attributes. Trend and breakpoint analyses were applied to all time series. Chlorophyll a showed temporally variable and ecosystem-specific responses to nutrient declines with an overall declining trend for 18 % of the time series, contrasting greatly with a majority of declining trends for nutrient concentrations. We harmonized the database to ensure reproducibility and ease of access and support future updates and contributions. Available at https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a7ad060a4dbc4e7dfcb763a794506524 (Minaudo and Benito, 2024), the OLIGOTREND database supports collaborative efforts aimed at further advancing our understanding of biogeochemical and biological mechanisms underlining oligotrophication and ecological impacts of global long-term environmental change."

 The Global Heat Flow Database is a comprehensive data compilation on published heat-flow measurements dating back to the 1950s. The International Heat Flow Commission first released the database in 1963. Recent activities within the World Heat Flow Database Project (funded by the DFG German Research Association) and the Task Force VIII of the International Lithosphere Program (ILP) have focused on (1) developing a new, modern digital data infrastructure with integrated quality control of the data, (2) creating a new dedicated metadata scheme for reporting heat-flow data, (3) conducting a comprehensive review of the original literature to supplement the original metadata according to the new scheme, and (4) thoroughly adding new measurements from the literature. As a result, the 2024 release presents a substantial update, with the number of heat flow observations increasing from 58,302 data points in 2012 to 91,182 in 2024, while the number of literature sources simultaneously increased from 572 to 1,586 documents. A key part of this process was the introduction of a new, comprehensive metadata scheme and the development of the GHFDB Data Template, which facilitates the structured and detailed reporting of heat flow observations in accordance with the new scheme. The GHFDB Data Template captures methodological details, uncertainty estimates, and contextual information, forming the basis for a newly implemented, multi-dimensional quality-assessment system. The improved data submission workflow, now supported by the option of obtaining digital object identifier (DOI), making the newly submitted data citable in literature, as is increasingly required by journals. This service encourages direct contributions from researchers and ensures transparency, attribution, and long-term data stewardship by the partner repository GFZ Data Services. The new heat flow database release marks a significant step towards establishing a global, quality-assured data infrastructure and lays the foundation for more reliable, reusable, and interoperable heat-flow datasets across scientific disciplines."

An integrated hourly charging behavior optimization model for charging costs or emissions relying on a large carsharing reservation database is showcased for Switzerland, revealing a strong trade-off between electricity prices and CO2 emissions. Price-responsive electric charging reduces charging costs by 27% compared to emission-responsive charging, which reduces e-mobility-related CO2 emissions by 82%. Introducing a dynamic carbon tariff could make emission-responsive charging economically rational, resulting in an average carbon price of EUR 0.3/kg CO2-equivalent. Although carsharing hinders battery charging at times of low emissions and requires increased overnight charging, carsharing only leads to minimal differences in operational costs or charging emissions compared to privately owned cars. However, a large-scale shift to battery electric vehicles requires energy system adjustments to meet the additional electricity needs from e-mobility. For complete electrification of private cars by 2050 in Switzerland, an additional curtailment, storage or import capacity of 1.3 TWh for the most critical winter month is required for individual car ownership and an additional 1.0 TWh for shared e-mobility."

The work reported two different LBL membranes prepared with pairs of long-chain polyelectrolytes (PVAm/PSS, L/L) and short-chain polyelectrolytes (S/S) for analysis of the impact of PFAS adsorption on removal. Both L/L and S/S membranes showed high Na2SO4 rejection (99.9%) and PFAS removal rates in the range of 73.6∼98.8%. A strong positive correlation between the PFAS removal rate and molecular dimensions suggested size exclusion as the main separation mechanism. After filtration, the pore size of both membranes decreased and the surface zeta potential became more negative. The adsorption of PFAS in the S/S membranes was significantly greater than that of the L/L membranes; electrostatic interaction of PFAS with positively charged overcompensated PVAm was the key contribution. The adsorption of PFAS in the S/S membranes caused increased MgCl2 rejection and reduced Na2SO4 rejection. Contrary PFAS adsorption behavior in PEC and LBL membrane suggested PVAm overcompensation varied with the assembly process.

Herein, an acid-modified Zr-MOF, UiO-67, supported Pd catalyst was synthesized and optimized as an example to explore the influence mechanism of impurity gases (H2O and CO) on o-xylene degradation intermediates. It was found that the impurity gases had a great influence on the generation of Cl-containing byproducts, which formed due to the presence of residual Cl in the frameworks. Meanwhile, the influence mechanism was experimentally and theoretically studied. It was revealed that the introduction of H2O weakened the formation of energy barriers for Cl-containing byproduct generation, resulting in the spontaneous generation of Cl-containing byproducts. Conversely, the addition of CO improved the energy barrier of the Cl-containing byproduct formation rate-determined step, chlorine addition reaction (*C6H3CH3CH3 + Cl → *C6H3ClCH3CH3, *C6H4CH3CH2 + Cl → *C6H4CH3CH2Cl), inhibiting Cl-containing byproducts formation.

However, achieving direct oxidation removal of Hg0 in a reducing atmosphere at ambient temperature presents a significant challenge. In this study, we designed a Cu-doped OMS-2 sorbent, synthesized with citric acid (CA) assistance, which demonstrated exceptional Hg0 removal performance in simulated natural gas at ambient temperature. The sorbent achieved 97.0% Hg0 removal efficiency under a space velocity of 72 × 104 h–1 when the CA ratio was 0.05. As a carboxyl-rich organic complexing and reducing agent, CA promoted the introduction and dispersion of Cu ions, thereby forming more Mn–O–Cu units. The resulting charge transfer of Mn–O–Cu units further facilitated oxygen vacancy (Ov) formation and lattice oxygen (Olatt) activation, promoting the transformation of gaseous H2S into polysulfide (Sn2–) species. The accumulation of electrons around active Sn2– groups accelerated electron transfer with Hg0 via an Eley–Rideal mechanism.

Metabolomic profiling identified 8 unique metabolites and 812 metabolomic features (FDR < 0.05) associated with bAs (predominantly AsV), and 66 metabolites and 285 metabolomic features with %uAs (predominantly %uInAs). Metabolic pathways enriched for bAs and %uAs were similar, highlighting phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. A FA-induced %uInAs change was associated with four metabolites, three of which share links to acetyl-CoA metabolism. Of 11 measured OCM metabolites, cystathionine was positively associated with all bAs species. Methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cysteine, choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine were associated with increased As methylation profiles in urine (FDR < 0.05).

Metal oxide-mediated hydrolysis of contaminants under limited surface moisture conditions has attracted increasing attention due to its similarity to the natural soil environment. While the nonaqueous catalytic hydrolysis mechanisms differ significantly among varying metal oxides, this warrants further investigation to gain a new understanding of these processes. In this study, the nano-ZnO, exposed to atmospheric humidity conditions, exhibited strong surface basicity (pH > 9.0). It performed extremely strong catalytic hydrolysis activity on chloramphenicol (CAP) antibiotic, achieving a half-life of 3.3 h at the optimal surface moisture content (∼2.9 wt %), which is 7–347 times faster than previously reported acid-catalytic processes by other minerals. A novel nonaqueous catalytic hydrolysis mechanism is proposed, namely, the hydrogen-bond-assisted base catalysis by synergistic effects of surface lattice oxygen and ≡Zn–OH.

In this study, we explored epitranscriptomic-driven metabolic reprogramming using keratinocyte transformation models established by environmentally relevant arsenite exposure. Our results identified an elevated intracellular taurine concentration as a metabolic reprogramming hallmark of arsenite-induced transformation of keratinocytes, which was validated in mouse models and human samples. Upregulated taurine transporter SLC6A6 facilitated taurine uptake, promoting the arsenic-induced transformation. Mechanically, SLC6A6-mediated taurine uptake enhanced oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase II (MT-CO2), supporting the energy requirements of the arsenic-induced transformation. Notably, this taurine uptake also enhanced MT-CO2-dependent copper utilization, thereby sensitizing arsenite-transformed keratinocytes to copper-dependent and oxidative-phosphorylation-driven metabolic cell death, known as cuproptosis. Furthermore, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase METTL3 catalyzed m6A modifications at multiple sites on SLC6A6 mRNA, promoting the stability and translation of SLC6A6 mRNA by recruiting m6A binding protein YTHDF1 during arsenite-induced transformation. In conclusion, our results suggest that taurine uptake, mediated by m6A-methylated SLC6A6, promotes arsenite-induced malignant transformation while enhancing sensitivity to cuproptosis in arsenite-transformed keratinocytes. This study reveals novel RNA epigenetic mechanisms driving arsenic-induced transformation through metabolic reprogramming, offering valuable insights for environmental health risk assessment and potential intervention strategies."

However, their specific role in the development of adverse health effects related to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we used both mouse models and cultured cells to document their role in the development of pulmonary inflammation due to exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP), the main component of urban PM2.5. The results revealed that DEP induced pulmonary inflammation as well as an acute phase response in the lung and liver within 24 h, which gradually diminished over the subsequent week. Depletion of alveolar macrophages alleviated the DEP-induced pulmonary inflammation and acute phase response. Furthermore, this study showed that Msr1 may be the primary receptor responsible for the phagocytosis of DEP in macrophages, while the PIP2-mediated nonbiological phagocytic signaling pathway appeared to be nonsignificant. All of the results in the present study reveal the key role of alveolar macrophages in DEP-induced pulmonary inflammation, enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions among DEP, alveolar macrophages, and inflammatory responses."

However, the enantioselective fate and effects of chiral paclobutrazol in the soil ecosystem are still unclear. In this study, systemic assessments of dissipation dynamics, transformation products (TPs) and pathways, and interactions between soil microorganisms and related metabolites are first carried out using suspect and nontarget screening, high-throughput sequencing, and soil metabolomics. The dissipation half-lives of R- and S-paclobutrazol were 30.7 and 40.7 d, and interconversion between the two enantiomers occurred in soils. Nine previously unreported TPs were identified, and one was synthesized and confirmed with an authentic standard. Aerobic degradation pathways of R- and S-enantiomers were proposed, showing enantioselective degradation. 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing results showed that both R- and S-enantiomers increased bacterial diversity but decreased fungal diversity and disrupted microbial symbiosis networks’ complexity. Chiral paclobutrazol enantioselectively and significantly changed the soil metabolite spectrum. Integrated analyses revealed a strong association between microorganisms and certain metabolite expressions.

However, the understanding of its long-term compositional changes and responses to natural and anthropogenic factors remains limited, and few atmospheric radiative modeling studies have specifically examined the distinct contributions of char-BC and soot-BC components. In this study, we trace the compositional changes of BC over the past ∼500 years using sediments from Huguangyan Maar Lake, China and separately quantify the impacts of char-BC and soot-BC on the RF of atmospheric BC. Our findings reveal that the proportion of soot-BC in BC has increased by 2.5 times since 1950 CE. In earlier periods, wildfires driven by the East Asian summer monsoon were the primary contributors to the dominance of char-BC in BC. However, the contribution of human activities to the rise in soot-BC has progressively increased from approximately 10% around 1950 CE to 80% by around 2010 CE, significantly altering BC composition and leading to a 5-fold increase in atmospheric BC RF. These results suggest that ongoing human activities will likely continue to alter BC composition and the atmospheric radiative balance, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing BC components in atmospheric models."

Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), long-lived in particulate matter, may promote HONO formation via reactions with NO2, although the mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, the heterogeneous formation of HONO was explored through reactions between NO2 and diesel soot collected during a field campaign, focusing on the role of EPFRs. EPFRs in diesel soot, primarily composed of carbon-centered radicals (CCRs) within the elemental carbon (EC), were present at 5.40 × 1018 ± 9.60 × 1018 spins·m–3. The combination of CCRs in EC with NO2 to form surface nitro compounds (RONO) was initially observed and served as the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, the photolysis of carboxyl compounds (ROOH) in organic carbon (OC) generated •OH, which reacted with RONO to enhance HONO formation. Gradient RH experiments revealed that H2O facilitates HONO formation by enhancing NO2 adsorption or acting as an •OH donor. The results indicate that, in typical urban environments, besides HCHO photolysis, EPFRs in diesel soot significantly contribute to HONO formation, playing a major role in •OH production with a rate of ∼106 molecules·cm–3·s–1 at RH 40–60% under vehicle-related EPFR concentrations (∼1013 spins·m–3, observed in Xi’an, China).

In this study, we hypothesized that cosmetics may contain previously unidentified thyroid-disrupting chemicals. To evaluate this possibility, we compiled a comprehensive data set of cosmetic ingredients and developed a random forest regression-based machine learning model to predict their potential to disrupt thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ), a critical regulator of thyroid function. From the top 40 compounds ranked by the model, 12 frequently used cosmetic ingredients were selected for experimental validation. Of these, six demonstrated measurable binding affinity toward TRβ. Notably, Vat Blue 6 (VB6), a colorant utilized in cosmetic formulations, exhibited structural characteristics potentially mimicking thyroid hormones and displayed potent TRβ binding with an affinity (Kd) as low as 0.7 μM. Subsequent in vitro assays and in vivo experiments in mice confirmed VB6’s thyroid-disrupting effects, evidenced by dose-dependent reductions in serum thyroid hormone concentrations and morphological alterations of thyroid tissue.

To this end, we first attempted to enrich Ca. N. nitrosa in a laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank reactor fed with mainstream-level ammonium. Following the 40 d operation, a suite of microbial analyses jointly confirmed the unprecedentedly rapid specific enrichment and absolute dominance of Ca.

Associations between PFASs and LTL were analyzed by using general linear regression. Both multiplicative interaction terms and stratified analyses were used for the assessment of the modification effects. Serum perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUDA) were negatively associated with LTL. A doubling of PFDA or PFUDA levels led to a significant decrease in LTL [percent change (95% CI): −1.55 (−2.82, −0.27); −1.61 (−3.01, −0.19), respectively]. Significant associations of PFAS exposure and PGS with LTL were observed in those with a low healthy diet score.

All PSNPs aggregated in inflammatory artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF), whereas bare- and carboxyl-modified PSNPs remained stable in healthy Gamble’s solution (GS) and modified GS (MGS). Aggregation of PSNPs in ALF and GS followed the classical Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory, while steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding between PSNPs and the lung surfactant governed the aggregation in MGS. Furthermore, redundancy analysis indicated that the aggregation of PSNPs reduced oxidative stress and membrane damage to bacteria in lung fluids. Specifically, amino-modified PSNPs, which aggregated in GS, could induce sustained oxidative stress, damage the cell membrane of native pulmonary bacteria, and promote the release of pyoverdine from pathogenic bacteria up to 2.16 times. Moreover, the aging process significantly enhanced the toxicity of PSNPs on pulmonary bacteria. These findings enhance our understanding of the behavior and toxic effects of nanoplastics on humans."

However, GUV222 also generates ozone (O3), posing human health risks and initiating additional photochemistry that may degrade indoor air quality. Air cleaners present an opportunity to counteract the drawbacks of GUV222 by removing harmful byproducts; however, to our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated. Here, we conduct laboratory experiments in a 7.5 m3 Teflon chamber using two commercially available air cleaners─a manganese-oxide-catalyst “ozone cleaner” and an activated-carbon-HEPA “volatile organic compound (VOC) + particulate matter (PM) cleaner”─each simultaneously with a GUV222 lamp. We show that both cleaner types remove a wide range of key pollutants, including O3, NO2, formaldehyde, VOCs, and particles. Application of chamber results to a photochemical model simulating chemistry in a 150 m3 room suggests that a single cleaner can achieve modest reductions in O3 levels and substantial reductions in secondary pollutant levels within typical indoor environments. These results indicate that indoor air pollutants from GUV222 can be mitigated through the use of air cleaning technology, thereby improving indoor air quality while maximizing the potential benefit of germicidal UV for human health."

While activity‐based (“bottom up”) emission estimates are widely used for global cities, they often lack independent verification. In this study, we use remotely‐sensed CO2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐3 (OCO‐3) to “top‐down” estimate CO2 emissions for 54 global cities. This global‐scale analysis is enabled by a computationally efficient cross‐sectional flux approach, which uses NO2 observations from TROPOMI and trajectory simulations from HYSPLIT to identify OCO‐3 pixels influenced by urban plumes. Our satellite‐based emission estimates for 54 global cities agree within 7% to two widely used bottom‐up data sets but reveal regional discrepancies. Bottom‐up estimates tend to overestimate emissions for cities in Central East Asia and South and West Asia, while underestimating emissions in Africa, East and Southeast Asia & Oceania, Europe, and North America. Additionally, our satellite‐based socioeconomic analysis shows that (a) high‐income cities tend to have less carbon‐intensive economies: North American cities emit 0.1 kg CO2 per USD of economic output, while African cities emit 0.5 kg CO2 per USD, and (b) per capita emissions decrease with increasing population size, from 7.7 tCO2/person for cities under 5 million residents to 1.8 tCO2/person for cities over 20 million residents. This study highlights the potential of satellite data to bridge gaps between top‐down and bottom‐up emission estimates, enhancing the robustness and transparency of emissions monitoring. Our findings emphasize the growing role of satellite data in verifying urban CO2 emissions and supporting efforts to mitigate emissions for global cities."

While Tibetan Plateau snow cover (TPSC) has been linked to Arctic sea‐ice variability, the spatiotemporal stability of this relationship remains unclear. In this study, combing satellite observations and snow experiments, we identified a shift in connections between TPSC and Barents‐Kara Seas sea‐ice around 1990. Before 1990, a positive dipole TPSC pattern (eastern enhanced/western reduced snow cover) induces Arctic anticyclonic anomalies through a circumglobal wave train. These anomalies facilitate polar vortex splitting, enhancing moisture transport and solar radiation over the northern Kara Sea, which accelerates sea‐ice reduction. Conversely, post‐1990, a positive monopole TPSC pattern (positive snow anomalies on the entire Tibetan Plateau) strengthens the polar vortex, suppressing Barents Sea (BS) moisture and solar radiation, thereby promoting sea‐ice growth.

Here, we use a thermodynamic systems approach, and show that DTR primarily reflects changes in lower atmospheric heat storage, governed by diurnally constrained non‐latent energy input from the surface into the atmospheric boundary layer. This approach predicts DTR across a range of climates, reproduces its day‐to‐day variations, and explains its decline with rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. We show that in addition to strong controls exerted by radiation and cloud cover, DTR carries imprints of surface water stress during the water‐limited evaporative regime. Our expression yields a mean reduction of 0.23°C in DTR per 1°C rise in temperatures, in response to changes in GHG forcings.

We find that VMM operates on a wider range of temporal scales than previously thought.

Each of the first three (higher‐altitude) collisions was associated with luminosity waves originating from the collision point, including an upward reflection‐type wave along the colliding leader channel and one or more transmitted waves along the residual branches of the preceding stroke. Based on the estimated extension speeds and RF field signatures, we attributed the transmitted luminosity waves to dart‐stepped leaders developing in shorter segments of the decayed channel. As a result of the last collision, at a height of 90 m above ground level, a branch of the Stroke 2 leader entered the lower part of the residual (nonluminous) Stroke 1 channel and connected to the ground, producing a return stroke. Additionally, the heavily branched Stroke 2 leader created a ground termination about 950 m away from its ground termination common with Stroke 1. We observed four X‐ray pulses of unknown origin with peaks ranging from 130 to 750 keV during a 3.5‐ms or so interval around the time of the higher‐altitude collisions during the leader stage of Stroke 2, but no detectable X‐ray pulses during the leader stages of Strokes 1 and 3.

However, delivering these materials to the stratosphere at the required altitudes (18–25 km) poses practical challenges. Here, we evaluate a novel delivery method called solar‐powered lofting (SPL), inspired by self‐lofting during extreme wildfires. SPL coinjects a small amount of black carbon (BC) with SO2 at lower altitudes accessible to commercial aircraft (∼13 km), allowing the SO2 to self‐loft into the stratosphere. Using the Community Earth System Model, we compare SPL simulations with traditional SAI simulation that injects equivalent SO2 mass at 20 km at the same locations, but without BC.

BC induces an additional 1.5 K annual mean warming in the tropical stratosphere, raising stratospheric water vapor by 0.42 ppm. The coinjected BC accounts for 20% of the annual mean temperature and water vapor anomalies. Furthermore, the BC strengthens the polar vortex and enhances the Brewer‐Dobson circulation. As a result of the changes in dynamics and chemistry, the coinjected BC results in a 5% increase in Antarctic ozone depletion in October.

While ARs were thought to peak in winter, recent research shows they exhibit region‐specific seasonality and are heavily influenced by the chosen detection algorithm. This study examines the link between the year‐to‐year consistency of peak‐AR activity to the presence of a dominant seasonal pattern, considering both location and algorithm choice. Regions are categorized by their temporal characteristics: consistent patterns (e.g., East Asia), patterns with occasional outliers (e.g., British Columbia coast), and regions lacking a clear dominant peak season (e.g., South Atlantic, parts of Australia). Hence, not all regions display a consistent seasonal cycle of AR activity. This study quantifies the extent to which a region experiences a dominant peak season of AR activity (or lacks one) and offers insights to enhance decision‐making in water management, natural hazard preparedness, and forecasting. Furthermore, given our finding that detection algorithms influence the peak season of AR activity, we also examine two diagnostic variables representative of moisture transport to corroborate our results. Integrated vapor transport, which captures meridional and zonal moisture transport, and Moist Wave Activity, representing moisture intrusions from lower to higher latitudes, are examined. Our analysis indicates that inconsistencies in the seasonal cycle of AR activity are not solely due to discrepancies in detection algorithms but also arise from changes in moisture transport."

Our findings suggest that the combined influence of local SST warming and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events can account for a substantial portion of historical meridional SST gradients (SSTG) in the Bay of Bengal (BOB), and thus contribute to the ISMR anomalies over Central India, Northeast India, and the northwestern GMS. The meridional SSTG in the BOB exert oceanic feedback on the atmosphere by modulating anomalous planetary boundary layer winds via the sea level pressure adjustment mechanism, vertical momentum mixing mechanism, and the thermal wind mechanism. The evolution of deep convection aligns with that of the meridional SSTG, thereby intensifying the downward transport occurred over the BOB north of 15°N and the upward transport occurred over the near‐equator BOB. Both the temperature and pressure anomalies contribute to the anomalous easterlies at 850 and 500 hPa, and thus leads to the significant weakening of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Numerical experiments provide robust evidence supporting the proposed modulating influence of the meridional SSTG on the reduction of ISM rainfall over the BOB.

 Climate change has significantly increased adverse effects on human health, and economic growth1–3. However, few studies have differentiated the impacts of extreme temperatures at the city level, and analysed the future implications for human health under various climate change scenarios.4–6 Here, data on historical relationship among six kinds of climate-sensitive diseases (CSD) hospitalizations and temperatures across 301 cities (over 90% of all cities) and more than 7,000 hospitals in China are leveraged, and a nonlinear distributed lag model is used. This study projects hospitalization risks associated with extreme temperatures through to the year 2100 and develops the Hospitalization Burden Economic Index to assess the burden under three carbon emission scenarios in cities. Five dimensions including spatial distribution, disease categories, population age groups, future time horizons, and carbon emission development pathways have been evaluated. Historical data specifically indicate more temperature-related risks among the CSDs in northwestern and southwestern China. Notably, gestation-related disease risk is associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat in specific regions. The projections reveal that, under current thermal conditions with no adaptations, the excess hospitalizations from extreme heat will reach 5.1 million people by 2100 under the high emission scenario.These findings highlight the need for targeted climate change mitigation strategies to reduce uneven climate-related hospitalization risks and economic burdens while accounting for differences in city geography, extreme temperatures, population groups and carbon emission development pathways."

 Atmospheric aerosols are an important component of the Earth’s climate system and contribute substantial uncertainties to predictions of future climate change. In the southeast Atlantic, where expansive light-absorbing smoke aerosol plumes overlie semi-permanent stratocumulus clouds, the direct aerosol radiative effect (DARE) induces warming, but the magnitude of this effect varies widely among climate models. Thus, it is essential to improve estimates based on observations to help constrain model uncertainties. However, the impact of the observed cloud diurnal cycle on DARE remains unclear. Here we quantify DARE using radiative transfer modelling based on hourly satellite observations of clouds focusing on the region 20° S–0° and 10° W–15° E. We find that accounting for the observed cloud diurnal cycle over the southeast Atlantic, rather than assuming a constant early-afternoon cloud field throughout the entire day, results in a more than twofold increase (+1.7 ± 0.4 W m−2) in the regional mean aerosol radiative warming. The increase in DARE results from morning hours when cloud fractions and optical depths are higher. Neglect of the cloud diurnal cycle adds to the underestimated radiative warming in the southeast Atlantic associated with underestimated aerosol absorption among climate models. Future observations-based estimates of aerosol climatic effects need to account for the cloud diurnal cycle. Accounting for the diurnal cycle in low clouds more than doubles estimated aerosol radiative warming in the southeast Atlantic, according to radiative transfer modelling and satellite observations."

 Quantifying climate sensitivity is essential for future climate projections, yet it varies with major Earth system changes. We present a glacial CO₂ reconstruction using paleosols from the Chinese Loess Plateau, covering 2580 to 800 thousand years ago. A stepwise decline in glacial CO₂ levels from ~300 ppm to <200 ppm is observed. Our paleosol-based CO₂ estimates support the key role of atmospheric CO₂ in driving major climate transitions during the Pleistocene, such as the long-term global cooling and the amplification of the glacial cycles. Based on compiled glacial and interglacial CO2 records, Earth system sensitivity, defined as the global temperature change for a doubling of CO2 once the whole Earth system has reached equilibrium, is estimated to be ~6.2–7.4 K (3.2–12.0 K, 95% confidence). Equilibrium climate sensitivity, after accounting for the different efficacy between ice-sheet and CO2 forcing and other slow feedbacks, is estimated to be 3.3 K (2.1–6.3 K, 95% confidence) and 3.7 K (1.7–6.3 K, 95% confidence), respectively.

 Macrophages play vital roles in innate and adaptive immunity, and their functions are mediated via phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Despite the effort to identify phagocytic checkpoints and explore their mechanism of action, current checkpoint-scanning strategies cannot provide a complete and systematic list of such immune checkpoints. Here, we perform in vitro phagocytosis assays using primary healthy donor macrophages co-cultured with breast cancer cells followed by ribosome profiling of sorted macrophages, to identify immune system-specific checkpoints. We observe a downregulation of CD37 in phagocytic macrophages and demonstrate that targeting CD37 with a specific antibody promotes the phagocytosis of multiple cancer cells in vitro. Mechanistically, tumorous macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) directly binds to CD37, promoting the phosphorylation of CD37Y13 and activating a transduction cascade that involves the recruitment of SHP1 and inhibition of AKT signaling, ultimately impairing phagocytosis. In vivo, targeting CD37 promotes tumor clearance in multiple preclinical mouse models and synergizes with anti-CD47 therapy. Thus, our study identifies a previously unidentified phagocytic checkpoint and provides new potential for precise therapy. Cancer cells evade the immune system by disrupting phagocytic clearance.

 Traditional wearable ultrasound devices pose challenges concerning the rigidity and environmental impact of lead-based piezoelectric materials. This study proposes a silicon nanocolumn capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (snCMUT) array for real-time wearable ultrasound imaging in disposable patches. Using a lead-free design, snCMUT incorporates silicon nanocolumns to address existing issues and achieves high transmission efficiency (220 kPa/V), flexibility, and low power consumption.

 Somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons modulate hemodynamic responses both directly and indirectly, but their precise role remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of SST interneurons on hemodynamic control in response to optogenetic stimulation of SST neurons and somatosensory stimulation in both awake and anesthetized mice. Prolonged optogenetic stimulation of SST neurons induces fast vasodilation through nitric oxide synthase-expressing neurons that co-express SST, and slow vasodilation mediated by astrocytes. Similar neurovascular coupling mechanisms are observed during prolonged sensory stimulation, which also induces both fast and delayed vasodilation. The delayed vasodilation, mediated by the SST neuron-astrocyte pathway, enhances the specificity of cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted fMRI signals to cortical layer 4, as confirmed by chemogenetic inhibition of SST neurons. Our findings indicate that the SST neuron-astrocyte-vascular pathway shapes hemodynamic responses to prolonged stimulation and is critical for achieving high-specificity, laminar-resolution fMRI, which is increasingly pursued in human cognitive studies.

 Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output."

 The decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter (ROM) in seagrass litter plays a crucial role in mediating blue carbon magnitude. However, the mechanisms underlying ROM decomposition in seagrass litter under eutrophication, driven by anthropogenic pressures, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of eutrophication on the decomposition of two types of seagrass litter (leaf and sheath) through laboratory experiments adding nitrogen and macroalgae. We found that macroalgae addition inhibited ROM breakdown in leaves and sheaths. Nitrogen addition enhanced ROM decomposition in leaves by 4% while suppressing it in sheaths compared to the treatments without nitrogen addition. Additionally, the combined addition of nitrogen and macroalgae led to a more substantial loss of sheath ROM (35-39%) compared with macroalgae alone. The opposite response of ROM breakdown in leaf and sheath under nitrogen addition were co-regulated by litter quality and bacteria taxa (i.e., Flavobacteriales, Actinomarinales, and Phycisphaerales). In the presence of macroalgae, fungi, including Lecythophora luteoviridis, Tyrannosorus hystrioides, and Pseudeurotium_ovale, were found to play a significant role in the decomposition of leaf ROM, but not in sheath decomposition. These findings highlight the negative effects of eutrophication on litter ROM sequestration and the important role that litter quality and microbe play.

 We report unequivocal evidence of seagrasses preserved in radiometrically constrained sediments (20.5 Ma) from Patagonia (Gaiman Formation), substantially extending their known palaeogeographic distribution. The new morphospecies Thalassotaenia notophyllum sp. nov. was erected based on well-preserved leaf blades that exhibit characters phylogenetically close to the genus Thalassia (Hydrocharitaceae), today distributed predominantly in tropical regions. Exquisitely preserved epibionts—diatoms, bryozoans, polychaetes, and coralline algae—occurred on these Miocene leaves, indicating that seagrass-dominated ecosystems were well established at high South American latitudes. Our finding implies that average sea surface temperatures in Patagonian coastal waters during the early Miocene were substantially warmer than today. The warm conditions are also supported by the presence of marine and terrestrial palynomorphs recovered from the seagrass-bearing sediments. Since seagrass ecosystems rank amongst the most important natural carbon sinks on earth, our discovery from Patagonia provides evidence that the wider past extension of seagrasses may have had a more important role in the Cenozoic carbon cycle than previously thought.

 Important aspects concerning the origin and formation of the Moon’s exosphere, its tenuous gas envelope, remain puzzling with uncertainties regarding the importance of different effects. Two competing processes — micrometeoroid impact vaporization and solar wind ion sputtering — are considered key contributors to the ejection of particles into the exosphere.

We find solar wind sputter yields up to an order of magnitude lower than previously used in exosphere models.

Our results provide critical, experimentally validated sputter yield estimates and address long-standing modeling uncertainties. These results are particularly timely in light of upcoming and ongoing missions, such as the Artemis program at the Moon or BepiColombo at Mercury, contributing essentially to our understanding of how the surfaces of rocky bodies in the solar system are altered. Sputtering yields from solar wind exposure on lunar regolith are up to an order of magnitude lower than expected from prior modeling and calculations, according to laboratory-based experiments on real lunar Apollo samples and advanced 3D simulations"

 The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) posits that higher spectral diversity indicates higher biodiversity, which would allow imaging spectroscopy to be used in biodiversity assessment and monitoring. However, its applicability varies due to ecological and methodological factors. Key methodological factors impacting spectral diversity metrics include spatial resolution, shadow removal, and spectral transformations. This study investigates how these methodological considerations affect the application of the SVH across ecosystems and sites. Using field and hyperspectral data from forest and open (e.g., wetland, grassland, savannah) ecosystems from five sites of the Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory (CABO), we analyzed three variance-based spectral diversity metrics across and within vegetation sites, examining the effects of illumination corrections, spatial resolution, and shadow filtering on the spectral-plant functional diversity relationship. Our findings highlight that the relationship between spectral diversity metrics and functional diversity are strongly influenced by methods, especially spectral transformations. These illumination corrections notably impacted the spectral regions of importance and the resulting relationships to plant functional diversity. Depending on methodological choices, we observed correlations that varied not only in strength but also direction: in open vegetation we saw negative correlations when using brightness normalization, and positive correlations when using continuum removal. Shadow removal and spatial resolution were important but had less impact on the correlations. By systematically analyzing these methodological aspects, our study not only aims to guide researchers through potential challenges in SVH studies but also highlights the inherent sensitivity of spectral-functional diversity relationships to methodological choices. The variability and context-dependence of these relationships across and within sites emphasize the need for adaptable, site-specific approaches, presenting a key challenge in developing robust methods to enhance biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies."

 Accurate monitoring of plant nutrient status, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, via remote sensing can facilitate precision forestry, with environmental and management benefits. In previous studies, plant traits derived from hyperspectral data via radiative transfer models (RTMs) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) effectively explained the observed variability in leaf N concentrations in crops. However, their contribution to leaf P concentration is unknown. Furthermore, such an approach might not be transferrable to coniferous stands, which are structurally complex and heterogeneous. We evaluated the potential of using physiological plant traits derived from airborne hyperspectral imagery to explain the observed variability in needle N and P concentrations in Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) with four datasets collected over three years in established nutrient trials. RTM-derived data on pigment content in needles, including chlorophyll a + b (Cab), carotenoid (Car), and anthocyanin contents (Anth), as well as SIF quantified at the O2A absorption band (SIF760), explained variability in N (R2 = 0.67–0.97 and NRMSE = 0.07–0.30) and P concentrations (R2 = 0.60–0.95 and NRMSE = 0.09–0.27) in needles. Although Cab was the most important predictor of needle N concentration (ranking Cab > Anth > SIF760 > Car), SIF760 contributed the most to explain the variability of needle P concentration (SIF760 > Anth > Cab > Car). Moreover, the blue spectral region was essential for assessing P but not for explaining N variability in needles. Among all reflectance-based indices and inverted traits evaluated, the blue indices best explained the variability in needle P concentration, followed by Cab, Car, and Anth. The study revealed the distinct contribution of far-red SIF vs. the blue spectral region for needle P compared to needle N, describing new insights for the physiological assessment of nutrient levels in forest stands using hyperspectral imagery."

 Complete spatial randomness (CSR) describes a fully homogeneous random distribution of species across space, where every location within a study area has an equal probability of hosting individuals. However, previous literature often conflates the roles of the Poisson and uniform distributions in representing CSR. While the homogeneous nature of CSR intuitively suggests a connection to the uniform distribution, it is less clear how the Poisson distribution can achieve this. In this study, we provide a statistical explanation, demonstrating that the Poisson distribution, and the exponential waiting time derived from it, the uniform distribution, and CSR are all mathematically equivalent under the same probabilistic framework. We present interpretations from both a simulation algorithm perspective and a statistical sampling perspective, supported by appropriate statistical reasoning. Our ecology-oriented discussion aims to clarify the conceptual confusion surrounding CSR and establish a coherent link to foundational knowledge in spatial ecology. Ultimately, we hope to deepen ecologists’ and biologists’ understandings of species distribution patterns and support future developments of distributional ecology."

 Continuous winter cover on croplands reduces soil erosion and enhances soil organic carbon, making it essential for climate-smart agriculture and greenhouse gas mitigation. However, spatially and temporally explicit data on winter cropland cover remain limited across Europe. We present a national-scale assessment of winter cropland cover in Germany from 2017 to 2023 using spectral unmixing-derived fractional cover time series from Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. Four winter cover types were distinguished: winter crops, green cover (including cover crops and spontaneous vegetation), residue cover, and no cover (bare soil). Phenological metrics were derived for green cover to assess vegetation duration, biomass accumulation, and termination type.Our results reveal an increasing share of green cover, rising from 17 % in 2017/18 to 21 % in 2022/23, and a decline in bare soil from 20 % to 12 %, indicating a shift toward more protective winter management. Green cover was most frequent in northwestern and southern Germany, while bare soil remained prevalent in central and eastern regions. Classification results showed good agreement with Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) parcel-level records of winter cover crops (F1-Score = 0.68) and agricultural census data at the federal state level (R2 = 0.82, MAE = 5 percentage points). Remote sensing estimates consistently exceeded reported cover crop shares, reflecting the presence of non-subsidized or spontaneous vegetation.

 Rock glaciers are debris landforms formed by long-term creep of ice-rich permafrost. Their kinematics provide critical insights for climate change and permafrost studies, mountain hydrology, and hazard assessment. Previous studies have measured rock glacier velocities using field-based terrestrial geodetic surveys, repeat photogrammetry, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). However, these methods have typically been confined to local regions, leaving the large-scale velocity characteristics underexplored. In this study, we developed a multi-temporal and multi-geometry InSAR framework for systematically generating rock glacier velocity fields. We rigorously validated our approach by comparing the InSAR-derived velocities with those derived from very-high-resolution optical imagery (Pléiades satellite imagery and aerial imagery) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The mean relative difference is approximately 20 % when compared to velocities from Pléiades and aerial images, increasing to 50 % for GNSS point measurements. Applying our method, we produced the first large-scale regional rock glacier velocity dataset, encompassing downslope velocity fields for 19,727 previously inventoried rock glaciers in the Tibet-Pamir-Karakoram region. We found a velocity contrast between different climatic domains: rock glaciers in the westerlies domain move on average faster (median = 30 cm/yr) than those in the monsoon domain (median = 13 cm/yr). Our study presents a methodological framework for assessing rock glacier velocities using InSAR and demonstrates its capability for large-scale applications. This approach can be readily adapted to other regions worldwide to support the assessment and monitoring of rock glacier dynamics in a changing climate."

 Delineating clear scene boundaries in remote sensing images remains a challenge despite their ability to visually present landscapes. This study introduces a novel Scene Boundary Visual Perception (SBVP) method designed to identify scene boundaries in remote sensing images that conform to human visual perception. SBVP first computes the image’s average state as a fundamental unit for perception, guiding upscaling segmentation for initial scene targets and superpixel segmentation for object-level refinement. The hypothesis that the average state of the image scene can effectively guide upscaling segmentation and superpixel segmentation was tested on 16 large-scale remote sensing images with varying spatial resolutions and land cover types. SBVP was compared against eCognition and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and further applied to suspicious target detection and the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries. Experimental results validate the hypothesis, showing that SBVP outperforms eCognition and SAM, achieving a mean IoU of 0.90, representing a 20 % and 23 % improvement over eCognition and SAM, respectively (P < 0.01). Additionally, SBVP effectively detects suspicious targets and enhances the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries. As a simple yet effective approach, SBVP provides an automated solution for identifying scene boundaries that closely conform to human visual perception, offering broad applicability in remote sensing and geographic studies."

 While numerous studies have evaluated precipitation products by comparing them with in-situ observations, the suitability of these products for closing the water balance budget in Africa remains largely unexplored. This study assesses the performance of eight latest precipitation products, namely MSWEP v2.8, CRU v4.07, CHIRPS v2.0, ERA5-Land, CPC, NOAH, IMERG v7, and MSWX v1, in closing the water balance budget over Africa. We begin by assessing the general consistency among these precipitation products using rain-gauge measurements and multiple linear regression analysis, followed by the generalized three-corner-hat (GTCH) method applied to estimate the relative uncertainties and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios of the eight precipitation products, which help identify the potential causes of the water balance non-closure over Africa. To evaluate the suitability for closing the water balance budget, we compare the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO, hereafter GRACE) satellite missions’ derived total water storage changes (TWSC) with those of the water balance equation using each precipitation product. The influence of climate zones and terrain on these evaluations is also examined. The results reveal significant discrepancies in precipitation trends among the eight precipitation products. The GTCH analysis indicates that MSWEP achieves the lowest uncertainties and highest SNR values in most cases, followed by MSWX and CHIPRS. Regarding closing the water balance budget, NOAH exhibits the highest consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC than other products, followed by IMERG, whereas CPC achieved the lowest suitability. The performance of these products appears to be more influenced by climatic regimes than by terrain. All precipitation products indicate approximately 20% non-closure in the water balance budget over Africa, likely due to the underestimation of annual signals, as revealed by the principal component analysis (PCA). This study underscores that utilizing precipitation derived from the same data source as runoff and evapotranspiration demonstrates high consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC data. These findings suggest that precipitation estimates should merge multi-source datasets and consider the water balance budget, which can help reduce uncertainties and provide a more reliable foundation for hydrological studies in Africa."

 This study investigates future projections of the extreme Humidex, a compound index integrating air temperature and relative humidity, as an indicator of heat stress under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5). Using multi-model ensemble simulations from 15 high-resolution CMIP6 models, we examine seasonal variations in the extreme Humidex at both global and regional scales across 21 land regions. The historical simulations from CMIP6 models were validated using ERA5 observational data, ensuring reliability and accuracy in model projections. Additionally, the climatology of Humidex values derived from MME simulations was compared with the climatology of the Heat Index obtained from MME simulations, revealing consistency between the two heat stress indicators. To quantify heat-related hazards, we calculate the number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days (DHDs). Furthermore, we assess the relative contributions of air temperature and relative humidity to projected changes in the extreme Humidex. The results reveal a marked intensification of heat stress under SSP5–8.5, with late-century (2080–2100) increases in the extreme Humidex reaching approximately 5 to 9 °C across most land regions, compared to around 1.5 to 3.5 °C under SSP1–2.6. The JJA season exhibits the greatest intensification, particularly over Eastern North America and Northern Asia. On average, DJF shows a 2.78-fold increase in Humidex anomalies, while JJA demonstrates an even larger amplification of approximately 2.90-fold when transitioning from a low to high-emission scenario. The number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days also increases significantly, with an additional 60 to 80 days during DJF across many tropical and subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere, and more than 80 additional days per JJA season in most tropical regions under the high-emission scenario.

 Evaluating the efficacy of cloud-seeding operations presents a complex challenge in atmospheric science, due to the multifaceted interactions between artificial nuclei, natural cloud processes, and local meteorological conditions. In this study, to assess cloud-seeding effects, several field experiments were conducted at Dongyanshan site (elevation 840 m) in northern Taiwan during northeast monsoon seasons from 2019 to 2022. The experiments utilized hygroscopic cloud seeding, leveraging the site's advantages of well-established instrumentation and a semi-closed, in-cloud environment. Our observational results indicate that the seeding agents can strengthen the competition effect, which causes an increase in liquid water content (LWC) and a decrease in water vapor mixing ratio, as well as the tail effect, which widens the drop size distribution (DSD). This important phenomenon of increased raindrop number concentration after cloud seeding was further confirmed by DSD observations at the upstream neighboring site, Xiayunping (elevation 340 m), where no cloud seeding was executed. Additionally, real-case model simulations were performed to further investigate the microphysical processes of cloud seeding. Simulation results indicate that cloud seeding enhances the cloud activation process (Pcact) while leading to the development of smaller cloud droplets, which decreases the auto-conversion process (Praut) of rain. Concurrently, an intensified accretion process (Pracw) increases raindrop diameter. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cloud seeding, potentially improving the design and implementation of future weather modification strategies in similar atmospheric conditions."

 The increasing demand for freshwater resources has intensified interest in precipitation enhancement technologies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Traditional cloud seeding methods that utilize crewed aircrafts have limitations in terms of safety, cost, and operational flexibility. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer promising complementary platforms by providing enhanced maneuverability, reduced risks, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, UAS can gather in situ high-resolution atmospheric data that are currently inaccessible via remote sensing techniques or crewed aircraft. This article provides a detailed introduction, history of UAS usage, and recent advancements in small UAS for cloud seeding, as well as presents the impacts, challenges, and future prospects. It then examines the different types of aircraft used for cloud seeding and discusses their specifications, functions, and sensors, as well as their pros and cons. Subsequently, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the small UAS used for precipitation enhancement, focusing on the types of small UAS suitable for cloud seeding, onboard equipment and sensors, ground station equipment and software, communication protocols, and methodologies, such as cloud seedability algorithms (CSA), path planning, and control autonomy. The integration of the Rapid Evaluation of Convective Cell Environments for Seeding (RECCES) algorithm built on top of the Lidar Radar Open Software Environment (LROSE) is also discussed for real-time cloud data acquisition and analysis, which are important for UAS cloud seeding missions. Advanced control-and-command communication systems between the UAS and ground stations are discussed, along with the regulatory requirements of the UAS for cloud seeding. The advantages, advancements, and challenges of UAS in precipitation enhancement are highlighted, and future prospects such as swarm technology, advanced sensor integration, centralized autonomy, de-icing technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, regulatory framework development, and environmental and ethical considerations are proposed in detail to pave the way for more efficient and effective UAS-based precipitation enhancement for cloud seeding operations."

In this study, we showed that polyglycine itself forms aggregates that incorporate endogenous glycine-rich proteins, including FAM98B, a component of the transfer RNA (tRNA) ligase complex (tRNA-LC) that harbors the most glycine-rich sequence in the human proteome. Through this glycine-rich intrinsically disordered region (IDR), polyglycine sequesters and depletes the tRNA-LC, disrupting tRNA processing. Accordingly, patient tissues revealed aggregate-associated FAM98B depletion and accumulation of aberrant tRNA splicing intermediates. Furthermore, Fam98b depletion in adult mice caused progressive motor coordination deficits and hindbrain pathology. Our data suggest that the FAM98B glycine-rich IDR mechanistically links previously disparate neurodegenerative disorders of protein aggregation and tRNA processing."

Yet, data on infection rates after these events and the consequences for planning disease control programs remain rare. Data on malaria infection in the wake of major tropical cyclones in Madagascar show that infection is likely to rebound rapidly during the gaps in interventions that occur after extreme events.

However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. We performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5ASB7E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration.

A prevalent hypothesis posits that the Arp8 module within INO80 enables a ruler-like activity. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we show that on nucleosomes with 40 bp of flanking DNA, the Arp8 module rotates 180° away from the DNA. Deleting the Arp8 module enables rapid sliding irrespective of flanking DNA length. Thus, rather than enabling a ruler-like activity, the Arp8 module acts as a brake on INO80 remodeling when flanking DNA is short. This autoinhibition–based mechanism has broad implications for understanding how primitive nucleosome mobilization enzymes may have evolved into sophisticated remodelers."

Despite a host of favorable properties, pyridazine (an analogous C4N2ring) has comparatively lagged behind—a discrepancy attributable to its often-challenging preparation, which arises from an electronically dissonant heteroatom arrangement. In this work, we achieve a single-atom skeletal edit that produces pyridazines from pyridines by direct carbon-to-nitrogen atom replacement: Azide introduction at the ortho position enables a photoinitiated rearrangement ofN-amino-2-azidopyridinium cations.
