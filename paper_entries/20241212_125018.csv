10.5194/acp-24-13653-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了位势涡度梯度定义的动力学对流层顶的变率和趋势。对流层顶是地球大气中重要的分界面，它分隔了对流层和平流层。研究使用了四个气象卫星资料再分析数据集（ERA5，ERA-Interim，JRA-55，MERRA-2），分析了1980年至2017年期间对流层顶的纬度位置变化。结果表明，对流层顶存在明显的季节性和年际变化，并且与厄尔尼诺-南方涛动（ENSO）等气候现象密切相关。长期趋势分析显示，对流层顶在不同高度上的变化趋势不同，这可能与大气环流的变化以及温室气体分布有关。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据来研究大气环流和温室气体分布，并分析了气候变化对大气结构的影响。,"['potential vorticity', 'tropopause', 'atmospheric circulation', 'greenhouse gases', 'satellite reanalysis', 'climate change', 'El Niño–Southern Oscillation', 'upper tropospheric width']",Katharina Turhal;Felix Plöger;Jan Clemens;Thomas Birner;Franziska Weyland;Paul Konopka;Peter Hoor,Variability and trends in the potential vorticity (PV)-gradient dynamical tropopause,"The tropopause separates the troposphere, where many greenhouse gases originate, from the stratosphere. This study examines a tropopause defined by potential vorticity – an analogue for angular momentum that changes sharply in the subtropics, creating a transport barrier. Between 1980 and 2017, this tropopause shifted poleward at lower altitudes and equatorward above, suggesting height-dependent changes in atmospheric circulation that may affect greenhouse gas distribution and global warming. 
 The dynamical tropopause acts as a transport barrier between the tropical upper troposphere and extratropical lowermost stratosphere and is characterized by steep gradients in potential vorticity (PV) along an isentropic surface. Hence, the latitudinal separation between the dynamical tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere can be used as a metric of upper-tropospheric width for assessing climate change impacts. Here, we obtain the PV-gradient-based dynamical tropopause (PVG tropopause) from four meteorological satellite-era reanalyses (ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2) and investigate its climatology, variability and long-term trends from 1980 to 2017. Our results show a distinct seasonal cycle with larger PV values and a poleward movement of the PVG tropopause in summer. The climatological tropopause PV values are substantially different between different reanalyses, but the tropopause latitude is similar. Significant interannual variability in the PVG tropopause latitude is related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and weaker variability also to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and is consistently represented in reanalyses. In particular, El Niño correlates with equatorward shifts in the PVG tropopause and hence a decrease in upper-tropospheric width. Long-term trends in the PVG tropopause over the period 1980–2017 exhibit a distinct vertical structure with poleward shifts below 340 K potential temperature, equatorward shifts between 340 and 370 K, and poleward shifts between 370 and 380 K. This consistent widening at lower levels and narrowing in the upper troposphere also exhibit considerable zonal variability with  the  strongest upper-tropospheric narrowing over the eastern Pacific."

Isoprene was the major source of formic, acetic, and oxalic acid. Gas-phase chemistry greatly underestimated formic and acetic acid, indicating missing sources, while cloud chemistry was a key source of oxalic acid. More studies of organic acids are required to better constrain their sources. 
 Organic acids represent an important class of compounds in the atmosphere,  but there is limited research investigating their chemical production, particularly in the northeast United States. To improve our understanding of organic acid sources, a modeling analysis was performed for air masses reaching the summit of Whiteface Mountain (WFM), New York,  where measurements of organic acids in cloud water have been collected. The analysis focuses on a pollution event associated with a heat wave that occurred on 1–2 July 2018 that exhibited unusually high concentrations of formic (HCOOH), acetic (CH3COOH), and oxalic (OxAc) acid in cloud water.  The gas-phase production of organic acids for this pollution event was modeled using a combination of the regional transport model Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), which gives information on transport and environmental factors affecting air parcels reaching WFM, and the Lagrangian chemical box model BOXMOX, which allows analysis of chemistry with different chemical mechanisms. Two chemical mechanisms are used in BOXMOX:  (1) the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART T1) and (2) the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) version 3.3.1.  The WRF-Chem results show that air parcels sampled during the pollution event at WFM originated in central Missouri, which has strong biogenic emissions of isoprene. Many air parcels were influenced by emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the Chicago metropolitan area. The gas-phase oxidation of isoprene and its related oxidation products was the major source of HCOOH and CH3COOH,  but both mechanisms substantially underproduced both acids compared to observations. A simple gas–aqueous mechanism was included to investigate the role of aqueous chemistry in organic acid production. Aqueous chemistry did not produce more HCOOH or CH3COOH, suggesting missing chemical sources of both acids. However this aqueous chemistry was able to explain the elevated concentrations of OxAc. Anthropogenic NOx emissions from Chicago had little overall impact on the production of all three organic acids. Further studies are required to better constrain gas and aqueous production of low-molecular-weight organic acids."
10.5194/acp-24-13633-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了全球环流模型（GCMs）对气溶胶-云相互作用中云液水路径调整的模拟能力。研究发现，GCMs模拟结果与对气溶胶增加导致云液水路径增加（从而对气候辐射强迫产生负调整）的认识相符，但与其他证据的结论有所不同。论文探讨了模型中可能存在的混杂机制以及参数化或基态表示误差等问题，并分析了两种气溶胶-云相互作用机制（降水抑制和卷入蒸发增强）在GCMs中的表现。虽然模型能够参数化小尺度微物理-湍流相互作用，但卷入增强机制的全球平均效应可忽略不计。这引发了对GCMs模拟结果准确性和现有过程理解是否充分代表真实气候中云多样性的质疑。最后，论文提出了解决当前和未来全球模型系统与其他证据之间差异的方法，以改进气候预测。  研究中涉及到卫星观测数据与GCMs模拟结果的比较，以评估模型的可靠性，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Aerosols', 'Cloud liquid water path', 'Radiative forcing', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate modeling', 'General Circulation Models (GCMs)', 'Cloud properties', 'Aerosol-cloud interactions']",Johannes Mülmenstädt;Andrew S.

Varble;Hailong Wang;Kai Zhang;Youtong Zheng,Can general circulation models (GCMs) represent cloud liquid water path adjustments to aerosol–cloud interactions?,"Stratocumulus clouds play a large role in Earth's climate by reflecting incoming solar energy back to space. Turbulence at stratocumulus cloud top mixes in dry, warm air, which can lead to cloud dissipation. This process is challenging for coarse-resolution global models to represent. We show that global models nevertheless agree well with our process understanding. Global models also think the process is less important for the climate than other lines of evidence have led us to conclude. 
 General circulation models (GCMs), unlike other lines of evidence, indicate that anthropogenic aerosols cause a global-mean increase in cloud liquid water path (ℒ) and thus a negative adjustment to radiative forcing of the climate by aerosol–cloud interactions.  In part 1 of this series of papers, we showed that this is true even in models that reproduce the negative correlation observed in present-day internal variability in ℒ and cloud droplet number concentration (Nd). We studied several possible confounding mechanisms that could explain the noncausal cloud–aerosol correlations in GCMs and that possibly contaminate observational estimates of radiative adjustments.  Here, we perform single-column and full-atmosphere GCM experiments to investigate the causal model-physics mechanisms underlying the model radiative adjustment estimate.  We find that both aerosol–cloud interaction mechanisms thought to be operating in real clouds – precipitation suppression and entrainment evaporation enhancement – are active in GCMs and behave qualitatively in agreement with physical process understanding.  However, the modeled entrainment enhancement has a negligible global-mean effect.  This raises the question of whether the GCM estimate is incorrect due to parametric or base-state representation errors or whether the process understanding gleaned from a limited set of canonical cloud cases is insufficiently representative of the diversity of clouds in the real climate.  Regardless, even at limited resolution, the GCM physics appears able to parameterize the small-scale microphysics–turbulence interplay responsible for the entrainment enhancement mechanism.  We suggest ways to resolve tension between current and future (storm-resolving) global modeling systems and other lines of evidence in synthesis climate projections."

Grosvenor;Ben B. B. Booth;Colin P. Morice;Ken S. Carslaw,Warming effects of reduced sulfur emissions from shipping,"A 2020 regulation has reduced sulfur emissions from shipping by about 80 %, leading to a decrease in atmospheric aerosols that have a cooling effect primarily by affecting cloud properties and amounts. Our climate model simulations predict a global temperature increase of 0.04 K over the next 3 decades as a result, which could contribute to surpassing the Paris Agreement's 1.5 °C target. Reduced aerosols may have also contributed to the recent temperature spikes. 
 The regulation introduced in 2020 that limits the sulfur content in shipping fuel has reduced sulfur emissions over global open oceans by about 80 %. This is expected to have reduced aerosols that both reflect solar radiation directly and affect cloud properties, with the latter also changing the solar radiation balance. Here we investigate the impacts of this regulation on aerosols and climate in the HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL climate model. The global aerosol effective radiative forcing caused by reduced shipping emissions is estimated to be 0.13 W m−2, which is equivalent to an additional ∼50 % to the net positive forcing resulting from the reduction in all anthropogenic aerosols from the late-20th century to the pre-2020 era. Ensembles of global coupled simulations from 2020–2049 predict a global mean warming of 0.04 K averaged over this period. Our simulations are not clear on whether the global impact is yet to emerge or has already emerged because the present-day impact is masked by variability. Nevertheless, the impact of shipping emission reductions either will have already committed us to warming above the 1.5 K Paris target or will represent an important contribution that may help explain part of the rapid jump in global temperatures over the last 12 months. Consistent with previous aerosol perturbation simulations, the warming is greatest in the Arctic, reaching a mean of 0.15 K Arctic-wide and 0.3 K in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic (which represents a greater than 10 % increase in the total anthropogenic warming since pre-industrial times)."

Beres;Julia Burkart;Elias Graf;Yanick Zeder;Lea Ann Dailey;Bernadett Weinzierl,"Merging holography, fluorescence, and machine learning for in situ continuous characterization and classification of airborne microplastics","We tested a method to identify airborne microplastics (MPs), merging imaging, fluorescence, and machine learning of single particles. We examined whether combining imaging and fluorescence data enhances classification accuracy compared to using each method separately and tested these methods with other particle types. The tested MPs have distinct fluorescence, and a combined imaging and fluorescence method improves their detection, making meaningful progress in monitoring MPs in the atmosphere. 
 The continued increase in global plastic production and poor waste management ensures that plastic pollution will be a serious environmental concern for years to come. Because of their size, shape, and relatively low density, plastic particles between 1 and 1000 µm in size (known as microplastics or MPs) emitted directly into the environment (“primary”) or created due to degradation (“secondary”) may be transported through the atmosphere, similarly to other coarse-mode particles such as mineral dust. MPs can thus be advected over great distances, reaching even the most pristine and remote areas of Earth, and may have significant negative consequences for humans and the environment. The detection and analysis of MPs once airborne, however, remains a challenge because most observational methods are offline and resource-intensive and, therefore, not capable of providing continuous quantitative information.In this study, we present results using an online in situ airflow cytometer (SwisensPoleno Jupiter; Swisens AG; Emmen, Switzerland) – coupled with machine learning – to detect, analyze, and classify airborne single-particle MPs in near real time. The performance of the instrument in differentiating between single-particle MPs of five common polymer types (including polypropylene, polyethylene, polyamide, poly(methyl methacrylate), and polyethylene terephthalate) was investigated under laboratory conditions using combined information about their size and shape (determined using holographic imaging) and fluorescence measured using three excitation wavelengths and five emission detection windows. The classification capability using these methods was determined alongside other coarse-mode aerosol particles with similar morphology or fluorescence characteristics, such as a mineral dust and several pollen taxa.The tested MPs exhibit a measurable fluorescence signal that not only allows them to be distinguished from other fluorescent particles, such as pollen, but also differentiated from each other, with high (> 90 %) classification accuracy based on their multispectral fluorescence signatures. The classification accuracies of machine learning models using only holographic images of particles, only the fluorescence response, and combined information from holography and fluorescence to predict particle types are presented and compared. The last model, using both the holographic images and fluorescence information for each particle, was the most optimal model used, providing the highest classification accuracy compared to employing models using only the holography or fluorescence response separately. The results provide a foundation for significantly improving the understanding of the properties and types of MPs present in the atmosphere."

As a result, we propose optimized post-processing for error reduction. 
 High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) wind velocity measurements are of major importance for the characterization of atmospheric turbulence. The use of a multi-beam wind lidar focusing on a measurement volume from different directions is a promising approach for obtaining such wind data. This paper provides a detailed study of the propagation of measurement uncertainty of a three-beam wind lidar designed for mounting on airborne platforms with geometrical constraints that lead to increased measurement uncertainties of the wind components transverse to the main axis of the system. The uncertainty analysis is based on synthetic wind data generated by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as well as on experimental wind data from airborne and ground-based 3D ultrasonic anemometers. For typical atmospheric conditions, we show that the measurement uncertainty of the transverse components can be reduced by about 30 %–50 % by applying an appropriate post-processing algorithm. Optimized post-processing parameters can be determined in an actual experiment by characterizing measured data in terms of variance and correlation time of wind fluctuations, allowing for the optimized design of a multi-beam wind lidar with strong geometrical limitations."

The data reveal variations of the air–sea interface and the ocean itself, which are valuable for studies of air–sea interactions and ocean dynamics in the northern South China Sea. 
 This work presents a cross-shaped moored array dataset (MASCS 1.0) comprising five buoys and four moorings with synchronous atmospheric and oceanic data in the northern South China Sea during 2014–2015. The atmospheric data are observed by two meteorological instruments at the buoys. The oceanic data consist of sea surface waves measured using a wave recorder, temperature, and salinity from the surface to a depth of 400 m and at 10 and 50 m above the ocean bottom using conductivity, temperature, and depth recorders. They also include currents from the surface to a depth of 850 m measured using acoustic Doppler current profilers and measured at 10, 50, and 100 m above the floor using current meters. Additional measurements were taken for sea surface radiation, air visibility, chlorophyll, turbidity, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter at buoy 3 located at the center of the moored array. The data reveal air–sea interactions and oceanic processes in the upper and bottom ocean, especially the transition of the air–sea interface and ocean conditions from summer to winter monsoon and the effects of six tropical cyclones on the moored array. Multiscale processes were also recorded, such as air–sea fluxes, tides, internal waves, and low-frequency flows. The data are valuable and have many potential applications, including analyzing the phenomena and mechanisms of air–sea interactions and ocean dynamics and validating and improving numerical model simulations, data reanalysis, and assimilations.

Dias,Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation (TRACE),"We infer ocean gas exchange and circulation from ocean tracer measurements and use this to create code to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean that is there due to human emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. The code works across the ocean depths for the past, present, or future from information about the location, temperature, and saltiness of the seawater. We produce a data product with estimates throughout the ocean throughout the last ~300 and next ~500 years. 
 The ocean is one of the largest sinks for anthropogenic carbon (Canth) and its removal of CO2 from the atmosphere has been valued at hundreds of billions of US dollars in climate mitigation annually. The ecosystem impacts caused by planet-wide shifts in ocean chemistry resulting from marine Canth accumulation are an active area of research. For these reasons, we need accessible tools to quantify ocean Canth inventories and distributions and to predict how they might evolve in response to future emissions and mitigation activities. Unfortunately, Canth estimation methods are typically only accessible to trained scientists and modelers with access to significant computational resources. Here we make modifications to the transit-time-distribution approach for Canth estimation that render the method more accessible. We also release software called “Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation version 1” (TRACEv1) that allows users—with one line of code—to obtain Canth and water mass age estimates throughout the global open ocean from user-supplied values of coordinates, salinity, temperature, and the estimate year. We use this code to generate a data product of global gridded open-ocean Canth distributions (TRACEv1_GGCanth, Carter, 2024) that ranges from the preindustrial era through 2500 c.e. under a range of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs, or atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways). We quantify the skill of these estimates by reconstructing Canth in models with known distributions of Canth and transient tracers and by conducting perturbation tests. In the model-based reconstruction test, TRACEv1 reproduces the global ocean Canth inventory with reasonable skill (within ±12 % in 1980 and 2015). We discuss implications of the projected Canth distributions and highlight ways that the estimation strategy might be improved. One finding is that the ocean will continue to increase its net Canth inventory at least through 2500 due to deep ocean ventilation even with the SSP where intense mitigation successfully decreases atmospheric Canth by ~60 % in 2500 relative to the 2024 concentration."

The results of this study highlight the beneficial impact of data assimilation by effectively combining land surface model and satellite-derived data according to their relative uncertainty, thereby controlling not only transitional regions but also the regions with heavy snow accumulation that are difficult to detect by satellite. 
 Snow water equivalent (SWE), as one of the land initial or boundary conditions, plays a crucial role in global or regional energy and water balance, thereby exerting a considerable impact on seasonal and subseasonal-scale predictions owing to its enduring persistence over 1 to 2 months. Despite its importance, most SWE initialization remains challenging due to its reliance on simple approaches based on spatially limited observations. Therefore, this study developed an advanced SWE data assimilation framework with satellite remote sensing data utilizing the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) and the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land model. This approach constitutes an objective method that optimally combines two previously unattempted incomplete data sources: the satellite SWE retrieval from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and dynamically balanced SWE from the JULES land surface model. In this framework, an algorithm is additionally considered to determine the assimilation process based on the presence or absence of snow cover from the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) satellite, renowned for its superior reliability.The baseline model simulation from JULES without satellite data assimilation shows better performance in high-latitude regions with heavy snow accumulation but is relatively inferior in the transition regions with less snow and high spatial and temporal variation. Contrastingly, the AMSR2 satellite data exhibit better performance in the transition regions but poorer performance in the high latitudes, presumably due to the limitation of the satellite data in the penetrating depth. The data assimilation (DA) demonstrates the positive impacts by reducing uncertainty in the JULES model simulations in most areas, particularly in the midlatitude transition regions. In the transition regions, the model background errors from the ensemble runs are significantly larger than the observation errors, emphasizing great uncertainty in the model simulations. The results of this study highlight the beneficial impact of data assimilation by effectively combining  land surface model and satellite-derived data according to their relative uncertainty, thereby controlling not only transitional regions but also the regions with heavy snow accumulation that are difficult to detect by satellite."

Most models reproduce global totals, spatial patterns, seasonality, and regional historical changes well but fail to simulate the recent decline in global burned area and underestimate the fire response to climate variability. CMIP6 simulations address three critical issues of phase-5 models. 
 Fire is the primary form of terrestrial ecosystem disturbance on a global scale and an important Earth system process. Most Earth system models (ESMs) have incorporated fire modeling, with 19 of them submitting model outputs of fire-related variables to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of CMIP6 historical fire simulations by comparing them with multiple satellite-based products and charcoal-based historical reconstructions. Our results show that most CMIP6 models simulate the present-day global burned area and fire carbon emissions within the range of satellite-based products. They also capture the major features of observed spatial patterns and seasonal cycles, the relationship of fires with precipitation and population density, and the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the interannual variability of tropical fires. Regional fire carbon emissions simulated by the CMIP6 models from 1850 to 2010 generally align with the charcoal-based reconstructions, although there are regional mismatches, such as in southern South America and eastern temperate North America prior to the 1910s and in temperate North America, eastern boreal North America, Europe, and boreal Asia since the 1980s. The CMIP6 simulations have addressed three critical issues identified in CMIP5: (1) the simulated global burned area being less than half of that of the observations, (2) the failure to reproduce the high burned area fraction observed in Africa, and (3) the weak fire seasonal variability. Furthermore, the CMIP6 models exhibit improved accuracy in capturing the observed relationship between fires and both climatic and socioeconomic drivers and better align with the historical long-term trends indicated by charcoal-based reconstructions in most regions worldwide. However, the CMIP6 models still fail to reproduce the decline in global burned area and fire carbon emissions observed over the past 2 decades, mainly attributed to an underestimation of anthropogenic fire suppression, and the spring peak in fires in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, mainly due to an underestimation of crop fires.

We have focused on collection processes, where the hydrometeor number transfer is often estimated in proportion to the mass transfer. The impact of these parameterizations on a convective system and the prospects for more realistic estimates of secondary parameters (reflectivity, hydrometeor size) are shown in a first test on an idealized case. 
 A full two-moment microphysics parameterization of the LIMA scheme (with LIMA standing for Liquid Ice Multiple Aerosols and hereafter named LIMA v2.0) has been developed and successfully implemented in the Meso-NH cloud-resolving model. The novelty of the scheme is a set of prognostic equations of the number concentration of each precipitating ice category (snow/aggregates, graupel, and hail), in addition to the prediction of the mass mixing ratios. As a result, new microphysical conversion rates are introduced and explicitly computed using the size distributions of the hydrometeors.The new LIMA v2.0 scheme has been tested for an idealized deep convection case against the original LIMA scheme characterized by an empirical number-concentration–mixing-ratio relationship applied to the precipitating ice. Inclusion of number concentration equations for the snow/aggregates and graupel significantly alters the microphysical structure and dynamical evolution of the simulated supercell. When comparing to the results obtained with the previous version of LIMA, the new v2.0 of the scheme tends to increase the pristine ice mixing ratio; to decrease the other ice hydrometeors by slowing down the growing processes of snow/aggregates, graupel, and hail; and to enhance the feedbacks between raindrops and the ice-phase hydrometeors. This comparison also emphasizes the unreasonable diagnostic approach used to estimate the number concentration of precipitating ice particles in the previous version of the scheme. The new scheme is more efficient at producing earlier raindrops at ground level and reducing hail precipitation."

While reduced sulfur deposition is a key cause, an increasing role of hydrologic mechanisms as a result of cleaner air and progressing climate change has been repeatedly suggested. How these controls act remains however unclear. Here we examine over 30 years of organic carbon concentration and discharge data from four reference streams located across Norway to pinpoint consistent hydrologic changes that may promote water browning. Stable slopes with changing intercepts of the concentration-discharge relations indicate that the influence of air pollution on soil solution chemistry is plausible, supporting available chemical explanations from a hydrologic perspective. Decreasing ratios of concentration to discharge variability, observed in autumn over the years, point to less spatial heterogeneity of the sources of organic carbon. A clear rise in the frequency of runoff events, which increases the opportunities for dissolved organic carbon to transit from soil to streams, also indicates higher hydrologic connectivity and more even mobilization of carbon sources. More connected sources and more frequent runoff events, which jointly enhance the likelihood of organic carbon reaching rivers, may thus contribute to the observed browning of northern waters."

We used online instruments to track the evolution of OP [via dithiothreitol (DTT) assays] during the aging of wood burning and coal combustion emissions by hydroxyl-radical-driven photooxidation and dark ozonolysis. We observed very substantial increases in the intrinsic OP (OPmDTT) of complex combustion aerosols (e.g., OPmDTT up to 100 pmol min–1 μg–1 for OH-aged wood burning emissions) within 1 day of equivalent aging. Further analysis in relation to the degree of oxidation revealed a potential for generalizing the OP of carbonaceous aerosols with average carbon oxidation state OS¯c values ranging from −1.5 to −0.5 by assuming they have a constant OPmDTT value of ∼10 ± 6 pmol min–1 μg–1. Additionally, we uncovered a strong dependency of OPmDTT on both the source/precursor and aging pathway with OS¯c above ∼−0.5.

The TGFs occurred during the initial stage of negative cloud‐to‐ground flashes whose return strokes had increasingly large peak currents up to − ${-}$223 kA, 147 GeV energy deposit in up to 25 1.2 km‐spaced surface detectors, and intermittent bursts of gamma‐rays with total durations up to 717 μ ${\upmu }$s. The analyses are based on observations recorded by the TASD network, complemented by data from a 3D lightning mapping array, broadband VHF interferometer, fast electric field change sensor, high‐speed video camera, and the National Lightning Detection Network. The TGFs of the final two flashes had gamma fluences of ≃2×1014 $\simeq 2\times 1{0}^{14}$ and 8×1014 ${\times} 1{0}^{14}$, logarithmically bridging the gap between previous TASD and satellite‐based detections.

Despite high traffic burden in NY's environmental justice communities, this reduction has not been evaluated through an environmental justice lens—our objective in this analysis. We obtained census tract‐level traffic congestion data from Google traffic maps hourly for 2018–2020. We defined congestion as the percent of streets in a census tract with heavy traffic (red‐ or maroon‐color). We used the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to measure racialized economic segregation and the CDC's Environmental Justice Index (EJI) as a measure of combined environmental, social, and chronic disease burden. We divided census tracts into quintiles of ICE and EJI and used linear mixed models stratified by ICE and EJI quintile in an interrupted time series design. Prior to NY on Pause, less marginalized and burdened census tracts (Q5) tended to have higher levels of traffic congestion; during NY on Pause, this trend reversed. For both ICE and EJI, more marginalized and burdened (Q1–Q2 vs. Q4–Q5) tracts had smaller absolute decreases in percent traffic congestion. For example, percent traffic congestion in ICE Q5 decreased by 7.8% (% change: −36.6%), but in Q1, it decreased by 4.2% (% change: −51.7%). NY on Pause, while protecting residents during COVID‐19, may have resulted in inequitable reductions in traffic congestion. It is critical that such inequities are measured and acknowledged so that future policies to reduce traffic congestion and respond to pandemics can enhance equity."

 Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous synthetic approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. In contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon-carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible due to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon-carbon bond-forming and breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remained elusive4. Here, we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrene by employing Schrock-Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each of the ring systems proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective aromatic ring-opening metathesis with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis is therefore a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation."

 The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies employed at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, within the skin, host-microbiota symbiosis depends on the remarkable ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centers within the lymph node associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs within the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microbe. Collectively, these results reveal a striking compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis."

The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalyzed by the condensation (C) domain 3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction 3-12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. We have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogs 13,14 assembled the two parts with protein ligation 15, and solved structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and allow biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPSs C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, where the active site histidine likely serves not a as general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium."

The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and a ~61 nm long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the “β-belt” are 9 strategically located inter-strand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of >200 intramolecular crosslinks and find close agreement between the two.

 Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been discovered, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorAB complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defense using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We present cryo-EM structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, finding that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated upon sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defense system."

 The ubiquitous skin colonist Staphylococcus epidermidis elicits a CD8+ T cell response pre-emptively, in the absence of an infection1. However, the scope and purpose of this anti-commensal immune program are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable, and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labeled commensal elicits high antibody titers under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a novel form of topical vaccination."

 Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, 
              NCT04725474
              
            ), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer.

 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3–9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement.

 Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia.

 In the quest for environmental sustainability, the rising demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies has substantially increased the need for efficient lithium extraction methods. Traditional lithium production, relying on geographically concentrated hard-rock ores and salar brines, is associated with considerable energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and land disturbance, thereby posing notable environmental and supply chain challenges. On the other hand, low-quality brines—such as those found in sedimentary waters, geothermal fluids, oilfield-produced waters, seawater and some salar brines and salt lakes—hold large potential owing to their extensive reserves and widespread geographical distribution. However, extracting lithium from these sources presents technical challenges owing to low lithium concentrations and high magnesium-to-lithium ratios. This Review explores the latest advances and continuing challenges in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising sources, covering a variety of methods, including precipitation, solvent extraction, sorption, membrane-based separation and electrochemical-based separation. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the future development of lithium extraction technologies, framed within the basic principles of separation processes. The aim is to encourage the development of innovative extraction methods capable of making use of the substantial potential of low-quality brines.

 Amniote integumentary appendages constitute a diverse group of micro-organs, including feathers, hair and scales. These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units1, the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback4,5. The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm6. However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species.

 Rainfall events are globally becoming less frequent but more intense under a changing climate, thereby shifting climatic conditions for terrestrial vegetation independent of annual rainfall totals1–3. However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3–17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security. Satellite data and field observations show that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year."

 Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is a structural component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR)1. Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface.

 Tailored light–matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency1,2, with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry3–7. Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation8, comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states9,10. However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.

 The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1–3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6–8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations.

 The automated synthesis of small organic molecules from modular building blocks has the potential to transform our capacity to create medicines and materials1–3. Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4–6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments.

 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. The rapid development of highly effective vaccines2,3 against SARS-CoV-2 has altered the trajectory of the pandemic, and antiviral therapeutics4 have further reduced the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that encode various structural and non-structural proteins, including those critical for viral RNA replication and evasion from innate immunity5. Here we report the discovery and development of a first-in-class non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor of the viral guanine-N7 methyltransferase (MTase) NSP14. High-throughput screening identified RU-0415529, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a unique ternary S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound complex. Hit-to-lead optimization of RU-0415529 resulted in TDI-015051 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM, inhibiting virus infection in a cell-based system. TDI-015051 also inhibited viral replication in primary small airway epithelial cells and in a transgenic mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection with an efficacy comparable with the FDA-approved reversible covalent protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir6. The inhibition of viral cap methylases as an antiviral strategy is also adaptable to other pandemic viruses.

 Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are assembly line biosynthetic pathways that are used to produce critical therapeutic drugs and are typically arranged as large multi-domain proteins called megasynthetases1. They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.

 The human body contains trillions of cells, classified into specific cell types, with diverse morphologies and functions. In addition, cells of the same type can assume different states within an individual’s body during their lifetime. Understanding the complexities of the proteome in the context of a human organism and its many potential states is a necessary requirement to understanding human biology, but these complexities can neither be predicted from the genome, nor have they been systematically measurable with available technologies. Recent advances in proteomic technology and computational sciences now provide opportunities to investigate the intricate biology of the human body at unprecedented resolution and scale. Here we introduce a big-science endeavour called π-HuB (proteomic navigator of the human body). The aim of the π-HuB project is to (1) generate and harness multimodality proteomic datasets to enhance our understanding of human biology; (2) facilitate disease risk assessment and diagnosis; (3) uncover new drug targets; (4) optimize appropriate therapeutic strategies; and (5) enable intelligent healthcare, thereby ushering in a new era of proteomics-driven phronesis medicine.

 During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome1–3. In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1–3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.

 The functionality of materials is determined by their composition1–4 and microstructure, that is, the distribution and orientation of crystalline grains, grain boundaries and the defects within them5,6. Until now, characterization techniques that map the distribution of grains, their orientation and the presence of defects have been limited to surface investigations, to spatial resolutions of a few hundred nanometres or to systems of thickness around 100 nm, thus requiring destructive sample preparation for measurements and preventing the study of system-representative volumes or the investigation of materials under operational conditions7–15.

 The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.

 Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6–8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro.

 The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest1–13. However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms14–24, the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate11. These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene reveals flat-band replicas that are indicative of strong electron–phonon coupling; these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene."

 The most distant galaxies detected were seen when the Universe was a scant 5% of its current age. At these times, progenitors of galaxies such as the Milky Way were about 10,000 times less massive. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at zspec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS)1. The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 105M⊙ to 106M⊙. These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (>103M⊙ pc−2), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function.

 The ability of cells to maintain distinct identities and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks1–3. These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis4–8. Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness9–11. Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.

 Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1–4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5–8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain. ZMQ-1 has high thermal and hydrothermal stability with tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios. ZMQ-1 is the first aluminosilicate zeolite with an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system. The Brønsted acidity of ZMQ-1 imparts high activity and unique selectivity in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite.

Wadley,Nanoscale imaging and control of altermagnetism in MnTe,"Nanoscale imaging and control of altermagnetism in manganese telluride is achieved, paving the way for the experimental realization of the theoretically predicted field of altermagnetism. 
 Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a spectrum of condensed-matter research and device functionalities involving magnetism. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization1–4. So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes4–19. Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre-scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe)2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21. We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices3,14,22–24.

 The ring-shaped chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC; also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1, CCT) is an ATP-driven protein-folding machine that is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis1,2. Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease3,4. Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells. Defining the TRiC cycle and function inside cells lays the foundation to understand its dysfunction during cancer and neurodegeneration.

Here authors show how addition of a heavy inert gas can increase the thickness uniformity of the films on complex objects. 
 Semiconductor devices are constructed from stacks of materials with different electrical properties, making deposition of thin layers central in producing semiconductor chips. The shrinking of electronics has resulted in complex device architectures which require deposition into holes and recessed features. A key parameter for such deposition is the step coverage (SC), which is the ratio of the thickness of material at the bottom and at the top. Here, we show that adding a co-flow of a heavy inert gas affords a higher SC for deposition by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). By adding a co-flow of Xe to a CVD process for boron carbide using a single source precursor with a lower molecular mass than the atomic mass of Xe, the SC increased from 0.71 to 0.97 in a 10:1 aspect ratio feature. The concept was further validated by a longer deposition depth in lateral high aspect ratio structures. We suggest that competitive co-diffusion is a general route to conformal CVD.

 Hsp90, a crucial molecular chaperone, regulates diverse client proteins, impacting both normal biology and disease. Central to its function is its conformational plasticity, driven by ATPase activity and client interactions. However, comprehensive insights into Hsp90’s dynamic molecular transitions remain elusive. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we reveal how ATP binding, hydrolysis, and client engagement drive conformational and dynamic shifts in E. coli Hsp90, HtpG, through its chaperone cycle. Pronounced conformational fluctuations occur, especially in regions crucial for nucleotide binding and conformational transitions. ATP binding induces slow-exchanging conformations, representing discrete on-path transition states from open to closed forms, while ATP hydrolysis shifts HtpG into a compact conformation. Client binding acts as an allosteric switch, dynamically priming HtpG for elevated chaperone activity and, therefore, its efficient remodeling. Here, we provide atomic-level insights into Hsp90’s functional mechanism, highlighting the interplay of conformation, dynamics, nucleotide, and client interactions.

 Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) of cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis, but is challenging to detect from low plasma volumes. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), ctDNA assays are needed to prognosticate outcomes of patients treated with androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors. We develop a custom targeted cfDNA sequencing assay, named AR-ctDETECT, to detect ctDNA in limiting plasma cfDNA available from mCRPC patients in the Alliance A031201 randomized phase 3 trial of enzalutamide with or without abiraterone. Of 776 patients, 59% are ctDNA-positive, with 26% having high ctDNA aneuploidy and 33% having low ctDNA aneuploidy but displaying AR gain or structural rearrangement, MYC/MYCN gain, or a pathogenic mutation. ctDNA-positive patients have significantly worse median overall survival than ctDNA-negative patients (29.0 months vs. 47.4 months, respectively).

 Clinical studies of the urinary tract microbiome, termed urobiome, suggest a direct, antibiotic-dependent, impact of the urobiome on kidney physiology. However, evidence for kidney bacteria comes from indirect sources or infected tissue. Further, it is unclear how antibiotics impact kidney bacteria. Here we show direct evidence for the presence of bacteria in the kidneys, with microniches in nephrons. In murine kidneys, administration of cefazolin, a commonly used perioperative antibiotic, led to a loss of uroprotective Lactobacillus spp. and proliferation of Enterobacteriaceae (which includes many known uropathogens). This effect was dependent on treatment duration, with recovery post treatment. Uroprotective L. crispatus and a strain of stone-associated E. coli differentially influenced calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization through the incorporation of CaOx inhibitors or promoters, respectively. In humans, microbial signatures were identified in the kidney, with unique niches between the glomeruli and tubules, established through RNA sequencing analysis and direct imaging of two independent populations. Collectively, findings support the hypothesis that the kidneys harbor a stable and antibiotic-responsive microbiota that can influence CaOx lithogenesis. The presence of unique, age-dependent microbial signatures in the glomeruli and tubuli carry implications for non-infectious kidney diseases.

Here, authors use a combination of imaging and mechanical tests to model the kinematics and dynamics of wing deployment in Drosophila. 
 During their final transformation, insects emerge from the pupal case and deploy their wings within minutes. The wings deploy from a compact origami structure, to form a planar and rigid blade that allows the insect to fly. Deployment is powered by a rapid increase in internal pressure, and by the subsequent flow of hemolymph into the deployable wing structure. Using a combination of imaging techniques, we characterize the internal and external structure of the wing in Drosophila melanogaster, the unfolding kinematics at the organ scale, and the hemolymph flow during deployment. We find that, beyond the mere unfolding of the macroscopic folds, wing deployment also involves wing expansion, with the stretching of epithelial cells and the unwrinkling of the cuticle enveloping the wing. A quantitative computational model, incorporating mechanical measurements of the viscoelastic properties and microstructure of the wing, predicts the existence of an operating point for deployment and captures the dynamics of the process. This model shows that insects exploit material and geometric nonlinearities to achieve rapid and efficient reconfiguration of soft deployable structures.

 Biomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles that can concentrate hundreds of different proteins in cells to operate essential biological functions. However, accurate identification of their components remains challenging and biased towards proteins with high structural disorder content with focus on self-phase separating (driver) proteins. Here, we present a machine learning algorithm, PICNIC (Proteins Involved in CoNdensates In Cells) to classify proteins that localize to biomolecular condensates regardless of their role in condensate formation. PICNIC successfully predicts condensate members by learning amino acid patterns in the protein sequence and structure in addition to the intrinsic disorder. Extensive experimental validation of 24 positive predictions in cellulo shows an overall ~82% accuracy regardless of the structural disorder content of the tested proteins. While increasing disorder content is associated with organismal complexity, our analysis of 26 species reveals no correlation between predicted condensate proteome content and disorder content across organisms. Overall, we present a machine learning classifier to interrogate condensate components at whole-proteome levels across the tree of life.

 Land use/land cover (LULC) is one of the most impactful global change phenomenon. As a result, considerable effort has been devoted to creating large-scale LULC products from remote sensing data, enabling the scientific community to use these products for a wide range of downstream applications. Unfortunately, uncertainty associated with these products is seldom quantified because most approaches are too computationally intensive. Furthermore, uncertainty maps developed for large regions might fail to perform adequately at the spatial scale in which they will be used and might need to be customized to suit the specific applications of end-users.In this study, we describe the class-conditional conformal statistics method, an approach that quantifies uncertainty more uniformly for each class but that requires more calibration data than the conventional conformal method. Using the class-conditional method, we show that it is possible to create customized local uncertainty maps using local calibration data without requiring remote sensing and modeling work and that these local uncertainty maps outperform uncertainty maps calibrated based on global data. We use empirical data from Brazil (i.e., Dynamic World LULC product and Mapbiomas validation data) to demonstrate this methodology. The analysis of these data reveals substantial heterogeneity in observations of the same LULC class between Brazilian states, an indication that national-level data are not representative of the focal state, thus explaining why uncertainty maps calibrated using focal state-level data outperform maps calibrated using national-level data. Importantly, we develop straight-forward approaches to determine the spatial extent over which calibration data are still representative of the area of interest, ensuring that these data can be used to reliably quantify uncertainty. We illustrate the class-conformal methodology by creating uncertainty maps for a selected number of sites in Brazil. Finally, we show how these uncertainty maps can yield valuable insights for LULC map producers.Our methodology paves the way for users to generate customized local uncertainty maps that are likely to be better than uncertainty maps calibrated based on global data while at the same time being more relevant for the specific applications of these users. A tutorial is provided to show how this methodology can be implemented without requiring remote sensing and modeling expertise to generate uncertainty maps."

 The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the UK has been decreasing in the last few decades but remains the leading environmental health risk. As a consequence of changing population, behaviour, activity factors, emissions and regulation, it is likely that the sources of PM2.5 in the UK are changing but a quantitative source apportionment has not been reported for many years. This study analyses the characteristics and sources of PM2.5 collected in 2021 and 2022 at two urban background sites: Birmingham Air Quality Supersite (BAQS) and Ladywood (LW) in Birmingham. Results indicate a notable decrease in the contribution (concentration) of (NH4)2SO4 to PM2.5 from 25% (2.9 μg m−3) in 2007 to 15% (1.5 μg m−3) in 2022. In contrast, the contribution of NH4NO3 (20–22%) to PM2.5 remains consistent with that in 2007, despite various air quality actions implemented over the years. These shifts are attributed to changes in SO2 and NOx emissions, coupled with relatively stable NH3 levels—key precursors for (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3, which altered the formation dynamics of these compounds, ultimately affecting their contribution to PM2.5 concentrations. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis showed that biomass burning factors (25%), resuspended dust and traffic-related emissions (22%), and secondary aerosols (25%) are the major contributors to PM2.5 mass. Furthermore, PMF and Aethalometer-model analyses consistently showed that biomass burning aerosol concentrations are approximately seven times higher (1.5 μg m−3) than those observed in studies from 2008 to 2010. These findings suggest that targeted measures to reduce wood burning and road traffic have the greatest potential to reduce PM2.5-related health risks in the West Midland region."

 The atmosphere over the Northeastern region of Brazil (NEB) contains a variety of different aerosol types: marine, soil dust, biomass burning, urban pollution, as well as mixed species. However, very few reliable information on aerosols is available for the region. Satellite data provides spatial and temporal coverage in places with low density ground-based observational networks, with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products as most important information on the atmospheric aerosol load. To find out how different AOD products from satellites behave over the NEB region we compared AOD at 550 nm from MODIS retrievals aboard both NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, and ground-based derived AOD 550 nm from the two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites in the region, located in cities of Petrolina and Natal, between 2015 and 2018. We based our analysis on the following MODIS AOD retrievals products: Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), the combined product (DTDB), DT 3 km resolution product (MxD3k) and MAIAC at 1 km resolution. Additionally, we used AOD from MERRA2 reanalysis for another comparison that may provide additional insight on which products perform best over the region. We also analyze and compare the seasonality of the AOD products to the four biomes of NEB, which are Amazon rainforest, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and Caatinga (wooded savannah-like) biomes. Petrolina is located in the NEB largest biome, the Caatinga, while Natal is a coastal city in the Atlantic Forest. The results show that DB yields the best results for the Petrolina site. The analyses also show that in all biomes the AOD monthly averages decrease during austral autumn and winter and increase during spring and summer. The compared products show some differences in AOD, even though with similar patterns. MAIAC and DB show very similar values in all four biomes throughout the year, recommending the use of DB and MAIAC for studies in the Caatinga region."

This ability is not innate; rather, it develops with experience early in life. We show that, when mice are naïve to an odor object, perceptual constancy is absent across increasing concentrations. The perceptual change coincides with a rapid reduction in activity from a single olfactory receptor channel that is most sensitive to the odor. This drop in activity is not a property of circuit interactions within the olfactory bulb; instead, it is due to a sensitivity mismatch of olfactory receptor neurons within the nose. We show that, after forming an association of this odor with food, the sensitivity of the receptor channel is matched to the odor object, preventing transmission failure and promoting perceptual stability. These data show that plasticity of the primary sensory organ enables learning of perceptual constancy."

During I/R, elevated mitochondrial Ca2+triggers mPTP opening, leading to necrotic cell death. Although nonessential regulators of this pore are characterized, the molecular identity of the pore-forming component remains elusive. Two of these genetically verified regulators are cyclophilin D (CypD) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family. We investigated the ANT/CypD relationship in mPTP dynamics and I/R injury. Despite lacking all ANT isoforms, Ca2+-dependent mPTP opening persisted in cardiac mitochondria but was desensitized. This desensitization conferred resistance to I/R injury in ANT-deficient mice. CypD is hypothesized to trigger mPTP opening through isomerization of ANTs at proline-62. To test this, we generated mice that expressed a P62A mutated version of ANT1. These mice showed similar mPTP dynamics and I/R sensitivity as the wild type, indicating that P62 is dispensable for CypD regulation. Together, these data indicate that the ANT family contributes to mPTP opening independently of CypD."

Machine learning force field applications in computational chemistry, especially through deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD), offer a promising alternative that closely aligns with the accuracy of first-principles methods. Our research used DPMD to study how salts affect water by comparing its results with ab initio molecular dynamics, SPC/Fw, AMOEBA, and MB-Pol models.

Additionally, we directly observe1H NMR lines spanning 10 MHz. The spectrum is confirmed by simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which verify that the signals originate from intramolecular protons on TEMPOL. Using two-dimensional NMR, we demonstrate polarization transfer from hypershifted to bulk nuclei across a spin diffusion barrier.

Palmitoylation and the signal peptide were not required for Wnt7a-EV secretion. Coatomer was identified as the EV-binding protein for the EBP. Analysis of cocrystal structures, binding thermodynamics, and mutagenesis found that a dilysine motif mediates EBP binding to coatomer with a conserved function across the Wnt family.

Here, using cellular models and in vitro studies, we show the spatiotemporal formation and material properties of p53 condensates that might dictate its function. In particular, p53 forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus of cells, which can bind to DNA and perform transcriptional activity. However, cancer-associated mutations promote misfolding and partially rigidify the p53 condensates with impaired DNA binding ability. Irrespective of wild-type and mutant forms, the partitioning of p53 into cytoplasm leads to the condensate formation, which subsequently undergoes rapid solidification. In vitro studies show that abundant nuclear components such as RNA and nonspecific DNA promote multicomponent phase separation of the p53 core domain and maintain their liquid-like property, whereas specific DNA promotes its dissolution into tetrameric functional p53. This work provides mechanistic insights into how the life cycle and DNA binding properties of p53 might be regulated by phase separation."

Baker,Electrochemical imaging of neurotransmitter release with fast-scan voltammetric ion conductance microscopy,"Understanding the dynamic spatial and temporal release of neurotransmitters can help resolve long-standing questions related to chemical modulation of neurological circuits. Dopamine modulates function in a range of physiological processes and is key to transmission in addiction and neurological disorders. Studies at subcellular scales promise to help develop a broader understanding of dopamine release, diffusion, and receptor activation and how these processes lead to functional outcomes. Electrochemical measurements of dopamine release at individual cells have proven especially informative. We describe incorporation of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of dopamine release with subcellular spatial resolution and millisecond time resolution. The platform is benchmarked with standard redox probes and then applied to imaging stimulated release from subcellular locations of a coculture of dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes. Voltammetry reveals heterogeneity in release based on time, location, and neuron identity. We believe that this platform ultimately offers a window to understanding neurotransmission in pathophysiological models of disease where cell-cell communication is key."

While stimulated Raman imaging has found successes in deciphering biological machinery, many vibrational modes are Raman inactive or weak, limiting the broader impact of the technique. It can potentially be mitigated by the spectral complementarity from infrared (IR) spectroscopy. However, the vastly different optical windows make it challenging to develop such a platform. Here, we introduce in situ pump-probe IR and Raman excitation (INSPIRE) microscopy, a nascent cross-modality spectroscopic imaging approach by encoding the ultrafast Raman and the IR photothermal relaxation into a single probe beam for simultaneous detection. INSPIRE inherits the merits of complementary modalities and demonstrates high-content molecular imaging of chemicals, cells, tissues, and organisms. Furthermore, INSPIRE applies to label-free and molecular tag imaging, offering possibilities for optical sensing and imaging in biomedicine and materials science."

While high-resolution ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy has been demonstrated for slide-free histology, the imaging speed is insufficient, due to the low laser repetition rate and the limited depth of field. To address these challenges, we present parallel ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (PUV-PAM) with simultaneous scanning of eight optical foci to acquire histology-like images of slide-free fresh specimens, improving the ultraviolet PAM imaging speed limited by low laser repetition rates. The PUV-PAM has achieved an imaging speed of 0.4 square millimeters per second (i.e., 4.2 minutes per square centimeter) at 1.3-micrometer resolution using a 50-kilohertz laser. In addition, we demonstrated the PUV-PAM with eight needle-shaped beams for an extended depth of field, allowing fast imaging of slide-free tissues with irregular surfaces. We believe that the PUV-PAM approach will enable rapid intraoperative photoacoustic histology and provide prospects for ultrafast optical-resolution PAM."

We interpret multiparametric, quantitative, optical metabolic assessments in the context of microRNA gene set analysis and identify distinct metabolic changes in neurons and glial cells. Glycolysis, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) and glutathione synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and oxidation are mobilized within glial cells to mitigate the impacts of initial enhancements in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation within neurons, which lack robust antioxidant defenses.

However, its application to thick tissues has been restricted by its limited penetration depth within 300 μm, largely due to light scattering. Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to more than 700 μm in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber-based, low repetition rate, high peak power, three-photon excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having more than 0.5 megawatts peak power at the band of 1100 ± 25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the eightfold increase in pulse energy enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a substantial advance for deep and dynamic imaging of intact living biosystems.

Emerging methods using sequential rounds of staining, imaging, and signal removal can probe tens of targets but require specialized hardware and time-consuming workflows and face challenges with sample distortion and artifacts.

Pdots are small, bright, and photostable fluorescent probes with a wide range of tunable Stokes shifts (20 to 450 nanometers). Multiple series of Pdots with varying excitation wavelengths allow for fast (<1 minute) and single-round imaging of up to 21 targets in the brain and kidney.

The high solubility, compositional flexibility, and chemical robustness of HEMs offer pathways for using higher fractions of mixed and contaminated scrap and waste feedstocks, which are not admissible for synthesizing conventional materials.
