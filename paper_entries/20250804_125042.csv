Although two glows were detected at the same time, only one was ended by a discharge. Using advanced instruments such as the Ka-band vertically oriented Doppler radar and SEVAN detector, we gained new insights into the inner thunderstorm processes even in a cloud only 3 km in height. 
 This study presents the first-ever published detection of two parallel winter continental gamma-ray glows in Central Europe, observed during a rare winter thunderstorm on Milešovka hill, Czech Republic. The combination of the hill's altitude of 837 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and the low altitude of the winter thunderstorm cloud resulted in an observation very near the acceleration region inside the thundercloud. The event was captured using a combination of advanced instruments, including a Ka-band cloud profiler (which enabled a detailed analysis of the storm's microphysics), a SEVAN large-area scintillation detector for monitoring ionizing radiation, and a staffed professional meteorological observatory. The radar data indicated the alignment of ice crystals within the cloud, strongly suggesting the presence of a substantial electric field. The findings offer valuable insights into winter thunderstorm dynamics in continental climates, with broader implications for studying high-energy atmospheric physics."

Ruby Leung;Yun Qian;Wenjun Cui,A derecho climatology (2004–2021) in the United States based on machine learning identification of bow echoes,"We developed a high-resolution (4 km and hourly) observational derecho dataset over the United States east of the Rocky Mountains from 2004 to 2021 by using a mesoscale convective system dataset, bow echoes detected by a machine learning method, hourly gust speeds, and physically based identification criteria. 
 Due to their persistent widespread severe winds, derechos pose significant threats to human safety and property, with impacts comparable to many tornadoes and hurricanes. Yet, automated detection of derechos remains challenging due to the absence of spatiotemporally continuous observations and the complex criteria employed to define the phenomenon. This study presents an objective derecho detection approach capable of automatically identifying derechos through both observations and model results. The approach is grounded in a physically based definition of derechos and integrates three algorithms: (1) the Python Flexible Object Tracker (PyFLEXTRKR) algorithm to track mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), (2) a semantic segmentation convolutional neural network to identify bow echoes, and (3) a comprehensive classification algorithm to detect derechos within MCS life cycles and distinguish derecho-producing from non-derecho-producing MCSs. Using this approach, we developed a novel high-resolution (4 km and hourly) observational dataset of derechos and accompanying derecho-producing MCSs over the United States east of the Rocky Mountains from 2004 to 2021. The dataset consists of two subsets based on different gust speed data sources and is analyzed to document the climatology of derechos in the United States. On average, 12–15 derechos are identified per year, aligning with previous estimations (∼6–21 events annually). The spatial distribution and seasonal variation patterns are consistent with prior studies, showing peak occurrences in the Great Plains and the Midwest during the warm season. Additionally, during the study period, derechos account for approximately 3.1 % of measured damaging gusts (≥25.93 m s−1) over the eastern United States.

With milk sampled from 2020 to 2024, the temporal trends and cross-country variations of legacy and emerging PFAS were investigated across 15 countries for the first time. Among the 32 PFAS analyzed, 26 were detected in more than 40% of the samples and 18 were present in over 60%, indicating their widespread geographical occurrence. Over the five-year period, concentrations of legacy PFAS declined significantly (p < 0.05), with a reduction rate of 85.9%, whereas emerging PFAS─particularly hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer (HFPO-DA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (6:2 FTS)─increased sharply by 251% and 146%. Based on these observed trends, we further projected PFAS concentrations in milk through 2030 using three statistical models, revealing a potential dominance of emerging PFAS in the near future. Notably, spatial differences in PFAS distribution appear to be associated with intensive industrialization and socioeconomic activities. Furthermore, a risk prioritization analysis integrating eight exposure and toxicity domains identified HFPO-DA, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) as priority contaminants. These findings provide critical insights into global PFAS regulations, their effectiveness, and the urgent need for continuous monitoring of novel PFAS in future food supply."

In contrast, model simulations of 21st‐century stratospheric temperature changes show widespread cooling driven by increasing greenhouse gases, with local warming in the Antarctic lower stratosphere due to ozone healing. We provide evidence that these discrepancies between observed and simulated stratospheric temperature changes are linked to a slowdown of the Brewer‐Dobson Circulation, particularly in the SH. These changes in the stratospheric circulation are strongest from October through December. This altered circulation warms the SH subtropical lower stratosphere while cooling the Antarctic lower stratosphere, canceling and even reversing the Antarctic ozone recovery that would have occurred in its absence during this period. When circulation changes are accounted for, the SH subtropical lower‐stratospheric warming is removed, and Antarctic lower‐stratospheric warming is revealed with enhanced ozone healing, highlighting the crucial role of the stratospheric circulation in shaping temperature and ozone changes."

Waves with varying initial steepness, including regular wave patterns, mild spilling, and intense plunging breakers are examined. A two‐phase solver is employed to model exchange processes enabling precise estimation of the air‐water interface area and gas transfer velocity, achieving an accuracy unattainable in experiments. We show that the volume of gas transferred across the air‐water interface increases significantly with the amount of air entrained due to wave breaking, peak values in the transfer velocity being concurrent with peaks in energy dissipation rate and air entrainment. The gas transfer velocity is observed to scale approximately as the one‐fourth power of the energy dissipation rate, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. The present findings can help reduce the substantial uncertainty associated with the parametrization of fundamental natural processes, such as CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ absorption by the oceans."

Alterations potentially create positive climate feedback loops by enhancing production and emission of aquatic greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, N2O, and CH4. We tested this hypothesis by measuring dissolved CO2, N2O, and CH4 concentrations across the anthropogenic aquatic continuum (farm ponds, ditches, irrigation drains, streams, tidal rivers, and estuaries) and continuously during a winter storm. Combining measurements with hydrodynamic modeling enabled us to parameterize physical gas transfer uncertainties, revealing artificial waterways contributed disproportionately to emissions. Ditches and drains cover 5% of water surface area but produced >50% of emissions (2–11 Mmol d−1 CO2‐equivalents). But storms inverted this pattern by increasing estuary emissions 16‐fold (5.0 Mmol d−1 CO2‐equivalent), suggesting storm patterns could control both sources and magnitudes of aquatic GHG emissions.

Our analysis reveals that smoke plumes transport light‐absorbing aerosols aloft to the marine stratocumulus region, which triggers cooling and cloud fraction enhancement beneath. During the smoke impact, the cloud tops ascend until they reach the height of the strengthened inversion layer, where smoke intensifies the temperature gradient by heating above. Besides, when absorbing aerosols and the accompanied warming are present in lower layers, there is no evident cloud enhancement, highlighting the importance of smoke height to cloud adjustment. This study also examines the fire smoke impacts on the diurnal cycle of stratocumulus and the boundary layer. The smoke may mitigate the cloud breakup in the afternoon, when wildfire aerosols locally heat the atmosphere above the clouds and reduce downward entrainment into the clouds by strengthening the inversion. During nighttime, the surface temperature shows a more rapid warming under smoke perturbation. Combined with the cooling at the cloud layer, this results in the boundary layer deepening more during nighttime than during the day. Meanwhile, intensified convection leads to an increased rate of water supply to the stratocumulus clouds at night."

A thorough investigation into their formation mechanisms is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of weather forecasts and improving disaster prevention capabilities. Based on the hourly precipitation data from the CMORPH data set and the ERA5 data set, this study adopts a moving coordinate system to reconstruct the thermo‐dynamic fields associated with rainfall centers, systematically revealing the diversity of formation mechanisms behind EHR in the MLYB during the summers of 2013–2022. The findings reveal three distinct categories of EHR in the MLYB based on their dominant formation mechanisms: frontogenesis‐driven, jet‐driven, and frontal‐instability‐driven EHR, with the jet‐driven EHR being the most frequent. Frontogenesis‐driven EHR is maintained by wind‐field deformation: stretching and shearing of the flow intensify temperature gradients, which in turn strengthen the frontal zone. In jet‐driven EHR, intense coupling between upper‐ and lower‐level jets, along with pronounced super‐geostrophic characteristics, generates robust dynamic lifting. Frontal‐instability‐driven EHR is characterized by substantial convective available potential energy accumulation concurrent with frontal system influences. Frontogenesis‐driven rainfall occurs with comparable frequency in both the morning and afternoon. Jet‐driven EHR predominantly occurs in the morning while frontal‐instability‐driven EHR is concentrated in the afternoon. This temporal distribution exhibits a significant relationship with their respective dominant formation mechanisms. The findings of this study can enhance the understanding of the formation mechanisms of EHR and provide valuable insights for improving the forecasting of EHR in the MLYB."

Traditional wind field retrieval methods, relying on spatial homogeneity assumptions, often fail to resolve wind vectors at meter‐scale resolutions due to significant errors under rapidly changing wind conditions and small‐scale wind shear. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative Variable Frozen Grid (VFG) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts grid sizes based on wind shear intensity while leveraging regional homogeneity assumptions. As wind shear intensifies, the algorithm reduces grid dimensions to capture finer spatial variations, thereby enhancing retrieval accuracy. Additionally, Gaussian smoothing is applied to refine wind vectors, ensuring spatial continuity and smoothness. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the VFG algorithm, achieving a root mean square error of 0.42 m/s for wind speed and 12.19° for wind direction. Compared to conventional methods, the VFG algorithm reduces wind speed errors by 12%–25% and direction errors by up to 11% under varying wind shear conditions. This advancement enables robust meter‐scale wind vector retrieval in complex scenarios, providing a foundational tool for high‐resolution atmospheric studies and applications in aerospace safety, weather forecasting, and low‐altitude economy."

This study evaluates a large ensemble of multiscale simulations, including large‐eddy simulations (LES), using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) over Perdigão, Portugal, driven by boundary conditions from multiple global data sets. Simulations are compared with data from the Perdigão field campaign, including radiosonde and flux tower measurements. Results show that LES, using high‐resolution topography and land use data, better replicate flow features and dynamics, providing valuable insights for wind resource quantification and mapping. We identify that model performance varies spatially. The RMSE of wind speed at 10 m at ridge towers is 5.65 m s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$, while at valley towers, it is lower (2.28 m s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$), and variation across runs is greater for higher wind speeds. Temporally, surface winds show substantial variability throughout the day, posing greater modeling challenges during nighttime and synoptic transitions. This variability is not observed at 100 m, where topographic effects are less dominant and RMSE remains consistent across runs. Simulations driven by hourly boundary conditions perform best. However, drawing general conclusions about optimal turbulence modeling in the gray zone remains challenging due to microscale meteorology in complex terrain. Wind field characteristics are sensitive to turbulence scheme choice, particularly in the boundary layer, while above it, wind behavior is mainly influenced by boundary conditions. These results help identify key factors driving model variability and biases, which may guide future model developments to enhance wind flow simulation accuracy and reliability."

The NPF frequency was low (∼11 %), especially during winter (∼1 %), which may be due to high CS (annual average of 0.022 s−1), high RH (annual average of ∼73 %), and low gaseous sulfuric acid concentration. Since RH was persistently high in Wuhan, wet CS that considers the hygroscopic growth of particles can predict the occurrence of NPF more accurately than the commonly-used dry CS. The formation rate of 10 nm particles (J10, annual average of 0.59 cm−3 s−1) and growth rate (GR) of 10–25 nm particles (annual average of 4.6 nm h−1) was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter, while GR > 25nm showed the opposite seasonal variations, indicating their different precursors or growth mechanisms. Long-distance trajectory from Northwest brings air masses with low wet CS and corresponds to the highest NPF frequency (38 %). This study provides the basis for subsequent research on particle number concentration in highly-humid cities."

 Reliable modeling of heavy rainfall events is required for accurate flood prediction. This study evaluated the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in simulating heavy rainfall events that occurred on July 17, 2022 in the Sahelian region of Zinder in Niger. We performed a sensitivity study using various cumulus and microphysical schemes. We evaluated the reliability of the WRF model using different statistical approaches, including the probability of detection, false alarm ratio, success ratio, frequency bias, and critical success index. At the synoptic scale, atmospheric conditions were favorable for heavy precipitation in the Zinder region. Intense moisture transport from the southwest, high precipitable water values (≥ 50 kg/m2), strong wind shear (10–15 m/s) and convective instability indicators (high K index and low convective inhibition) contributed to the initiation and intensification of convection. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) analysis confirmed the presence of strong convective activity and an active easterly wave, which strengthened the organization of convective systems. The evaluation analysis showed that the model effectively captured the spatial pattern of heavy rainfall in all ensemble member simulations. When combined with the Purdue Lin (PL), Morrison-2 moment (M2), and New Thomson (TS) microphysical schemes, the Tiedkte (TK) cumulus scheme outperformed other convective schemes. The WRF model has the potential to improve the prediction of heavy rainfall events in Niger and to inform decision-making processes."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108394,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了利用中国风云三号E星（FY-3E）的微波湿度计-2（MWHS-2）的辐射数据，通过三维混合集合变分（3DEnVar）数据同化系统，结合地表湿度作为控制变量，对台风“杜苏芮”的预报和分析的影响。研究表明，同化FY-3E MWHS-2数据，并耦合地表湿度，可以显著提高台风预报的准确性，尤其是在路径、中心气压和最大风速的预测方面。该研究还确定了流动依赖背景误差协方差的最佳权重为50%，并发现耦合地表湿度的数据同化系统在降低风、温度和比湿的均方根误差（RMSE）和偏差方面表现更好。此外，地表湿度的引入也改善了降水分布和强度的模拟，特别是在24小时累积降水量超过25毫米的降水事件中。,"['FY-3E MWHS-2', 'radiance data assimilation', '3DEnVar', 'surface humidity', 'typhoon forecast', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric humidity']",Feifei Shen;Xiaolin Yuan;Haiyan Fei;Changliang Shao;Dongmei Xu;Qilong Sun,The impact of assimilating FY-3E MWHS-2 within 3DEnVar with surface humidity control variable on the forecast of Typhoon Doksuri,"•Assimilating FY-3E MWHS-2 radiance via 3DEnVar with coupled surface humidity control enhances typhoon Doksuri forecasts. •3DEnVar with 50 % weight optimizes forecast accuracy, reducing track, central pressure, and maximum wind speed errors. •3DEnVar coupled surface humidity control improves wind, temperature, and specific humidity forecasts. 
 In this study, FY-3E MWHS-2 radiance data are assimilated using the Hybrid Three-Dimensional Ensemble Variational (3DEnVar) data assimilation (DA) system with surface humidity (SH) coupled as an extended control variable to investigate the impact on the forecast and analysis of typhoon Doksuri. The efficiency of adjusting low level humidity is confirmed by a single temperature observation test. Nine experiments were conducted to assess the impact of coupled versus uncoupled SH configurations on the data assimilation system performance, and the effect of different weights assigned to the flow-dependent background error covariance on forecast accuracy. The results show that the assimilation of FY-3E MWHS-2 data within the 3DEnVar system coupled SH significantly improves the accuracy of typhoon forecasts. This improvement is particularly evident in the forecasted track, central pressure, and maximum wind speed. In this study, the optimal weight of the flow-dependent background error covariance was determined to be 50 %, which resulted in the lowest average errors in track (36.73 km), central pressure (17.37 hPa), and maximum wind speed (−11.56 m/s). Moreover, the DA system coupled SH demonstrated better performance in reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) and BIAS across the zonal component of wind (U-wind), meridional component of wind (V-wind), temperature, and specific humidity. Additionally, the introduction of SH has positively influenced the simulation of precipitation distribution and intensity, it specifically improves the simulation accuracy for precipitation events with a 24-h accumulated amount exceeding 25 mm."

 Satellite-based precipitation products play a crucial role in providing global, continuous, and reliable estimates of rainfall, essential for understanding and managing Earth’s water cycle. This study evaluates the accuracy of three H SAF satellite products (H61B, H64, and H68) and compares their performance with IMERG V06B (Early and Late Runs) products in detecting and estimating extreme precipitation events in the western Mediterranean region. The analysis is based on hourly and daily rainfall data collected from 186 rain gauges in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), using a point-to-pixel approach. The results show that satellite estimates tend to overestimate low precipitation accumulations (less than 2 mm and 10 mm in one hour and one day respectively), with this overestimation being more evident in the H68 product at the hourly scale and in IMERG Late at the daily scale. However, all products show a substantial decline in accuracy for higher precipitation amounts, particularly when they exceed 10 mm in one hour and 30 mm in one day (relative errors up to −60% and critical success index less than 33% in all cases). Despite its biases, IMERG Late product emerged as the most reliable for detecting substantial rainfall accumulations. Additionally, this analysis examined the relationship between the microphysical properties of the precipitating cloud top and estimated or observed surface precipitation. Accurate precipitation estimates from the satellite products were consistently associated with high values of Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Ice Water Path (IWP), while false alarms were often linked to low values of these variables. As expected, the results indicated a poorer performance in estimating precipitation associated with warm clouds. Additionally, these findings highlight the importance of integrating cloud optical and microphysical properties into retrieval algorithms to improve satellite precipitation estimates."
