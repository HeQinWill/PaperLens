We show a polar vortex strengthening in winter 1, followed by a weakening in winters 2–3 due to surface cooling, where ocean–atmosphere interactions play a major role in the detected response. This weakening appears to trigger sudden stratospheric warming events that can cause severe cold spells throughout the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Stratospheric aerosols after major explosive volcanic eruptions can trigger climate anomalies for up to several years following such events. Whereas the mechanisms responsible for the prolonged response to volcanic surface cooling have been extensively investigated for tropical eruptions, less is known about the dynamical response to high-latitude eruptions. Here we use global climate model simulations of an idealized 6-month-long Northern Hemisphere high-latitude eruption to investigate the stratospheric circulation response during the first three post-eruption winters. Two model configurations are used, coupled with an interactive ocean and with prescribed sea-surface temperature. Our results reveal significant differences in the response of the polar stratosphere with an interactive ocean: the surface cooling is enhanced and zonal flow anomalies are stronger in the troposphere, which impacts atmospheric waveguides and upward propagation of large-scale planetary waves. We identify two competing mechanisms contributing to the post-eruption evolution of the polar vortex: (1) a local stratospheric top-down mechanism whereby increased absorption of aerosol-induced thermal radiation yields a polar vortex strengthening via thermal wind response and (2) a bottom-up mechanism whereby anomalous surface cooling yields a wave-activity flux increase that propagates into the winter stratosphere. We detect an unusually high frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings in the simulations with interactive ocean temperatures that calls for further exploration. In the coupled runs, the top-down mechanism dominates over the bottom-up mechanism in winter 1, while the bottom-up mechanism dominates in the follow-up winters."

The results showed lower amplitudes of δ18O during the southwest monsoon and higher amplitudes of δ18O during the northeast monsoon. Sea surface evaporation and regional convective activity influenced the isotopic compositions. Our results facilitate an understanding of the impacts of local meteorological conditions on tropical water vapor isotope signals. 
 Atmospheric water vapor stable isotopes are crucial for understanding hydrological cycle processes under climate change. This study presents the results from a year-long in situ monitoring of atmospheric water vapor stable isotopes (δ18O, δD) at Matara, Sri Lanka, from March 2020 to February 2021 to assess how oceanic sources and moisture transport influence coastal atmospheric moisture isotopic composition. We identified clear seasonal patterns in the isotopic composition, with δ18O, δD, and d-excess showing substantial variation between the southwest and northeast monsoon periods. The primary moisture sources were the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean during the southwest monsoon (May to September), characterized by small amplitude fluctuations of δ18O (−20.4 ‰ to −9.1 ‰). During the northeast monsoon, the northern Bay of Bengal, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia were primary moisture sources, resulting in large-amplitude fluctuations in δ18O (−23.9 ‰ to −7.5 ‰) and higher d-excess values (up to 25 ‰). The study also identified significant influences of sea surface temperature and sea surface relative humidity on the isotopic composition of water vapor. Additionally, we could use outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to gauge the intensity of convective activity. Observational periods with low OLR, indicative of stronger and deeper convection, were associated with air masses that were more depleted in δ18O than periods with high OLR. These findings facilitate a better understanding of how the monsoon and local meteorological conditions affect water vapor isotope compositions in tropical regions. Furthermore, the new dataset will enable us to improve water vapor isotopic modeling and projections of atmospheric processes in coastal regions."

Floutsi;Hannes Griesche;Kevin Ohneiser;Julian Hofer;Martin Radenz;Holger Baars;Patric Seifert;Ulla Wandinger,Invisible aerosol layers: improved lidar detection capabilities by means of laser-induced aerosol fluorescence,"In this study, we discuss the enhanced detection capabilities of a fluorescence lidar in the case of optically thin aerosol layers in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. Our results suggest that such thin aerosol layers are not so rare in the UTLS and can potentially trigger and impact cirrus cloud formation through heterogeneous ice nucleation. By altering the microphysical cloud properties, this could affect clouds' evolution and lifetime and thus their climate effect. 
 One of the most powerful instruments for studying aerosol particles and their interactions with the environment is atmospheric lidar. In recent years, fluorescence lidar has emerged as a useful tool for identifying aerosol particles due to its link with biological content. Since 2022, this technique has been implemented in Leipzig, Germany. This paper describes the experimental setup and data analysis, with a special emphasis on the characterization of the new fluorescence channel centered at 466 nm. The new capabilities of the fluorescence lidar are examined and corroborated through several case studies. Most of the measurement cases considered are from the spring and summer of 2023, when large amounts of biomass-burning aerosol from huge forest fires in Canada were transported to Europe. The fluorescence of the observed aerosol layers is characterized. For wildfire smoke, the fluorescence capacity was typically in the range of 2×10-4–7 × 10−4, which aligns well with the values reported in the literature. The key aspects of this study are the capabilities of the fluorescence lidar technique, which can potentially improve not only the typing but even the detection of aerosol particles. In several measurement cases with an apparently low aerosol load, the fluorescence channel clearly revealed the presence of aerosol layers that were not detectable with the traditional elastic-backscatter channels. This capability is discussed in detail and linked to the fact that fluorescence backscattering is related to aerosol particles only. A second area of potential of the fluorescence technique is the distinction between non-activated aerosol particles and hydrometeors, given water's inability to exhibit fluorescence. A smoke–cirrus case study suggests an influence of the aerosol layer on cloud formation, as it seems to affect the elastic-backscatter coefficient within the cloud passing time. These aforementioned applications promise huge advancements towards a more detailed view of the aerosol–cloud interaction problem."

Varon,A data-efficient deep transfer learning framework for methane super-emitter detection in oil and gas fields using the Sentinel-2 satellite,"We target the challenge of detecting methane super-emitters in oil and gas fields, which is critical for mitigating climate change. Traditional satellite-based detectors struggle due to interference from complex surfaces. We developed a novel method using deep transfer learning that improves detection efficiency and accuracy by reducing artifacts and adapting methane knowledge to different regions. Application revealed significant methane emissions, demonstrating the potential of our method. 
 Efficiently detecting large methane point sources (super-emitters) in oil and gas fields is crucial for informing stakeholder decisions about mitigation actions. Satellite measurements by multispectral instruments, such as Sentinel-2, offer global and frequent coverage. However, methane signals retrieved from satellite multispectral images are prone to surface and atmospheric artifacts that vary spatially and temporally, making it challenging to build a detection algorithm that applies everywhere. Hence, laborious manual inspection is often necessary, hindering widespread deployment of the technology. Here, we propose a novel deep-transfer-learning-based methane plume detection framework. It consists of two components: an adaptive artifact removal algorithm (low-reflectance artifact detection, LRAD) to reduce artifacts in methane retrievals and a deep subdomain adaptation network (DSAN) to detect methane plumes. To train the algorithm, we compile a dataset comprising 1627 Sentinel-2 images from six known methane super-emitters reported in the literature. We evaluate the ability of the algorithm to discover new methane sources with a suite of transfer tasks, in which training and evaluation data come from different regions. Results show that DSAN (average macro F1 score 0.86) outperforms four convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MethaNet (average macro F1 score 0.70), ResNet-50 (average macro F1 score 0.77), VGG16 (average macro F1 score 0.73), and EfficientNet-V2L (average macro F1 score 0.78), in transfer tasks. The transfer learning algorithm overcomes the issue of conventional CNNs, which is their performance degrades substantially in regions outside regions with training data. We apply the algorithm trained with known sources to an unannotated region in the Algerian Hassi Messaoud oil field and reveal 34 anomalous emission events during a 1-year period, which are attributed to three methane super-emitters associated with production and transmission infrastructure. These results demonstrate the potential of our deep-transfer-learning-based method in contributing towards efficient methane super-emitter discovery using Sentinel-2 across different oil and gas fields worldwide."

Stability during atmospheric transformation processes is crucial for predicting their environmental fate and assessing the associated risks. Here, we conducted field studies and laboratory simulation experiments to reveal the mechanisms, influencing factors and products for XPAHs' heterogeneous phototransformation. Results revealed that the conversion of XPAHs led to a reduction in environmental risk. 
 Chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (XPAHs) are emerging pollutants widely found in atmospheric particulate matter (PM).  However, their environmental transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we collected PM samples of varying sizes over a year for XPAH analysis and found that the average concentrations of XPAHs peaked in winter and were dominated by the contribution of PM1 (particulate matter ≤ 1 µm in aerodynamic diameter) (47.0 %). Correlation analysis with relevant meteorological parameters showed strong associations between XPAH fluctuations and PM, temperature and humidity. Hence, controlled laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the influence of particle size, sunlight duration, temperature, humidity and oxidant concentrations on XPAHs. Our results indicated that the transformation rates of XPAHs were influenced by the parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures (with phenanthrene < fluoranthene < pyrene < benz[a]anthracene ≈ anthracene < benzo[a]pyrene) as well as the substitution of halogens (chlorinated < brominated). Furthermore, the photoirradiation promoted the heterogeneous transformation of XPAHs; this process was accelerated by the increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species and elevated temperature, peaking at a humidity level of 45 %. The transformation products were identified by nontarget analysis. According to that, we then proposed phototransformation pathways for XPAHs, suggesting a mechanism involving dehalogenation followed by oxidation. Predictions were made regarding the persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transportation, and toxicities of XPAHs and their transformation products, showing a decrement in environmental risk as the transformation progressed. This study provides novel insights into the primary influencing factors for particulate XPAH variations and the mechanisms of heterogeneous phototransformation."

Here, we established a hierarchical quantitative analysis framework to understand the driving factors of aerosol acidity on different timescales. Its application in Changzhou, China, revealed distinct driving factors and corresponding mechanisms of aerosol acidity from annual trends to random residuals. 
 Aerosol acidity (or pH) plays a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry, influencing the interaction of air pollutants with ecosystems and climate. Aerosol pH shows large temporal variations, while the driving factors of chemical profiles versus meteorological conditions are not fully understood due to their intrinsic complexity. Here, we propose a new framework to quantify factor importance, which incorporated an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach and time series analysis. In particular, a hierarchical influencing factor relationship is established based on the multiphase buffer theory with ISM. A long-term (2018–2023) observation dataset in Changzhou, China, is analyzed with this framework. We found the pH temporal variation is dominated by the seasonal and random variations, while the long-term pH trend varies little despite the large emission changes.  This is an overall effect of decreasing PM2.5, increasing temperature and increased alkali-to-acid ratios. Temperature is the controlling factor of pH seasonal variations, through influencing the multiphase effective acid dissociation constant Ka∗, non-ideality cni and gas–particle partitioning. Random variations are dominated by the aerosol water contents through Ka∗ and chemical profiles through cni. This framework provides quantitative understanding of the driving factors of aerosol acidity at different levels, which is important in acidity-related process studies and policy-making."

During a 5 d field campaign in the Mount Qomolangma region, we performed 15 flights using the device mounted on a hexacopter unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV). A total of 139 samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph. Vertical profiles of four greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)) were analyzed and discussed. 
 Understanding the vertical profile of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is crucial for elucidating their sources and sinks, transport pathways, and influence on Earth's radiative balance, as well as for enhancing predictive capabilities for climate change. Remote sensing methods for measuring vertical GHG profiles often involve substantial uncertainties, while in situ measurements are limited by high equipment costs and operational expenses, rendering them impractical for long-term continuous observation efforts. In this study, we have developed an automatic low-cost and user-friendly multi-altitude atmospheric sampling device designed for small- and medium-sized unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs), balloons, and other flight platforms. A field campaign was carried out in the Mount Qomolangma (also known as Mount Everest) region, at an average surface altitude of 4300 m above sea level (a.s.l.). During the campaign, we conducted 15 flights and collected 139 samples from the ground surface up to a height of 1215 m using a hexacopter UAV platform equipped with the sampling device. The samples were analyzed using the Agilent gas chromatography (GC) 7890A instrument, enabling the derivation of the vertical profiles for four GHG species (CO2, CH4, N2O, and SF6) within the boundary layer of the Mount Qomolangma region. To enable long-term monitoring using small UAVs, future efforts should prioritize reducing the weight of the equipment and improving the sampling efficiency."

 Monitoring global radiation resources relies on sunshine duration (SD) as an important indicator; however, research examining high-resolution SD data is scarce. This study established a daily 5 km SD dataset in China from 2016 to 2023 using Himawari's Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) Level 3 shortwave radiation fitted with the Ångström–Prescott model based on a time series. We used ground-measured SD at 2380 Chinese Meteorological Administration stations to verify the SD dataset accuracy. The results of the testing set indicate that the average correlation coefficient between the SD from the estimation and ground measurements was 0.88. Additionally, we investigated the effects of wind speed, vapour pressure, precipitation, aerosol optical depth, and cloud capacity on the estimation performance of SD and found that temperature had the greatest effect. We also found that cloud capacity that was both too low and too high, and wind speed that was too high affected SD estimation on an average annual scale.

The evaluation and validation results confirm the reliability of this dataset. The altimeter-based virtual stations along the world’s coastlines can be built using this dataset to monitor the coastal sea level changes where tide gauges are unavailable. Therefore, it is beneficial for both oceanographic communities and policymakers. 
 A new dedicated 20 Hz coastal sea level dataset, called the International Altimetry Service 2024 (IAS2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13208305, Peng et al., 2024c), is presented for monitoring sea level changes along the world's coastlines. One of the reasons for generating this dataset is that the quality of coastal altimeter data has been greatly improved with advanced coastal reprocessing strategies. In this study, the Seamless Combination of Multiple Retrackers (SCMR) strategy is adopted to obtain the reprocessed Jason data from January 2002 to April 2022. The evaluation/validation results show that the IAS2024 20 Hz along-track coastal sea level dataset achieves good performance over global coastal oceans. The good consistency between IAS2024 and independent altimeter datasets, including the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative version 2.4 (ESA CCI v2.4) 20 Hz along-track coastal sea level dataset and the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service Level-3 (CMEMS L3) 1 Hz along-track sea level dataset, is observed. The closure of sea level trend differences (0.16 ± 3.97 mm yr−1) between IAS2024 and Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) tide gauge data at the global scale is also achieved. Moreover, 1548 virtual stations have been constructed using the IAS2024 coastal sea level dataset, which will contribute to the analysis of coastal sea levels for the ocean community and to risk management for the policymakers. Our study also finds that no obvious variations exist in the linear sea level trends from the offshore to the coast over the last 20 km coastal strip at the global scale. In addition, the vertical land motion (VLM) estimates from the combination of the IAS2024 dataset with the PSMSL tide gauge records agree well with the University of La Rochelle 7a (ULR7a) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) solution, with the mean difference of VLM estimates being 0.12 ± 2.27 mm yr−1, suggesting that altimeter-derived VLM estimates can be used as an independent data source to validate the GNSS solutions."

It is known that agriculture is an important source of ammonia (e.g. using fertilisers) and that South Asia is a global hotspot of this pollutant. It is, therefore, important to refine methods used to estimate how much ammonia is released in South Asia to be then used in advanced chemistry models for air quality assessments. 
 Emissions of ammonia (NH3) from agricultural activities are a major threat to ecosystems and human health. Its quantification via emissions inventories is vital to the understanding of mitigation strategies and policy formation. South Asia, specifically the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), is a global hotspot of NH3 emissions from agriculture but also an area of great uncertainty due to a lack of data that are representative of local practices. This study presents a framework into which indigenous data can be ingested to adjust such estimates, to provide spatially distributed (0.1° × 0.1°) emissions in five agricultural sectors for improved input data for atmospheric chemistry transport models, by moving away from Tier 1 methods for emission inventories. Results incorporate data such as lower emission factors of NH3 following the application of Urea (13 % of total nitrogen lost as NH3-N) to provide a total estimated emission of NH3 in the SAARC of ~6 Tg, with high values (> 5 g NH3 m-2 a-1) in the Indian states Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP)."

 Understanding global livestock dynamics is essential for global food security, public health, socio-economic and sustainable development. This study developed an automated global livestock mapping framework that integrated Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the Random Forest regression model. By implementing the mapping scheme on Google Earth Engine (GEE), we develop the first annual gridded livestock of the world (AGLW), covering the period from 1961 to 2021 at a spatial resolution of 5 km. The annual maps of AGLW were then evaluated from three perspectives: model level, finer-scale statistic level, and pixel level, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.54–0.73, 0.79–0.98, and 0.73–0.83, respectively. The AGLW maps reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of global livestocks over the past six decades, highlighting both global expansion and localized fluctuations, such as the notable increase in pig stock in China and the decline in horse stock in Poland. By offering a reliable and continuous dataset, AGLW overcomes the limitations of existing livestock mapping products in terms of spatio-temporal continuity and resolution. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for enhancing our understanding of global livestock dynamics, informing policy decisions, guiding sustainable agricultural practices, and promoting resilience in both ecological and human systems.

 In Italy, a complete and updated database including the most relevant structural information regarding reservoirs and characteristics of their upstream watersheds is currently missing. This paper tackles this gap by presenting the first comprehensive dataset of 528 large dams in Italy. Alongside structural details of the dams, such as coordinates, reservoir surface area and volume, the dataset also encompasses a range of geomorphological, climatological, extreme rainfall, land cover and soil-related attributes of their upstream catchments. The data used to create this dataset are partially sourced from the General Department of Dams and Hydro-Electrical Infrastructures as well as from the processing of updated and standardized grid data. These include a DEM from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, national-scale monthly maps of hydrological budget components, land cover and vegetation index data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service as well as high-resolution maps of soil particle size fractions. This dataset (Evangelista et al., 2024a; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12818297), which contains information not easily available in other similar global or national data collections, is expected to be of great help for a broad spectrum of hydrological applications, particularly those related to floods."

Schwab,Aerial Estimates of Methane and Carbon Dioxide Emission Rates Using a Mass Balance Approach in New York State,"Methane and carbon dioxide emission rates were calculated for facilities across several sectors in New York State using aerial observations. Of the sampled facilities, landfills dominated the methane emission rates while combustion facilities had the highest carbon dioxide emission rates, followed by landfills. The self-reported EPA inventory is mostly underestimating landfill methane emissions apart from a few facilities with comparable numbers. 
 Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories are vital for climate mitigation as they can identify areas of need and ensure effective policy and regulation in reducing GHG emissions. Several studies have shown that self-reporting GHG inventories are undercounting methane emissions across all anthropogenic sectors showcasing an increasing need to validate the inventory with direct measurements. This study carried out aerial observations and emission rates of methane and carbon dioxide across multiple sectors in New York State (NYS). Emission rates were calculated for each of the sources using a mass balance method and were subsequently compared to the 2021 Environmental Protection Agency GHG Reporting Program (EPA GHGRP) Inventory. Landfills were the source of the highest observed methane emission estimates, ranging from 161–3440 kg/hr. There was also significant variation in observed emissions within facilities between seasons indicating a significant influence from meteorology. Observed carbon dioxide emission estimates were dominated by combustion facilities followed by landfills. Comparisons with the inventory show that methane emissions averaged over ten observed landfills are underestimated by a factor of 2. However, out of the ten landfills, five landfills had observed methane emission estimates significantly higher than the inventory value, four landfills had an inventory value within the uncertainty range of the observations, and one landfill observed emission estimate was markedly lower than the reported inventory estimate. Seneca Meadows Landfill was the highest emitter from the measurements and was ~4.3x higher than what was reported to the 2021 EPA GHGRP Inventory. The difference in emissions between landfills could be due to operational differences or waste quantities. NYS can use this information to inform the NYS GHG Inventory and improve emission estimation methodologies to better depict actual emissions."

CHN-CH4, a map of anthropogenic methane emissions was created by combining satellite data, national statistics, and climate guidelines. Over 30 years, China emitted 1157 Tg of methane, peaking in the 2010s. Shanxi province had the highest emissions. CHN-CH4 helps improve tracking, informs global climate models, and strengthens collaboration between science and policy to combat climate change. 
 China is the largest emitter of global methane emissions, contributing about 10 % to anthropogenic climate change based on existing methane inventories. However, significant uncertainties in these statistics limit the accuracy at both national and sub-national scales. The lack of continuous gridded emissions inventories also constrains the inverse analysis of atmospheric observations. To address these, we present CHN-CH4, a spatially aggregated 0.1°×0.1° anthropogenic methane emission inventory for mainland China from 1990 to 2020. CHN-CH4 offers the country with new temporal coverage and details, by means of national statistical yearbooks and remote sensing products. Over the three decades, mainland China emitted 1156.689 [884.857–1413.315] Tg of methane, with the highest emission occurred in the last decade. But this decade also marked the beginning of a decreasing trend, from 45.017 [33.329–55.738] Tg in 2010 to 43.351 [32.089–52.679] Tg in 2020. As important priors, CHN-CH4 enables robust comparisons between estimated emissions and atmospheric observations, thereby improving the accuracy of inverse modelling, which is crucial for effective tracking of methane emissions. By providing a reliable and detailed emissions inventory, CHN-CH4 would be a valuable tool in accelerating the global effort to achieve equitable methane emission reduction goals, as well as supporting China’s climate policy."

Data collected, including time series from recordings up to 2020 and time series significantly enhancing data coverage at high elevations, were tested for quality and homogeneity. The dataset aims to serve as a powerful tool for better understanding climate change over the European Alpine region. 
 The Extended European Alpine Region (EEAR) exhibits a well-established and very high density network of in situ weather stations, hardly attained in other mountainous regions of the world. However, the strong fragmentation of the area into national and regional administrations and the diversity of data sources have hampered the full exploitation of the available data for climate research. Here, we present EEAR-Clim, a new observational dataset gathering in situ daily measurements of air temperature and precipitation from a variety of meteorological and hydrological services covering the whole EEAR. The data collected include time series from recordings of diverse lengths up to 2020, with the longest records spanning up to 200 years. The overall observational network encompasses about 9000 in situ weather stations, significantly enhancing data coverage at high elevations compared to existing datasets and achieving an average spatial density of one station per 6.8 km2 over the 1991–2020 period, the most covered by measurements. Data collected from many sources were tested for quality to ensure the internal, temporal, and spatial consistency of time series, including outlier removal. Data homogeneity was assessed through a cross-comparison of the break points detected by three methods that are well established in the literature, namely Climatol, ACMANT, and the RH test. Quantile matching was applied to adjust inhomogeneous periods in time series. Overall, about 4 % of data were flagged as unreliable, and about 20 % of air temperature time series were corrected for one or more inhomogeneous periods. In the case of precipitation time series, fewer break points were detected, confirming the well-known challenge of properly identifying inhomogeneities in noisy data. The high quality, homogeneity, unprecedented spatial density, and completeness of data and the inclusion of the most recent records are important add-on improvements compared to other observational products available for the EEAR. The dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10951609, Bongiovanni et al., 2024) aims to serve as a powerful tool to better understand climate change and climatic variability over the European Alps."

This study advances our understanding of the selection of basic parameters in the four-dimensional local ensemble transform Kalman filter assimilation system and the performance of ensemble simulation in a particulate-matter-polluted environment. 
 Accurately simulating severe haze events through numerical models remains a challenge because of uncertainty in anthropogenic emissions and physical parameterizations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). In this study, a coupled Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem)–four-dimensional local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4D-LETKF) data assimilation system has been successfully developed to optimize particulate matter concentration by assimilating hourly ground-based observations in winter over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region and surrounding provinces. The effectiveness of the 4D-LETKF system and its sensitivity to the ensemble member size and length of the assimilation window are investigated. The promising results show that significant improvements have been made by analysis in the simulation of particulate matter during a severe haze event. The assimilation reduces root mean square errors in PM2.5 from 69.93 to 31.19 µg m−3 and of PM10 from 106.88 to 76.83 µg m−3. Smaller root mean square errors and larger correlation coefficients in the analysis of PM2.5 and PM10 are observed across nearly all verification stations, indicating that the 4D-LETKF assimilation optimizes the simulation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration efficiently. Sensitivity experiments reveal that the combination of 48 h of assimilation window length and 40 ensemble members shows the best performance for reproducing the severe haze event. In view of the performance of ensemble members, an increasing ensemble member size improves ensemble spread among each forecasting member, facilitates the spread of state vectors about PM2.5 and PM10 information in the first guess, favors the variances between each initial condition in the next assimilation cycle, and leads to better simulation performance in both severe and moderate haze events. This study advances our understanding of the selection of basic parameters in the 4D-LETKF assimilation system and the performance of ensemble simulations in a particulate-matter-polluted environment."

The task of monitoring those impacts across the globe is formidable and must necessarily rely on satellites – at a significant cost: the measurements are only indirect and require comprehensive physical understanding. We have created a comprehensive modelling system that we offer to the research community to explore how satellite data can be better exploited to help us capture the changes that happen on our lands. 
 Advances in Earth observation capabilities mean that there is now a multitude of spatially resolved data sets available that can support the quantification of water and carbon pools and fluxes at the land surface. However, such quantification ideally requires efficient synergistic exploitation of those data, which in turn requires carbon and water land-surface models with the capability to simultaneously assimilate several such data streams. The present article discusses the requirements for such a model and presents one such model based on the combination of the existing Data Assimilation Linked Ecosystem Carbon (DALEC) land vegetation carbon cycle model with the Biosphere Energy-Transfer HYdrology (BETHY) land-surface and terrestrial vegetation scheme. The resulting D&B model, made available as a community model, is presented together with a comprehensive evaluation for two selected study sites of widely varying climate. We then demonstrate the concept of land-surface modelling aided by data streams that are available from satellite remote sensing. Here we present D&B with four observation operators that translate model-derived variables into measurements available from such data streams, namely fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence  (SIF), vegetation optical depth (VOD) at microwave frequencies and near-surface soil moisture (also available from microwave measurements). As a first step, we evaluate the combined model system using local observations and finally discuss the potential of the system presented for multi-stream data assimilation in the context of Earth observation systems."

It remains unknown whether the unique alkyl–OH-6PPD-Q contributes to the toxicity of 6PPD-Q. To test this, we herein synthesized chemical standards of alkyl–OH-6PPD-Q isomers and investigated their metabolic formation mechanism and toxicity. The predominant alkyl–OH-6PPD-Q was confirmed to be hydroxylated on the C4 tertiary carbon (C4–OH-6PPD-Q). The formation of C4–OH-6PPD-Q was only observed in microsomal but not in cytosolic fractions of rainbow trout (O. mykiss) liver S9. A general cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited the formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q, supporting that CYP450 catalyzed the hydroxylation. This well-explained the compound- and regio-selective formation of C4–OH-6PPD-Q, due to the weak C–H bond on the C4 tertiary carbon. Surprisingly, while cytotoxicity was observed for 6PPD-Q and C3–OH-6PPD-Q in a coho salmon (O. kisutch) embryo (CSE-119) cell line, no toxicity was observed for C4–OH-6PPD-Q. To further confirm this under physiologically relevant conditions, we fractionated 6PPD-Q metabolites formed in the liver microsome of rainbow trout. Cytotoxicity was observed for the fraction of 6PPD-Q, but not the fraction of C4–OH-6PPD-Q. In summary, this study highlighted the C4 tertiary carbon as the key moiety for both metabolism and toxicity of 6PPD-Q and confirmed that alkyl hydroxylation is a detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q."

Aiming to identify potential replacement antiozonants for 6PPD that do not produce toxic quinones, seven PPD-quinones with distinct side chains were synthesized to investigate their structure-related toxicities in vivo using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). While 6PPD-Q exerted high toxicity (96 h LC50 = 0.35 μg/L), toxicity was not observed for six other PPD-quinones despite their similar structures. The fish tissue concentrations of 6PPD-Q after sublethal exposure (0.29 μg/L) were comparable to the other PPD-quinones, which indicated that bioaccumulation levels were not the reason for the selective toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Hydroxylated PPD-quinones were detected as the predominant metabolites in fish tissue. Interestingly, a single major aromatic hydroxylation metabolite was detected for the alternate PPD-quinones, but two abundant OH-6PPD-Q isomers were detected for 6PPD-Q. MS2 spectra confirmed that hydroxylation occurred on the alkyl side chain for one isomer. The structurally selective toxicity of 6PPD-Q was also observed in a coho salmon (CSE-119) cell line, which further supports its intrinsic toxicity.

Logistic regression assessed individual metabolites, while quantile-g computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression analyzed mixture effects on binary outcomes. Individual analysis showed that MnBP (mono-n-butyl phthalate) was positively associated with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and eosinophil ≥ 300 cells/μL, while ∑DBP (dibutyl phthalate) and OH-MiNP (mono-hydroxy-isononyl phthalate) were linked with FeNO ≥ 35 ppb.

However, an effective framework for identifying these taxa from numerous high-throughput sequencing data is still lacking, particularly without the challenging task of reconstructing the detailed microbial correlation network. We developed a deep learning framework that quantifies microbial impact values across samples, bypassing network reconstruction. This algorithm effectively avoids the tricky issue of differing keystoneness across species in various samples, making it applicable to AS assemblage samples from various environmental and climatic conditions. In this work, we applied this framework to the high-throughput sequencing of the global wastewater treatment sample and identified 61 candidate taxa as the keystones for the wastewater treatment process. We found that the temperature and dissolved oxygen are the primary factors influencing the keystone taxa. Moreover, we found that the increased connectivity of keystone taxa with other members promotes tighter integration within the activated sludge microbial community. In summary, this study introduces an expeditious framework for efficient keystone taxa identification and reveals their role in enhancing microbial community integration in wastewater treatment systems."

In this study, following detection of PPD-Qs in human blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we investigated their toxicities to the blood–brain barrier (BBB). After ethical approval and signed informed consent, 27 participants were enrolled, and 20 blood and 20 CSF samples were collected. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-3Q-MS) was used to detect the PPD-Qs in the samples. Cell biology and molecular biology technologies were applied to investigate the toxicological effects and the mechanisms of PPD-Qs on the BBB model by using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC-D3). PPD-Qs were frequently detected in both extracts of serum and CSF samples, with 6PPD-Q, N-isopropyl-N′-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine-quinone (IPPD-Q), and N,N′-bis(1,4-dimethylpentyl)-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (77PD-Q) being the most abundant. 77PD-Q and IPPD-Q exhibited greater toxicity compared with 6PPD-Q. 6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q, and 77PD-Q led to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells by upregulating PAI-1, resulting in BBB dysfunction.

The surface properties of atmospheric aerosol particles can influence several of their chemical and physical impacts, including their hygroscopic growth, aerosol–cloud interactions, and heterogeneous chemical reactions. The effects of the various compounds within a particle on its surface tension depend in part on the pure-component surface tensions. For many of the myriad of organic compounds of interest, experimental pure-component surface tension data at tropospheric temperatures are lacking, thus, requiring the development and application of property estimation methods. In this work, a compiled database of experimental pure-component surface tension data, covering a wide range of organic compound classes and temperatures, is used to train four different types of machine learning models to predict the temperature-dependent pure-component surface tensions of atmospherically relevant organic compounds. The trained models process input information about the temperature and the molecular structure of an organic compound, initially in the form of a Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string, to enable predictions. Our quantitative model assessment shows that extreme gradient-boosted descent along with Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) key descriptors of molecular structure provided the best balance of derived input complexity and model performance, resulting in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ∼1 mJ m–2 in pure-component surface tension. Additionally, a simplified model based on molar mass, elemental ratios, and temperature as inputs was developed for use in applications for which molecular structure information is incomplete (RMSE of ∼2 mJ m–2). We demonstrate that including predicted pure-component surface tension values in thermodynamically rigorous bulk–surface partitioning calculations may substantially modify the critical supersaturations necessary for aerosol activation into cloud droplets."

The role of the sea surface microlayer (SML) in mediating these exchanges was investigated. Samples were collected across a latitude gradient in the Pacific Ocean, and 16S rRNA gene and transcript sequences from surface seawater (SW), SML, and atmospheric samples were analyzed. The genomic signature varied diurnally and spatially, with the SW community being the most consistent and the air community the most variable. The SML displayed genomic characteristics intermediate between SW and air. The 16S rRNA transcript signature, a proxy for active microbial communities, showed tight clustering in the air and SML, suggesting selective control compared to SW. The transcriptional community composition in the air clustered between the SML and SW, pointing to viable non-SML-mediated exchange. Furthermore, taxa from air- and marine-associated communities showed a gradient of presence through all three environments, suggesting an exchange of key species through the SML. Additionally, certain volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere demonstrated a noteworthy relationship with specific bacterial taxa in the SML. This study improves our understanding of the role of the SML in ocean–atmosphere exchanges of marine bacteria and highlights how microbial communities travel and best utilize their environment."

To better understand their toxicity, we exposed four generations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastics (<38 μm) and monitored their reproductive performance. We found that the eclosion fraction of pupae was 5.7% higher (p < 0.05) in the stream of flies that were fed 100 mg/kg HDPE across all generations when compared to those fed control food. Several fourth-generation treatment flies expressed malformed salivary glands and scutella. No toxicity was observed in the number of pupae and flies that emerged from the eggs laid in each generation or their mean pupation and eclosion time. Moreover, no toxicity was observed in the development of larvae into adult flies (0.1–10 000 mg/kg HDPE) and various sublethal end points (100 mg/kg HDPE) such as larva and adult fly locomotion and the mass of female and male flies. These results, obtained with realistic weathered microplastics, indicate that HDPE microplastics at the concentrations evaluated are unlikely to be lethal in Drosophila melanogaster; however malformations are still possible despite little-to-no observable internalization of the microplastics."

Our findings enrich this framework, revealing that a pIOD without El Niño can independently trigger IOB warming, and both types of pIODs can induce La Niña events. While El Niño primarily forces IOB warming and subsequent La Niña development via the atmospheric bridge across the Maritime Continent, pIODs independent of El Niño influence IOB warming through oceanic dynamics, which further favors La Niña development in the following year.

The result shows that the spring NAT is significantly positive correlated with the subsequent autumn tropical Pacific YFT catch per unit effort (CPUE). The spring NAT triggers eastward‐propagating Rossby waves, inducing VM‐like SSTAs in the North Pacific.

This study investigates how AUSM rainfall is affected by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) by simulating scenarios with a closed and an opened Drake Passage with the Community Earth System Model.

This analysis addresses a key DCOTSS science question, namely “How much tropospheric air and water is irreversibly injected into the stratosphere by convection?” A novel method for defining individual storms or a cluster of adjacent storms as objects and tracking them throughout their lifetime facilitates the analysis. Overshooting convection injected 3.92 × 106 – 5.36 × 106 km3 of air into the stratosphere in 2021 and 9.59 × 106 – 1.06 × 107 km3 in 2022 over the North American study domain with GOES being higher than GridRad during both years. GOES overshooting detections were more uncertain due to difficulty differentiating updrafts from adjacent broad areas of cold outflow. Overshooting volume from the top 10 storm objects each year contributed 37%–52% of the total domain‐wide volume. Total object‐lifetime volume from these events ranged from ∼1.3 × 105 to 7.9 × 105 km3 for GOES and ∼8.7 × 104 to 8.0 × 105 km3 for GridRad. Overshooting seldom exceeded 5% of the total anvil area, and most often occupied <1%, demonstrating that very small regions within convection are responsible for impacting stratosphere composition.

This study investigates haze pollution at an upwind site in Sonipat using advanced instrumentation during October 25 to 15 November 2023, encompassing biomass burning and Diwali events. Sudden spikes in pollutants caused severe haze, temporary reductions in pollution due to rainfall, and a resurgence of haze during Diwali. Two major haze episodes were identified, with particulate matter (PM2.5) levels exceeding 300 μg/m3. Organics dominated composition based PM2.5 (C‐PM2.5) followed by Black Carbon (BC), jointly accounting for ∼80% of total mass during all the episodes, with secondary inorganics contributed minimally. Limited day‐night variations and low inorganics contribution suggested minimal photochemical activity and secondary formation. Elevated levels of biomass burning tracers and emission ratios indicated aged, oxidized aerosols from crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana, supported by fire count data and 72‐hr backward trajectory analysis. Regional meteorology, including a shallow atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and low wind speeds, hindered pollutant dispersion, leading to accumulation and prolonged haze.

Here, we use diagnostics of local wave activity, waveguidability, and soil moisture‐temperature coupling to gain insights into the previously underexplored dynamic and land drivers underlying these early pre‐monsoon heatwave episodes. Our findings reveal a sudden surge in wave activity in the upper troposphere over the heatwave region during the first episode of the heatwave. The intensified wave activity results from strong transient waves, due to transfer of energy from the extratropical to the subtropical waveguide, leading to strong anticyclonic circulation. The April heatwave event, in contrast to the first episode, is found to be the result of a strong soil moisture‐temperature coupling over the heatwave region. Further, the low‐level winds revealed an advection of heat from highly coupled regions (Pakistan and Afghanistan) to the Indian landmass during the heatwave episode in April. Our findings indicate that waveguide interaction together with equatorward energy transfer drives early heat in March, subsequently setting the stage for further heat in the following weeks by depleting soil moisture levels."

An algorithm to identify and track MCSs was used to characterize simulated MCS features and compare with satellite observations. Our results show that WRF adequately represents the seasonal occurrence of MCSs, although large discrepancies arise during periods in which the Intertropical Convergence Zone migrates northward and southward. The complex diurnal cycles of MCS initiation and occurrence are well reproduced by the model, including in‐land nocturnal convection, oceanic hotspots during the morning, and an afternoon maximum in the flatlands. WRF reproduces the evolution of MCS size, minimum brightness temperature, and maximum rainfall through the lifecycle, but especially for short‐lived systems. In terms of MCS features, simulated and observed storms travel comparable distances, and both propagate westward with the trade winds. Notably, the model is able to capture higher MCS speeds on the Amazon‐Savannas flatlands and lower velocities over and to the west of the Andes. Nevertheless, WRF simulates smaller and shorter‐lived systems, while the rainfall intensity and the fraction of heavy rainfall are largely overestimated. A more detailed analysis showed that rainfall overestimation is especially marked in smaller MCS objects and during the development stage. After separating the results by region, we notice a marked overestimation of rainfall intensity in MCSs occurring east of the Andes, while the model underestimates the area of those occurring west of the Andes and in the ocean."

In this study, we analyzed the temporal variations in NOy and speciated compounds during eight intensive field campaigns and 6 years of continuous measurements during 2007–2023 at Mount Tai in the North China Plain (NCP). The measured concentration levels of NOy were significantly higher than those at other remote high‐altitude sites globally.

Vertical transport from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) substantially influences the atmosphere at Mount Tai, with air masses from both PBL and free troposphere containing different chemical compositions of NOy. The lower free troposphere above the NCP contained relatively high abundances of PAN and pNO3−.

Focused on the regional heatwaves over YHRB, independent daytime and compound heatwaves are mostly related to the atmospheric systems at middle and lower levels, including strengthened and westward western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) and the Pacific‐Japan/East Asia—Pacific (PJ/EAP) pattern, which benefits the sunny weather and downdrafts over YHRB. On the other hand, independent nighttime and compound heatwaves are influenced by the synoptic systems at higher levels, including northward and cyclonic meandering East Asian subtropical jet (EASJ), strengthened and eastward South Asian high (SAH), and positive phase of circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) pattern accompanied with cloudy weather and strengthened downward longwave radiation over north YHRB.

A recent observational effort into this mechanism, the Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical and CLimate Impact Project (ACCLIP), sampled the composition of the ASM UTLS over the northwestern Pacific region during boreal summer 2022 using two airborne platforms. In this work, we integrate Lagrangian trajectory modeling with convective cloud top observations to diagnose ASM convective transport which contributed to ACCLIP airborne observations. This diagnostic is applied to explore the properties of convective transport associated with prominent ASM sub‐systems, revealing that for species ranging in lifetime from days to months, transport from convection along the East Asia Subtropical Front was generally associated with more UTLS pollutants than transport from convection over South Asia. The convective transport diagnostic is used to isolate three convective transport events over eastern Asia which had distinct chemical tracer relationship behaviors, indicating the different economical behaviors of the contributing source regions. One of these transport events is explored in greater detail, where a polluted air mass was sampled from convection over the Northeast China Plain which may have been high enough in altitude to impact the composition of the stratosphere. Overall, the presented diagnosis of convective transport contribution to ACCLIP airborne sampling indicates a key scientific success of the campaign and enables process studies of the climate interactions from the two ASM sub‐systems."

Three simplified microphysics schemes available in 4D‐Var are assessed first, revealing that the new regularized WSM6 scheme performed relatively better in precipitation prediction. Meanwhile, precipitation data assimilation (DA) utilizing the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) V2.0 precipitation reanalysis product is evaluated against the experiments with conventional observations in DA and no assimilation. Results demonstrates that it seems that DA with precipitations is able to enhance the accuracy of precipitation forecasts. In addition, it is well known that one of the challenges in convective‐scale DA is to extract small‐scale information from the observations while maintaining the large‐scale balance and mitigating the growth and propagation of large‐scale errors. Therefore, the large‐scale analysis constraint (LSAC) is further introduced to improve precipitation forecasting. Results indicate that LSAC could effectively adjust large‐scale information, including temperature, humidity, and dynamic conditions, thereby improving the precipitation forecasting skills to some extent."

The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry is used to investigate potential causes of uncertainties in modeling Arctic BC for winter 2014. The model captures observed variability in BC at surface sites, reproducing BC concentrations at Zeppelin but showing a low bias at Tiksi, Alert, and Utqiaġvik/Barrow. The influence of removal processes on model BC biases is explored by switching off dry or wet deposition. Wet deposition, during transport in the North Atlantic storm track, and locally over Svalbard, dominates BC removal at Zeppelin, while wet removal in the Pacific storm track influences BC at Alert and Utqiaġvik/Barrow. Dry removal over Asian source regions and Alaska affects BC at Utqiaġvik/Barrow, and is larger than wet removal at Tiksi due to the proximity of local/regional anthropogenic sources. Regional runs over northern Alaska in late January show improved simulated BC compared to observations at Utqiaġvik/Barrow, in part, due to better resolution of removal processes, and local/regional emissions. Sensitivity runs also show that regional Alaskan sources, notably from the North Slope of Alaska oil fields, may be contributing 30%–50%, on average, to observed BC at Utqiaġvik/Barrow in January and February 2014, with the remainder from outside the region. These findings highlight the importance of local Arctic emissions, and the need for improved emission inventories in the Arctic."

Short,COVID‐19 Fueled an Elevated Number of Human‐Caused Ignitions in the Western United States During the 2020 Wildfire Season,"The area burned in the western United States during the 2020 fire season was the greatest in the modern era. Here we show that the number of human‐caused fires in 2020 also was elevated, nearly 20% higher than the 1992–2019 average. Although anomalously dry conditions enabled ignitions to spread and contributed to record area burned, these conditions alone do not explain the surge in the number of human‐caused ignitions. We argue that behavioral shifts aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID‐19 altered human‐environment interactions to favor increased ignitions. For example, the number of recreation‐caused wildfires during summer was 36% greater than the 1992–2019 average; this increase was likely a function of increased outdoor recreational activity in response to social distancing measures. We hypothesize that the combination of anomalously dry conditions and COVID‐19 social disruptions contributed to widespread increases in human‐caused ignitions, adding complexity to fire management efforts during the 2020 western US fire season. Knowledge of how social behavior changes indirectly contributed to the increased number of ignitions in the 2020 wildfire season can help inform resource management in an increasingly flammable world."

 Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation1,2. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer’s disease.

 Radio-frequency (RF) accelerators providing high-quality relativistic electron beams are an important resource enabling many areas of science, as well as industrial and medical applications. Two decades ago, laser-plasma accelerators1 that support orders of magnitude higher electric fields than those provided by modern RF cavities produced quasi-monoenergetic electron beams for the first time2–4. Since then, high-brightness electron beams at gigaelectronvolt (GeV) beam energy and competitive beam properties have been demonstrated from only centimetre-long plasmas5–9, a substantial advantage over the hundreds of metres required by RF-cavity-based accelerators. However, despite the considerable progress, the comparably large energy spread and the fluctuation (jitter) in beam energy still effectively prevent laser-plasma accelerators from driving real-world applications. Here we report the generation of a laser-plasma electron beam using active energy compression, resulting in a performance so far only associated with modern RF-based accelerators. Using a magnetic chicane, the electron bunch is first stretched longitudinally to imprint an energy correlation, which is then removed with an active RF cavity. The resulting energy spread and energy jitter are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to below the permille level, meeting the acceptance criteria of a modern synchrotron, thereby opening the path to a compact storage ring injector and other applications.

 Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin1. Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing2,3. However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)4 of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release5,6. Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin7. These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement. A study using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy reveals the swinging lever mechanism of myosin, providing information on the molecular basis behind the production of force and movement by myosin."

 The complexity of neural circuits makes it challenging to decipher the brain’s algorithms of intelligence. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have produced models that accurately simulate brain activity, enhancing our understanding of the brain’s computational objectives and neural coding. However, it is difficult for such models to generalize beyond their training distribution, limiting their utility. The emergence of foundation models1 trained on vast datasets has introduced a new artificial intelligence paradigm with remarkable generalization capabilities. Here we collected large amounts of neural activity from visual cortices of multiple mice and trained a foundation model to accurately predict neuronal responses to arbitrary natural videos. This model generalized to new mice with minimal training and successfully predicted responses across various new stimulus domains, such as coherent motion and noise patterns. Beyond neural response prediction, the model also accurately predicted anatomical cell types, dendritic features and neuronal connectivity within the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset2. Our work is a crucial step towards building foundation models of the brain. As neuroscience accumulates larger, multimodal datasets, foundation models will reveal statistical regularities, enable rapid adaptation to new tasks and accelerate research.

 Plant absorption is important for the entry of many pollutants into food chains. Although terrestrial microplastics (MPs) can be absorbed by the roots1,2, their upward translocation is slow1. Meanwhile, atmospheric MPs are widely present3,4, but strong evidence on their direct absorption by plants is still lacking. Here, analyses using mass spectrometry detection show the widespread occurrence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) polymers and oligomers in plant leaves, and identify that their levels increase with atmospheric concentrations and the leaf growth duration. The concentrations of PET and PS polymers can reach up to 104 ng per g dry weight in leaves at the high-pollution areas studied, such as the Dacron factory and a landfill site, and 102–103 ng per g dry weight of PET and PS can be detected in the open-air-grown leafy vegetables. Nano-sized PET and PS particles in the leaves were visually detected by hyperspectral imaging and atomic force microscopy–infrared spectroscopy. Absorption of the proactively exposed non-labelled, fluorescently labelled or europium-labelled plastic particles by maize (Zea mays L.) leaves through stomatal pathways, as well as their translocation to the vascular tissue through the apoplastic pathway, and accumulation in trichomes was identified using hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the absorption and accumulation of atmospheric MPs by plant leaves occur widely in the environment, and this should not be neglected when assessing the exposure of humans and other organisms to environmental MPs.

 Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations—sometimes affecting the same gene—will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions1. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1+/− deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine.

 Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system1,2. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel NaV1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony.

 Mammalian neocortex contains a highly diverse set of cell types. These cell types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches1–4. Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell-type specialization. Cellular-scale electron microscopy provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective on the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometre-scale morphology. In data that contain tens of thousands of neurons, most of which have incomplete reconstructions, identifying cell types becomes a clear challenge for analysis5. Here, to address this challenge, we present a systematic survey of the somatic region of all cells in a cubic millimetre of cortex using quantitative features obtained from electron microscopy. This analysis demonstrates that the perisomatic region is sufficient to identify cell types, including types defined primarily on the basis of their connectivity patterns. We then describe how this classification facilitates cell-type-specific connectivity characterization and locating cells with rare connectivity patterns in the dataset. An analysis demonstrates that quantitative measurements of perisomatic ultrastructure features of neurons can be used to categorize them into cell types."

 The DNA damage response (DDR) is a multifaceted network of pathways that preserves genome stability1,2. Unravelling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge3,4. Here we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening to comprehensively map the genetic interactions required for survival during normal human cell homeostasis across all core DDR genes. We captured known interactions and discovered myriad new connections that are available online. We defined the molecular mechanism of two of the strongest interactions. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain PCNA degradation in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM directly unwind TA-rich DNA cruciforms, preventing catastrophic chromosome breakage by the ERCC1–ERCC4 complex. Our data yield fundamental insights into genome maintenance, provide a springboard for mechanistic investigations into new connections between DDR factors and pinpoint synthetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cancer therapy.

 At subduction zones, lithospheric material descends through the upper mantle to the mantle transition zone (MTZ), where it may continue to sink into the lower mantle or stagnate1,2. Several factors may be important in influencing this flow, including chemical heterogeneity3–5. However, tight constraints on these mantle flows and the exact factors that affect them have proved challenging. We use P-to-S receiver functions to image the subducting slab and the MTZ beneath the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. We image a singular, superdeep (>700 km) 660-km discontinuity over a 200-km-wide zone within the slab, accompanied by nearby double 660 discontinuity phases (normal and superdeep). Combined geodynamic and waveform modelling shows that this observation cannot be explained by temperature effects in typical mantle compositions but requires a large basalt-rich chemical anomaly, strongest in the location of the singular, deep 660. The inferred basalt signature is near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge6,7, where basalt is probably present in greater proportions. Our finding suggests that past tectonic events impart chemical heterogeneity into slabs, and the heterogeneities, in turn, may affect the inherent tendency of the slab to sink.

 Materials with a high electrocaloric effect (ECE)1,2 tend to favour a disordered yet easily tunable polar structure. Perovskite ferroelectrics3 stand out as ideal candidates owing to their high dielectric responses and reasonable thermal conductivity. The introduction of multielement atomic distortions induces a high-polar-entropy state4 that notably increases the ECE by effectively overcoming the constraints imposed by highly ordered, polar-correlated perovskite structures. Here we developed a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric with strong polar disorder through targeted multielement substitution at both the A and B sites of the perovskite, effectively distorting the lattice structure and inducing a variety of nanoscale polar configurations, polymorphic polar variants and non-polar regions. A combination of these multielement-induced features led to an increased density of interfaces, significantly enhancing the polar entropy. Remarkably, a high ECE for an entropy change of about 15 J kg−1 K−1 under a 10 MV m−1 field is observed for the material across a broad temperature range exceeding 60 °C. The formation of ultrafine, dispersed, multiphase lattice configurations leads to high-polar-entropy ferroelectric oxides with a high ECE and a long lifetime of over 1 million cycles that are suitable for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors for practical electrocaloric refrigeration applications.

 Existing wearable technologies rely on physical coupling to the body to establish optical1,2, fluidic3,4, thermal5,6 and/or mechanical7,8 measurement interfaces. Here we present a class of wearable device platforms that instead relies on physical decoupling to define an enclosed chamber immediately adjacent to the skin surface. Streams of vapourized molecular substances that pass out of or into the skin alter the properties of the microclimate defined in this chamber in ways that can be precisely quantified using an integrated collection of wireless sensors. A programmable, bistable valve dynamically controls access to the surrounding environment, thereby creating a transient response that can be quantitatively related to the inward and outward fluxes of the targeted species by analysing the time-dependent readings from the sensors. The systems reported here offer unique capabilities in measuring the flux of water vapour, volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide from various locations on the body, each with distinct relevance to clinical care and/or exposure to hazardous vapours. Studies of healing processes associated with dermal wounds in models of healthy and diabetic mice and of responses in models using infected wounds reveal characteristic flux variations that provide important insights, particularly in scenarios in which the non-contact operation of the devices avoids potential damage to fragile tissues.

 Retroelements have a critical role in shaping eukaryotic genomes. For instance, site-specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons have spread widely through preferential integration into repetitive genomic sequences, such as microsatellite regions and ribosomal DNA genes1–6. Despite the widespread occurrence of these systems, their targeting constraints remain unclear. Here we use a computational pipeline to discover multiple new site-specific retrotransposon families, profile members both biochemically and in mammalian cells, find previously undescribed insertion preferences and chart potential evolutionary paths for retrotransposon retargeting. We identify R2Tg, an R2 retrotransposon from the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as an orthologue that can be retargeted by payload engineering for target cleavage, reverse transcription and scarless insertion of heterologous payloads at new genomic sites. We enhance this activity by fusing R2Tg to CRISPR–Cas9 nickases for efficient insertion at new genomic sites. Through further screening of R2 orthologues, we select an orthologue, R2Tocc, with natural reprogrammability and minimal insertion at its natural 28S site, to engineer SpCas9H840A–R2Tocc, a system we name site-specific target-primed insertion through targeted CRISPR homing of retroelements (STITCHR). STITCHR enables the scarless, efficient installation of edits, ranging from a single base to 12.7 kilobases, gene replacement and use of in vitro transcribed or synthetic RNA templates. Inspired by the prevalence of nLTR retrotransposons across eukaryotic genomes, we anticipate that STITCHR will serve as a platform for scarless programmable integration in dividing and non-dividing cells, with both research and therapeutic applications.

 The Maltese archipelago is a small island chain that is among the most remote in the Mediterranean. Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka)1. In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys2–4. Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta’s geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region.

 The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from comparative studies1–3. Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (<1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives.

 In the same way that the mRNA-binding specificities of transfer RNAs define the genetic code, the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) form the molecular basis of the gene regulatory code1,2. The human gene regulatory code is much more complex than the genetic code, in particular because there are more than 1,600 TFs that commonly interact with each other. TF–TF interactions are required for specifying cell fate and executing cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. Despite this, the landscape of interactions between DNA-bound TFs is poorly defined. Here we map the biochemical interactions between DNA-bound TFs using CAP-SELEX, a method that can simultaneously identify individual TF binding preferences, TF–TF interactions and the DNA sequences that are bound by the interacting complexes. A screen of more than 58,000 TF–TF pairs identified 2,198 interacting TF pairs, 1,329 of which preferentially bound to their motifs arranged in a distinct spacing and/or orientation. We also discovered 1,131 TF–TF composite motifs that were markedly different from the motifs of the individual TFs. In total, we estimate that the screen identified between 18% and 47% of all human TF–TF motifs. The novel composite motifs we found were enriched in cell-type-specific elements, active in vivo and more likely to be formed between developmentally co-expressed TFs. Furthermore, TFs that define embryonic axes commonly interacted with different TFs and bound to distinct motifs, explaining how TFs with a similar specificity can define distinct cell types along developmental axes. A large-scale analysis of DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs) shows how the presence of DNA markedly affects the landscape of TF interactions, and identifies composite motifs that are recognized by complexes of TFs rather than by individual ones."

 Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food1. However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood. Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes. PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food. These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations. Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later. These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.

Here we found that treating these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and about 1,000 °C in the presence of CO and NO in steam (reactive treatment under reducing atmosphere) leads to the dispersion of ceria nanoparticles into high-density 2D (roughly one atomic layer thin) CexOy domains, as confirmed by microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These domains, which densely cover the alumina, exhibit substantially enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity, facilitating easier extraction of oxygen and the formation of Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies. As a result, these catalysts—whether with or without PGMs, such as Rh and Pt—show improved activity for several industrially important catalytic reactions, including NO and N2O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation, even after exposure to harsh ageing conditions. This study shows a catalyst architecture with superior redox properties under conditions that typically cause sintering, offering a pathway to more efficient metal–ceria catalysts for enhanced general catalysis.

 Mammalian cortex features a vast diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties1. Synaptic connectivity shapes how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but mapping connectivity rules at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here we used millimetre-scale volumetric electron microscopy2 to investigate the connectivity of all inhibitory neurons across a densely segmented neuronal population of 1,352 cells spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. Inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on targeting of dendritic compartments and developed an excitatory neuron classification based on dendritic reconstructions with whole-cell maps of synaptic input. Single-cell connectivity showed a class of disinhibitory specialist that targets basket cells. Analysis of inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of spatially intermingled subpopulations. Inhibitory targeting was organized into ‘motif groups’, diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking contemporary multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram. Using volumetric electron microscopy, the authors map and analyze the structure of cortical inhibition with synaptic resolution across a column of visual cortex."

 The water contents of the lunar interior record important clues for understanding the formation and subsequent thermochemical evolution of the Moon1. The Chang’e-6 (CE6) mission returned samples from the South Pole–Aitken impact basin of the lunar farside2–4, providing an opportunity to study the water contents of the farside mantle. Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite and melt inclusions from CE6 mare basalt, derived from partial melting of the lunar mantle. The parent magma of CE6 mare basalt is estimated to have a water abundance of 15–168 μg g−1 with a δD value of −123 ± 167‰. Our estimate of water abundance of 1–1.5 μg g−1 for the mantle source indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier than its nearside counterpart. This contrast thus suggests that the distribution of water in the interior of the Moon may exhibit a hemispheric dichotomy similar to numerous surface features5. The new estimate for the lunar farside mantle represents a landmark for estimating the water abundance of the bulk silicate Moon, providing critical constraints on the giant impact origin hypothesis6–8 and the subsequent evolution of the Moon for which the role of water is central1,9.

 Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits1. More than 300 mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists2. Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA.

 Osteoarthritis is the third most rapidly growing health condition associated with disability, after dementia and diabetes1. By 2050, the total number of patients with osteoarthritis is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide2. As no disease-modifying treatments exist for osteoarthritis, a better understanding of disease aetiopathology is urgently needed. Here we perform a genome-wide association study meta-analyses across up to 489,975 cases and 1,472,094 controls, establishing 962 independent associations, 513 of which have not been previously reported. Using single-cell multiomics data, we identify signal enrichment in embryonic skeletal development pathways. We integrate orthogonal lines of evidence, including transcriptome, proteome and epigenome profiles of primary joint tissues, and implicate 700 effector genes. Within these, we find rare coding-variant burden associations with effect sizes that are consistently higher than common frequency variant associations. We highlight eight biological processes in which we find convergent involvement of multiple effector genes, including the circadian clock, glial-cell-related processes and pathways with an established role in osteoarthritis (TGFβ, FGF, WNT, BMP and retinoic acid signalling, and extracellular matrix organization). We find that 10% of the effector genes express a protein that is the target of approved drugs, offering repurposing opportunities, which can accelerate translation.

 Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons’ functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis1,2. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types3–6, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column4, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data4,7. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space8, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances9 and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas10,11.

 Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis with hooks, are a diverse endoparasitic group that infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates1. Although long regarded as a separate phylum, they have several putative sister taxa based on morphological features, including Platyhelminthes (flatworms)2, Priapulida (penis worms)3 and Rotifera (wheel animals)4. Molecular phylogenies have instead recovered them within rotifers5–10, suggesting acanthocephalans are derived from free-living worms with a jaw apparatus (Gnathifera). Their only fossil record is Late Cretaceous eggs11, contributing limited palaeontological information to deciphering their early evolution. Here we describe an acanthocephalan body fossil, Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis gen. et. sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou biota of China. Juracanthocephalus shows unambiguous acanthocephalan characteristics, for example a hooked proboscis, a bursa, as well as a jaw apparatus with discrete elements that is typical of other gnathiferans. Juracanthocephalus shares features with Seisonidea (an epizoic member of Rotifera) and Acanthocephala, bridging the evolutionary gap between jawed rotifers and the obligate parasitic, jawless acanthocephalans. Our results reveal previously unrecognized ecological and morphological diversity in ancient Acanthocephala and highlight the significance of transitional fossils, revealing the origins of this highly enigmatic group of living organisms.

 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These clusters can be found at the centre of all galaxy types but tend to favour galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 109M⊙ (refs. 1,2). At present, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in situ star formation from gas infall3 and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction4. Studies5–9 of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, whereas the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, until now, no ongoing merger of GCs has been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N-body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need for large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps.

 Chronic stress remodels brain homeostasis, in which persistent change leads to depressive disorders1. As a key modulator of brain homeostasis2, it remains elusive whether and how brain autophagy is engaged in stress dynamics. Here we discover that acute stress activates, whereas chronic stress suppresses, autophagy mainly in the lateral habenula (LHb). Systemic administration of distinct antidepressant drugs similarly restores autophagy function in the LHb, suggesting LHb autophagy as a common antidepressant target. Genetic ablation of LHb neuronal autophagy promotes stress susceptibility, whereas enhancing LHb autophagy exerts rapid antidepressant-like effects. LHb autophagy controls neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity by means of on-demand degradation of glutamate receptors. Collectively, this study shows a causal role of LHb autophagy in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress. Disrupted LHb autophagy is implicated in the maladaptation to chronic stress, and its reversal by autophagy enhancers provides a new antidepressant strategy. Acute stress activates autophagy in the lateral habenula, whereas chronic stress suppresses it, with this autophagy having a causal role in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress, and its restoration through autophagy enhancers offers a novel antidepressant strategy."

 The Saharo-Arabian Desert is one of the largest biogeographical barriers on Earth, impeding dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, including movements of past hominins. Recent research suggests that this barrier has been in place since at least 11 million years ago1. In contrast, fossil evidence from the late Miocene epoch and the Pleistocene epoch suggests the episodic presence within the Saharo-Arabian Desert interior of water-dependent fauna (for example, crocodiles, equids, hippopotamids and proboscideans)2–6, sustained by rivers and lakes7,8 that are largely absent from today’s arid landscape. Although numerous humid phases occurred in southern Arabia during the past 1.1 million years9, little is known about Arabia’s palaeoclimate before this time. Here, based on a climatic record from desert speleothems, we show recurrent humid intervals in the central Arabian interior over the past 8 million years. Precipitation during humid intervals decreased and became more variable over time, as the monsoon’s influence weakened, coinciding with enhanced Northern Hemisphere polar ice cover during the Pleistocene. Wetter conditions likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, with Arabia acting as a key crossroads for continental-scale biogeographic exchanges.

 Intersectionality describes interdependent systems of inequality related to sex, gender, race, age, class and other socio-political dimensions. By focusing on the compounded effects of social categories, intersectional analysis can enhance the accuracy and experimental efficiency of science. Here we extend intersectional approaches that were predominantly developed in the humanities, social sciences and public health to the fields of natural science and technology, where this type of analysis is less established. Informed by diverse global and disciplinary examples—from enhancing facial recognition for diverse user bases to mitigating the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized populations—we extract methods to demonstrate how quantitative intersectional analysis functions throughout the research process, from strategic considerations for establishing research priorities to formulating research questions, collecting and analysing data and interpreting results. Our goal is to offer a set of guidelines for researchers, peer-reviewed journals and funding agencies that facilitate systematic integration of intersectional analysis into relevant domains of science and technology. Precision in research best guides effective social and environmental policy aimed at achieving global equity and sustainability. This Perspective offers a guide for researchers, peer-reviewed journals and funding agencies to make quantitative intersectional approaches a standard part of science and technology research design, where relevant, in efforts to enhance precision in science, and ultimately global equity and environmental sustainability."

 Human cells consist of a complex hierarchy of components, many of which remain unexplored1,2. Here we construct a global map of human subcellular architecture through joint measurement of biophysical interactions and immunofluorescence images for over 5,100 proteins in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Self-supervised multimodal data integration resolves 275 molecular assemblies spanning the range of 10−8 to 10−5 m, which we validate systematically using whole-cell size-exclusion chromatography and annotate using large language models3. We explore key applications in structural biology, yielding structures for 111 heterodimeric complexes and an expanded Rag–Ragulator assembly. The map assigns unexpected functions to 975 proteins, including roles for C18orf21 in RNA processing and DPP9 in interferon signalling, and identifies assemblies with multiple localizations or cell type specificity. It decodes paediatric cancer genomes4, identifying 21 recurrently mutated assemblies and implicating 102 validated new cancer proteins.

 Numerous natural products and drugs contain flexible alkyl chains. The resulting conformational motion can create challenges in obtaining single crystals and thus determining their molecular structures by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)1–11. Here we demonstrate that by using pillar[5]arene-incorporated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and taking advantage of pillar[5]arene−alkyl chain host−guest recognition12–15, it is possible to reduce this motion and bring order to alkyl-chain-containing molecules as the result of docking within accessible pillar[5]arene units present in an overall MOF. This has allowed the single-crystal structures of 48 alkyl-chain-containing molecules, including 6 natural products, 2 approved drugs and 18 custom-made compounds collected from 16 research groups, to be determined using standard SCXRD instrumentation. The structures of alkyl-chain-containing molecules derived from crude reaction products can also be determined directly by SCXRD analyses without further purification. The simplicity, high efficiency and apparent generality of the present pillar[5]arene-incorporated MOF-based supramolecular docking approach suggest that it could emerge as a new tool for the analyses of natural products and drugs that might not be amenable to traditional SCXRD-based structure determination.

 At the heart of medicine lies physician–patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust1,2. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians’ expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE’s performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM–patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.

 Integrated photonics, particularly silicon photonics, have emerged as cutting-edge technology driven by promising applications such as short-reach communications, autonomous driving, biosensing and photonic computing1–4. As advances in AI lead to growing computing demands, photonic computing has gained considerable attention as an appealing candidate. Nonetheless, there are substantial technical challenges in the scaling up of integrated photonics systems to realize these advantages, such as ensuring consistent performance gains in upscaled integrated device clusters, establishing standard designs and verification processes for complex circuits, as well as packaging large-scale systems. These obstacles arise primarily because of the relative immaturity of integrated photonics manufacturing and the scarcity of advanced packaging solutions involving photonics. Here we report a large-scale integrated photonic accelerator comprising more than 16,000 photonic components. The accelerator is designed to deliver standard linear matrix multiply–accumulate (MAC) functions, enabling computing with high speed up to 1 GHz frequency and low latency as small as 3 ns per cycle. Logic, memory and control functions that support photonic matrix MAC operations were designed into a cointegrated electronics chip. To seamlessly integrate the electronics and photonics chips at the commercial scale, we have made use of an innovative 2.5D hybrid advanced packaging approach. Through the development of this accelerator system, we demonstrate an ultralow computation latency for heuristic solvers of computationally hard Ising problems whose performance greatly relies on the computing latency.

 The mammalian nucleus is compartmentalized by diverse subnuclear structures. These subnuclear structures, marked by nuclear bodies and histone modifications, are often cell-type specific and affect gene regulation and 3D genome organization1–3. Understanding their relationships rests on identifying the molecular constituents of subnuclear structures and mapping their associations with specific genomic loci and transcriptional levels in individual cells, all in complex tissues. Here, we introduce two-layer DNA seqFISH+, which enables simultaneous mapping of 100,049 genomic loci, together with the nascent transcriptome for 17,856 genes and subnuclear structures in single cells. These data enable imaging-based chromatin profiling of diverse subnuclear markers and can capture their changes at genomic scales ranging from 100–200 kilobases to approximately 1 megabase, depending on the marker and DNA locus. By using multi-omics datasets in the adult mouse cerebellum, we showed that repressive chromatin regions are more variable by cell type than are active regions across the genome. We also discovered that RNA polymerase II-enriched foci were locally associated with long, cell-type-specific genes (bigger than 200 kilobases) in a manner distinct from that of nuclear speckles. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that cell-type-specific regions of heterochromatin marked by histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me3) are enriched at specific genes and gene clusters, respectively, and shape radial chromosomal positioning and inter-chromosomal interactions in neurons and glial cells. Together, our results provide a single-cell high-resolution multi-omics view of subnuclear structures, associated genomic loci and their effects on gene regulation, directly within complex tissues.

 Understanding the relationship between circuit connectivity and function is crucial for uncovering how the brain computes. In mouse primary visual cortex, excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected1–8; however, broader connectivity rules remain unknown. Here we leverage the millimetre-scale MICrONS dataset to analyse synaptic connectivity and functional properties of neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar response properties are preferentially connected within and across layers and areas—including feedback connections—supporting the universality of ‘like-to-like’ connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections beyond what could be explained by the proximity of axons and dendrites. We also discovered a higher-order rule whereby postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Recurrent neural networks trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns that mirror both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitudes similar to those in MICrONS data. Ablation studies in these recurrent neural networks reveal that disrupting like-to-like connections impairs performance more than disrupting random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may have a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems. The MICrONS mouse visual cortex dataset shows that neurons with similar response properties preferentially connect, a pattern that emerges within and across brain areas and layers, and independently emerges in artificial neural networks where these ‘like-to-like’ connections prove important for task performance."

 Mutation of some genes drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) provided the very first such genetic link to cancer1,2. However, little is known about the trajectory to CML, the rate of BCR::ABL1 clonal expansion and how this affects disease. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 haematopoietic colonies from nine patients with CML aged 22 to 81 years, we reconstruct phylogenetic trees of haematopoiesis. Intronic breaks in BCR and ABL1 were not always observed, and out-of-frame exonic breakpoints in BCR, requiring exon skipping to derive BCR::ABL1, were also noted. Apart from ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, extra myeloid gene mutations were mostly present in wild-type cells. We inferred explosive growth attributed to BCR::ABL1 commencing 3–14 years (confidence interval 2–16 years) before diagnosis, with annual growth rates exceeding 70,000% per year. Mutation accumulation was higher in BCR::ABL1 cells with shorter telomere lengths, reflecting their excessive cell divisions. Clonal expansion rates inversely correlated with the time to diagnosis. BCR::ABL1 in the general population mirrored CML incidence, and advanced and/or blast phase CML was characterized by subsequent genomic evolution. These data highlight the oncogenic potency of BCR::ABL1 fusion and contrast with the slow and sequential clonal trajectories of most cancers.

 California data demonstrate failures in latent tuberculosis screening to prevent progression to tuberculosis disease. Therefore, we developed a clinical risk prediction model for tuberculosis disease using electronic health records. This study included Kaiser Permanente Southern California and Northern California members ≥18 years during 2008-2019. Models used Cox proportional hazards regression, Harrell’s C-statistic, and a simulated TB disease outcome accounting for cases prevented by current screening which includes both observed and simulated cases. We compared sensitivity and number-needed-to-screen for model-identified high-risk individuals with current screening. Of 4,032,619 and 4,051,873 Southern and Northern California members, tuberculosis disease incidences were 4.1 and 3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The final model C-statistic was 0.816 (95% simulation interval 0.805-0.824). Model sensitivity screening high-risk individuals was 0.70 (0.68-0.71) and number-needed-to-screen was 662 (646-679) persons-per tuberculosis disease case, compared to a sensitivity of 0.36 (0.34-0.38) and number-needed-to-screen of 1632 (1485-1774) with current screening.

 Total sea ice extent (SIE) across the Southern Ocean increased from 1979-2014, but declined rapidly after 2016. Significant sea ice decline has emerged since the peak of SIE in 2014, coincident with Pacific sub-decadal sea surface temperature (SST) trends resembling a strong La Niña-like cold condition and the negative phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Previous studies suggest that the warm subsurface Southern Ocean was an important driver of the low sea ice in spring 2016 and the sustained low sea ice state since. Here we show that the observed atmospheric circulation changes near Antarctica during the period from June 2013-May 2023 are conducive to increasing surface temperature via warm advection from north and reducing Antarctic SIE, involving a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low and anomalous high pressures over the Weddell Sea and West Pacific sectors. Through coupled pacemaker experiments, we demonstrate that Pacific sub-decadal SST trends have dominantly driven these atmospheric circulation changes through tropical–polar teleconnections and also induced significant Southern Ocean subsurface warming in the recent decade. The consequent decreasing SIE has enhanced the Southern Ocean subsurface warming effect and significantly contributed to the rapid Antarctic SIE decline.

Here, by precisely engineering the location of two multi-donor quantum dot qubits in silicon, the authors demonstrate high-fidelity latched parity readout with reduced integration time, even at elevated temperatures. 
 Electron spin qubits in semiconductors are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing due to their small size, long coherence and manufacturability. Typically, readout in spin qubits has been performed using energy-selective readout with extremely high fidelities up to 99.95% at millikelvin temperatures. Despite achieving record fidelities at low electron temperatures, the readout time remains on the order of 1 μs to 100 μs and comparable to the electron spin coherence time. In this paper we show that by engineering the location of two multi-donor quantum dot qubits with nanoscale precision we can demonstrate latched parity readout of two electrons in only 175 ns integration time with a fidelity of 99.44% at mK temperatures. Most importantly we show that this combination of strong confinement potential present in donor qubits with precision engineering of the tunnel rates allows us to operate our compact sensors at the highest temperatures recorded so far (3.7 K) using latched spin readout, giving a maximum fidelity of 97.87% in 1.5 μs.

Here, the authors report an actuating hydrogel used for untethered pneumatic actuators. 
 Pneumatic artificial muscles have been widely used in the field of robotics because of their large output force and fast actuation, however, the accompanying bulky compressors and pumps limit their miniaturized applications. Despite current untethered pneumatic artificial muscles can be driven by adjusting the internal pressure, it is challenging to structurally mimic natural muscles with high water content. Here, we propose untethered pneumatic artificial muscles comprising a hydrogel actuator with snap-through instability and an air storage chamber. These hydrogel actuators can realize the conversion from hydrophobic association of octyl acrylate moieties to host-guest interaction between β-cyclodextrin and octyl acrylate under thermal stimuli, leading to the decrease of their moduli. The inflated hydrogel actuators exhibit rapid actuation with a radial expansion speed of 200% s−1, which are powered by snap-through instability, thermal expansion of the gas inside the hydrogel actuator, and evaporation of water on its internal surface. With the pneumatic artificial muscles miniaturized, we demonstrate diving and rolling robots, exemplifying bionic robots able to adapt to and modify the environment. We expect that the design of hydrogel actuator in miniaturized pneumatic artificial muscles will facilitate rapid locomotion for future bionic robotic platforms.

 Despite extensive work on the evolution of cooperation, the roles of teaching and leadership in transmitting opaque cultural norms—foundations of cooperative behaviors—are underexplored. Similarly, while teaching is well-studied in the evolution of instrumental culture, little attention is given to its role in transmitting opaque culture, such as social values and norms. Transmitting opaque culture often requires teaching, and group leaders are well-positioned to facilitate this process. Using comparative ethnographic data, we explore teaching, leadership, and instrumental versus opaque culture by examining whether opaque culture is primarily transmitted via teaching, which age groups tend to learn these norms, and whether leaders are disproportionately involved in teaching. Drawing on ethnographic data from 23 egalitarian foraging societies, we find teaching is more strongly associated with transmitting cultural values and kinship knowledge than subsistence skills and is closely linked to opaque culture and leadership. Leader-directed teaching may drive cooperation, suggesting new research avenues. Teaching and leadership are under-studied in connection with the opaque norms that underpin cooperation.

 While seasoned organic chemists can often predict suitable catalysts for new reactions based on their past experiences in other catalytic reactions, developing this ability is costly, laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, replicating this remarkable expertize of human researchers through machine learning (ML) is compelling, albeit that it remains highly challenging. Herein, we apply a domain-adaptation-based transfer-learning (TL) approach to photocatalysis. Despite being different reaction types, the knowledge of the catalytic behavior of organic photosensitizers (OPSs) from photocatalytic cross-coupling reactions is successfully transferred to ML for a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, improving the prediction of the photocatalytic activity compared with conventional ML approaches. Furthermore, a satisfactory predictive performance is achieved by using only ten training data points. This experimentally readily accessible small dataset can also be used to identify effective OPSs for alkene photoisomerization, thereby showcasing the potential benefits of TL in catalyst exploration.

Here, authors present structures of cagilintide with each target receptor, revealing the molecular basis for its non-selective action. 
 Obesity is a major and increasingly prevalent chronic metabolic disease with numerous comorbidities. While recent incretin-based therapies have provided pharmaceutical inroads into treatment of obesity, there remains an ongoing need for additional medicines with distinct modes of action as independent or complementary therapeutics. Among the most promising candidates, supported by phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, is cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. As such, understanding how cagrilintide functionally engages target receptors is critical for future development of this target class. Here, we determine structures of cagrilintide bound to Gs-coupled, active, amylin receptors (AMY1R, AMY2R, AMY3R) and calcitonin receptor (CTR) and compare cagrilintide interactions and the dynamics of receptor complexes with previously reported structures of receptors bound to rat amylin, salmon calcitonin or recently developed amylin-based peptides. These data reveal that cagrilintide has an amylin-like binding mode but, compared to other peptides, induces distinct conformational dynamics at calcitonin-family receptors that could contribute to its clinical efficacy. Cagrilintide is a long-acting agonist of amylin and calcitonin receptors in late phase trials for obesity. Here, authors present structures of cagilintide with each target receptor, revealing the molecular basis for its non-selective action."

 Secure access to energy services is a prerequisite to economic productivity and a chief strategic concern of national governments, yet it is unclear how the trade in fuels and critical materials in scenarios with net-zero emissions relates to energy security risks. Here we find that overall trade risks decrease in most countries (70%) in net-zero scenarios due to reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels, but trade risks to either electricity or transportation systems increase in the majority (82%) of countries that become more dependent on imported materials. Countries with abundant mineral reserves (for example, Australia and China) become much less dependent on imports, but the opposite is true of countries with large fossil fuel reserves (for example, Russia and the Middle East). We further evaluate the sensitivity of countries’ trade risks to differences in trading networks, energy systems, the material intensities of technologies and recycling rates, highlighting opportunities for technological innovation and policy changes. Trade risks associated with fossil fuels and critical materials matter for energy security, and will evolve with the low-carbon transition.

 Plastics used in agriculture improve productivity and resource efficiency. As they fragment over time, microplastics are unintentionally released into soil, raising concerns regarding long-term implications for soil structure and fertility. Here we investigated microplastics transport and their impact on soil structure through a two-year field experiment. 45 re-packed soil columns were installed with three treatments: indium-doped polyethylene terephthalate fragments or fibers in the top 2 cm and a control with no microplastics. Soil pore structure was monitored with X-ray tomography, and microplastics vertical transport was assessed via the indium tracer. With time macropore volume, biopore fraction and critical pore diameter increased independent of microplastic addition. Microplastic transport was minimal, with only ~1% reaching below 8 cm soil depth in two years. This experimental design, simulating natural soil conditions, suggests that microplastics have a negligible influence on soil macropore architecture and its transport rate is limited in the short term.

 Artisanal and Small-Scale mining (ASM) provides essential livelihoods for many in developing countries but often lacks regulation, leading to environmental issues such as water pollution and deforestation. Timely and accurate mapping of ASM activities is vital for responsible mining that benefits the environment and local communities. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for regular ASM monitoring in cloudy regions due to its ability to penetrate clouds. However, atmospheric effects can limit its effectiveness, particularly with shorter wavelengths in wet tropical areas during the rainy season. This study utilised a time series smoothing technique to improve Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR time series data, reducing SAR noise and atmospheric effects from heavy rainfall for early ASM activity detection. We tested three change point detection (CPD) methods, including cumulative sum (CuSuM), pruned exact linear time (PELT), and binary segmentation (BinSeg) in the Western and Ashanti wet regions in southern Ghana using the smoothed S-1 data for early ASM detection. We observed a relatively fast response of ASM activity tracking when utilising smoothed S-1 data at both sites for VV and VH polarizations during the rainy seasons. However, VH polarization is more effective than VV polarization during rainy seasons. While all CPD algorithms showed similar performance, CuSuM had the shortest lag time of up to 9 days, compared to 11 days for PELT and BinSeg. This method significantly reduces ambiguity caused by heavy rainfall when identifying change points due to ASM activity, making it a viable option for near real-time monitoring in wet tropical regions."

Furthermore, during the loss function formulation, we have incorporated a Small Object Enhancement Factor (SOEF) to prioritize small object detection. An edge-awareness map is also utilized within the model to accurately delineate change edges and assess their influence on adjacent changed pixels. The efficacy of our model and its innovative components has been validated through experimental results on two public datasets, showcasing improved capabilities in detecting edges and small objects."

 Soil moisture products with long-term, high spatial continuity, and high accuracy are essential for meteorological management and hydrological monitoring. Microwave remote sensing retrieval and land surface model simulation are the two primary sources of global-scale soil moisture data, but each has inherent limitations, making it difficult to balance accuracy and spatial coverage. In this paper, to tackle this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based spatiotemporal fusion framework to integrate the two data sources and generate a global soil moisture product with high spatial continuity and accuracy. Specifically, we leverage the high accuracy of the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) microwave soil moisture data and the spatiotemporal continuity of the Noah assimilation soil moisture data. The proposed model employs a deep residual cycle GAN (DrcGAN) to capture the nonlinear complementary spatiotemporal features between the SMAP and Noah data, generating a seamless global daily product at a 36-km resolution, spanning April 4, 2015, to November 26, 2023, referred to as STSG-SM. Various validation methods, including spatial pattern analysis, time-series comparison, and in-situ validation, are utilized to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the product.

 Up-to-date cadastral maps are vital to local governments in administrating real estate in cities. With its growing availability, remote sensing imagery is the cost-effective data for updating semantic contents on cadastral maps. In this study, we address the problem of updating buildings on cadastral maps, as city renewal is mainly characterized by new construction and demolition. While previous works focus on extracting all buildings from remote sensing images, we argue that these methods not only disregard preliminary information on cadastral maps but also fail to preserve building priors in unchanged areas on cadastral maps. Therefore, we focus on the task of extracting changed buildings (i.e., newly built and demolished buildings) from remote sensing images and cadastral maps. To address this task, we create an image-map building change detection (IMBCD) dataset, formed by around 27K pairs of remote sensing images and maps and their corresponding changed buildings in six distinct geographical areas across the globe. Accordingly, we propose a Bilateral Attention Network (BANet), introducing a novel attention mechanism: changed-first (CF) attention and non-changed-first (NCF) attention. This bilateral attention mechanism helps to refine the uncertain areas between changed and non-changed regions. Extensive experiments on our IMBCD dataset showcase the superior performance of BANet. Specifically, our BANet outperforms state-of-the-art models with F1 scores of 90.00% and 63.00% for the IMBCD-WHU and IMBCD-Inria datasets.

 Buildings are crucial to cities, and tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR) is an important tool for monitoring the heights, linear deformations and thermal amplitudes of buildings. However, existing TomoSAR height inversion methods do not fully leverage a priori knowledge, compromising the accuracy of deformation estimation; deep learning-based methods involve the integration of multiple steps, complicating the process. Additionally, the computational inefficiency of existing algorithms significantly hinders the large-scale practical deployment of TomoSAR. To address the above issues, this study proposes a novel large-area urban TomoSAR method integrating limited a priori knowledge constraints with a complex-valued (CV) deep learning model. By refining scatterer types and Permanent Scatterer (PS) height sample sets under limited a priori height data constraints, the proposed CV-TomoPS-Net establishes an end-to-end framework for scatterer classification and PS height regression. Additionally, the proposed fast beamforming method, paired with an adaptive spatial search mechanism, enables rapid large-area inversion of deformation and thermal amplitude parameters. Experiments were conducted in Shenzhen city using COSMO-SkyMed SAR data from 2020 to 2023 and limited a priori data. Results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of scatterer type classification by 16 %, reduces the height calculation error by 30 %, and improves the monitoring efficiency by 80 % compared with the traditional beamforming method. Validation via corner reflectors deformation monitoring confirmed reliability, with a 1.5 mm average error.

 In the processing of Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, two-dimensional (2-D) phase unwrapping (PU) is crucial for ensuring the quality of InSAR data inversion. Traditional methods, based on the assumption of phase continuity, often struggle with abrupt terrain changes and the influence of severe noise, leading to poor performance or failure. To address these challenges, this paper presents a dilated multi-path phase unwrapping network (DMP-PUNet) for 2-D PU under conditions of severe noise and complex fringes. To train this model, we developed a multi-effect interferometric phase simulation (ME-IPS) strategy that aims to simulate interferometric phases that closely resemble real-world conditions by comprehensively considering various factors, including terrain and digital elevation model (DEM) errors, atmospheric turbulence, vegetation effects, baseline geometry, multiple scattering, and noise. This simulation, combined with quasi-real interferometric phase data obtained from DEM inversion algorithms, forms the comprehensive training dataset. Finally, experiments on simulated data, quasi-real data, the InSAR-DLPU dataset, and InSAR data demonstrate that DMP-PUNet outperforms existing methods. For simulated data, DMP-PUNet achieved an overall average mean absolute error (MAE) in residuals of 0.221 rad, improving accuracy by 54.75 % with an average processing time of 0.81 s.

 Understanding the interactions between atmospheric aerosols and the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is important for human health, climate, and weather forecasting models. In this study, an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) model is coupled with a radiative transfer model (RTM) to investigate the effects of aerosol optical depth τλ and single scattering albedo ω on the growth and thermodynamics of the PBL, or the so-called aerosol-PBL interactions (API).

In extreme conditions (τ500=1.5, ω=0.81) for the stove case we recorded ∼62% and ∼72% increase in PBL growth and heating rates respectively. For the dome case, we recorded ∼21% and ∼22% decreases in PBL growth and heating rates respectively. In both cases, the feedback loop severely impacts surface aerosol concentrations and enhances heat index. Based on the sensitivity runs, a parametrization relating the τ500 and ω on the PBL heating rate and PBL growth is suggested.

 High-quality satellite quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is crucial for theoretical studies and disaster monitoring. However, it remains unclear which information is effective or relatively less valuable. Accurately eliminating ineffective variables and applying effective ones as predictors can further enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency for QPE. In this study, an hourly QPE algorithm was developed using three machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM. We focused on obtaining high-precision precipitation estimations and further analyzing the contribution of different input variables. Sensitivity experiments revealed that satellite visible channels and cloud properties are key factors for accurate QPE. In contrast, information provided solely by infrared channels and meteorological variables is relatively limited. Among three ML models, LightGBM achieved the best QPE, and was comparable to, or even slightly better than GPM IMERG, which may be attributed to its incorporation of more effective variables and training with ground rain gauge. However, it sometimes underestimates heavy precipitation compared to GPM IMERG, probably due to few training samples and saturation of satellite spectral signals. The analysis of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) indicates that QPE are more sensitive to cloud properties (e.g., cloud water path), but some meteorological factors, such as relative humidity at different pressure levels are becoming more important as the environment becomes drier. Additionally, the performance of ML model and GPM IMERG deeply relies on cloud type. These findings are expected to provide valuable references for the construction of future satellite QPE algorithms in terms of feature selection and data processing."

 This study uses HadISST and ERA5 reanalysis data to investigate the trend-removed variability of the 0 °C isotherm elevation, and the main controls on this variability, along the southern slopes of the Himalayas in pre-monsoon season. Here we show that the sea surface temperature (SST) in the north tropical Atlantic Ocean (NTAO) exerts a phase-locked effect on the anomalous seesaw pattern in the 0 °C isotherm elevation with a node around 84.5°E, after the upward trend in the 0 °C isotherm elevation is removed. When the NTAO SST anomalies are warmer than normal, wave-train-like patterns are forced out over western Africa–southeastern Tibetan Plateau with the same anomalous centers from the lower to upper troposphere. An anomalous temperature dipole associated with this wave-train-like pattern is the direct cause of the rise (fall) in the 0 °C isotherm elevation along the southern slopes of the western (eastern) Himalayas in pre-monsoon season. When the NTAO SST anomalies are colder than normal, the opposite situation develops. This significant phase-locked correlation between NTAO SST and trend-removed isotherm elevation, which persists from the previous autumn to the current pre-monsoon season, will help to both elucidate and mitigate the risks posed by glacier-related hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and avalanches over the southern Himalayas."

Directing attention toward translational regulation as a bridge between these events can yield additional insights into previously unexplained mechanisms. Our functional CRISPR interference screen–based approach revealed that EIF3D, a translation initiation factor, is crucial for maintaining primed pluripotency. Loss of EIF3D disrupted the balance of pluripotency-associated signaling pathways, thereby compromising primed pluripotency. Moreover, EIF3D ensured robust proliferation by controlling the translation of various p53 regulators, which maintain low p53 activity in the undifferentiated state. In this way, EIF3D-mediated translation contributes to tuning the homeostasis of the primed pluripotency networks, ensuring the maintenance of an undifferentiated state with high proliferative potential. This study provides further insights into the translation network in maintaining pluripotency."

Here, we explore the coupling between two resonances in a chiral metasurface and introduce a mechanism for high-purity chiral laser emission. We reveal that two resonances with nearly orthogonal polarizations become strongly coupled in an engineered chiral metasurface. The inherent phase difference of the resonances, associated with the coherent destruction on the decay channel, can endow high-Qfactor and maximize chirality to one of the hybrid modes. We verify this approach experimentally by measuring transmission spectra, angle-resolved photoluminescence, and laser emission. We believe that this mechanism allows breaking restrictions on conventional chiral quasi-BIC lasing, enabling the realization of chiral emission at any designed direction."

Our previous work suggests that αSyn can facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, promoting genomic stability. We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs. Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage. αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion."

By using a controlled surface cross-linking process through diffusion, we greatly enhance the mechanical strength of polymer-fluid gels without sacrificing their damping capabilities. This asymmetric design results in an unprecedented loss factor (tanδ > 0.5 from −45 degrees to 135 degrees Celsius, peaking at tanδ = 2.2) while achieving a tensile modulus of 20 megapascals.

Unexpectedly, three of the most common human RNA epitranscriptomic marks—i.e.,N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and pseudouridine—had almost no influence on the immunogenicity of dsRNA; however, the presence ofN6-methyladenosine inhibited the OAS/RNase L pathway.

However, the carbon sequestration potential of these efforts remains uncertain in satellite-based assessments, particularly when accounting for dynamic climate conditions, vegetation-climate feedback, fire-dominated disturbance, and the trade-offs associated with surface albedo changes. Leveraging a coupled Earth system model, we estimated that global forestation mitigates 31.3 to 69.2 Pg Ceq(carbon equivalent) during 2021–2100 under a sustainable shared socioeconomic pathway. Regionally, the highest carbon mitigation potential of forestation concentrates in tropical areas, while mid-high-latitude regions demonstrate higher heterogeneity, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies and further refinement of nature-based mitigation plans. Our findings underscore the importance of considering disturbances and minimizing adverse albedo changes when estimating the carbon mitigation potential of forestation initiatives. We also advocate for the development of consistent, high-resolution maps of suitable areas for targeted forestation, avoiding environmentally sensitive lands and potential conflicts with other human activities."

Recent studies show that spared motor neurons can still be voluntarily controlled using surface electromyography (EMG), even without visible movement. To harness these signals, we developed a wireless, high-density EMG bracelet and a software framework, MyoGestic. Our system enables rapid adaptation of machine learning models to users’ needs, allowing real-time decoding of spared motor dimensions. In our study, we successfully decoded motor intent from two participants with traumatic SCI, two with spinal stroke, and three with amputations in real time, achieving multiple controllable motor dimensions within minutes. The decoded neural signals could control a digitally rendered hand, an orthosis, a prosthesis, or a two-dimensional cursor. MyoGestic’s participant-centered approach allows a collaborative and iterative development of myocontrol algorithms, bridging the gap between researcher and participant, to advance intuitive EMG interfaces for neural lesions."

Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we identified a single residue, D164, in exfoliative toxin A (ETA) that acts as a molecular “switch” to regulate global dynamic sampling. Mutations at this site shift the balance between inactive and active states, correlating directly with catalytic activity. Beyond identifying this dynamic switch, we demonstrate how it works in concert with other allosterically coupled sites to rationally control enzyme movements and catalytic function. This study provides a framework for linking conformational dynamics to function and paves the way for engineering enzymes, in particular, proteases, with tailored activities for applications in medicine and biotechnology."

However, the neural mechanisms supporting such a critical operation remain unknown. Here, we developed computational neuroimaging methods to decode and demix neural responses associated with multiple items in working memory with different priorities. In striate and extrastriate cortex, the gain of neural responses tracked the priority of memoranda. We decoded higher-priority memoranda with smaller error and lower uncertainty. Moreover, these neural differences predicted behavioral differences in memory prioritization between and within participants. Trial-wise variability in the magnitude of delay activity in the frontal cortex predicted differences in decoded precision between low- and high-priority items in visual cortex. These results support a model in which feedback signals broadcast from frontal cortex sculpt the gain of memory representations in the visual cortex according to behavioral relevance, thus identifying a neural mechanism for resource allocation."

The films exhibit a metallic temperature dependence of the conductivity over a wide temperature range, but below 15 kelvin charge transport becomes dominated by weak localization and electron-electron interactions. Temperature-dependent Hall, Seebeck, and Nernst measurements consistently indicate the existence of ambipolar transport characteristics in CuBHT. A two-band analysis has been used to extract transport parameters for electron and hole carriers as a function of temperature. The results show that contributions from electron and hole conduction in CuBHT are of comparable magnitude, revealing the complexity of charge transport and allowing one to identify strategies for enhancing the thermoelectric transport coefficients of such conducting coordination nanosheets."

However, the tradeoff between long reach and small storage volume can be resolved using deployable structures such as tape springs. We developed bidirectional tape spring “fingers” that have large buckling strength compared to single tape springs and that can be spooled into a compact state or unspooled to manipulate objects. We integrate fingers into a robot manipulator that allows for object Grasping and Rolling In Planar configurations (called GRIP-tape). The continuum kinematics of the fingers enables a multitude of manipulation capabilities such as translation, rotation, twisting, and multi-object conveyance. Furthermore, the dual mechanical properties of stiffness and softness in the fingers endow the gripper with inherent safety from collisions and enables soft-contact with objects. Deployable structures such as tape springs offer opportunities for manipulation in cluttered or remote environments."

Acknowledging the importance of user perception in this context, this study explores preference-based controller optimization for a back exosuit that assists lifting. Considering the high mental and metabolic effort discrete motor tasks impose, we used a forced-choice Bayesian Optimization approach that promotes sampling efficiency by leveraging domain knowledge about just noticeable differences between assistance settings. Optimizing over two control parameters, preferred settings were consistent within and uniquely different between participants. We discovered that overall, participants preferred asymmetric parameter configurations with more lifting than lowering assistance, and that preferences were sensitive to user anthropometrics. These findings highlight the potential of perceptually guided assistance optimization for wearable robotic devices, marking a step toward more pervasive adoption of these systems in the real world."

In this work, we propose SYMPLEX (synthetic biological part mining platform by large language model–enabled knowledge extraction), a universal gene-mining platform based on large language models. We applied SYMPLEX to mine enzymes responsible for messenger RNA (mRNA) capping, a key process in eukaryotic posttranscriptional modification, and obtained thousands of diverse candidates with traceable evidence from biomedical literature and databases. Of the 46 experimentally tested integral capping enzyme candidates, 14 demonstrated in vivo cross-species capping activity, and 2 displayed superior in vitro activity over the commercial vaccinia capping enzymes currently used in mRNA vaccine production. SYMPLEX provides a distinct paradigm for functional gene mining and offers powerful tools to facilitate knowledge discovery in fundamental research."
