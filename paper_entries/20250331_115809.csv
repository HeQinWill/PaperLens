Their high surface area and adjustable pore sizes make them ideal for a range of applications, including CO2 capture, CH4 storage, gas separation, catalysis, etc. Traditional methods of material research, which mainly rely on manual experimentation, are not particularly efficient, while with advancements in computer science, high-throughput computational screening methods based on molecular simulation have become crucial in material discovery, yet they face limitations in terms of computational resources and time. Currently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in many fields, capable of analyzing large data sets, identifying underlying patterns, and predicting material performance efficiently and accurately. This approach, termed “materials genomics”, combines high-throughput computational screening with ML to predict and design high-performance materials, significantly speeding up the discovery process compared to traditional methods. This review discusses the functions of ML in the screening, design, and performance prediction of COFs and highlights their applications across various domains like CO2 capture, CH4 storage, gas separation, and catalysis, thereby providing new research directions and enhancing the understanding of COF materials and their applications."

However, the self-purification process of the contaminants by pyrite after their migration from surface water to groundwater has been neglected. This process is accompanied by a decrease in pollutant concentration with a transition from aerobic to anaerobic environments. Here, we selected sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a micropollutant frequently detected in groundwater, as a modeled micropollutant for the investigation. The findings indicate that pyrite could degrade micropollutants SMX (20 μg/L) by self-activation with nearly 100% degradation efficiency under anaerobic conditions. It was also found that •OH was not the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS), but rather the longer-lived and more stable Fe(IV) generated by •OHad-mediated oxidation of structural Fe(III). Additionally, SMX can be degraded by outer-sphere electron transfer with dissolved Fe3+ in the system. Whereas, the reduction product Fe2+ facilitates the supply of electrons to pyrite and promotes the production of Fe (IV). The contributions of Fe(IV) and outer-sphere electron transfer to SMX degradation were 67.5% and 32.5%, respectively. Furthermore, pyrite self-activation exhibited selective oxidation of electron-rich pollutants under anaerobic conditions. This finding provides a new insight into the self-purification of micropollutants in groundwater environments."

These mélanges have compositions and metamorphic mineral assemblages dissimilar to their endmember source lithologies, resulting in a subduction zone interface with physical properties (e.g., H2O capacity, density, and viscosity) that are distinct from both the source lithologies and simple mechanical mixtures of these lithologies. Using phase equilibria modeling, we find that a large range of mélange compositions carry more H2O to sub‐arc depths and are less dense compared to equivalent mechanical mixtures. We further show that mélange is much weaker than the overlying mantle but remains stronger than quartzite deforming by dislocation creep. Lastly, we synthesize these results and find that at all subduction zones, a range of mélange compositions are likely to form diapirs at sub‐arc depths and sub‐solidus temperatures."

Small‐scale magnetic structures and waves are frequently found at and around the DFs. Whistler waves are closely related to DFs, and the flux pileup regions (FPRs) behind DFs are thought to be the source regions of the whistler waves around DFs. Statistically, whistler waves are much more frequently observed in FPRs than at DFs. Here, we present an observation of whistler waves in a magnetic hole at a DF. Theoretical calculations show that the observed whistler waves can be trapped in the magnetic hole. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest that whistler waves cannot be trapped at a DF if the DF has no sub‐structures. Our results indicate the importance of the magnetic structures on the propagation of whistler waves around the DFs and could explain why whistler waves are rarely observed at the DFs."

The Poyang Lake‐Yangtze River system has received much attention due to the reverse flow from the Yangtze River, which blocks the flow of Poyang Lake and causes extensive inundation. However, a less explored perspective is the backwater effects of lake outflow on the Yangtze River. This study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the water surface slope (WSS) along the 294 km reach upstream of the confluence. Results show that huge variations of WSS (the maximum doubles the minimum) occur due to the dynamics of lake outflow and river discharge. The backwater can extend upstream to around 74 km. Elevated water level at Jiujiang can be up to 14.1 m in the worst case.

We used the global observation‐based SAPFLUXNET data set to quantify the trees' TIC and investigate how hydroclimatic variables affect TIC across biomes. Results show that TIC (i.e., air temperature reduction (ΔT)) was highest in tropical rainforests (3.24°C m−2 d−1) and lowest in temperate grassland deserts (0.06°C m−2 d−1). ΔT was mainly driven by air temperature and vapor pressure deficit in warm‐wet biomes, while precipitation and soil water content (SWC) in hot‐dry biomes. Globally, we found an average critical SWC threshold (SWCcrit) for ΔT (0.37 m3 m−3), with higher values in warm‐wet and lower values in hot‐dry biomes.

Vapor pressure deficit is the difference between saturation vapor pressure (es) and actual vapor pressure (ea). Because es increases nonlinearly with temperature, calculations of time‐averaged VPD vary depending on the frequency of temperature measurements and how ea is calculated, potentially limiting our understanding of fire‐climate relationships. We calculate eight versions of monthly VPD across the WUS and assess their differences. Monthly VPDs calculated from daily data are 2%–6% higher, and more accurate, than when calculated from monthly data. Using daily maximum and minimum temperature, instead of mean, increases VPD by ∼20%, but can overestimate true values depending on how ea is calculated. These differences do not meaningfully impact correlations with annual wildfire area, however, suggesting our understanding of historical fire‐VPD relations is not very sensitive to how VPD is calculated."

Our findings revealed a distinct pattern of electron behavior: in the lobe regions, electrons tend to converge toward the current sheet, driven by an ambipolar electric field that is directed from the current sheet toward the lobe. Additionally, we observed that electrons are more energetic in the +E hemisphere, where the solar wind electric field points away from Mars, compared to the opposite hemisphere.

Field observations suggest that stress amplification in rigid blocks surrounded by ductile shear zones leads to seismic failure: the jostling block model. Here we quantify this model by systematically testing numerically how variations in geometry, material properties, and loading conditions impact magnitude and rate of stress amplification. We demonstrate that bulk strain rate is the dominant factor controlling stress amplification. High strain rates of 10−10–10−12 s−1 cause stresses on the 102–103–MPa level within 100–102 years, while lower strain rates are insufficient to generate the stresses required for lower‐crustal earthquakes. While geometries and material properties play a subordinate role in causing stress amplification, tests with varying loading conditions show that pure shear is more effective in generating high stress amplifications compared to simple shear in the case of the given geometry."

Our analysis reveals that mixed layer variability due to strong interannual salinity anomalies determines the changes in CEP barrier layer thickness (BLT) during El Niño Southern Oscillation events since isothermal layer variations are minimal there. During El Niño, enhanced rainfall leads to anomalous surface freshening in the CEP especially west of the dateline, while anomalous vertical‐sheared zonal current results in stronger vertical salinity stratification and thicker barrier layer east of the dateline in the CEP. Surface‐layer zonal current advection in general contributes to a thicker barrier layer in the entire CEP."

We simulated BC and BrC absorption during the intense Canadian boreal wildfires in June 2023 using an enhanced version of CHIMERE chemical and transport model. The study focused on a domain extending from North America to Eastern Europe, including the Arctic up to 85°N. The enhanced model includes an update treatment for BC absorption enhancement and a BrC aging scheme accounting for browning and blanching through oxidation. Validation against Aerosol Robotic Network and satellite data showed the model accurately reproduced aerosol optical depth (AOD) at multiple wavelengths, both near wildfire sources and during transoceanic transport to Europe. Improvements were observed in simulations of absorbing AOD (absorbing aerosol optical) compared with the baseline model. Significant enhancements were achieved in capturing the spatial distribution of aerosol absorption in areas affected by wildfire emissions. For June 2023, the regional all‐sky DRE attributed to Canadian wildfires was reduced from −2.1 W/m2 in the control model to −1.9 W/m2 in the enhanced model. This corresponded to an additional warming effect of +0.2 W/m2 (+10%) due to the advanced treatment of BC and BrC absorption. These results indicate the importance of accurate aerosol absorption modeling in regional climate predictions, during large‐scale biomass burning events. They also highlight potential overestimations of cooling effects in traditional models, emphasizing the need of improved aerosol parameterization to better simulate the DRE and for evaluating the impacts of mitigation strategies."

 Sedimentary pyrite iron and sulphur isotope compositions (δ56FePYR, δ34SPYR, Δ33SPYR) are commonly used to reconstruct global ocean properties and the evolving oxidation state of Earth’s surface, motivating exploration of impacts of diagenesis on pyrite-based proxies.

In contrast, “sulphidic zone” pyrite displays distinct late-stage morphologies and higher δ56FePYR and δ34SPYR, which reflect sulphide accumulation at the sulphate-methane transition zone and direct sulphidization of residual iron phases. We propose that coupled δ56FePYR-δ34SPYR-Δ33SPYR distributions constrain pyritization pathways and microbial and physico-chemical aspects of the depositional environment. Pyrite iron and sulfur isotopic compositions constrain the pyritization pathway and microbial and physicochemical aspects of sedimentary depositional environments, according to pyrite samples from a sedimentary core in the Danube River."

 With the intensification of climate change and human activities, water resource shortages, floods, and water quality anomalies are becoming increasingly serious. It is urgent to ensure the effective realization of water resource management, flood monitoring, and water quality assessment through fine-scale monitoring of water body spatial distribution and dynamics. Currently, various technologies have been applied to water information monitoring, with remote sensing-based spectral index methods being widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, and large-scale observation capabilities. However, the wide variety of existing water spectral indices, each suited to different scenarios and objectives, makes it challenging for ordinary users to select the most appropriate index and determine its optimal usage (i.e., threshold settings). This study addresses these challenges by evaluating the performance and applicability of 15 widely used water detection indices, using Sentinel-2 imagery across 14 representative global regions. The results revealed that the performance of water indices varied across different scenarios. Common issues include misidentification in high-reflectance backgrounds (e.g., buildings and snow), low-reflectance backgrounds (e.g., shadows), and omission errors for water bodies with high chlorophyll content. On this basis, this study provides a recommended table for water body index selection in different scenarios and a recommended range table for index thresholds, and point out key directions for future development of water body indices. This study offers valuable guidance for the selection and use of water body indices in practical application, helping to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fine-scale monitoring of water bodies."

 Heterogeneous reactions of toluene with mineral oxides play a crucial role in the formation processes of N-containing organic compounds (NOCs). However, less attention was paid to the effects of pollutant content and temperature changes on the formation of NOCs under combined pollution. In this study, the combined effects on the heterogeneous reaction of toluene/NO2/NH3 with α-Fe2O3/α-Al2O3 particles were investigated by using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The results show that the characteristic peak of the R-ONO2 group appears at 1295 cm−1, indicating benzyl nitrate formation in the presence of α-Fe2O3 with or without α-Al2O3. The addition of α-Al2O3 promotes the R-ONO2 formation on the particle surface compared to pure α-Fe2O3 as a result of the dispersion and oxidation of the additional particles. The optimal mass ratio of α-Fe2O3 and α-Al2O3 particles is 3:1. Furthermore, the optimal concentration ratio for toluene, NO2 and NH3 is determined as 2.5:2.5:1. It is obvious that NO2 and toluene are the primary sources of organic nitrates production. Higher concentration proportions of NO2 and toluene within a certain range lead to higher formation amounts of NOCs during the heterogeneous reaction. Spectral analysis demonstrates that reaction kinetics, such as reaction rate and uptake coefficient, are sensitive to temperature variations. When temperature decreases from 298 K to 253 K, the reaction rate increases from (1.59 ± 0.04) × 1018 ions g−1 s−1 to (2.38 ± 0.02) × 1018 ions g−1 s−1. Low temperature favors the production of R-ONO2, resulting from an exothermic process during the heterogeneous reaction. These findings are helpful for further exploring the combined effects on particulate NOCs formation and partly contribute to understanding of multicomponent reaction systems in real environment conditions."

Majestic,The photochemistry of quinones and combustion-derived particles in forming hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen in the atmosphere,"•Combustion-derived particles contain various photosensitizers that form ROS. •9,10-anthraquinone and juglone act as photocatalysts in forming hydroxyl radicals. •Singlet oxygen formed from quinone photolysis is used to form other products. •1,4-naphthoquinone and juglone degrade into oxidized products that form ROS. 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are byproducts of combustion processes and can undergo photooxidation in cloud water upon being emitted into the atmosphere. Quinones are among the products formed from the photochemical aging of PAHs and can undergo subsequent reactions to form environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study showed that 9,10-anthraquinone (9,10-ANTQ), 1,4-anthraquinone (1,4-ANTQ), and 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NAPQ) undergo different pathways when forming ROS. Singlet oxygen (1O2), which was monitored during the photoaging of these quinones, formed logarithmically over time in low yields (0.5 ± 0.1 μM M−1 to 1.6 ± 0.1 μM M−1) with 9,10-ANTQ and 1,4-ANTQ. However, with 1,4-NAPQ, it formed rapidly within the first 5 min, reaching high yields of 21 ± 7 μM M−1, before undergoing decay. This work suggests that 9,10-ANTQ can behave as a photocatalyst to continuously generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the atmosphere; however, it will more likely exist in its triplet state (39,10-ANTQ∗) as an EPFR. Contrarily, 1,4-ANTQ and 1,4-NAPQ will photodegrade into other products that generate ROS. Among these products is juglone, which was shown to generate •OH exponentially upon photoaging as well as degrade into other products. The varying photochemical behaviors between these different quinones help explain the overall photochemistry of combustion-derived particles, which catalytically generated 1O2 and •OH in this study. This work provides insight into the environmental fates of combustion-derived material and their oxidized derivatives and shows the potential of these compounds to generate excess atmospheric ROS."

 This study investigates long-term (1980–2014) surface ozone (O3) variability over India using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, offering a comprehensive spatial assessment crucial for addressing air quality and climate change challenges. Model outputs were compared with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) derived surface O3 to evaluate their reliability. Results reveal a persistent north-south gradient in surface O3, with higher values over northern India, consistent with satellite data. Most models indicate a positive trend in surface O3 across the country, while a negative trend is identified over parts of the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a previously unreported phenomenon. Analysis of precursor gases shows significant positive trends over India, with the IGP emerging as a hotspot. Spatial correlations between surface O3 and its precursors highlight regional heterogeneity and complex formation dynamics. VOC-limited regimes dominate across India, whereas NO/NO2-limited chemistry prevails in the IGP, explaining the decreasing trend of surface O3 despite rising NO/NO2 emissions. Among the CMIP6 models, CESM2-WACCM-FV2 is identified as the most reliable for studying surface O3 in India. The spatial distribution provided by CMIP6 models is particularly valuable in regions lacking long-term monitoring, where ground-based observations are limited to point-based measurements. This study underscores the critical role of CMIP6 models in understanding surface O3 variability and highlights the utility of satellite-derived data as a complementary resource. The findings provide actionable insights for policy efforts to mitigate surface O3 and its precursors, improving air quality and addressing climate challenges in India."

 Effects of humic like substances (HULIS) on cloud condensation nuclei, initiation of ice, and global radiative forcing of clouds highlight their significant influence on climate dynamics. However, optical properties of HULIS in cloud water and their indications remain poorly understood. Cloud water samples were gathered from June through August 2021 at Mt. Tai, China, and HULIS and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) within these samples were quantitatively analyzed. The optical characteristics of these substances were examined using UV–Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The average concentration of HULIS was 3.14 ± 2.14 mgC L−1 contributing 38 ± 15 wt% to WSOC (9.42 ± 7.50 mgC L−1). A mass absorption efficiency value at 365 nm (MAE365) of 0.72 m2 g−1 and an absorption Ångström exponent (AAE300–400) value of 3.79 were measured for HULIS compared to 0.54 m2 g−1 and 3.58 for WSOC. Three fluorescent components, i.e., less oxygenated HULIS (LO-HULIS), highly oxygenated HULIS (HO-HULIS), and protein-like substances (PRLIS), were identified in both HULIS and WSOC employing EEM and parallel factor analysis. HULIS light absorption was dominated by HO-HULIS, followed by that of LO-HULIS and PRLIS. Compared to WSOC, HULIS exhibited enhanced light absorption and a higher degree of humification, attributed to its elevated levels of HO-HULIS and LO-HULIS alongside reduced PRLIS. Furthermore, the degradation of PRLIS was posited as a potential pathway for LO-HULIS formation based on the increasing trend in the ratio of LO-HULIS:PRLIS with decreasing PRLIS in WSOC.
