It affects the livelihoods of people inhabiting permafrost areas and is affected by human activity within and outside of the cryosphere’s geographical span. ‘Frozen commons’ (FCs) are cryosphere resources and landscapes, defined by snow, ice, and permafrost, that are experienced, used, protected and managed by groups of people together. This paper highlights collaboration between herders and scientists aimed at improving the understanding of FCs in northern Mongolia, a region of rapid cryosphere transformation. The impact of climate change on Indigenous and pastoralist communities in Mongolia is profound, leading to the damage or loss of FCs critical to local livelihoods. Therefore, Indigenous and local knowledge becomes crucial in assessing and predicting the climate-driven dynamics of FCs. In 2022, 2023, 2024 a team of permafrost scientists, geographers, and economists conducted interviews in reindeer and cattle herder camps in Khövsgöl Aimag (Province) located in the northern part of Mongolia. Local livelihoods do not depend only on cattle, which allows us to examine a variety of animal–environment interactions and impacts on pastoralism. The analysis of interviews indicates that FCs are a vital resource for the Khövsgöl communities and holds significant importance in their daily lives. Permafrost plays a key role for herders as it provides water resources for pastures and local rivers, which is critical during dry summers. Ice and snow also have many uses, such as a source of water, winter transport and the basis of cultural events. As winters become shorter and ice conditions become less predictable, the sustainability and availability of these resources for local people are under threat. In light of these challenges, it is imperative to formulate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies through collaborative efforts that actively involve and respect the perspectives of Indigenous and local people."

Yet biodiversity data reveal more than species distributions. They reflect colonial histories, economic inequities, and cultural differences. This article argues for moving beyond ideas of ‘spatial bias’ in conservation science to highlight the colonial legacies and contemporary social forces that shape biodiversity data. Drawing on interviews with the GBIF staff and data publishers as well as critical mapping of GBIF data patterns, we visualize and analyze how and why colonial patterns persist and shift in this global biodiversity data. To explain diverse trajectories of postcolonial production of data, we identify three social forces–colonial legacies of collecting, infrastructures of international development, and contemporary data cultures–that structure biodiversity observation distributions and data ownership and availability. Together, these findings demonstrate how, even in the age of open access, colonial and postcolonial practices and politics continue to shape what we know about the natural world."

Data from the Global Water Intelligence and the World Bank’s International Benchmarking Network show that most of the countries with utilities with limited piped water coverage (Phase 1) have an annual GDP per capita less than US$5000. In contrast, most countries with an annual GDP per capita greater than US$10 000 have close to universal piped water coverage (Phase 3). We find no statistically significant relationship between country-level water scarcity and the average water prices charged by utilities in a country. We discuss a comprehensive policy mix with four components that municipal water utilities need to address the growing water deficits as rising demands confront limited supplies: (1) reduction of nonrevenue water, (2) source diversification, (3) reduction of customer water use, and (4) establishment of financial reserves to address climate-related emergencies."

The leading EOF (EOF1) accounts for about 14%–22% of annual and seasonal wind speed variability, and is composed of widely positive anomalies across most of the Arctic Ocean largely influenced by the positive Arctic Oscillation. Seasonally, the positive anomalies shift from the central Arctic Ocean in summer toward the Greenland and Norwegian Seas in winter, driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The second EOF (EOF2) explains 9.5% of annual wind speed changes and consists of a meridional dipole structure, i.e. positive anomalies over the Russian Arctic seas and negative anomalies over the Greenland and Norway Seas, mainly driven by the Arctic dipole and NAO. The time series of EOF2 shows a decadal switch from negative to positive anomalies at the beginning of the 21st century, related to the phase transition of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."

Jacob;Su Keun Kuk;Young-Je Park,"A decadal, hourly high-resolution satellite dataset of aerosol optical properties over East Asia","Atmospheric aerosols adversely affect human health, with East Asia recognized as one of the most impacted regions. This study presents a long-term (2011–2021), high spatiotemporal resolution aerosol optical depth dataset retrieved from a geostationary satellite over East Asia. The high-resolution data capture subtle aerosol gradients and land-ocean boundaries, providing valuable input for various fields such as aerosol-cloud interaction, climate change, ocean optics, and air quality studies. 
 Formerly known as one of the most polluted regions of the globe, East Asia underwent a dramatic improvement of air quality, especially for aerosols, starting in the 2010s. Numerous satellites have observed East Asia for a long time duration, but often with a low spatial or temporal resolution, limiting their ability to capture small-scale variabilities or provide continuous observations of long-range transport of aerosols. In this study, we provide an hourly aerosol optical property (AOP) dataset retrieved from the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), with a high spatial resolution of 2 km at nadir, covering the entire operational period from March 2011–March 2021. The dataset is retrieved using the Yonsei Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm, providing aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm as the primary product, along with fine mode fraction, single scattering albedo, Ångström exponent, and aerosol type as ancillary products. Seasonal validation of AOD against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) showed that the fraction of data points within the expected error range of 0.05 + 15 % varied from 56.4 % in June-July-August to 64.5 % in September-October-December, with the mean bias generally within ±0.05. Compared to the operational version, the high-resolution product demonstrated improved retrieval capability in the presence of broken clouds, along complex coastlines, and in capturing AOD variability at the sub-district level. The decadal AOD exhibited a decreasing trend over four major cities within the observation domain. We expect this data to be widely used in climate modelling, reanalysis, atmospheric chemistry, marine optics, environmental health studies, variability and trend analysis, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between climate change, trace gases, human health, and AOPs.

During this process, sufficient electron transfer from the catalyst surface to the antibonding π* orbitals of adsorbed NO and O2 is necessary to facilitate the adsorption and subsequent bond cleavage. Herein, an electronic orbital coupling strategy is applied by doping praseodymium (Pr) into a CeO2-TiO2 (CeTi) composite oxide to obtain a PrCeTi bifunctional catalyst, which has a strong interaction with NO to form NO+, further splitting with N3+ production and thereby enhancing NH3-SCR performance following the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. Meanwhile, O2 adsorbs on the PrCeTi catalyst surface to produce superoxide (O2–) and further transforms into peroxide (O22–) which, along with increased temperature, boosts the PhCH3 total oxidation. Finally, the coactivation of NO and O2 over the PrCeTi catalyst contributes to its better simultaneous removal efficiency of NOx and toluene than that of the CeTi catalyst."

Here, we observed distinct proteinuria in the mice exposed to sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS), an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate. The renal S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) level increased due to the decrease in its hydrolase adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY), and was positively correlated with the observed proteinuria. Consequently, the DNA methylation level was downregulated. Specifically, the promoter methylation of Arap3 increased, while the genebody methylation of Tiam1 decreased, thereby causing downregulation of their mRNA expressions. This further suppressed the levels of Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1, which then reduced their downstream genes Pip5k1a, Pip5k1b and Pip5k1c, and eventually inhibited Actn4 expression. Consequently, the podocyte cytoskeleton was disrupted, promoting foot process fusion and inducing proteinuria. Overexpression of AHCY in OBS-exposed mice reduced the level of SAH, restored the methylation levels and gene expressions, ameliorated the podocyte injury, and eventually reduced the level of urinary protein. Taken together, inhibition of AHCY was the molecular initiating event of OBS-induced proteinuria, which functioned through the AHCY–SAH–Arap3/Tiam1–RhoA/Rac1–Pip5k1a/Pip5k1b/Pip5k1c–Actn4 axis. This study provides profound insight into the potential risk of PFAS in disrupting renal function and kidney health."

Here, we present a MoS2 modification strategy to address these challenges. MoS2-modified ZVI (MoS2-ZVI) exhibited dechlorination rate constants that are 1.25 to 54 times those obtained with ZVI, for eight representative CHCs, with significantly fewer incompletely dechlorinated products. The electron efficiency values increased to 2.7–26.5 times, with the synchronously inhibited H2 evolution possibly resulting from the increased hydrophobicity caused by MoS2 modification. While H• contributes to the reduction of certain CHCs, the enhancement by MoS2 is mainly attributed to improved electron transfer at the surface. Characterization results revealed partial integration of MoS2 with ZVI and the presence of sulfur vacancies on MoS2 surfaces in MoS2-ZVI. Electrochemical experiments with separated ZVI and MoS2bm in different compartments identified sulfur vacancies as the reactive sites. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory results demonstrated that CHCs adsorb at Mo sites exposed by sulfur vacancies, and this process is facilitated by the integrated effects of underlying ZVI. The dechlorination of CHCs subsequently occurs with the electrons transferred from ZVI to the surface-bonded CHC through the MoS2 layer. This study provides a broadly applicable modification strategy for achieving rapid, full, and selective dechlorination of a wide range of CHCs."

However, its wider use faces obstacles because of the copresence of various pollutants in wastewater and the additional requirement for magnesium to achieve proper supersaturation conditions. To address these challenges, this study developed novel mineral–hydrogel composites that can remove ammonium and phosphate simultaneously via heterogeneous struvite and calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralization in hydrogel matrices. The composites include in situ formed struvite and CaP mineral seeds, decreasing the nucleation energy barrier of struvite and CaP formation and promoting their heterogeneous nucleation kinetics even under undersaturation conditions in bulk solution. The dual struvite and CaP seeded composites can simultaneously reduce the ammonium and total phosphate concentrations up to 60% (26.3 mg of N/g) and 91% (9.54 mg of P/g), respectively. The average particle sizes in composites were increased from 6.12 to 14.8 nm after wastewater treatment. Moreover, various ions commonly existing in wastewater did not significantly interfere with the removal of ammonium and phosphate. Thus, these new mineral–hydrogel composites can provide an innovative way to lower nutrient levels before discharge to streams. Moreover, encapsulating ammonium and phosphate in mineral-hydrogel composites enables their upcycling in agricultural or biorefinery applications."

This review focuses on the key distinctions in PFAS exposure between the occupational population and the general population from different countries. A systematic summary is made from the external exposure environment, exposure pathways, internal exposure levels, and health effects of the occupational population. The manufacturing, use, and disposal processes of PFAS increase their concentration levels in the ambient environment, leading to significantly higher concentrations than background areas. Different PFAS exposure pathways may lead to different molecular initiating events and health outcomes in the occupational population and the general population. Moreover, the PFAS exposure levels of the occupational population are nearly one hundred times higher than those of the general population. Mixed exposure to more unknown PFAS is another important feature of the occupational population. Although occupational exposure to PFAS is not associated with mortality, PFAS exposure can significantly disrupt metabolic pathways and cause adverse effects on the liver, kidney, and lipid homeostasis. Therefore, more stringent occupational protections for the PFAS occupational population are necessary to reduce their health risks."

However, the limited spatiotemporal coverage of current satellite-derived XCO2 data poses significant challenges to tracking CO2 variations on a large scale and over extended periods. In view of this, this study uses satellite-derived NO2 data as a suitable proxy and tracks CO2 emissions from 38 selected power plants globally by integrating near-synchronously observed TROPOMI NO2 data and OCO-2 XCO2 data. The results show that our method significantly increases the effective observation frequency by almost 200 times compared to using OCO-2 data alone. Compared to the emissions reported by the power plants, the correlation coefficient of the method used in this study (0.78) is higher than that of the emission inventory estimates (0.43–0.62), resulting in an accuracy improvement of approximately 1.8–2.3 Mt/yr per power plant. The use of satellite-derived NO2 data significantly enhances the ability to remotely estimate CO2 emissions from power plants, which gives us confidence in studying anthropogenic point-source CO2 emissions across different spatial and temporal scales.

Hydrothermal systems and submarine volcanoes are natural sources of mercury, yet the magnitude of emissions, their transport, and their impact on marine ecosystems remain poorly understood. Quantifying natural mercury fluxes is essential to understanding anthropogenic perturbations and guiding effective reduction strategies. We investigate hydrothermal mercury inputs at the Tonga volcanic arc and their impact on the local ecosystem. Our results show that hydrothermal and volcanic activity in the Tonga Arc increases mercury concentrations in seawater. Comprehensive surveys identified mercury-rich plumes (up to 22.7 pmol L–1) associated with high mercury fluxes (4763 pmol m–2 day–1) reaching productive surface waters, resulting in an estimated total flux of 4.23 t y–1 for the entire Tonga Arc. Despite these significant inputs, mercury concentrations in phytoplankton remain unexpectedly low. We demonstrate that phytoplankton blooms, stimulated by natural iron fertilization from hydrothermal sources, dilute mercury at the cellular level, reducing the impact of hydrothermal mercury. Additionally, we provide a revised global estimate of hydrothermal mercury inputs with a maximum of 120 t y–1, which is considerably lower than atmospheric and riverine inputs to the ocean."

To bridge the theoretical gap, this study investigated the mechanisms of P enrichment through microbially mediated mineralization of natural P-containing DOM by adopting an approach combining comprehensive field investigation with hydrochemical and molecular biological analyses. The co-analysis of the dominant microbial community compositions and genomics revealed that the microbial metabolism pathways involved in the biodegradation of P-containing DOM were associated with the enrichment level of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Specifically, dephosphorylation was more pronounced under conditions of limited DIP, while C–P bond cleavage was the primary metabolic pathway under sufficient DIP.

However, it faces significant challenges, including environmental compatibility, scalability, and multifunctional integration. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel strategies to improve agricultural water use efficiency. Herein, natural polysaccharides sodium alginate (SA) and thermoresponsive hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) are selected as the matrix, with SA cross-linking with Ca2+ to enable rapid gelation and continuous production of shape-controllable spheres. Additionally, carbon black (CB) and urea are incorporated through physical doping and chemical interactions to enable solar energy collection and slow-release fertilization. The synergistic effect of the hygroscopic salt and porous matrix resulted in water uptake of 0.64–3.38 g g–1 at 30–90% relative humidity. The photothermal of CB, combined with the low-temperature phase transition of HPC, facilitated low-temperature desorption and rapid solar-driven water release, achieving maximum desorption rate of 4.07 g g–1 h–1. Notably, as water was released from the material and the matrix degraded, urea was gradually discharged, with release of 224.6 ± 5.2 mg kg–1 over 30 days, providing sustained support for crop growth. This innovative approach provides sustainable and geographically unconstrained solution for agricultural water management in arid regions."

The high Cu content mitigates the risk of SO2-induced structural degradation. A key finding is that lower regeneration temperatures can lead to more severe secondary poisoning, while high temperatures induce hydrothermal aging. Thus, controlling the regeneration temperature is critical for maintaining long-term catalyst stability. Additionally, experimental results and DFT calculations show that SO2 preferentially reacts with dimer-Cu species, especially hydrogenated dimer-Cu ([CuII2(NH3)4(OH)O]+), resulting in significant sulfate accumulation. This interaction inhibits the redox cycle of Cu+/Cu2+, thereby suppressing low-temperature activity. Overall, this work elucidates the mechanisms of SO2-induced deactivation in Cu-zeolite SCR catalysts and provides valuable insights into designing Cu-SSZ-13 catalysts with enhanced sulfur resistance through Cu-Al co-optimization."

While natural organic matter exists as a ubiquitous redox mediator, how it regulates the distance scale of •OH production in a heterogeneous system remains poorly understood. This study, for the first time, reports an unrecognized route mediated by humic acid (HA) in extending the spatial range of •OH from oxygenation of reduced hematite (rHem). The results showed that HA facilitated the spatial redistribution of •OH from the surface to the solution, posing inverse impacts on oxidation efficacies of pollutants with varying surface accessibilities. It was difficult to explain the enhanced free •OH production using electron shuttling by quinones or dissolved Fe–HA complexes. Comprehensive evidence demonstrated that adsorbed HA preferentially consumed surface-bound •OH to trigger a solid-to-liquid propagation of carbon-centered radicals (CCR•), dominantly promoting formation of secondary free •OH far from the surface. Reactive-transport simulation and in situ fluorescence results visualized interfacial and centimeter-scale long-range production of •OH mediated by CCR•. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry verified the role of surface decarboxylation of adsorbed HA in CCR• generation.

Many emerging and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been disposed into the world’s oceans, exemplified by the recent discovery of large amounts of the halogenated pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) waste in the waters of Southern California. The biological mechanisms governing persistence and trophic transfer of marine pollutants into seafood species remain incompletely understood. Xenobiotic transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are present in all organisms and prevent the accumulation of toxic chemicals. Our previous work has demonstrated that halogenated marine pollutants can act as inhibitors of human and murine P-gp transporters by interacting with their binding site and impeding transport. Using cryo-EM, we determined the molecular interactions of DDT with P-glycoprotein from yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). The results reveal that the conformation of the transporter samples multiple degrees of widening in the absence of substrate. We also show that DDT binds in a singular, wide inward-facing conformation that could inhibit the transport cycle. This transporter inhibition may contribute to the bioaccumulation of DDT in tuna. This study highlights the capacity of persistent organic pollutants to act at multiple points in the food chain to inhibit this critical transport mechanism."

While microbial communities constitute the resilient power of lake ecosystems to CyanoHAB disturbances, the role of fungi remains underexplored. Here, the dynamics of size-fractionated fungal and associated bacterial communities were tracked across the peak and decline stages of a CyanoHAB event in shallow subtropical Lake Taihu. The results revealed that the composition of fungal and bacterial communities in separated size fractions varied between bloom stages, with enrichment patterns likely influenced by their reliance on algal-derived nutrients. Null model-based analysis revealed a shift in fungal community assembly, from dominance by dispersal limitation (44%) and drift (30%) at the peak stage to increased homogeneous selection (44%) at the early decline stage, whereas bacterial communities remained predominantly shaped by stochastic processes, highlighting their distinct responses to cyanobacterial biomass decomposition. Comparative topological analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks showed strengthened cross-kingdom fungi-bacteria interactions as the bloom declined, especially within decomposing cyanobacterial colonies, facilitating nutrient cycling and accelerating cyanobacterial biomass removal. These findings led to a conceptual model proposing fungi as critical members of the freshwater microbiome in eutrophic lakes, driving biogeochemical cycling and potentially contributing to the resilience of the lake ecosystem against CyanoHABs."

To assess the role of fire ash in altering CO2 and CH4 fluxes in aquatic sediments, we designed three mesocosm experiments that compared the changing fluxes of these gases and water quality parameters under different loads and types of ash. Black ash (char) caused substantial drops in pH and increased CO2 and CH4 emissions through abiotic and biotic mechanisms, while white ash dramatically increased pH and enhanced CH4 emissions, possibly due to inhibition of methanotrophy. White ash-driven increases in pH also instigated CO2 uptake. If this abiotically driven CO2 uptake could interact with ash-driven nutrient fertilization to synergistically enhance biotic CO2 uptake in surface waters after a fire, these initial increases in pH may represent an important priming effect. Our findings suggest that strong ash flows following fires may trigger substantial pulses of heterotrophic or abiotically driven greenhouse gas emissions or uptake in recipient lentic aquatic ecosystems, which─although they may be overshadowed by autotrophic responses─may nonetheless be central to altered lake or wetland carbon balance following a fire."

Biofiltration using adsorbents with dual adsorption–biodegradation functions, such as biological anion exchange resins (BAERs), offers a promising solution. Compared to biological activated carbon (BAC), BAERs’ adjustable skeletons enable targeted EfOM removal. This study designed two BAERs with polystyrene (PS-AER) and magnetic polyacrylic (MPA-AER) skeletons and compared them with conventional polyacrylic BAER (PA-AER) and BACs. During 12 000-bed-volume field applications, BAERs demonstrated 1.7–2.6 and 1.6–2.6 times higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 removal rates than BACs. This efficacy stemmed from the high concentration of negatively charged components, which BAERs effectively attract. Furthermore, skeleton modifications improved DOC removal by 15.3–17.2% and UV254 removal by 7.3–18.2% for PS-AER and MPA-AER, compared to PA-AER. The MPA-AER’s open pore structure enhanced diffusion of high molecular weight components, while PS-AER’s enhanced hydrophobicity improved aromatic component removal. These structural changes also influenced the biological effects of BAERs. Notably, the enhanced performance of PS-AER and MPA-AER reduced wastewater cytotoxicity and controlled the production of disinfection byproducts.

This study aimed to evaluate the adverse effects of ITs at human-relevant levels on the male mammal reproductive system. First, we employed testicular cells to determine all test ITs exerting relatively high toxicity, with 2-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT) exhibiting toxicity higher than that of other ITs. Then, the OIT was administered to mice through drinking water at nominal doses of 50 and 5000 μg/kg/day from gestational day 10. Consequently, we found that the two doses of the OIT caused retarded testis development in suckling pups, accompanied by male reproductive impairments in adulthood, including decreased sperm count and increased malformations. When receiving subsequent spermatogenic stress induced by an injection of busulfan, OIT-exposed mice exhibited more pronounced testicular abnormalities and sperm defects, indicating increased susceptibility to stress. In addition, our in vitro results of germ cell line and mouse sperm, combined with sperm defects in animals, suggest the possibility that OIT-caused testicular impairments are partly due to its binding to thiol-containing molecules. Altogether, our study for the first time shows that exposure to OIT at human-relevant levels not only impairs the male reproductive system but also induces it to be more susceptible to subsequent spermatogenic stress, which highlights reproductive health risks of OIT."

Despite extensive research, decoupling these two steps and quantifying their relative contributions remain challenging due to the lack of reliable characterization methods. Here, we develop a rapid, reproducible electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) protocol incorporating advanced electrical equivalent circuits to directly quantify partitioning and diffusion resistance. Its validity is verified through membrane filtration experiments and activation energy analysis. Our findings reveal that diffusion dominates ion transport resistance, with values 4.5 to 6.0 times higher than partitioning resistance across diverse monovalent cations. However, we discovered a critical concentration-dependent behavior where partitioning resistance becomes increasingly significant at lower electrolyte concentrations, eventually equaling diffusion resistance near 0.1 mM. We also uncovered that the anomalously low rejection of NH4+ of RO membranes stemmed from significantly reduced diffusion resistance, likely due to moderate hydrogen-bonding interactions with membrane pores or its tetrahedral geometry. This quantitative insight into transport resistance mechanisms establishes new design principles for next-generation RO membranes, enabling tailored strategies for applications ranging from high-salinity desalination to the removal of low-concentration micropollutants."

 Anthropogenic activities impose multiple concurrent pressures on soils globally, but responses of soil microbes to multiple global change factors are poorly understood. Here, we apply 10 treatments (warming, drought, nitrogen deposition, salinity, heavy metal, microplastics, antibiotics, fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) individually and in combinations of 8 factors to soil samples, and monitor their bacterial and viral composition by metagenomic analysis. We recover 742 mostly unknown bacterial and 1865 viral Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs), and leverage them to describe microbial populations under different treatment conditions. The application of multiple factors selects for prokaryotic and viral communities different from any individual factor, favouring the proliferation of potentially pathogenic mycobacteria and novel phages, which apparently play a role in shaping prokaryote communities. We also build a 25 M gene catalog to show that multiple factors select for metabolically diverse, sessile and non-biofilm-forming bacteria with a high load of antibiotic resistance genes. Finally, we show that novel genes are relevant for understanding microbial response to global change. Our study indicates that multiple factors impose selective pressures on soil prokaryotes and viruses not observed at the individual factor level, and emphasizes the need of studying the effect of concurrent global change treatments.

Data from six Phanerozoic periods suggest a ~ 4‰ rise in the δ18Oseawater since the Carboniferous. 
 The oxygen isotope composition of seawater (δ18Oseawater) is shaped by high- and low-temperature rock-water interactions, reflecting Earth system’s dynamics and evolution. The history of δ18Oseawater remains debated due partly to post-depositional imprints to all current mineral proxies. The oxygen atoms in sulfate minerals are among the most inaccessible to later exchange but often not in isotope equilibrium with ambient water. However, the δ18Osulfate may reach a plateau or approach equilibrium with the δ18Oseawater as the corresponding δ34Ssulfate increases during microbial sulfate reduction. Here we show 289 paired δ18O-δ34S values for sedimentary barite spanning six periods of the Phanerozoic Eon. The δ18O-δ34S trajectories point to variable equilibrium δ18Obarite values for different periods. A ~ 4‰ lower δ18Oseawater value is evident before the Carboniferous than today if assuming the same formation temperature. Utilizing the barite δ18O-δ34S trajectory approach, we now have a robust proxy to advance the long-debated issue of seawater δ18O history.

Here, the authors apply high-throughput screening to identify selective covalent inhibitors that target serine hydrolases in Staphylococcus aureus 
 Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteria-associated mortality worldwide. New tools are needed to both image and treat this pathogen. We previously identified a group of S. aureus serine hydrolases (Fphs), which regulate aspects of virulence and lipid metabolism. However, due to high structural and functional similarities, it remains challenging to distinguish the specific roles of members of this family. Here, we apply a high-throughput screening approach using a library of covalent electrophiles to identify inhibitors for FphB, FphE, and FphH. We identify selective covalent inhibitors for each target without the need for extensive medicinal chemistry optimization. Structural and biochemical analysis identify novel binding modes for several of the inhibitors. Functional studies using the inhibitors suggest that all three hydrolases likely play distinct functional roles in biofilm formation and virulence. This approach has the potential to be applied to target hydrolases in other diverse pathogens or higher eukaryotes.

 Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs) are key drivers of precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), triggering heavy precipitation both locally and in downstream regions. This work reveals that an early burst of TPVs significantly enhances the extreme precipitation over the TP in early spring. Variation in burst date of TPVs during 1979–2023 is investigated, and the underlying mechanism is explored. It is reported that the burst date of TPVs tends to be much earlier, gradually shifting from April to March. Rapid sea ice cover decline in the northern North Atlantic, under the sea surface warming context, intensifies the subsequent upward surface heat flux in the sea near Scandinavia. This process promotes the negative phase of Scandinavia teleconnection pattern (STP) in March, which benefits the genesis of TPVs by strengthening the cyclonic convergence and ascending motion over the TP."

 Ice loss from Antarctica’s vast freshwater reservoir could threaten coastal communities and the global economy if the ice volume decreases by just a few percent. Observed changes in mass balance are limited to  ~40 years, and are difficult to interpret in the context of an ice sheet with response time scales reaching centuries to millennia. To gain a much longer-term perspective, here we combine transient and equilibrium Parallel Ice Sheet Model simulations of Antarctic Ice Sheet response to glacial-interglacial warming and cooling cycles over the last 800,000 years. We find hysteresis that is caused by the long response time and by crossing of tipping points. Notably, West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse contributes over 4 m sea-level rise in equilibrium ice sheet states with little (0.25 °C) or even no ocean warming above present. Therefore, today we are likely already at (or almost at) an overshoot scenario, supporting recent studies warning of substantial irreversible ice loss with little or no further climate warming.

 Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux, or soil respiration, is a critical control on net ecosystem carbon (C) balance. Using long-term (2002-2020) measurements at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, U.S.), we show that soil respiration rates have notably increased since ~2015. In 2020, cumulative summer respiration flux was approximately 90% higher than the average summer flux over the 2002–2015 period. The increase in soil respiration cannot be explained directly by temperature or pH change alone. We also found that heterotrophic microbial C mineralization and microbial biomass C have also increased rapidly since ~2015, pointing towards an increase in the bioavailability of organic C substrates. We suggest that these observations are consistent with a hypothetical increase in plant allocation of C belowground in response to changing climatic and soil conditions. Quantification of interactions among co-occurring global change factors (e.g., warming temperatures, increasing atmospheric CO2, and nutrient limitation) is needed to predict how the soil C reservoir will continue to respond to global environmental changes.

 Straw burning poses significant threats to local air quality and nearby public health by emitting harmful pollutants during specific seasons. Traditional satellite-based remote sensing techniques encounter difficulties in monitoring small-scale straw-burning events due to long revisit intervals and low spatial resolution. To address this challenge, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging sensors have emerged as a rapid and cost-effective solution for monitoring and detecting straw fires. This paper presents the UAV-StrawFire dataset, which comprises RGB images, thermal infrared images, and videos captured during controlled straw residue burning experiments in southern China using drones. The dataset is annotated and labeled to support the application of detection, segmentation, and tracking algorithms. This study addresses three key machine learning tasks using the dataset: (1) flame detection, achieved through a feature-based multi-modal image fusion model (FF-YOLOv5n) reaching a mAP50-95 of 0.5764; (2) flame segmentation, which delineates fire boundaries using the real-time lightweight BiSeNetV2 model, achieving a high mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score exceeding 0.88; and (3) flame tracking, which monitors the real-time progression of straw burning with a precision of 0.9065 and a success rate of 0.6593 using the Aba-ViTrack algorithm, suitable for on-board processing on UAVs at 50 frames per second (FPS). These experiments provide efficient baseline models for UAV-based straw-burning monitoring with edge computing capabilities. The UAV-StrawFire dataset enables the detection and monitoring of flame regions with varying sizes, textures, and opacities, thereby supporting potential straw-burning control efforts. The dataset is publicly available on IEEE Dataport, offering a valuable resource for researchers in the remote sensing and machine learning communities to advance the development of effective straw-burning monitoring systems."

 Spatial and temporal data gaps present a significant challenge to high-frequency surface water mapping using satellite imagery. Utilizing observations from temporally close periods and multi-modal sensors for gap-filling is of critical importance. However, discontinuous pixel values inherent to conventional water maps hinder the application of deep learning methods, which are effective and popular for relevant studies. In this study, a novel approach, termed “gap-filling of surface water probability”, is introduced to achieve seamless surface water mapping. A new fused dataset tailored for this purpose was constructed, consisting of paired synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and surface water probability data with a 10-meter spatial resolution at a 10-day interval. A Generative CNN-Transformer (GCT) for Gap-Filling (GF) of surface water probability, GCT-GF, was then proposed to integrate the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to reconstruct gapless water probability images from multi-modal and multi-temporal data. The GCT-GF employs a coarse-to-fine structure: information from different time points is initially aggregated using a branched gated inpainting module, followed by refinement and alignment of the coarse output under target SAR guidance. For adversarial learning, a branched SN-PatchGAN discriminator is introduced to adapt to the multi-temporal input. The results show that the GCT-GF surpasses the state-of-the-art relevant methods in quantitative metrics and visual perception. The fusion of multi-modal, multi-temporal inputs obvious enhance the gap-filling performance across varying gap ratios. Applied to Baiyangdian, Poyang Lake Basin and Qinghai Lake, GCT-GF demonstrates its high reliability on large scale scenes."

 The increasing complexity and scale of remote sensing datasets, coupled with the challenges of accurately estimating algorithmic time efficiency, often lead to significant resource waste or even failure when using machine learning algorithms in urgent or resource-constrained scenarios. Accurate time efficiency estimation is critical for deploying effective algorithms, yet it remains challenging due to the many factors influencing computational performance. Traditional methods of evaluating time efficiency often neglect the effects of core model parameters and complex data scales in spectral and temporal dimensions. In addition, inference time, an essential factor in real-world applications, is often overlooked. To address these limitations, we propose the Time Efficiency Assessment Framework (TEAF), a novel method for evaluating the time efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Through mathematical reasoning, TEAF models the training and inference time as functions (ψ) of complex data scales and core model parameters. The strong linear correlation between ψ and the actual runtime allows TEAF to accurately predict the time and cost of machine learning tasks with a low computational overhead before algorithm execution. To validate this framework, we derived TEAF formulations for five classical machine learning algorithms and tested them on state-of-the-art hyperspectral image datasets and Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets. The results demonstrated that TEAF could accurately predict both training and inference time for various algorithms, with a strong linear correlation between ψ and actual runtime (R2>0.942). This study offers a practical solution to the challenges posed by the increasing volume and complexity of data in remote sensing image processing.

The analysis shown that during the currents' attenuation stage, the temporal evolutions of the intensities of ionic and neutral atomic lines exhibited a close alignment with those of the breakdown and corona currents, respectively. The peak value of the total intensity of ionic lines were significantly larger than and ahead of that of the corresponding total intensity of neutral atomic lines. In the initial stage of the return stroke, the total intensity of ionic lines exhibits a rapid decay along the channel, approximating an exponential decay. Following the peak of the return stroke current, the total intensity of ionic lines along the channel decays slower, transitioning to a linear decay or remaining constant, and in some cases, even increasing along the channel. The total intensity of ionic lines can increase along the channel, which differs from previously reported results of the total intensity of ionic lines decaying or remaining constant along the channel. The total intensity of neutral atomic lines decays linearly with channel height in the initial phase of the return stroke, then also can increase along the channel.

 Snow plays a critical role in global climatic, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes. As a result, snow droughts have gained considerable attention in recent research in the context of global climate change. However, there are few studies on the long-term variations in global snow droughts. Therefore, we analyzed the trend of global snow droughts from 1951 to 2021 using the Snow Water Equivalent Index (SWEI) calculated from the ERA5-Land dataset, including the availability of ERA5-Land data, SWEI variation trends, changes in SWEI with latitude and elevation, as well as the frequency, severity, and risk of snow droughts. Our findings show that ERA5-Land demonstrates relatively good performance in simulating snow depth. There has been a significant intensification of global snow droughts over the past 71 years, with a period of mitigation from 1959 to 1979 and intensification from 1980 to 2021, particularly in spring. Snow drought occurrence varies considerably with latitude and elevation. Over the 71-year period, the area, frequency, severity, and risk of snow droughts initially declined, followed by an increase, with the lowest levels observed in the 1980s. Compared to the 1951–1979 period, the 1980–2021 period saw elevated levels of snow drought frequency, severity, and risk. The most severely affected areas include the midwestern United States, western and eastern Canada, south-central Europe, western Siberia, Russia, Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and northeastern China. This study provides a scientific basis for snow drought early warning systems and enhances the ability of regions to cope with the impacts of potential snow droughts."

The separation of the multiplication layer controls the density of trap states while amplifying the response of conventional narrowband photodetectors by more than 215 times. The carrier dynamics were characterized by ultrafast measurement, thus verifying the mechanism of response amplification. By analyzing multiplication with different trap states energy levels under charge injection, it is shown that dopants have a wide selection space, providing a feasible path for high-performance narrowband photodetectors.

Here, we show that PqqU binds PQQ with high affinity and determine the high-resolution structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex, revealing that PqqU undergoes conformational changes in PQQ binding to capture the cofactor in an internal cavity. We show that these conformational changes preclude the binding of a bacteriophage, which targets PqqU as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ structure, we identify amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla occupying diverse habitats, indicating that PQQ is an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies."

Despite its abundance, the impact of defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, on davemaoite’s properties under mantle conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we use machine learning molecular dynamic simulations to examine the behavior of oxygen-deficient davemaoite structures under high pressures and temperatures. Our simulations reveal its superionic transition driven by oxygen’s diffusion, enhancing electrical conductivities. Our predicted phase diagrams demonstrate that higher oxygen vacancy concentrations expand the superionic phase region. This superionic behavior implies that defective davemaoite could play a critical role in early mantle oxidation and deep-Earth oxygen cycling, providing a potential major source of mobile oxygen in the deep mantle. These findings offer fresh insights into the geodynamic processes in Earth’s early mantle and suggest that oxygen-deficient davemaoite could primarily contribute to the electrical conductivity and oxidation state of the deep lower mantle."

However, the mechanisms by which APC/C mediates developmental processes are not fully understood. In this study, we show that APC/C and its activator FZR-1 regulate the chromatin regulators MES-4 and MES-3. These proteins are part of histone methylation complexes essential for maintaining germline stem cell (GSC) identity in the germ line ofCaenorhabditis elegans. APC/CFZR-1facilitates the degradation of MES-4 and MES-3 when GSCs transition toward differentiating into oocytes. The activity of APC/CFZR-1is restricted by the Notch signaling pathway provided by the distal tip cell, which is responsible for maintaining the stemness of the GSC pool. This negative regulation enables the accumulation of MES-3 and MES-4 in GSCs, offering an additional component by which niche activity modulates theC. elegansgerm line."

During subsequent rest or sleep, the activity patterns of these neurons often correlate with those observed during the preceding experience. Growing evidence suggests that these reactivations play a crucial role in memory consolidation, the process by which experiences are solidified in cortical networks for long-term storage. Here, we use longitudinal two-photon Ca2+imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, to show that targeted manipulation of PV+inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuates cue-specific reactivations and learning, with only minute effects on spontaneous activity and no apparent effect on normal function such as visual cue–elicited responses during training. In control mice, reactivations were biased toward salient cues, persisted for hours after training had ended, and the prevalence of reactivations was aligned with the learning process. Overall, our results underscore a crucial role for cortical reactivations in memory consolidation."

Here, we successfully synthesized two polymorphic gold nanoclusters (Au8-C and Au8-P) and investigated their stacking-dependent piezoluminescence based on hydrostatic pressure. Under compression, Au8-C exhibits notable piezoluminescence enhancement. However, Au8-P presents monotonic piezoluminescence quenching. High-pressure structural characterizations confirm the existence of stacking-dependent anisotropic compression in Au8-C and Au8-P. Under high pressure, the columnar-stacked Au8-C shrinks faster along theaaxis, increasing the aspect ratio (AR) of the fusiform Au8core. However, the layered Au8-P is compressed faster along thecaxis, reducing the AR and leading to a flatter Au8core. High-pressure femtosecond transient absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence, and Raman spectra collaboratively confirm that differentiated anisotropic compression notably suppresses nonradiative loss caused by low-frequency vibrations of the Au8core, which is responsible for the piezoluminescence enhancement in Au8-C."

We found that normal and high-fat diet–fed L cell–specificPiezo1knockout (IntL-Piezo1−/−) mice exhibited reduced circulating GLP-1 levels, increased hepatic lipid accumulation, decreased β-catenin expression, and elevated lipogenesis-related genes and proteins, including SREBP1c, PPARγ, FASN, and ACC. Treatment with exendin-4 improved fatty liver inIntL-Piezo1−/−mice by stimulating β-catenin and inhibiting de novo lipogenesis. Intestinal bead implantation stimulated GLP-1 release and inhibited lipid synthesis in livers of diet-induced obese mice but not inIntL-Piezo1−/−mice. In primary hepatocytes derived fromIntL-Piezo1−/−mice, lipid accumulation and enhanced fatty acid synthesis were associated with reduced β-catenin expression and impaired nuclear translocation.

However, common signals must be extracted from geographically sparse records. Here, by applying low-frequency component analysis (LFCA) to tide gauge records and surface climate reconstructions, we isolate three coherent modes of Pacific Ocean variability that we ascribe to: a secular, greenhouse gas–driven climate change (LFC1); a nonlinear mode of variability with a reversal around 1980, potentially linked to aerosols (LFC2); and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (LFC3). Although sea level trend patterns reflect the superimposed contribution of all modes, satellite-era trends are dominated by an increasing phase of LFC2: They are thus potentially unrepresentative of both longer-term historical patterns and those expected in the future."

However, the stereoselective conversion of planar indole rings into three-dimensional indoline skeletons bearing multiple stereogenic centers remains a persistent challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe an intermolecular catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of simple indoles via a palladium-catalyzed three-component cross-coupling reaction. By using readily accessible diazonium salts and aromatic boronic acids as arylative reagents under a ligand-swap strategy, this method enables the efficient construction of 2,3-diarylated indolines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral BiOx ligand governs the highly stereoselective migratory insertion of the aryl-palladium intermediate into the indole’s C═C double bond with complete diastereo- and regioselectivity, whereas the achiral fumarate ligand facilitates the reductive elimination step, as corroborated by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, this protocol is extended to the dearomative diarylation of benzofurans, affording chiral 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with high stereocontrol."

The rapid switch from icehouse to greenhouse conditions, along with the higher mean rate of temperature change during LOME II, resulted in a much higher mean extinction rate during LOME II than I (71.6% versus 8.4% species loss per 100 thousand years, respectively), implying that the rate of climate change was a primary control on the tempo of the LOME."

Our study further uncovers a broader picture—an L-shaped hybrid network, supported by spatial patterning: Food-related PNs diverge across KC classes, whereas pheromone-sensitive PNs converge on γ KCs. α/β KCs specialize in food odors, whereas γ KCs integrate diverse inputs. Such spatial arrangement extends further to the antennal lobe (AL) and lateral horn (LH), shaping a systematic olfactory landscape. Moreover, our functional validations align with computational predictions of KC odor encoding based on the hybrid connectivity, correlating PN-KC activity with behavioral preferences. In addition, our simulations showcase the network’s augmented sensitivity and precise discrimination abilities, underscoring the computational benefits of this hybrid architecture in olfactory processing."

However, the modulation of spin state is still challengeable for most OER catalysts, and there remains a debate on deciphering the active spin state in OER. Here, we pioneered an asymmetric Fe-incorporated NiPS3tactic system to retune the metal localized spin for efficient OER electrocatalysis. It is unraveled that the synergistic effect of medium-spin FeIIIsite and P/S coordination can effectively boost OER activity and Cl resistance selectivity in alkaline/sea water. Resultantly, the Fe/NiPS3-based asymmetric electrodes exhibit low cell voltages of 1.50 volts/1.52 volts in alkaline/sea water at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter, together with a sustainable retention for 1000 hours. It also delivers the durable performance in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers with a low operation voltage at 45°C.

Despite their significance, the origins of secondary eggshell units remain understudied, leading to debates in paleontology, including the hypothesis of an abiogenic origin for these structures. Here, we demonstrate that secondary eggshell units in non-avian dinosaur eggshells are biogenic in nature, based on analyses using advanced microscopic techniques. The structural characteristics of these units suggest a formation mechanism similar to that of turtle and crocodile eggshells, with matrix fibers likely initiating their development. Furthermore, a diminishing presence of secondary eggshell units in non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs points to the evolution of a more refined physiological process for eggshell formation in this lineage.
