10.1088/1748-9326/ada04c,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是城市形态、人口增长和城市用水需求之间的关系。研究使用城市增长模型预测洛杉矶地区2100年的城市土地开发强度和用水需求，考虑了不同的人口情景和城市发展强度情景。研究的重点是通过结合高分辨率人口情景、城市土地覆盖变化和城市用水需求预测，来分析城市形态对城市用水需求的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。,[],Stephen B Ferencz;Jim Yoon;Johanna Capone;Ryan A McManamay,Urban morphology and urban water demand: a case study in the land constrained Los Angeles region using urban growth modeling,"The interactions between population growth, urban morphology, and water demand have important implications for water resources and supply in urban regions. Water use for irrigation comprises a significant fraction of urban water demand, and is potentially influenced by long-term changes in urban morphology. To investigate this, we used spatially explicit projections of urban land development intensity (fraction impervious area) generated from a 30 m resolution urban growth model for the Los Angeles (LA) region. Recent historical data on water use and high resolution landcover were used to establish relationships between green area, urban development intensity, and outdoor water demand. These relationships were then used to project outdoor and total water demand in 2100 using the urban growth model outputs. We considered two different population scenarios informed by the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) projections for the region (SSP3 and SSP5), and three scenarios of urban development intensification. Our analysis is resolved for over 80 water providers in the region, from the urban core to suburban fringe, and highlights diverse demand responses influenced by initial urban form and water demand attributes. Assumptions about outdoor water use factors based on recent water supply data were found to be nearly as influential on future outdoor demand as the urban growth scenario settings. Compared to previous studies, our work is unique in coherently linking high resolution SSP population scenarios, urban land cover evolution, and urban water demand projections, demonstrating the approach for the LA region—the largest population center in the western United States."

In this study the trade-offs between socio-economic, environmental, and health indicators were analyzed in different dietary scenarios for Bangladesh between 2022 and 2050. We used a global economic simulation model with updated national food consumption data, extended with a footprint module to track environmental impacts through the food value chain in Bangladesh and its trading partners. This study compares a business-as-usual (BAU) diet with the EAT-Lancet diet and the Bangladesh food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs). The BAU diet has a higher intake of animal products and sugar, and a lower intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts than the EAT-Lancet and FBDG diets. We found that promoting a diet with more plant-based proteins has a strong positive impact on dietary health and an overall positive impact on the environment compared to the BAU scenario. This is due to the reduced impact of animal protein production on greenhouse gas emissions and the reduced impact of rice production on water use and nitrogen application. In addition, the transition to sustainable and healthy diets had minor impacts on the wages of low-skilled workers, Bangladesh’s self-sufficiency, and the affordability of food and cereals. In particular, the FDBG diet scenario scored best on diet and cereal affordability, as well as freshwater use compared to the other two scenarios. The decrease in the self-sufficiency ratio was comparable to the BAU diet scenario and smaller compared to the EAT-Lancet diet."

This lack of policy stringency is driven by a complex combination of a country’s numerous politico-economic, institutional and socio-economic characteristics. While extant studies aim at estimating causal effects between a selection of such characteristics and policy stringency, we examine the importance of a comprehensive set of predictors that underlie such empirical models. For this purpose, we employ machine-learning methods on a data set covering 22 potential predictors of policy stringency for 95 countries. Conditional random forests suggest that the most important predictors of policy stringency are of institutional nature: freedom (of press, media, associations, and elections), governmental effectiveness, and control of corruption. Further, accumulated local effects plots suggest that the relationship between some predictors, e.g. freedom or education, and policy stringency is highly non-linear."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada170,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了北半球森林碳汇在干旱胁迫下的恢复能力，以及大气和土壤水分亏缺的复合影响。研究发现，干旱加剧导致森林NEP恢复能力下降，而高蒸汽压差(VPD)加剧了土壤水分亏缺的负面影响，降低了树木的参考冠层导度(Gcref)，从而削弱了NEP的恢复能力。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术，特别是卫星观测，可以用于监测大气中的蒸汽压差、土壤水分和植被状况，从而评估森林碳汇的动态变化和对干旱的响应。研究中使用的气象观测数据很可能就来自于此类遥感技术。因此，该研究结果对于利用遥感技术监测和预测森林碳汇对气候变化的响应具有重要意义。,"['atmospheric water deficit', 'vapor pressure deficit', 'soil moisture', 'remote sensing', 'satellite observations', 'drought monitoring', 'carbon sink', 'forest ecosystem', 'Net ecosystem productivity (NEP)']",Xiaoyun Wu;Hang Xu;Jianzhuang Pang;Zhiqiang Zhang,Declining resilience of forest carbon sinks linked to increased atmospheric water deficit during droughts in the Northern Hemisphere,"Droughts have posed intense threats to the forest carbon sink (i.e. net ecosystem productivity, NEP), potentially elevating the risk of forest degradation and challenging the achievement of climatic and ecological goals. While global forest NEP endured, the resilience of NEP served as the ability of ecosystems to withstand and recover from perturbations and the underlying maintenance mechanisms during droughts remain unclear. Here, we explored the responses of NEP resilience, quantified by the lag-1 temporal autocorrelation coefficient (TAC) of two consecutive time series, to droughts based on 87 drought events across 45 forest sites with flux and meteorological observations in the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, an interpretable machine learning algorithm was utilized to disentangle the synergistic effects of environmental and biotic factors on TAC, achieving a mean coefficient of determination of 0.87 for drought events with significantly increasing TAC and 0.91 for other drought events. Here, we found that the increase in NEP resilience could alleviate the negative effects of droughts, in contrast to a 2.5 times increase in the probability of NEP decline events associated with decreased NEP resilience. However, NEP resilience declined with the rise of drought intensification. The reduced reference canopy conductance (Gcref) was the primary constraint on NEP resilience maintenance, contributing 48% to the total influence of biotic factors. In addition, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbated the negative effects of soil moisture deficit, jointly leading to the decline in NEP resilience. Specifically, elevated VPD during droughts significantly reduced Gcref, indicating the vulnerability of tree hydraulic systems to compound stress. Overall, our study emphasizes the potential risks of the compound soil and atmospheric water deficit on forest NEP resilience and carbon sink across the Northern Hemisphere in the future."

Continuous measurements with the instrument allow for the characterization of water-insoluble particles in ice cores at high resolution with a minimized risk of contamination. The SPES method can be used to investigate particles smaller than 1 μm, which previously could not be detected by instruments typically used in CFA. Moreover, the SPES method provides not only the particle concentration and size distribution but also the effective refractive index. We show that nonabsorbing mineral particles and absorbing particles from both wildfires and fossil fuel burning can be detected with the SPES method in shallow ice cores from North–East Greenland. The concentration record retrieved with SPES correlates well with established methods used in continuous measurements of dust content in ice cores. Year-to-year variations in the number distribution of the diameter are only detectable by stacking annual layers because of the low nonabsorbing particle concentration of late Holocene ice of approximately 6 × 104 mL–1. The median diameter in the bottom 20 m of the EGRIP-S7 core is found to be 0.75 μm (0.72 μm) during the annual maximum (minimum) in dust concentration."

However, the transformation pathways of BrC chromophores, especially in the presence of photochemically active species, such as nitrate, are not well understood. In this study, the nitrate-mediated aqueous-phase photooxidation of three typical BrC chromophores from biomass burning was investigated, including 4-nitrocatechol, 3-nitrosalicylic acid, and 3,4-dinitrophenol. Variations in nitrate concentrations, pH, and temperatures were systematically examined to assess their impacts on the apparent photolysis rates of these BrC chromophores. The results show that increasing nitrate concentrations significantly enhances apparent photolysis rates to 3–3.5 times compared to nitrate-free conditions. Also, a temperature rise from 0 to 30 °C increases apparent photolysis rates by a factor of 1.3–2.5 for these chromophores. However, the effect of pH varies among these chromophores, depending on the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis suggests that the photooxidation of these chromophores initiates with the addition of nitro and/or hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring, followed by a ring-opening reaction and the formation of smaller, highly oxygenated molecules including formic acid, glyoxylic acid, malonic acid, and nitropropanoic acid. This study highlights the key role of nitrate in the aqueous-phase photooxidation of BrC, altering the aging pathways and shortening the atmospheric lifetimes of BrC. These results are of particular importance for a better understanding of BrC aging and its radiative forcing, given the increase of the nitrate mass fraction in aerosols of China in recent years."

Luthy,"Assessing Regional Strategies to Cope with Drought, Climate, and Environmental Flow Policy Impacts for a Sustainable Water Supply: A Case Study of the Bay Area","California’s Bay-Delta watershed encompasses 40% of the state’s runoff and serves water supply and irrigation needs throughout the state. A recently amended policy attempts to rebalance water supply and ecological outcomes by requiring 40% of the flow to remain in-stream in the Tuolumne River and other tributaries between February 1 and June 30 each year. This policy impacts water supply diversions serving millions of customers in the San Francisco Bay Area. This work analyzes possible regional coping responses in the context of climate and policy uncertainty, exploring the effectiveness of various strategies to mitigate climate and policy impacts and improve future water supply outcomes. We find that climate uncertainty has a dominant impact on three measures of water supply performance: the frequency of full storage reserves, minimum storage level, and uncaptured flow remaining. Coping interventions in the ranges considered (0–500,000 acre-feet/0–620 million m3 new storage; 0–60,000 acre-feet per year/0–70 million m3 per year new supplies) can serve to mitigate climate impacts and to fully or partially offset the impact of the in-stream flow policy. Regardless of the policy, coping interventions are needed to avoid critically low storage levels. Our analysis indicates that recharge may be an effective strategy to increase capture of Tuolumne River streamflow, with an expected yield of 0.15–0.51 units of flow captured per unit of recharge capacity added, compared to reservoir expansion, with an expected yield of 0.05–0.07 units of flow captured annually per unit of volume capacity added."

Here, we evaluate the contribution of EC to the short-term toxicity (including cytotoxicity and oxidative stress potency) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the human respiratory tract using in vitro airway  organoids and cell lines. The toxic potency of EC per unit mass, including char and soot, is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are coemitted from incomplete combustion. EC contributes approximately 1 order of magnitude less to PM2.5 toxicity than PAHs, despite its positive associations with PM2.5-induced toxic potency (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, PAHs contribute 71.9 ± 12.2% and 61.9 ± 32.8% of the overall toxic potency of PM2.5 emitted from typical incomplete burning of solid and liquid fuels, respectively, while the PM2.5 toxicity significantly correlates with PAHs content (r = 0.94, p = 0.002). Hence, EC is not a cause of inducing acute toxicity, likely attributed to coemitted PAHs. These findings provide causal evidence for understanding the respiratory health risks associated with exposure to PM2.5 and further benefit to establishing efficient air pollution control policies."

Recently, sustainable technologies have been pursued to enhance industrial efficiency and reduce environmental and resource impacts. However, current research lacks a comprehensive methodology and typical cases for constructing efficient resource-based industrial networks. Hence, this study employs a comprehensive approach to identify and construct efficient industrial networks from a holistic perspective. Using the Qinghai Saline Lake industrial zone as an example, this research elaborates on establishing and evaluating highly efficient regional industrial networks. It evaluates the eco-efficiency of 184 technologies based on resource development and constructs an efficient resource industry network for the development of the Qinghai Salt Lake using natural resources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and various types of ores as the initial stage and analyzes the characteristics of the industry network with different efficiencies. The research findings emphasize that solely scrutinizing technological efficiency and focusing on either the upstream raw processing network or the downstream deep-processing network while neglecting interactions within the industrial network can constrain the network’s overall efficiency and hinder synergy between resources and the environment throughout the entire network. The method applies to constructing, evaluating, and optimizing industrial zones with resource endowments."

This research combines long-term monitoring data, science-based assessment methods, and novel data analysis approaches (i.e., machine learning) toward understanding the geography, trajectories, and controls of water quality in the Chesapeake Bay, which provides an example for the assessment and management of complex coastal ecosystems. Results showed that the attainment of water quality standards has improved in both the deep zone and the shallow zone since 1985, but the shallow zone has improved more rapidly. In addition, the attainment trajectory has been affected by mainly external drivers (i.e., nutrient reductions) and, to a lesser extent, internal drivers (i.e., water temperature and stratification). Reductions in nutrient loads would improve attainment, whereas warming and stratification would decrease attainment. Furthermore, scenario analyses demonstrated the importance of managing both nitrogen and phosphorus loads.

It is estimated that around 40% of pharmaceuticals target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The in vitro transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) shedding assay was applied to measure the antagonistic activities of pharmaceuticals against human GPCRs. However, their ability to stimulate fish GPCRs remains unclear. Here, antagonistic activities of 30 pharmaceuticals against zebrafish dopamine (zD2a and zD2c), adrenergic family member (zβ1), and histamine (zH1 and zH3) receptors were measured by the TGFα shedding assay. The study found an interspecies difference in binding affinities between human and zebrafish: pharmaceuticals more strongly inhibited the zD2c and zH1 receptors than human D2 (hD2) and hH1 receptors, while zD2a and zβ1 receptors were less inhibited than hD2 and hβ1 receptors. The potential molecular explanations for the observed interspecies differences in binding affinity for hydroxyzine and bisoprolol were investigated using molecular docking. Pharmaceutical potency against zebrafish GPCRs and predicted effluent concentrations were used to predict equivalent quantities (EQs), and these EQs were used to prioritize pharmaceuticals of concern in wastewater in England and Japan.

The structures of ArsC and ArsM complexed with Trx were modeled using AlphaFold-Multimer. Site-directed mutagenesis of key cysteine residues at the interaction sites of the complexes indicated that the archaeal ArsC and ArsM employ evolutionarily distinct disulfide bonds for interacting with Trx compared to those used by bacterial ArsC or eukaryotic ArsM.

This was achieved using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) applied to a spiked gradient of Zn and Cd concentrations in an arable soil. We observed patchy-distributed Zn and Cd hotspots in all soils, including at a native concentration in the nonspiked soil. With increasing Zn and Cd spikes, these metals preferentially colocated with Fe-dominated mineral phases, whereas with the highest spike, Zn and Cd increasingly colocated with clay minerals and soil organic matter. Soil extracts suggested that large proportions of spiked Zn and Cd were tightly bound to the colocated phases. Our direct measurements of patchy-distributed Zn and Cd hotspots indicate that distinct soil surfaces preferentially allocate and govern the fate of trace metals in soils."

However, besides the well-recognized cockroach-induced allergy, the potential impact of the cockroach microbiome on human health through various means is not yet fully elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the health impacts of cockroaches by investigating the microbial interactions among cockroaches, the indoor environment, and humans. We simultaneously collected cockroach, indoor environment (indoor air and floor dust), and human (exhaled breath condensate and skin) samples from residential areas in five cities representing distinct climate zones in China. The 16S rDNA sequencing results revealed that cockroaches harbor diverse bacterial populations that vary across different cities. The prevalence of potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB) in cockroaches ranged from 1.1% to 58.9%, with dominant resistance genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, macrolide, and beta-lactam. The relationships between the cockroach microbiome and the associated environmental and human microbiomes were explored by using fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST). The potential contribution of cockroach bacteria to the floor dust-borne microbiome and indoor airborne microbiome was estimated to be 5.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Similarly, the potential contribution of cockroach PPB to the floor dust-borne microbiome and indoor airborne microbiome was calculated to be 4.0% and 1.2%, respectively. In residences with cockroach infestations, the contribution of other sources to the indoor environment was slightly increased. Collectively, the role of cockroaches in the transmission of microorganisms, particularly pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes, cannot be overlooked."

This prospective cohort study sought to investigate how coexposure to bisphenols, parabens, triclosan (TCS), benzophenone-type UV filters, and neonicotinoids (NEOs) affects the odds of GDM. Quantile-based g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression showed a significant inverse relationship between EDC mixtures and the reduced risk of GDM (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13–0.87), which was mainly explained by bisphenol (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29–0.80) and paraben (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40–0.91) exposure.

Among the elderly, depression is particularly prevalent and is often linked to social isolation. However, the specific role of EE in social isolation-related geriatric depression remains imprecise. This study was intended to explore the status of EE exposure in geriatric depression and to uncover its underlying mechanisms. We utilized 19-month-old male C57BL/6J mice, which are equivalent to humans aged 50–60 years, and induced depression through social isolation. After 2 weeks of social isolation, mice were identified as depressive by using the sugar preference test and then classified into either standard or enrichment environment groups for 4 weeks. Subsequently, conventional indices associated with depression, including neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors, and neuroinflammation, were measured. Results display that EE alleviated the depressive-like symptoms in elderly mice and enriched their social activities. Concurrently, EE regulated levels of certain neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, including the systems of glutamate, tyrosine, and histamine. Moreover, the ability of neurogenesis also increased in the hippocampus of EE mice. At the neuroinflammation level, the activation of Natural Killer (NK) cells and ARG1+ microglia is considered a major contributor to mediating the effects of EE-regulated geriatric depression. Collectively, these results underline the importance of EE in the treatment of geriatric depression and partially elucidate its underlying mechanism, offering valuable suggestions for treating social isolation--related depression via environmental modulation."

Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in  human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under Aβ exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under Aβ exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The Aβ induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that Aβ exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered  detoxification by the lysosome.

However, the precise mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Here, the mechanism by which Mn induces dysfunction of autophagy–lysosomal pathway-mediated tauopathy by activating the cGAS–STING pathway was explored both in vitro and in vivo. Mn exposure induced tauopathy in microglia and in mice while activating the cGAS–STING pathway, inducing type I interferon production, and impairing the degradation function of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Importantly, inactivation of the cGAS–STING pathway rescued the degradation activity of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway, while tauopathy was markedly attenuated, as shown in both cGAS-knockout and STING-knockout BV2 microglia and in mice. Moreover, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) restored the impaired degradation activity of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway by inactivating the cGAS–STING pathway, thereby clearing Tau aggregation. Taken together, these results indicate that Mn exposure induces tauopathy by impairing the function of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway through the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway. Thus, this study identifies a novel mechanism by which Mn exposure induces Tau aggregation, which in turn triggers potential neurotoxicity, providing a foundation for future drug target research."

This study conducted a microcosm experiment using surface lake water exposed to sunlight to investigate the natural attenuation processes of MC-LR and CYN. Results indicated that photodegradation plays a crucial role in the natural attenuation of cyanotoxins. The half-lives of MC-LR and CYN were 1 and 7 days in summer under a combined effect of direct and indirect photodegradation, respectively. The effectiveness of these natural processes varied seasonally, with faster dissipation rates observed during summer. Bacterial degradation notably affected only MC-LR in summer, with a negligible effect on CYN. The identified transformation products showed that the conversion of MC-LR involved oxidation, hydroxylation, and/or bond cleavage with Adda and Mdha moieties, while it entails the oxidation of the tricyclic guanidine moiety and opening of the uracil ring for CYN. The Ames assay confirmed that these transformation products from the natural attenuation of MC-LR and CYN did not induce genotoxicity or mutagenicity. While these findings enhance our understanding of natural attenuation mechanisms, they also offer valuable insights that could guide artificial control strategies or improve the efficiency of cyanotoxin management.

This study investigated the long-term effects of continuous cattle grazing, stocking rates, and fertilization regimens on methane (CH4) emissions, soil microbial communities, and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Bermudagrass pastures in East Texas, USA. Pastures were subjected to high or low stocking rates for over 50 years, with further subdivision based on fertilization: nitrogen-based fertilizer application or no fertilizer but with the growth of annual clover. Seasonal soil cores (0–60 cm) were collected, and laboratory microcosm incubation studies revealed unexpectedly high in vitro CH4 emissions in surface soils, particularly in the top 0–5 cm soil layer, reaching up to 300 nmol of CH4 mL–1. Higher CH4 emissions and methanogen abundance, along with lower SOC stocks, were observed in pastures subjected to high stocking rates compared to those with low stocking rates and in clover pastures compared to those with N-fertilized ryegrass. On the contrary, in low-stocked, N-fertilized annual ryegrass pastures, methanogen abundance was lowest, CH4 emissions were negligible, and SOC stocks were highest. Furthermore, animal excreta deposition significantly contributed to increased CH4 emissions.

BHPF exhibits antiestrogenic effects and potential reproductive toxicity. Similar to BPA, BHPF can closely access the active site of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme, interact with the Fe═O moiety, and potentially initiate metabolic reactions. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the mechanisms underlying BHPF activation using a CYP450 compound I (Cpd I) model, identifying several plausible products. Compared with the higher energy barriers associated with phenyl ring addition reactions, the formation of a phenoxyl-type radical through phenolic hydrogen atom abstraction, followed by OH rebound or radical coupling, represents an energetically favorable pathway. The OH rebound process yields three primary products: 9-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene (PRD1), semiquinone radical anion (PRD2), and 9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene carbocation (PRD3), constituting the major outcomes of the BHPF metabolic reaction. Importantly, a lipophilic ether metabolite, BHPF-O-BHPF (PRD4), formed through the coupling of phenoxyl radicals, reflects a widespread metabolic pathway observed in phenolic molecules. Despite constituting a minor proportion, the toxicity of this product necessitates increased attention. These findings contribute significantly to an enhanced understanding of the potential hazards associated with BHPF and other unknown chemical entities."

Copper (Cu) overexposure has been found to be linked to many diseases during aging, particularly neurodegenerative diseases. Meanwhile, as an essential element, Cu has been implicated in key processes associated with aging, raising questions about its role in age-related health issues. This study delves into the mechanisms behind the copper imbalance during aging. By analyzing blood copper concentrations of healthy individuals (including data from healthy subjects (26 ≤ age ≤ 90, n = 62) and publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (18 ≤ age < 80, n = 1624)) and employing C57BL/6N male mice models (n = 22), we reveal a consistent age-related increase in copper levels, particularly in plasma. Utilizing stable copper isotopic analysis, copper-associated protein analysis, and metabolomic analysis, we trace the sources of Cu imbalance associated with aging. Our findings reveal that aged mice had a higher copper concentrations and an enrichment of light copper isotope (63Cu) in plasma compared to controls. Additionally, copper reductases and copper transporters are upregulated in the intestine tract, associated with the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways. We suggest that aged mice have an abnormally high copper intake requirement, probably due to deregulated nutrient sensing, leading to increased expression levels of copper reductases and copper transporters for extra copper absorption in the intestines. This research provides a copper-centric perspective on the connection between deregulated nutrient sensing and aging, thus shedding light on the aspect of aging and copper overexposure."

It primarily manifests in the form of pulmonary nodules, but not all will develop into lung cancer. Therefore, it is highly desired to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules for the early prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Currently, histopathological examination is the gold standard for classifying pulmonary nodules, which is invasive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. This study proposes a metallomics approach through synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) with a simplified one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) to distinguish pulmonary nodules by using serum samples. SRXRF spectra of serum samples were obtained and preliminarily analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, machine learning algorithms (MLs) and 1DCNN were applied to develop classification models. Both MLs and 1DCNN based on full-channel spectra could distinguish patients with benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, but the highest accuracy rate of 96.7% was achieved when using 1DCNN. In addition, it was found that characteristic elements in serum from patients with malignant nodules were different from those in benign nodules, which can serve as the fingerprint metallome profile. The simplified model based on characteristic elements resulted in good performance of sensitivity and F1-score > 91.30%, G-mean, MCC and Kappa > 85.59%, and accuracy = 94.34%. In summary, metallomic classification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using serum samples can be achieved through 1DCNN-boosted SRXRF, which is easy to handle and much less invasive compared to histopathological examination."

First, I calculate a suite of synthetic seamount models to show the expected VGG anomaly characteristic wavelength and amplitude for a simplified magmatic system, hydrothermal system, and a caldera infill, varying their dimensions for a given depth and density contrast. I find that most magmatic and hydrothermal systems create VGG anomalies with a characteristic wavelength and amplitude greater than the data uncertainty and are therefore detectable. The proposed approach consists in three main steps: (a) calculate the VGG from the two components of the deflection of the vertical, (b) calculate and remove the gravity contribution of the bathymetry interface using an independent bathymetry data set (e.g., acquired by multibeam echosounders) to obtain a VGG Bouguer gravity anomaly, (c) invert the Bouguer VGG anomaly to obtain a 3D density model.

Based on a meta‐analysis of 106 previously published laboratory measurements of hyporheic exchange (capturing a range of bed morphologies, hydraulic conditions, streambed properties, and experimental approaches) we find that the reference diffusivity and mixing length‐scale are functions of the permeability Reynolds Number and Schmidt Number. These dimensionless numbers, in turn, can be estimated for a particular stream from the median grain size of the streambed and the stream's depth, slope, and temperature. Application of these results to a seminal study of nitrate removal in 72 headwater streams across the United States, reveals: (a) streams draining urban and agricultural landscapes have a diminished capacity for in‐stream and in‐bed mixing along with smaller subsurface storage zones compared to streams draining reference landscapes; (b) under steady‐state conditions nitrate uptake in the streambed is primarily biologically controlled; and (c) median reaction timescales for nitrate removal in the hyporheic zone are ≈ ${\approx} $0.5 and 20 hr for uptake by assimilation and denitrification, respectively.

Paleomagnetic measurements of meteorites indicate that magnetic fields existed in the inner solar nebula capable of driving accretion at rates similar to those observed for young stellar objects with protoplanetary disks. However, the field strength in the solar system beyond ∼7 astronomical units (AU) and its role in accretion remain poorly constrained. Returned samples from asteroid (162173) Ryugu offer the possibility of determining the nebular field intensity in this distal region. Here, we report paleomagnetic studies of three Ryugu particles which reveal that alteration occurred in the presence of a null or relatively weak (<15.8 μT) field within 3 million years (Ma) after solar system formation. This resolves previously contrasting reports that Ryugu's parent body experienced alteration in the presence of a strong (>80 μT) magnetic field and weak or null field (<3 μT). In addition, we re‐examine previous paleomagnetic and Mn‐Cr chronometry studies of three other distally‐sourced meteorites, Tagish Lake, Tarda, and Wisconsin Range 91600, which measured paleointensities of <0.9, <1.7 and 5.1 ± 4.5 μT respectively. While it was previously unclear whether these records were acquired while the nebula was present, our re‐analysis suggests that their records are sufficiently old (i.e., <3.5 Ma after solar system formation) to be nebular in origin. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the distal solar system nebular field, while faint, was likely still strong enough to drive accretion at rates like those observed in the inner solar system."

The possible accumulation of basalt in the mantle transition zone has been examined, but details of the mantle composition below the 660‐km discontinuity (hereafter d660) remain poorly constrained. In this study, we utilize the subtle waveform details of S660S, the underside shear‐wave reflection off the d660, to interpret the seismic velocity, density, and compositional structure near, and particularly below, the d660. We identify a significant difference in S660S waveform shape in subduction zones compared to other regions. The inversion results reveal globally enriched basalt at the d660, with a notably higher content in subduction zones, consistent with the smaller impedance jump and S660S peak amplitude. The basalt fraction decreases significantly to less than 10% near 800‐km depth, forming a global harzburgite‐enriched layer and resulting in a steep seismic velocity gradient just below the d660, in agreement with 1D global reference models. The striking compositional radial variations near the d660 verify geodynamic predictions and challenge the applicability of homogeneous radial compositional models in the mantle. These variations may also affect the viscosity profile and, consequently, the dynamics at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle."

While precise CO2 source distribution estimates are limited by the resolution of model parameterizations, our model suggests that stream corridor CO2 production dominates over groundwater inputs at the continental scale.

 As freshwater ecosystems are threatened globally, the conservation of aquatic plant diversity is becoming a priority. In the last decade, remote sensing has opened up new opportunities to measure biodiversity, especially across terrestrial biomes, and the combination of spectral features with additional information derived from community phylogeny can further advance the accurate characterisation of plant functional diversity across scales. In this study, we explored the use of spectral features extracted from centimetre resolution hyperspectral imagery collected by a drone and phylogenetic metrics derived from a fully resolved supertree to estimate functional diversity (richness, divergence, and evenness) using non-linear parametric and machine learning models within communities of floating hydrophytes and helophytes sampled from different sites. Our results show that all three functional diversity metrics can be estimated from spectral features using machine learning models (random forest; R2 = 0.90–0.92), while parametric models perform worse (generalised additive models; R2 = 0.40–0.79), especially for community evenness.

 Ability of remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to serve as a vegetation productivity and stress indicator is impaired by confounding factors, such as varying crop-specific canopy structure, changing solar illumination angles, and SIF-soil optical interactions. This study investigates two normalisation approaches correcting diurnal top-of-canopy SIF observations retrieved from the O2-A absorption feature at 760 nm (F760 hereafter) of summer barley crops for these confounding effects. Nadir SIF data was acquired over nine breeding experimental plots simultaneously by an airborne imaging spectrometer (HyPlant) and a drone-based high-performance point spectrometer (AirSIF). Ancillary measurements, including leaf pigment contents retrieved from drone hyperspectral imagery, destructively sampled leaf area index (LAI), and leaf water and dry matter contents, were used to test the two normalisation methods that are based on: i) the fluorescence correction vegetation index (FCVI), and ii) three versions of the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV). Modelling in the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model revealed close matches for NIRv-based approaches when corrected canopy SIF was compared to simulated total chlorophyll fluorescence emitted by leaves (R2 = 0.99). Normalisation with the FCVI also performed acceptably (R2 = 0.93), however, it was sensitive to variations in LAI when compared to leaf emitted chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency. Based on the results modelled in DART, the NIRvH1 normalisation was found to have a superior performance over the other NIRv variations and the FCVI normalisation. Comparison of the SIF escape fractions suggests that the escape fraction estimated with NIRvH1 matched escape fraction extracted from DART more closely. When applied to the experimental drone and airborne nadir canopy SIF data, the agreement between NIRvH1 and FCVI produced chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency was very high (R2 = 0.93). Nevertheless, NIRvH1 showed higher uncertainties for areas with low vegetation cover indicating an unaccounted contribution of SIF-soil interactions. The diurnal courses of chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency for both approaches differed not significantly from simple normalisation by incoming and apparent photosynthetically active radiation. In conclusion, SIF normalisation with NIRvH1 more accurately compensates the effects of canopy structure on top of canopy far red SIF, but when applied to top of canopy in-situ data of spring barley, the effects of NIRvH1 and FCVI on the diurnal course of SIF had a similar influence."

 Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is widely used in studies of Earth surface change and has potential to inform targeted landscape remediation over large areas. Leveraging this capability requires geomorphic change detection methods that exploit the full 3D information contained in ALS point clouds but remains challenging over large areas (i.e., > 10 km2). We developed a methodology for geomorphic change detection over large areas using multitemporal ALS in a multiscale model-to-model cloud comparison (M3C2) framework adapted for volumetric estimation. Time series Sentinel-2 optical observations were used to isolate persistently-bare areas as candidate sites to co-register the ALS point clouds. Geomorphic stability of those sites was determined from coherence change detection using time series Sentinel-1 InSAR, thereby ensuring only geomorphically-stable sites were used for co-registration. Results showed the Sentinel-based co-registration produced a closer vertical alignment (0.00 ± 0.09 m) between ALS point clouds over stable parts of the landscape, while co-registration using an iterative closest-point algorithm contained bias (0.07 ± 0.10 m). The methodology was used to estimate annual sediment yield for a semi-arid catchment in northeastern Australia and results were compared with long-term field-based stream sediment monitoring. The ALS-based geomorphic change detection estimated 2.58 ± 0.54 t·ha−1·a−1 sediment yield and stream sediment monitoring estimated 1.40 t·ha−1·a−1. These similar estimates indicate multitemporal ALS can produce realistic whole-of-catchment sediment yield estimates in ungauged catchments (i.e., with no stream sediment monitoring) and improves the spatial detail of those estimates. Accurately detecting geomorphic change from multitemporal ALS also required a strategy to manage vegetation-related error due to misclassification of ALS point clouds. Combined identification of fine-scale erosion processes and reliable estimation of catchment-scale erosion rates indicates the proposed methodology provides a valuable tool for planning landscape remediation over large areas."

 LiDAR is a developed technology that has been widely used to measure the Earth's surface by acquiring accurate three-dimensional (3D) information. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) model developed a new LiDAR modeling method based on the Monte Carlo bidirectional path tracing mode named DART-Lux. Using the DART-RC (Ray Carlo) mode as a reference, DART-Lux shows consistency and efficiency for LiDAR signal modeling. This paper presents a further validation of DART-Lux LiDAR model for simulating actual LiDAR waveform and photon-counting measurements by considering two in-orbit spaceborne LiDAR systems: GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) and ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2). The validation experiments are conducted on accurate 3D descriptions of an urban landscape in Toulouse, France, and a natural forest landscape in Saihanba, China. The pulse-by-pulse comparisons of GEDI and simulated waveforms yield mean R2 = 0.893, mean RMSE = 0.077.

 SummaryManagement of forest genetics is shifting from a paradigm focused on increasing timber volume to a prioritization of climate adaptation. Functional traits related to foliar structure, photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments, and stress underlie climate adaptation and have spectral signatures that can be quantified with remote sensing. Common-garden trials present an opportunity to assess the genetic basis of multispectral reflectance dynamics across genotypes. We analyzed multitemporal drone remote sensing of 1350 individual trees from 88 populations from diverse geographic and climatic provenances in a provenance trial of interior spruce (Picea engelmannii, P. glauca, and their hybrids) to assess patterns of genetic differentiation, local adaptation to climate, and hybridization from multispectral reflectance. We quantified early-summer, mid-summer, late-summer, and late-winter multispectral vegetation indices for each population and derived variables describing changes in these indices during winter-to-summer photosynthetic green-up and early-to-late-summer decline. Spectral traits revealed moderate population differentiation (Vpop = 14.4 % — 39.9 %) and significant (P < .005) patterns of local adaptation to provenance warmest-month temperature and elevation. Derived green-up and decline indices revealed additional relationships for coldest-month temperature, date of first frost, precipitation-as-snow, and climatic moisture deficit. Principal components described leaf area greenness, the magnitude of green-up, and seasonal decline in the red edge. Hierarchical clustering of these principal components identified eight geographically and climatically distinct clusters which captured major patterns in hybridization. Seasonal dynamics of vegetation indices, assessed with multitemporal drone remote sensing, can identify important patterns in hybridization and adaptation to climate which are not evident from spectral reflectance assessed at one time of year. These dynamic spectral traits have the potential to quantify the functional basis of local adaptation in common-garden trials and facilitate the selection of resilient genotypes for future climates."

 Litter on the forest floor, or from a fire perspective the litter fuel load (LFL), is a key driver of the occurrence and spread of surface fires and an important regulator of forest fire behavior. High-quality spatiotemporal LFL data are essential for modeling fire behavior and assessing fire risk in forest ecosystems. Traditionally, LFL is estimated from ground-based measurements, but they are difficult to implement on large spatial scales. While remote sensing techniques have the advantage of large-scale observation, they encounter challenges in retrieving LFL because forest canopies generally block signals from the forest floor. Here we present a new method based on modeled litter accumulation to estimate LFL dynamics, integrating litterfall influx from the forest canopy and decomposition outflux through a mass balance approach. Annual litterfall was estimated based on seasonal changes in foliage fuel load which are retrieved from Landsat imagery and a radiative transfer model, while the decomposition rate was derived from meteorological data. Litterfall and decomposition were quantified over the past 20 years with the difference between the two being LFL accumulating over time. We validated the estimated LFL using 105 ground-based measurements in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, China, and this validation demonstrated a reasonably strong performance for estimating LFL (R2 = 0.67, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.56 Mg ha−1, relative RMSE = 31.61 %). Our method integrates remote sensing-based foliage phenology with the ecological process of LFL accumulation, enabling large-scale LFL monitoring for forest fire risk assessments."

 Irrigation is a critical component of global water usage, accounting for approximately 70 % of water consumption. As the world’s population continues to grow, the demand for food will increase, making it essential to improve irrigation management by reducing water waste and increasing efficiency. This study aims to develop and validate a fuzzy decision-making system that determines crop irrigation needs based on parameters that affect plant water requirements. These parameters can be monitored using Remote sensing (RS) satellites, enabling large-scale agricultural irrigation monitoring. The study utilized Landsat-8 satellite data and meteorological data. It also employed a fuzzy decision system with inputs of estimated evapotranspiration, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Stress Index (SI), and Soil Moisture (SM). The output of the fuzzy model is a map that effectively determines the irrigation requirements for agricultural land relatively. The system was tested on six Landsat images of winter wheat crops in Tehran University’s agricultural fields. The estimated evapotranspiration was compared to Reference Evapotranspiration (ETr) obtained from the FAO-Penman-Monteith equation, resulting in a root mean square error of 0.33 mm. The fuzzy decision system was evaluated by comparing its results with Vegetation Water Content (VWC) measurements during satellite overpass time. The NDVI, CWSI, SI, and SM variables had the highest R2 with VWC data (0.71––0.92) on all six dates. This approach has significant implications for improving irrigation management practices, reducing water waste, and increasing crop yields, which can contribute to global food security.

 The heterogeneity and complexity of multimodal data in high-resolution remote sensing images significantly challenges existing cross-modal networks in fusing the complementary information of high-resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for precise semantic segmentation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) dominated gate fusion network (MGFNet). MGFNet consists of three modules: a multi-path feature extraction network, an MLP-gate fusion (MGF) module, and a decoder. Initially, MGFNet independently extracts features from high-resolution optical and SAR images while preserving spatial information. Then, the well-designed MGF module combines the multi-modal features through channel attention and gated fusion stages, utilizing MLP as a gate to exploit complementary information and filter redundant data. Additionally, we introduce a novel high-resolution multimodal remote sensing dataset, YESeg-OPT-SAR, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m.

 Hyperspectral unmixing is of vital importance within the realm of hyperspectral analysis, which is aimed to decide the fractional proportion (abundances) of fundamental spectral signatures (endmembers) at a subpixel level. Unsupervised unmixing techniques that employ autoencoder (AE) network have gained significant attention for its exceptional feature extraction capabilities. However, traditional AE-based methods lean towards focusing excessively on the information of spectral dimension in the data, resulting in limited ability to extract endmembers with meaningful physical interpretations, and achieve uncompetitive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain dual-stream network, called MdsNet, which enhances performance by incorporating high-rank spatial information to guide the unmixing process. This approach allows us to uncover pure endmember data that is hidden within the original hyperspectral image (HSI). We first apply superpixel segmentation and smoothing operations as preprocessing steps to transform the HSI into a coarse domain. Then, MdsNet efficiently handles multi-domain data and employs attention generated from the approximate domain to learn meaningful information about the endmembers’ physical characteristic. Experimental results and ablation studies conducted on Synthetic and real datasets (Samson, Japser, Urban) outperform state-of-the-art techniques by more than 10% in terms of root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, illustrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

Therefore, this study explores land use and CS changes in the Tulufan-Hami Basin from 2000 to 2050. The SD-FLUS and InVEST models were employed to simulate land use patterns and assess CS under three scenarios (SSP126-EP, SSP245-ND and SSP585-ED).

CS initially rose by 0.74 × 106t from 2000 to 2010 but then declined by 1.37 × 106t from 2010 to 2020. Construction expansion and grassland degradation drove the decline. By 2050, the SSP126-EP scenario predicts an increase in CS of 3.64 × 106t compared to 2020.

 Invasive alien plant species (IPS) are one of the major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. As the dynamics of biological invasions by non-native plant species are expected to intensify with climate change, there is an increasing need to provide accessible information on the distribution of IPS to improve environmental management programmes. Monitoring the probability of occurrence of IPS is therefore essential to limit their spread, as control measures are most effective in the early stages of invasion. This article presents IPS Monitor, a tool developed to monitor habitat suitability for IPS in Germany under current and projected climate conditions. Developed from previous research on IPS impacts and habitat modelling, the tool facilitates the visualisation of habitat suitability for 45 IPS through digital web maps and fact sheets.

 Nitrogen is one of the most important macronutrients for plant growth and timely estimation of canopy nitrogen content (CNC) is crucial for agricultural applications. Remote sensing has emerged as an important tool to quantify CNC using either empirically or physically based methods. Most empirical methods use chlorophyll related spectral indices and are dependent on the relationship between nitrogen and chlorophyll, which varies with vegetation types and growth stages. In contrast, physically based methods use the full-range reflectance data and retrieve CNC from coupled leaf and canopy radiative transfer models (such as PROSPECT-PRO + 4SAIL, PROSAIL-PRO). However, the subtle absorption features of nitrogen and protein in fresh leaves hinder the accurate estimation of CNC. Therefore, this study proposed an efficient and mechanistic framework to estimate CNC (PROSAIL-NAM) by coupling PROSAIL-PRO with a nitrogen allocation model, which divided the total nitrogen into non-photosynthetic nitrogen (NPN) and photosynthetic nitrogen (PN). At the canopy level, PN and NPN are assumed to be proportional to canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and canopy dry matter content (CDM), respectively. The PROSAIL-PRO model was first used to estimate CCC and CDM, and then the resulting CCC and CDM were fed to the nitrogen allocation model to estimate CNC. The estimation accuracy of CNC was assessed with six diverse datasets: four from field crop experiments across geographic sites, one from multiple ecosystems, and one from a satellite-ground joint experiment. Our results showed that satisfactory estimations of CNC were obtained when CCC and CDM were estimated using a model inversion method (RMSE = 0.54–1.56 g/m2) and a hybrid retrieval method (RMSE = 0.49–2.25 g/m2). The model inversion method was comparable with the hybrid retrieval method for ground platforms, but performed better for airborne and satellite platforms. In addition, the traditional protein-nitrogen conversion model obtained CNC from the canopy protein content and led to clear overestimations of CNC with RMSE > 1.95 g/m2. This study represents a first attempt to develop a robust approach by coupling PROSAIL-PRO with a nitrogen allocation model for accurate estimation of CNC across geographic sites, ecosystems, and platforms. These finding will advance the monitoring of CNC from regional to global scales."

 Due to policies such as groundwater extraction restrictions, water diversion, and water replenishment, groundwater levels in the Beijing Plain have generally risen. This has effectively alleviated ground subsidence, with some regions even experiencing uplift. Under these new water conditions, strata deformation also shows spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and the overlap of these multiple deformation patterns hinders the interpretation of ground deformation. In this study, we employed Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneous deformation patterns and their influencing factors in the Beijing Plain. We utilized Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to effectively separate overlapping ground deformation patterns from InSAR-derived ground surface deformation. Four ground deformation patterns—approximately linear subsidence, approximately linear uplift, decelerating subsidence, and periodic deformation—were extracted. Their overlapping status and influencing factors were explored based on external hydrogeological data. Approximately linear subsidence represents the continuous compression of deep strata in areas with severe subsidence. Approximately linear uplift represents the rebound of shallow strata caused by water replenishment. Periodic deformation represents the ground’s response to precipitation and irrigation pumping. The ICA results benefit the estimation of the time lag between groundwater rise and strata rebound in the Beijing Plain, as well as the estimation of the increase in groundwater storage capacity in the Miyun-Huairou-Shunyi region. This study provides a new perspective for extracting deformation information from InSAR observations, gaining a deeper understanding of deformation patterns related to hydrogeological phenomena, and assessing the effectiveness of groundwater management and land subsidence control policies."

 Accurate geolocation using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is essential for safe and long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flights. However, GNSS systems are susceptible to blockages, jamming, and spoofing attacks. Localization using onboard cameras and satellite images provides a promising solution for UAVs operating in GNSS-denied environments. In this paper, we developed a novel UAV visual localization system for GNSS-denied situations, both day and night, that integrates image matching, visual odometry (VO), and terrain-weighted constraint optimization. First, an effective map management strategy is designed for satellite image chunking, real-time scheduling, and merging. Then, a 2D–3D geo-registration method, combining Bidirectional Homologous Points Search, is introduced to obtain accurate 3D virtual control points for UAV absolute localization. Lastly, a position estimation and optimization method, integrating the sliding window with terrain weighting constraints, is proposed to control position error accumulation and reduce position drift. Twenty experiments were conducted in typical and complex scenarios to validate our system’s resilience to altitude changes, trajectory variations, and rolling terrain. Our system demonstrated drift-free and viewpoint-robust, maintaining stability even in feature-poor environments and seasonal variations. It does not require loop closure, allowing for re-localization after positioning failures. Additionally, we utilized thermal infrared images to demonstrate the system’s performance in night-time conditions. With a Mean Absolute Error of less than 7 m, it can be a powerful complement to GNSS in the event of GNSS-Denied environments.

 Interpreting surface geological elements (such as rocks, minerals, soils, and water bodies) is the main task of geological survey, which plays a crucial role in geological environment remote sensing (GERS). However, the characteristics of geological elements, including high variabilities, various morphology, complicated boundaries and imbalanced class distribution, make it still a challenge for deep learning methods to interpret GERS images. Considering the correlations of geological elements as the regionalized variables in geostatistics, the sensitive features of GERS interpretation mainly include three aspects: tonal, textural and structural characteristics within a singular-class elements, spatial and spectral correlations of adjacent elements, and their global tectonic or spatial distribution. Thus, to simulate the manual interpretation process of geologists from local to global and promote GERS interpretation performance, we propose a local-to-global multi-scale feature fusion network (LGMSFNet). A geological object context represents the intra-class semantic dependencies of pixel sets with the same class. And a local feature aggregation module models the channel and spatial association. Then discriminative features are integrated by a global feature fusion module. For the model optimization, we focus on hard examples during the training process to achieve the balanced optimization of various categories.

 Snow cover significantly influences the Earth’s climate system and global hydrological cycle through its thermal insulation properties and high albedo, and is an important component of the cryosphere. Currently, the most efficient means of quantifying snow depth at both global and regional scales is through passive microwave remote sensing. However, the accuracy of passive microwave remote sensing inversion of snow depth in forested areas is affected by the forest canopy. In this study, a normalized maximum stem volume (NMSV) index was constructed by combining canopy height and tree cover data obtained through remote sensing techniques. The NMSV index was then incorporated into development of snow depth retrieval algorithm to improve accuracy of passive microwave snow depth estimation in forested areas. Compared to the Chang algorithm and the AMSR-E snow depth product, this study demonstrated higher accuracy in the mid- to high-latitude forested areas of Eurasia, with an R value approximately twice as high and a reduction in the overall root mean square error (RMSE) by 2.3 cm and 7.2 cm, respectively. The relative mean bias of this study in the Western Russia, the Eastern Siberian Mountains and the Northeast China is significantly reduced than that of the existing remote sensing algorithms. Against the ERA5 and GlobSnow datasets, with the exception of the Western Russia, the performance of this study in the mid- to high-latitude forested areas of Eurasia is comparable to the ERA5 dataset and superior to the other datasets. Based on the performance of the algorithms in different NMSV values, we observe a decline in the accuracy of this algorithm when the value exceeds 0.8, which was caused by small size of high NMSV values among the ground observation sites involved in the development of snow depth retrieval algorithm. Overall, the NMSV index proposed in this study, which integrates information from both the horizontal and vertical structures of forest, can better characterize the microwave radiation properties of sparse and moderately dense forests, facilitating improvements in the accuracy of passive microwave snow depth retrieval in global forested areas."

 Ocean colour (OC) remote sensing benefits society by providing continuous biological and ecological parameters relevant to sustainable marine resource exploitation. It enhances our understanding of climate change and allows us to monitor oceanographic phenomena over various scales of variability. However, significant data gaps occur daily due to cloud cover, atmospheric correction failures, sun-glint contamination, and satellite coverage limitations. Level 4 (L4) gap-free images are generally created by averaging over specific periods (e.g., weekly, monthly, seasonal) or re-gridding data with coarser resolution to overcome these limitations. These approaches, however, often fail to capture anomalous events or fine-scale resolution processes, calling for more advanced methods. The Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) method has proved effective in reconstructing missing OC data and capturing smaller-scale features in noisy fields. To the best of authors knowledge, DINEOF is here used for the first time to interpolate multispectral Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs) to produce a consistent and gap-free L4 Rrs dataset, minimizing errors in inferred ocean products, such as Chlorophyll-a (Chl), the most widely used proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Specifically, using a multivariate approach, we assessed the DINEOF technique’s capability to reconstruct Rrs, focusing on six bands (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, and 670 nm) and validating the results using extensive in situ datasets. Our outcomes show that this “upstream interpolation” method can generate a consistent Rrs dataset, thereby improving the accuracy of L4 Chl predictions when used as input in algorithms for remote Chl estimation. We anticipate further improvements in L4 Rrs accuracy using richer spectral information from upcoming hyperspectral satellite missions. This study highlights the effectiveness of using Rrs as a standalone dataset for DINEOF interpolation. Operationally, it can derivate various gap-free and consistent biogeochemical parameters with reduced uncertainty, thus providing a more reliable and versatile method."

Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions.

Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions.

 The localization of non-residential buildings over wide geographical areas is used as input within several contexts such as disaster management, regional and national planning, policy making and evaluation, among others. While the built-up environment has been continuously and globally mapped, given the efforts on producing synoptic land cover information; little attention has been given to the land use component of such built-up. This is due to, for example, difficulties in distinguishing built-up land use in non-commercial satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, with spatial resolution of up to 10 m), difficulties in collecting training data for supervised classification approaches, and the fact that variations in features of the built-up environment not always translate to a specific land use. This is even more critical when considering nadir viewing satellite or aerial imagery. However, map producers have been addressing this issue. For example, the Copernicus program (European Commission), through their pan-European CORINE Land Cover (CLC), and Urban Atlas restricted to several European metropolitan areas, have been making available land use information of the built-up cover, with 6-year intervals. The Global Human Settlement Layer (Copernicus program) has been providing built-up land use information by distinguishing residential from non-residential built-up since 2023 (GHSL_NRES). Currently these are also provided with a time interval of 5 years. National map producers often provide this information but usually with an interval between editions of several years. In this paper we combine readily available population counts and land cover maps to generate non-residential training labels that can be used to train a Sentinel-2 image segmentation model capable of distinguishing non-residential built-up from the remaining built-up. Leveraging two publicly available datasets, population counts (WorldPop) and built-up land cover (ESA WorldCover), allowed to produce training data from which an image segmentation model was able to learn relevant features to distinguish non-residential areas from other built-up in Sentinel-2 images.

 Here, a methodology to generate national-scale annual 10 m spatial resolution land use and land cover maps for Fiji (Fiji LULC) is presented. A training dataset of 13,419 points with a LULC label across three years from 2019 to 2021 was generated alongside a nationally representative test dataset of 834 points. These data were used to train a random forests model to convert an image stack of pre-processed Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data and topographic spatial layers into an annual categorical LULC map. When evaluated against the test dataset, the model has an overall accuracy of 83 % (SE: 2.1 %).The Fiji LULC map was compared to three global 10 m spatial resolution land cover products: Google’s Dynamic World, ESRI LULC, and ESA’s WorldCover v200. These maps were compared statistically using the independent test dataset and in several case study applications (e.g. agricultural monitoring and disaster impacts mapping). The Fiji LULC had a higher overall accuracy than the three global LULC products and aligned more closely with a high-quality field survey of over 2500 rice fields (i.e. Fiji LULC classified 88 % of the rice fields as agricultural compared to 60.6–15.7 % in the global LULC products). A comparison of the overlap between the agricultural class of the four LULC maps with a flood mask following Tropical Cyclone Yasa indicated that dataset choice has a substantial impact on estimates of the area of flooded croplands. The Fiji LULC map tends to capture agricultural land covers and smaller scale landscape features with more accuracy than the global products. This analysis illustrates the importance of assessing the performance of global LULC products in particular locations and for specific applications. As demonstrated here, the choice of LULC product could impact subsequent analysis and monitoring tasks. To support these LULC product comparisons, an open-source Python package for computing performance metrics for LULC maps when reference data have different strata to map classes has been published. Further, the training data, test data, and national-scale maps for Fiji have been produced for 2019 to 2022 and are available as open source products on the Pacific Data Hub."

 In remote sensing mapping studies, selecting an appropriate test set to accurately evaluate the results is critical. An imprecise accuracy assessment can be misleading and fail to validate the applicability of mapping products. Commencing with the WHU-Hi-HanChuan dataset, this paper revealed the impact of sample size ratios in test sets on accuracy metrics by generating a series of test sets with varying ratios of positive and negative sample size to evaluate the same map. A rigorous approach for accuracy assessment was suggested, and an example of tea plantations mapping is used to demonstrate the process and analyse potential issues in traditional approaches. A scale factor (λ) was constructed to measure the discrepancy in sample size ratios between test sets and actual conditions. Accuracy adjustment formulas were developed and applied to adjust the accuracy of 42 previous maps based on the λ. Results showed a higher ratio of positive to negative sample size in test set led to inflated user’s accuracy (UA), F1-score (F1) and overall accuracy (OA), but had little impact on producer’s accuracy. When the ratio aligned with that in the target area, the UA, F1, and OA closely matched the true values, indicating the proportion of positive and negative samples in test set should be consistent with that in actual situation. The accuracies reported by the traditional approaches including test set sampling from labelled data and 5-fold cross validation were far from the true accuracy and could not reflect the performance of the map. Among 42 previous maps, nearly 60% of the maps had UAs overestimated by 10%, and 9.5% of the maps had UAs and F1s deviations of more than 25%.

 Impervious surfaces are important indicators of human activity, and finding ways to quantify the gain and loss of impervious surfaces is important for sustainable urban development. However, most relevant studies assume that the transformation of natural surfaces to impervious surfaces is irreversible; thus, the losses of impervious surfaces are often ignored. Here, we propose a novel framework taking advantage of continuous change detection, multitemporal classification, and LandTrendr optimization to track the annual gains and losses in impervious surfaces. It may be the first study to focus on both loss and gain of impervious surfaces using time-series Landsat imagery. Specifically, we built dual continuous-change-detection models to pursue lower commission and omission errors for generating time-series training samples. Then, we adopted time-series classifications from multisource information and derived training samples to develop annual impervious-surface maps from 1985 to 2022 in Beijing. Afterwards, a novel optimization algorithm considering spatial heterogeneity and taking advantage of the LandTrendr algorithm was also proposed to optimize the spatiotemporal consistency of these impervious-surface maps. We further calculated accuracy metrics for the proposed method using time-series validation points, finding overall accuracies of 92.91 %±0.97 % and 93.17 %±1.26 % for gains and losses in impervious surfaces, respectively, using a one-year tolerance. Lastly, we revealed the gains and losses of impervious surfaces in Beijing during 1985–2022. The gained area of impervious surfaces was found to be 1996.21 km2 ± 18.58 km2, and there was a rapid increase during 2000–2010; the total lost area of impervious surfaces was 898.60 km2 ± 4.58 km2, of which 564.85 km2 ± 2.21 km2 first increased and was then lost. Therefore, the proposed method provides a new way of tracking the gain and loss of impervious surfaces, and it offers new possibilities for monitoring urban regreening."

 With advances in data collection technology, the volume of recent remote sensing point cloud datasets has grown significantly, posing substantial challenges for point cloud deep learning, particularly in neighborhood aggregation operations. Unlike simple pooling, neighborhood aggregation incorporates spatial relationships between points into the feature aggregation process, requiring repeated relationship learning and resulting in substantial computational redundancy. The exponential increase in data volume exacerbates this issue. To address this, we theoretically demonstrate that if basic spatial information is encoded in point features, simple pooling operations can effectively aggregate features. This means the spatial relationships can be extracted and integrated with other features during aggregation. Based on this concept, we propose a lightweight point network called DeLA (Decoupled Local Aggregation). DeLA separates the traditional neighborhood aggregation process into distinct spatial encoding and local aggregation operations, reducing the computational complexity by a factor of K, where K is the number of neighbors in the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (K-NN). Experimental results on five classic benchmarks show that DeLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced or equivalent latency. Specifically, DeLA exceeds 90% overall accuracy on ScanObjectNN and 74% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5. Additionally, DeLA achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanNetV2 with only 20% of the parameters of equivalent models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Matrix-ASC/DeLA."

 The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, spanning the past five years, has collected extensive three-dimensional Earth observation data, facilitating the understanding of environmental changes on a global scale. Its key product, Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08), offers global land and vegetation height data for carbon budget and cycle modeling. Consistent measurement accuracy of ATL08 is crucial for reliable time series analysis. However, fluctuations in the temporal accuracy of ATL08 data have been ignored in previous studies, leading to unknown uncertainties in existing time-series analyses. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study analyzes 59 months of ATL08 version 006 data in Finland to assess terrain and surface height accuracy, with a focus on temporal fluctuations across six major land cover types. A random forest (RF) model is employed to quantify the relative importance of error factors affecting height accuracy. Moreover, the study assesses accuracy at two official spatial resolutions, i.e., 100 m × 11 m and 20 m × 11 m, to evaluate the capability of ATL08 for the high-resolution height retrieval. For the terrain, the 100 m segment shows a bias of 0.04 m, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.44 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.66 m, while the 20 m segment exhibits a bias of 0.10 m, a MAE of 0.35 m, and an RMSE of 0.49 m. For the surface height, the 100 m segment shows a bias of −0.59 m, a MAE of 3.06 m, an RMSE of 4.52 m, a bias% of −3.45 %, a MAE% of 21.26 %, and an RMSE% of 31.40 %. The 20 m segment exhibits a bias of −0.72 m, a MAE of 3.51 m, an RMSE of 5.23 m, a bias% of −5.81 %, a MAE% of 28.52 %, and an RMSE% of 42.47 %. The results indicate that improving segment resolution enhances terrain accuracy but reduces surface height accuracy. According to the error factor analysis, surface coverage and beam type are crucial for terrain retrieval accuracy, with their effects varying over time. Seasonal changes, particularly the presence of snow, affect terrain retrieval accuracy, with the lowest accuracy observed around March each year. This study confirms the critical impact of surface height on its retrieval accuracy and suggests avoiding the use of ATL08 for retrieving low target surface heights, especially in steep terrains. Nevertheless, the analysis affirms the applicability of ATL08 for canopy height estimation in boreal forests, primarily composed of coniferous species, highlighting its potential for extensive spatial and temporal research. This contributes to bridging the gaps between accurate estimates and large area coverage in global carbon budget and cycle studies. Additionally, the findings reveal that similar issues may exist in other satellite laser altimetry missions, emphasizing the important impacts of temporal fluctuations in surface and terrain accuracy when utilizing satellite laser altimetry datasets."

 Plant foliage is known to respond rapidly to environmental stressors by adjusting leaf orientation at different timescales. One of the most fascinating mechanisms is paraheliotropism, also known as light avoidance through leaf movement. The leaf orientation (zenith and azimuth angles) is a parameter often overlooked in the plant and remote sensing community due to its challenging measurement procedures under field conditions. In this study, we investigate the synergistic potential of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-based mutlispectral imaging, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion to identify the paraheliotropic response of two distinct soybean varieties: Minngold, a chlorophyll-deficient mutant, and Eiko, a wild variety. We examined their responses to drought stress during the boreal summer drought in 2022 in western Germany by measuring average leaf inclination angle (ALIA) and canopy reflectance. Measurements were taken in the morning and at midday to track leaf movement. Our observations show significant differences between the paraheliotropic response of both varieties. Eiko’s terminal and lateral leaves became vertically erect in the midday (54→61∘), while Minngold’s ALIA remained largely unchanged (52→57∘). Apart from the vertical leaf movement, we also observed leaf inversion (exposing the abaxial side of the leaf) in Eiko under extreme water scarcity. The red edge band at 740 nm showed the strongest correlation with ALIA (r2=0.52−0.76) The ratio of the far red edge to near infrared (RE740/NIR842) vegetation index compensated for varying light levels during morning and afternoon measurements, exhibiting strong correlations with ALIA when considering only sun-lit leaf spectra (r2=0.72). The retrieval of ALIA with PROSAIL varied based on ALIA constraints and the spectra used for retrieval (full spectrum or the combination of bands 742 and 842), resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.7-12.9°. PROSAIL faced challenges in simulating the spectra of plots with very low LAI due to the soil background. This study made the first attempt to observe different paraheliotropic responses of two soybean varieties with UAV-based multispectral imaging. Proximal sensing opens up the possibilities to observe early stress indicators such as paraheliotropism, at much higher spatial and temporal resolution than ever before."

 Exploring the capabilities of remote sensing technologies for identifying stress responses in trees due to environmental pressures is crucial for comprehension, management, and maintenance of forests that are productive, healthy, and resilient. In recent decades, research on forest health monitoring has been predominantly focused on data obtained remotely, either from satellites or crewed aircraft. During the last few years, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained prominence as invaluable remote sensing platforms, increasingly being employed for forest surveying. As intermediary between traditional remote sensing methods and ground-level observations, UAVs can capture high-resolution imagery from low altitudes, even below cloud cover, in unprecedented detail. This ability allows for the precise detection of stress responses at the individual tree scale. In our study, we have acquired a highly heterogenous, multispectral time-series dataset from the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) inventory plots across Bavaria, Germany, focusing on the main tree species. The data was recorded over three consecutive years from a UAV with the objective of monitoring tree physiological stress responses. Concurrently, with the drone flights, the ground-based forest condition surveying (Level-1 monitoring) was conducted, serving as ground-truth validation, and providing detailed information on tree health indicators, such as defoliation and discoloration. Our findings revealed that multispectral imagery obtained from a UAV closely aligns with field data, proving effective detection of physiological stress in trees. Remarkably, in conjunction to the red, red edge, and near-infrared band, the inclusion of the blue band emerged as a critical indicator of tree stress when incorporated into the Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI), depending on factors such as tree species, class division, and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the averaged values per sample tree over three years, alongside the 5th and 25th percentile of the data distribution, have proven to be of key importance. Based on spectral indices, we achieved good classification accuracies by training species-specific gradient boosting models (macro F1-scores ranging from 0.492 to 0.769). These models can assist in quantifying tree stress responses, thereby supporting the objectives of the ICP Forests program, potentially leading to substantial cost savings or increased coverage in the future."

 Highly destructive flood disasters have occurred frequently recently. Related to this, accurate mapping of flood areas is a necessary undertaking that helps to understand the temporal and spatial evolution patterns of floods. Thus, this paper proposes a novel, unsupervised multi-scale machine learning (ML) approach for urban flood mapping with SAR images from the perspective of information mining and fusion. Considering the complexity of surface objects in urban scenes, the proposed approach first extracts and fuses multiple types of features, such as polarization, pseudo-color, and spatial features, from pre-flood and post-flood SAR images to enhance distinguishability of water bodies. In particular, some new pseudo-color features are constructed here for SAR images through pseudo-color synthesis and color space transformation. On this basis, a flood probability map (FPM) is generated, and multi-scale superpixel segmentation is performed on it. Then, an ML-based unsupervised classification model assisted by uncertainty analysis based on the Gaussian mixture model is designed and implemented for flood mapping at different segmentation scales. Finally, guided by the minimum uncertainty, an adaptive fusion strategy of multi-scale information is proposed to integrate the flood mapping results at different scales for producing the final flood map. The proposed approach is unsupervised, and can minimize the mapping uncertainty to improve mapping accuracy and reliability. These characteristics of the proposed approach make it practical. The results of comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and has certain advantages over existing methods, especially in reducing false detections and correctly identifying the categories of uncertain pixels in flood mapping. Furthermore, the experimental results also indicate that the pseudo-color features constructed here also help enhance flood mapping accuracy."

Within these clusters, an assortment of spatial regulations and evaluations facilitated the judicious selection of environmentally-conscious waste collection sites (WCSs).

 Modeling incompatible spatial data, i.e., data with different spatial resolutions, is a pervasive challenge in remote sensing data analysis. Typical approaches to addressing this challenge aggregate information to a common coarse resolution, i.e., compatible resolutions, prior to modeling. Such pre-processing aggregation simplifies analysis, but potentially causes information loss and hence compromised inference and predictive performance. To avoid losing potential information provided by finer spatial resolution data and improve predictive performance, we propose a new Bayesian method that constructs a latent spatial process model at the finest spatial resolution. This model is tailored to settings where the outcome variable is measured on a coarser spatial resolution than predictor variables—a configuration seen increasingly when high spatial resolution remotely sensed predictors are used in analysis. A key contribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enables full Bayesian inference using finer resolution data while optimizing computational and storage costs. The proposed method is applied to a forest damage assessment for the 2018 Adrian storm in Carinthia, Austria, that uses high-resolution laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements and relatively coarse resolution forest inventory measurements. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the proposed approach substantially improves inference for small prediction units."

Through self-organizing map (SOM) analysis of upper-level geopotential height fields and aerosol optical depth (AOD), the recurring coupled patterns of the large-scale circulation and the AOD are classified into three clusters associated with high pollution episodes that frequently occur in spring and winter. In addition, the long-range transport is investigated for each SOM type using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing PM2.5 levels.

 A new environmental meteorology index for O3 pollution (EMI/O3) has been developed to quantify the contribution of meteorological variations to the surface O3 trends, based on WRF-Chem simulation result analysis. Under fixed base emissions for the year of 2016 and varying meteorology from 2014 to 2023, four major factors influencing the surface O3 trend in a region, i.e. chemical formation, vertical mixing, horizontal advection and dry depositions were extracted from the simulation results and used to formulate the EMI/O3 index as a function of meteorology.

 The COVID-19 outbreak and the Beijing Winter Olympics provided an opportunity to study the impact of human activities on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. Continuous measurements of 117 VOC species were conducted in urban Ji'nan, the capital city of Shandong Province, North China Plain, from 2019 to 2024. The total volatile organic compound concentrations ranged from 30.7 ppbv to 41.7 ppbv, and the seasonal characteristics of VOCs were generally high in autumn and winter and low in spring and summer, with alkanes as the component with the highest percentage. The average VOC volume fraction increased by 24.8% after the COVID-19 outbreak compared to that before the outbreak, among which the concentrations of aromatics increased most markedly (334.7%), and those of alkanes increased by 95.2%. Alkenes, alkynes, halocarbons, and oxygenated VOCs showed decreasing trends. The volume fraction of each VOC species showed a decreasing trend during the Beijing Winter Olympics air quality guarantee period compared with the pre-Beijing Winter Olympics period, with a 16.7%–36.3% reduction rate. The positive matrix factorization model identified six sources: vehicle emission, industrial mixing sources, solvent use, oil and gas volatilization, biogenic and secondary sources, and combustion sources. Influenced by the resumption of work and production by enterprises after the COVID-19 pandemic, solvent use increased by 26.7% after the pandemic, and the contribution of diesel vehicle emissions was significant. After the pandemic, the contribution of industrial mixing sources decreased by 28.6%, whereas coal combustion sources increased by 5.3% compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. During the Beijing Winter Olympics air quality guarantee period, coal combustion sources and vehicle emission sources decreased by 11.6% and 6.5%, respectively, and contributions from industrial sources and biogenic and secondary sources increased by 13.2% and 6.4%, respectively, compared with those during the pre-Beijing Winter Olympics period. During the Beijing Winter Olympics air quality guarantee period, the results of the backward airflow trajectory, and potential source area analysis, showed a strong influence of air mass transmission in the southwest direction, and VOCs emissions from industrial sources had higher values in the southwest region. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, there were obvious ship sources from the long-range transmission of the near-coastal region in the Yellow Sea. However, in post-COVID-19, long-range transport contributions from ship sources vanished due to the upgrading of marine oils after implementing the DECA 2.0."

 Zaozhuang, located at the center of the boundary between Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, contains coal and heavy industries. Zaozhuang has experienced severe O3 pollution in recent years and it is crucial to identify the key drivers. This study aims to deeply excavate and analyze the formation mechanism of O3 in Zaozhuang based on hourly measured volatile organic compound (VOC) concentration data for the year 2023, combined with meteorological factors and other atmospheric pollutants, using a machine learning model in combination with the SHapley Additive Properties Interpretation method and Positive Matrix Factorization model. The results show the important contributions of meteorological factors to O3 production, especially solar radiation and temperature. Among atmospheric pollutants, VOCs are the main contributors, with significant effects from alkene and oxygenated VOCs, whereas propene and acetone have the most critical individual impacts on local O3 production. O3 peaked in June and August, with June seeing added contributions from temperature, and a higher chemical variable contribution than meteorological factors in August, led by NO2, OVOCs, and alkenes. The effects of the six emission sources on O3 formation in Zaozhuang showed that chemical emission sources (5.98 μg/m3), combustion sources (3.75 μg/m3), and solvent use sources (3.06 μg/m3) were the main drivers. The solvent source exhibited the most significant change on the O3 polluted day, with a relative increase of 115%. This relative increase was significantly higher than that of the other sources. During persistent pollution events with the highest levels of O3, the use of solvents made the greatest contribution to the emission sources, representing 23% of the total impact of the emission sources. Therefore, an integrated approach using machine learning, SHapley Additive Properties Interpretation, and Positive Matrix Factorization rapidly diagnoses the causes of O3 pollution at different timescales and provides a basis for targeted control measures."

 Multiple regulations have been promulgated to improve air quality, and previous studies have used an accountability chain to evaluate the effects of these regulations on emission levels, air quality, and human health. However, quantifying these impacts through the accountability chain is complex due to interactions between multiple factors that can influence the efficacy of control policies and introduce uncertainties at each step. We evaluated and quantified the impact of emission controls on electricity generating units (EGU) and motor vehicle sources on emissions and air quality via Generalized Additive Models. These GAMs have minimal bias (around 10−5 to 10−2 μg/m3 or ppbV) and r2 values for daily concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 Counterfactual air pollutant concentrations, in the absence of EGU and mobile source regulations, were calculated using estimated counterfactual emissions for the period 2005 to 2019 in Atlanta, New York City, and California's South Coast Air Basin. Counterfactual air pollutant concentrations indicated that the effects of regulations on air pollutants varied depending on the season and location. Predicted counterfactual air pollutant concentrations were generally 2–12 times higher than the measured concentrations at these sites, except for ozone. The impact of regulations on ozone concentrations typically resulted in reduced peak ozone values in the summer, but increased concentrations in the winter. Monte Carlo modeling found small to modest uncertainties, depending on the pollutant, location and regulations assessed.

 We collected simultaneous indoor and outdoor PM2.5 measurements from 17 homes in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to characterize spatio-temporal variations and identify factors influencing indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels. A pair of PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors were deployed at each home, one indoors and the other outdoors, during the wet and dry seasons, and the locally calibrated data were used for analysis. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels were three times higher during the dry season (indoor 146 ± 22 μg/m³, outdoor 153 ± 23 μg/m³) than during the wet season (indoor 52 ± 12 μg/m³, outdoor 50 ± 11 μg/m³). Indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratios were close to 1 in both seasons (dry: 0.97 ± 0.14, wet: 1.05 ± 0.19). This suggests that regional background pollution levels significantly influence indoor levels observed in different households. Infiltration factors closer to 1 (dry: 0.83 ± 0.12; wet: 0.87 ± 0.14), determined through mixed-effects regression of indoor and outdoor time series data, further highlight the substantial impact of outdoor pollution on indoor levels. Data from individual households exhibited strong temporal correlation between indoor and outdoor levels in both seasons (Pearson R: 0.82 ± 0.12 during the dry season and 0.83 ± 0.14 during the wet season), whereas indoor-outdoor spatial correlations across measured households were moderate (R: 0.49 and 0.62 during dry and wet seasons, respectively). These spatial correlations and empirical regression modeling suggest that while the spatial variation of outdoor PM2.5 levels significantly influences indoor levels' spatial variation, other factors such as indoor source activities and ventilation-related features play crucial roles in explaining variabilities in indoor PM2.5 across homes. Overall, our study suggests that indoor environments in Dhaka city are nearly as polluted as outdoor settings, and this locally derived scientific evidence can be valuable for enhancing public awareness and developing mitigation measures to reduce PM2.5 exposures in Bangladesh."

 Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have persistence and toxicities, so exposure to PBDEs is associated with various health hazards. Thus, it is crucial to study the pollution status of PBDEs in office microenvironments, which are the primary active places for people working in offices. We collected 80 samples (air, particulate matter, and dust) from 10 offices in Hangzhou and detected the congeners of PBDEs using GC-ECD. Median concentrations of total PBDEs in particle phase, gas phase, and dust were 108.28 pg/m3, 35.63 pg/m3 and 59.22 ng/g, respectively. BDE-209 was the primary congener in various media. The particle size distribution was bimodal and was primarily distributed in the ＜1.1 and > 7 μm particle size segment. We predicted the concentration of PBDEs in different phases to better explore the fate of released PBDEs. The measured value of the equilibrium coefficient between gas and dust indicated that PDBEs in the gas-phase were transferred into the dust. The predicted Cg−pre value of PBDEs was smaller than the measured value Cg, especially BDE-209. The measured concentration of low-brominated PBDEs in particles was higher than the predicted concentration, which may be because the non-equilibrium model did not consider the dry and wet deposition of particles. The PBDE concentrations in the materials were in the following order: mouse pad < cable shell < plastic folder < eco-board. The analysis of indoor sources of PBDEs demonstrated that plastic folders, eco-boards, and mouse pads and cable shells may be potential sources of PBDEs in the air, dust, and particles, respectively.

 In Japanese society, incense is often burned indoors for its fragrance and as a part of Buddhist rituals. However, fragrances and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by incense burning can adversely affect human health. Japanese products are not required to disclose fragrances included; therefore, the number of these compounds to which users are exposed is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the human health risks associated with incense burning in household rooms and temples. Chamber tests demonstrated that incense sticks used in the home contained higher concentrations of fragrance than those used in temples. Consequently, the level of fragrance contained in smoke from incense used in the home (1,100–9,200 μg stick−1) was greater than that from temple incense smoke (15–84 μg stick−1). The concentration of VOCs derived from the pyrolysis of incense ranged from 840 to 2,900 μg stick−1, which was higher than the fragrance emission concentrations. Field observations in three temples and four rooms revealed that incense burning during memorial services presented a benzene cancer risk of 3.7–5.2 × 10−6 for monks. The seating position of the monk should be at least 11 m from the incense to reduce the cancer risk of benzene to a value below 1 × 10−6."

This study examines the 2023/24 winter when frequent stratospheric disturbances occurred, including minor and major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). The stratospheric circulation was disturbed multiple times, with rapid circumpolar westerly wind deceleration and even zonal wind reversal. Corresponding wave pulses were observed in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, with large eddy heat flux pulses appearing before every stratospheric perturbation. The stratospheric perturbation was examined from the spatiotemporal evolution of the annular mode index, revealing two instances of evident downward propagation. Nevertheless, the near surface did not respond in a typical negative NAM pattern associated with the stratospheric signal. The study further analyzed the predictability of the near surface and its relation with the stratospheric disturbance using common initializations in January and February 2024 from S2S models. The results indicate that the near surface predictability was not enhanced in the 2023/24 winter albeit with frequent stratospheric disturbances, and the contribution of the stratospheric disturbance to the surface predictability was limited. Although the multimodel ensemble means forecast warm spots over broad regions of lands and dry spots in part of China and US, the stratospheric circulation error nearly did not explain the near surface forecasting error among S2S models most of the time. The subseasonal predictability of the near surface conditions over the course of the 2023/24 winter seldom originated from the stratospheric disturbances, and other predictability sources such as the warm tropical Pacific Ocean and increased Arctic sea ice should be considered."

 Precipitation and its diurnal cycle are closely connected with the thermodynamic and dynamic processes of the Earth system, significantly influencing the climate. This study evaluates the performance of reanalysis and CMIP6 datasets in reproducing hourly precipitation events during warm seasons across China from 1980 to 2014. Statistical results indicate that while these datasets better reproduce the distribution of mean intensity than mean duration, neither fully captures the trends in mean duration or intensity. The reanalysis and CMIP6 datasets can reproduce the late afternoon precipitation peak, but it is difficult to capture the early morning peak of long-duration events except for ERA5 and HadGEM3-GC31-MM. Short-duration events show advanced peak time trends over most stations, while long-duration events exhibit delayed trends, a pattern not comprehensively replicated by other datasets. Additionally, the impact of aerosols on precipitation peak times varies across three regions: North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD). In the NCP, early morning and midnight peaks advance for precipitation that lasts 4–6 h, potentially linked to aerosol radiative effects. In contrast, in the YRD and PRD, both early morning and late afternoon peaks are delayed 1–2 h, associated with the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols. This study also highlights that aerosol impacts on precipitation peak times are dependent on meteorological conditions. In the NCP, the radiative effect of absorbing aerosols is enhanced under low-CAPE conditions. In the YRD, the aerosol invigoration effect is inhibited under high-WS conditions, whereas in the PRD, a low-WS environment enhances the microphysical effect of aerosols."

 This study investigates the atmospheric conditions associated with major tornado outbreaks (at least seven tornadoes of magnitude EF2 or higher) in the United States during May using maximum covariance analysis (MCA). We focus on identifying the leading modes of covariability between 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies and the WMAXSHEAR parameter, a bivariate proxy of atmospheric buoyancy and vertical wind shear. By analyzing 91 significant tornado outbreaks from 1950 to 2019, we identify three primary multivariate patterns, each exhibiting distinct anomaly locations and intensities for both variables. These patterns account for 97 % of the covariability between the two fields, with the leading pattern (MCA1) explaining 71 %, the second (MCA2) 20 %, and the third (MCA3) 6 %. The application of MCA to tornado outbreak analysis is a novel approach, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex multi-scale atmospheric conditions leading to these events.We find that tornado outbreaks associated with the first two leading covariability patterns last longer ad can occur at any time of day and night, whereas those associated with the third pattern tend to be shorter and begin in the late morning or early evening. The identified patterns are significantly different from those observed on null-event days, suggesting that these patterns are useful for future research aimed at simulating and comparing tornado outbreak characteristics under scenarios of a warming climate. This research enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between mesoscale and synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions and provides valuable insights for improving tornado outbreak predictions and preparedness in a changing climate."

 Short-term forecasting of extreme weather is crucial for disaster warning and prevention. Many extreme weather events are often accompanied by significant water vapor changes, therefore, assimilating high-precision, high-resolution water vapor observations into numerical models is essential. This study explores the impact of GNSS ZTD assimilation on short-term forecasting of extreme weather using the WRF model on the case of “21.7” Henan extreme heavy rain. The impacts of GNSS ZTD assimilation on model fields and forecast results are analyzed, compared with scenarios where no data or only conventional observational data are assimilated. The results indicate that GNSS products outperform radiosonde data in temporal and spatial resolution, significantly affecting humidity fields in assimilation and providing more detailed water vapor distribution. In terms of precipitation forecasting, the analysis of POD, FAR, and ETS scores shows that GNSS data assimilation primarily impacts moderate to heavy rainfall for this case. During most simulation periods, the scores are higher when GNSS products are assimilated, with the most notable improvements observed at the threshold of 30 mm for 3-h accumulated precipitation, where ETS scores increase by an average of 21 %. However, despite the general improvement in precipitation forecast accuracy, limitations remain in forecasting peak rainfall periods."

 To understand the formation and evolution of tropical rainfall, this study examines macro- and micro-physical features and vertical structures of tropical precipitation systems (TPSs) using 9-years observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission's dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR). TPSs are primarily convective-dominated, and their precipitation rate (PR) concentrated in 20–40 mm/h, which can be largely attributed to liquid hydrometeors, especially in convective regions. However, TPSs with low PR (below 10 mm/h) are stratiform-dominated. The mean levels of 0 °C and − 40 °C within the TPSs are 4.9 km and 11 km, respectively. Warm core is observed in the TPS, which is related to the development of precipitation system. TPSs have distinct characteristics during different stages of their lifecycle. Condensation and autoconversion processes in convective cores contribute to the formation of initial small droplet below 3 km. With the development of TPSs, strong updrafts in convective cores transport droplets from cloud base to higher levels, facilitating the collision-coalescence process in liquid phase layers. During the developing and mature stages, aggregation and riming processes become active above the melting layers. The large hydrometeors within the convective cores contribute to high PR of mature-stage TPSs. In stratiform region, droplets sizes are larger during mature stage than dissipating stage, and these larger droplets may detach from the convective cores. It makes the dominate microphysical process in stratiform regions of mature (dissipating) stage is breakup (evaporation) of raindrops. These results advance the understanding of tropical rainfall and establish a foundation for future research into validating and improving cloud microphysical parameterization schemes in numerical models."

 The radiative effects caused by a massive desert dust outbreak that took place in the Western Sahara Desert, in the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean, in June 2020 are studied. This outbreak featured two significant dust plumes, the second of which is the focus of the present study.For the identification of the dust plume, we adopted a multi-platform set of remote sensing data, including satellite retrievals from the sensors VIIRS, MODIS and SEVIRI onboard the NOAA-20, Aqua and MSG spacecrafts, respectively. The analysis of aerosol-radiation effects is based on a regional simulation with the WRF-Chem model, implementing the coupling between the aerosols of the GOCART speciation and the radiative modules defined in WRF-Chem model by the “New Goddard Shortwave and Longwave Schemes”. In this context, two sets of simulations are proposed: the first one (CTL) without any feedback, and the second (CPL) adopting the fully-coupling strategy.From the comparison between the simulated and the observed (SEVIRI) incoming SW/LW radiation it follows that: (i) the presence of dust in the domain causes a reduction of the incoming SW radiation in the CPL runs; (ii) this reduction is fully in agreement with experimental data; (iii) conversely, the LW component appears to be insensitive to model coupling. Hence, the Goddard radiative coupling is effective in reducing the incoming SW radiation: the difference in terms of average daily values between model and SEVIRI is 123.7 vs 37.0 W m−2 for CTL and CPL runs, respectively. The incoming longwave radiation seems to be less correlated with the coupling strategy, being the difference of 31.15 vs 15.8 W m−2 for CTL and CPL runs, respectively.The dust radiative forcing (DRF), that characterises the aerosol–radiation interactions, results in an average surface cooling of −16.9 W m−2 between the CPL and the CTL runs that could be attributed to a reduction of SW radiation absorbed and scattered by dust particles in the coupled run. At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), a warming, caused by the decrease in atmospheric transparency to the terrestrial thermal radiation, results in an average DRF of +1.5 W m−2.Finally, the space- and time-averaged surface energy balance results in a difference (E(CPL) - E(CTL)) of about −7.5 W m−2. Similarly, the dynamic response of the dust forcing within the Planetary Boundary Layer is characterised by a mean temperature difference (CPL-CTL) of about −0.7 K near the surface.Our findings strongly encourage the use of fully-coupled modelling strategy, between aerosols and meteorology, for regional-scale studies and in climate risk assessments."

 While El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has widespread impacts on the climate around the Pacific and North America, the relationship between ENSO and winter surface air temperature (SAT) in Europe is less well established. This study investigates the modulation effects of the spring Victoria mode (VM) on the weak ENSO–SAT connection in the following winter based on reanalysis data and numerical experiments. It is shown that the connection between ENSO and the winter SAT in central Europe has a significant and positive (negative) correlation during the positive (negative) VM phase. Further analysis shows that the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with ENSO play an important role in the VM modulation. For the positive VM phase, ENSO combined with the SST warming mode in the western North Pacific induces the East Atlantic teleconnection pattern, which strengthens the anomalous warm advection and leads to the positive SAT anomalies in central Europe. In contrast, for the negative VM phase, ENSO could trigger a negative North Atlantic Oscillation pattern through intermediate SST anomalies in the tropical North Pacific, favoring the formation of the negative central European SAT anomalies. The remarkable modulation effect of the VM on the connection between ENSO and winter central European SAT is further verified through forced experiments using an atmospheric model. This could provide hope that ENSO can make predictions for the winter SAT in central Europe, considering the phase of the preceding spring VM."

 Understanding the impacts of land surface processes on summer extreme precipitation is crucial for accurate climate predictions. This study investigated these impacts across three subregions of eastern China (North China, Central China, and South China) using the regional Climate–Weather Research and Forecasting model with two land surface parameterization schemes: the Conjunctive Surface–Subsurface Process (CSSP) scheme and the NOAH Land Surface Model (NOAH). When compared with observational and reanalysis data, both schemes were found to successfully reproduce the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation, with the CSSP scheme showing distinct advantages in simulating evapotranspiration. The influence of land surface processes on summer extreme precipitation varies among the three subregions, largely depending on soil moisture conditions. In North China, a transitional zone between arid and humid regions, soil moisture primarily influences extreme precipitation, with biases arising from difference between the lifting condensation level and the planetary boundary layer height. In Central China, where soil moisture is moderate, soil moisture and net radiation jointly influence extreme precipitation, with biases linked to the planetary boundary layer height. In South China, where soil moisture is mostly saturated during summer, net radiation dominates the variability of land surface variables, with latent heat bias leading to extreme precipitation bias. Overall, soil moisture affects extreme precipitation by altering the energy and stability of the planetary boundary layer and the lifting condensation level. These findings could inform the assessment and future improvement of models, and support the monitoring and predicting of extreme precipitation events."

 This study examined the sensitivity of cloud microphysics and planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization in the simulation of localized heavy rainfall in northern Japan such as the August 2022 event. Accurate simulation/forecast of such quasi-stationary line-shaped mesoscale convective systems is a pressing issue for the region. The sensitivities of 17 different cloud microphysics parameterization schemes, including single and double moments, and eight different PBL schemes, including nonlocal and local closure schemes, were investigated. Overall, the simulated heavy rainfall in August 2022 was notably sensitive to the microphysics and PBL schemes. Among the microphysical parameterization comparisons, the Goddard and Eta (Ferrier) schemes exhibited superior performance in simulating the magnitude and spatial distribution of heavy rainfall events, evaluated using various precipitation statistics and object-based measure (Structure-Amplitude-Location (SAL) method). Considering the sensitivity of the PBL schemes, the combination of the Goddard microphysics scheme and the Grenier–Bretherton–McCaa PBL scheme performed the best in the 48-h basin-average precipitation depth and spatial distribution RMSE. Ensemble correlation analysis revealed that a better representation of the strong water vapor flux convergence was the key to simulating localized heavy rainfall.

 The land surface layer is an important interface between the ground and atmosphere, and cross-surface ground heat flux (G0) has a significant impact on land surface energy processes and associated cycles. Therefore, understanding dynamics in G0 is critical for predicting climate changes and developing adaptation strategies. However, the harsh environment and geographic barriers of the Tibetan Plateau have led to a significant lack of observations and soil samples, ultimately limiting the accuracy and application of G0 calculations. Here we investigated the changes in G0 at the BJ station, a typical seasonally frozen ground region of the Tibetan Plateau, through soil sampling and long-term in-situ observations. We used the calorimetric method to minimize reliance on model assumptions, aiming to achieve consistent and broadly applicable results. During the freezing-to-thawing and thawing-to-freezing stages, daytime G0 decreased while nighttime G0 increased. Conversely, daytime G0 increased while nighttime G0 decreased in the completely thawed and completely frozen stages. In moist conditions, more energy was directed toward soil moisture evaporation and vegetation transpiration, whereas in dry conditions, net radiation primarily increased soil temperature, enhancing G0.

 A seesawing temperature pattern occurred over northern mid-latitudes in December 2023, with cold anomalies over northern parts of Eurasia and warm conditions over North America. The recurrent dipole temperature pattern in boreal winter has been revealed to be associated with concurrent changes in atmospheric variability (e.g., Siberian high and Alaska ridge) and boundary forcing (e.g., Arctic sea ice and North Atlantic sea surface temperature), whereas its precursor features remain less clear. Based on reanalysis data and two sets of coupled simulations, this study revealed that strong blocking activity over the Greenland-Eurasia sector in November was an important precursor to the remarkable “colder North Eurasia, warmer North America” pattern in December 2023. Increased tropospheric blocking frequency in November favored vertically propagating planetary waves to weaken the stratospheric polar vortex. The stratospheric response that persisted into December was characterized as the shift of polar vortex towards Eurasia and away from North America, linked to the enhanced zonal wavenumber-1 planetary waves. Downward propagation of the amplified wavenumber-1 component into the troposphere in December contributed to stronger continental high pressure over Eurasia and weaker ridge over Alaska, causing the “colder North Eurasia, warmer North America” pattern. High consistency between the results of observations and two sets of numerical simulations confirms the critical role of preceding tropospheric blocking, which is valuable for sub-seasonal prediction of the dipole temperature pattern across northern mid-latitudes."

 Reanalysis is a well-established tool for monitoring the state of the atmosphere. This study aims at validating the ALADIN-Climate (AC) model reanalysis over Europe with a focus on Central Europe. The AC model is based on the ALARO model configuration and belongs to convection permitting models. Its horizontal resolution is 2.3 km. We evaluated a 25-year long period (1990–2014) and we performed the validation process using measurements from ground-based meteorological data over Europe to assess the ability of the AC model to simulate temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, and global radiation. The AC model reanalysis tends to overestimate minimum daily temperature and underestimate maximum daily temperature, with larger differences observed during summer. Winter precipitation totals are overestimated by nearly 50 %, partly due to an overestimation of wet days, while summer precipitation is less overestimated (by 13 %). Relative humidity is consistently overestimated across the model domain in winter, whereas in summer it is variable. Wind speed is overestimated in both summer and winter, and global radiation is also overestimated, especially in winter. Although some variables, like winter precipitation, exhibit significant biases, the overall differences between the AC model reanalysis and station data are consistent with other reanalyses, such as CERRA and ERA5. Biases in the AC model reanalysis are not only caused by the model's imperfections and errors, but also by potential systematic errors at measuring stations. Given its high spatial resolution, this AC regional reanalysis offers a valuable source for further climate studies in Central Europe."

 The Upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB), located at the junction of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Loess Plateau, and Inner Mongolia Plateau, plays a pivotal role in regional climate dynamics, hydrological processes, and ecological stability, primarily due to its precipitation variability. This study utilizes station-based observational data alongside atmospheric reanalysis data to investigate the interdecadal variability of heavy precipitation during the warm-season from 1980 to 2020 in the UYRB. Furthermore, it provides a comparative assessment of the atmospheric circulation patterns that influenced the observed shifts in heavy precipitation across different periods. The analysis revealed pronounced interdecadal changes in warm-season total precipitation (WSTP), heavy precipitation amount (R90p), and heavy precipitation frequency (R90d) around 2003. Heavy precipitation contributes approximately 40 % to the total precipitation, while changes in heavy precipitation account for up to 81 % of the increased total precipitation in the UYRB, the light precipitation exhibit a negative contribution, and moderate precipitation shows a slight positive contribution. Additionally, the variation in the frequency of heavy precipitation contributes the most, reaching 7 mm/10a, while the intensity of precipitation is only 1.5 mm/10a. After 2003, the frequency of heavy precipitation (R90d) during the warm-season increased by 14.4 %, whereas the intensity of heavy precipitation (R90t) rose by a modest 4.3 %, indicating that the increase in R90d predominantly drives the long-term trend in WSTP over the UYRB. The key factors such as moisture transport, moisture content, instability energy, and vertical motion were compared between two distinct periods: 1980–2002 (Period1) and 2003–2020 (Period2). During P2, there was a marked intensification of anomalous easterly moisture transport and moisture convergence throughout the atmospheric column, resulting in a nearly 50 % increases in net moisture input and a rise of 2.7 % in total columnar moisture content relative to P1. Atmospheric instability exhibited a slight increase, with notable anomalous convergent upward motion detected over the source region of the Yellow River and central Gansu province, likely intensified by orographic effects. A zonally-oriented “+ - +” Silk Road-like teleconnection pattern emerged in the mid-to-upper troposphere over Eurasia since 2003, enhancing westward moisture transport from the Indian Ocean and Pacific. This shift corresponded with increased moisture availability and vertical ascent during the warm-season, which is conducive to a significant increase in heavy precipitation over the UYRB."

 Ecosystem capacity studies for carbon sequestration and water extraction are largely conditioned by Eddy Covariance (EC) measurement availability and quality. Our study aims at evaluating several procedures of EC data qualification. Indeed, quality control of EC data is generally ensured by stationarity and well-developed turbulence tests. The latter is based on integral turbulence characteristic (ITC) models. In this study, we revisited the quality control procedure using locally established ITC models for wind speed components and atmospheric scalars (temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide molar densities) in unstable and stable conditions. We also considered the interdependence of flux qualities because of the corrections applied to fluxes during their preprocessing. The analyses were carried out using one year of data collected above a woodland forest and mixed crop sites, both situated in Northern Benin, West Africa. From these analyzes we note that the quality flags vary depending on the use of local or existing ITC models. Also, the test of turbulence development on atmospheric scalars, previously neglected, is of great importance in the quality control of data. Thus, taking into account the ITC models associated with the atmospheric scalars established locally in the well-developed turbulence test as well as taking into account the interdependence of the flux quality have considerably improved the standard quality control procedure used in effectively filtering unrealistic flux data while keeping a considerable percentage of good and medium quality data."

 Under global warming, the simultaneous occurrence of drought and high temperature is raising growing concerns due to their detrimental impacts on ecosystems, water resources, and food security. Extensive studies have evaluated different characteristics (e.g., spatial extent and frequency) of such compound extremes using percentile-threshold methods based on historical records and climate model projections. Nevertheless, quantitative assessments of projected changes in compound dry-hot extremes based on the daily-scale compound dry-hot index which is constructed by copula theory and the latest CMIP6 downscaled projection outputs are rather rare. Based on the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6), the study first calculated the daily Standardized Compound Dry and Hot Index (SCDHI) by combining Standardized Antecedent Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SAPEI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) to identify compound dry-hot extremes while exploring its constraints for an accurate evaluation of its spatiotemporal evolution in China from 1961 to 2100. In this study, a reasonable threshold is determined to reduce some dry but no hot (hot but no dry) condition incorrectly identified as compound dry-hot condition. In terms of temporal variation, the study shows that all characteristics (i.e., occurrence, intensity, and area) are projected to increase over the next 80 years under the four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, SSP5–8.5). Particularly in the last 30 years of the 21st century, these features escalate significantly and rapidly, and the higher the emission scenario, the greater the escalation. From a spatial distribution perspective, we find that a more frequent occurrence of compound dry-hot days across China under the future SSPs compared to 1961–2020, with more so in Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, Hainan, and Southwest China. These findings emphasize that policy makers should take relevant and timely measures to reduce social and economic losses caused by intensified projected compound dry-hot extremes."

 As a pivotal factor influencing crop water requirement, reference evapotranspiration (ET0) plays a crucial role in agricultural water planning and management. Irrigation can exert distinct influences on ET0 by modifying meteorological conditions through land-atmosphere coupling. While the climatic effects of irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP), the most intensively irrigated area over China, have been explored, the specific impact of irrigation on ET0 remains unclear. To address this gap, we here employ a regional climate model coupled with a well-validated irrigation scheme to perform idealized simulations to investigate the responding behaviors of ET0 to irrigation in the NCP from 2005 to 2014. We find that the incorporation of irrigation notably enhances the model performance in modeling ET0 in the NCP. Irrigation induces an ET0 decrease of −0.32 mm day−1 (−29.4 mm year−1) in spring and −0.38 mm day−1 (−35.0 mm year−1) in summer and an actual evapotranspiration (ETa) increase of 0.49 mm day−1 (45.1 mm year−1) in spring and 0.40 mm day−1 (36.8 mm year−1) in summer, respectively. The irrigation-induced changes in ET0 and ETa adhere to the complementary principle, which stems from the land-atmosphere coupling. The decline in ET0 is attributed to decreases in surface air temperature and wind speed, coupled with an increase in relative humidity due to irrigation, with the latter playing a paramount role. Furthermore, irrigation decouples the relationship between precipitation and ETa and weakens the traditional dependence of ETa on local precipitation. This study underscores that the related change in ET0 due to the climate feedbacks of irrigation should be taken into account in agricultural water planning and management."

 The dominant winter modes of large-scale atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA), and Scandinavian (SCA) patterns. This study examines their multi-decadal variability over the Instrumental Period. We identify stages through which interactions between NAO and both EA and SCA phases alter westerly winds and precipitation anomalies in Europe, which would be overlooked if only NAO phases were considered. Additionally, we show periods where EA becomes the leading mode, likely driven by natural ocean-atmosphere coupling variability, which can enhance climate reconstructions and projections. This study also provides new insights into shifts in NAO action centers. The recent shift (post-1980s) is notably distinct within the Instrumental Period. Unlike previous NAO pattern variations, EA and SCA intensify simultaneously, contributing to an expansion of the Azores High, combined with the Atlantic Ridge and/or Scandinavian Blocking. This results in drier conditions in southern Europe and wetter conditions in the north. The simultaneous intensification of NAO, EA, and SCA supports hypotheses of the Azores High expanding towards Central Europe. While this study does not attribute the shift to global warming, the eastward displacement of the northern NAO center post-1980s suggests some anthropogenic forcing through atmospheric and oceanic warming. We thus propose keeping this issue open, despite recent NAO reconstructions not identifying a singular signal in the latter half of the 20th century."

 This study used the pseudo-global warming (PGW) method in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to examine the effects of climate change on localized heavy rainfall events in the Tohoku and Hokuriku regions in August 2022. This heavy rainfall event is one of the representative cases of heavy rainfall in the region, in which water vapor transport from the Sea of Japan is a key factor, and its frequency and magnitude are projected to increase with climate change. Our modeling results showed that the simulated 48-h precipitation under the projected 2090s warming conditions increased by 34.6 % compared to precipitation without consideration of future warming effects. In general, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and convection instability over the ocean increased with future warming. While the rate of increase in water vapor is generally consistent with Clausius-Clapeyron scaling (7 %/K) based on surface temperature rise, the 48-h cumulative precipitation notably exceeds this scaling rate, even larger than triple Clausius-Clapeyron scaling. This increase in precipitation is driven by a combination of thermodynamic effects—such as enhanced water vapor content with rising temperatures—and dynamic effects, including strengthened updrafts. We showed that the model domain location can significantly affect the simulated precipitation and its changes in PGW simulations. For instance, a 29.2 % change in 48-h precipitation was observed solely due to the geospatial shift of the innermost domain. This finding indicates the importance of the model domain location as a source of uncertainty in the PGW method."

 Explosive cyclone development has been shown to be a positive feedback process, however what causes this to end is an open question. We employ the perturbation potential energy (PPE) framework to investigate the evolution of the December 2022 North American bomb cyclone (NABC) as a case study. A layer with negative PPE anomaly separates the positive PPE anomaly generated by the December 2022 NABC from a positive PPE anomaly near the tropopause during the development phase. This layer of negative PPE anomalies acts as a barrier such that positive PV anomalies cannot pass through. At the start of the decay phase, this barrier breaks, allowing stratospheric intrusion. Here we propose a mechanism where the negative upper pole of the vertical PV dipole caused by atmospheric latent heating (the lower, positive pole is involved in the positive feedback loop of development) triggers a cascade of events, where this PV anomaly causes tropopause deformation, which causes circulation anomalies, which causes enhanced energy conversion, which causes the negative PPE anomaly barrier to break, allowing a positive PV anomaly airmass to descend (indicative of stratospheric intrusion) through the break, leading to the suppression of further atmospheric latent heat release, and therefore ending the development phase of this bomb cyclone, despite the non-depletion of moisture in the vicinity of the December 2022 NABC. While this process is shown for a specific case study, the improved understanding of the life cycle of explosive cyclones has the potential to improve forecasting of explosive cyclones in the future.Plain language summaryBomb cyclones over land can have large social and economic consequences. Bomb cyclones are known to get stronger in part due to a cycle involving the increased potential vorticity below a level where water vapor condenses. The reasons that explosive cyclones stop developing has yet to be determined, and finding this mechanism could improve forecasts and therefore improve preparedness. In this paper we conduct a case study on a bomb cyclone that happened over North America in late December 2022 using some traditional approaches combined with a newer energetics method focusing on the local perturbations of the potential and kinetic energies. We find that this bomb cyclone stopped getting stronger, not because it ran out of water, but because of a chain of events starting from the decreased potential vorticity above the same condensation. Further research is needed to see if this process exists in other bomb cyclones, and if it can be turned into a predictive tool for forecasting."

 Propagations of intraseasonal precipitation are essential for subseasonal prediction of East Asian summer rainbelt. In this study, under the background of the southern China summer rainfall pattern (SCSRP), the intraseasonal northward and southward propagation types are first identified and then their propagation characteristics and influencing factors on the 20–90-day intraseasonal timescale are deeply examined. Results show that the northward propagation type, being primary during the SCSRP in its most cases, features robust northward propagation of anomalous signals in the low-level southwesterly wind, outgoing longwave radiation, and 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) towards the Yangtze River basin. For the southward propagation type, anomalous signals of Z500 with low-level northeasterly wind mainly exhibit a clear southward propagation from the northwest continental area, towards the precipitation anomaly center in southern China. We further reveal that the northward propagation type of intraseasonal precipitation is dynamically related to the first mode of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) that exhibits significant precipitation anomalies over the southern China in its Phases 5 and 8, and to the intraseasonal oscillation in the East Asia-Western North Pacific (EAWNP ISO) that shows significant precipitation anomalies in its Phases 3 and 5. In contrast, the southward propagation type is primarily influenced by the wave trains of anomalous circulation over mid-to-high latitudes."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107797,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究的是深对流云中二次冰晶产生(SIP)过程对云的形成和发展的影响。它使用三维双模式微物理模型DESCAM，模拟了不同SIP机制(Hallett-Mossop过程、冻结液滴破碎和冰晶碰撞破碎)对云中冰晶浓度、粒径分布、云顶高度和降水量的影响。研究发现，SIP过程显著减少了降水量，并降低了云顶高度，这主要是因为SIP增加了较低层次的潜热释放，从而增强了低层对流，抑制了高层对流。该研究主要关注云微物理过程和云动力学，与大气环境遥感技术(如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析)关系不大。,"['cloud microphysics', 'cloud dynamics', 'precipitation', 'ice crystals', 'deep convective cloud', '3D bin microphysics model']",Pierre Grzegorczyk;Wolfram Wobrock;Antoine Canzi;Laurence Niquet;Frédéric Tridon;Céline Planche,Investigating secondary ice production in a deep convective cloud with a 3D bin microphysics model: Part II - Effects on the cloud formation and development,"•Heterogeneous ice nucleation and fragmentation of freezing drops plays a role during formation of the cloud •Hallett-Mossop and ice-ice breakup processes dominate after the cloud formation •The impact of each SIP process on particle size distributions is analyzed by tracking air parcel trajectories •SIP reduces precipitation amount •SIP affects cloud dynamics, leading to a reduction in cloud top height. 
 Secondary ice production (SIP) leads to the formation of new ice particles from preexisting ones. Besides generating ice crystals, SIP can also influence cloud characteristics, including convection, precipitation, and even radiative properties. This study examines the effect of ice crystal formation by Hallett-Mossop, fragmentation of freezing drops, and fragmentation due to ice–ice collision processes in an idealized deep convective cloud observed during the HAIC/HIWC campaign, using the 3D bin microphysics scheme DESCAM. Our results indicate that heterogeneous ice nucleation and fragmentation of freezing drops play a role during the early formation of the cloud while after that, Hallett-Mossop and ice-ice breakup processes dominate, representing 17.6 % and 81.5 % of the ice crystal production, for temperatures warmer than −30°C. For temperatures colder than −30°C, homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation processes are the main contributors to ice crystal formation. The impact of each SIP process on particle size distributions is analyzed by tracking air parcel trajectories. This study also shows the effect of SIP processes on cloud development. Implementing SIP results in a decrease in cloud top altitude by around 1.5 km. Our analysis shows that this effect is caused by increased latent heat released below 11 km, resulting from a stronger vapor deposition on more numerous ice crystals. This enhances convection at lower levels but inhibits it above. Furthermore, incorporating SIP leads to 15 % decrease in total precipitation amount and 25 % reduction of intense rainfall (accumulated precipitation over 40 mm). Hence, our study emphasizes the importance of SIP mechanisms in cloud development and precipitation."

Van Eijk,Turbulent transport of sea-spray in the coastal region,"•Large-eddy simulation of sea-spray dispersion in a complex coastal area. •Dynamics of marine aerosols above sea and land during a diurnal cycle. •Influence of turbulence and stratification of the atmosphere on the vertical dispersion of aerosols. 
 A realistic three-dimensionnal large-eddy simulation is performed for the study of turbulent transport of sea spray aerosol in the coastal region of Le Croisic, France. A new transport model for the aerosol is implemented in the ARPS code. Simulation results are compared with field measurements, both for the mean wind field and aerosol concentration. The numerical results fit well with the observations. The mean vertical concentration profile takes an exponential shape when the data is averaged over sufficiently long timeframe, whereas the 15-min averaged profiles vary and deviate from the theory. The transport of the aerosols is analyzed in relation to the sea-land transition and the changes in thermal stability of the atmosphere during the diurnal cycle. Turbulence is found to play an important role in the mixing of aerosols in the unstable surface layer. The turbulent vertical transport of aerosols is enhanced through convective cells over the land during the day, whereas, at night, aerosols remain trapped near the surface and are transported over appreciable horizontal distances under quasi-neutral or stable thermal conditions."
