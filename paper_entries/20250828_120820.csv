Larson;Vaughan T. J. Phillips,Technical note: General formulation for the distribution problem – prognostic assumed probability density function (PDF) approach based on the maximum-entropy principle and the Liouville equation,"The distribution problems appear in atmospheric sciences at almost every corner when describing diverse processes. This paper presents a general formulation for addressing all these problems. 
 A general formulation for the distribution problem is presented, which is applicable to frequency distributions of subgrid-scale variables and hydrometeor size distributions, as well as to probability distributions characterizing data uncertainties. The general formulation is presented based upon two well-known basic principles: the maximum-entropy principle and the Liouville equation. The maximum-entropy principle defines the most likely general distribution form if necessary constraints are specified. This paper proposes to specify these constraints as the output variables  to be used in a host model. Once a general distribution form is defined, the problem of the temporal evolution of the distribution reduces to that of predicting a small number of parameters characterizing it. This paper derives prognostic equations for these  parameters from the Liouville equation. The developed formulation, which  is  applicable to a wide range  of atmospheric modeling problems, is specifically applied to the condensation growth of cloud droplets as a demonstration."

We use a set of model simulations that realistically simulate QBO and a novel ozone diagnostic tool to separate temperature- and circulation-driven QBO impacts. These are important for diagnosing model–model differences in QBO–ozone responses for climate projections. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in tropical winds perturbs stratospheric ozone throughout much of the atmosphere via changes in transport of ozone and other trace gases, as well as via temperature changes, both of which alter ozone chemistry. Attributing these causes of  QBO–ozone variability may provide insights into model-to-model differences that contribute to ozone simulation. Here we develop a novel metric of steady-state ozone (SSO) to separate these effects: SSO calculates the local steady-state response of ozone due to the changes in temperature, chemical species, and overhead ozone column; the response due to circulation change is presumed when SSO shows no response. It is applied to the nudged Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) with interactive ozone chemistry to demonstrate its validity. The E3SMv2 simulations nudged to reanalysis data produced reasonable wind and ozone patterns, especially in the tropics. Consistent with previous studies, we find clear demarcations with pressure. Ozone perturbations in the upper stratosphere (<6 hPa) are predicted by temperature changes; those between 6 and 20 hPa are predicted by NOy changes, and those in the lower stratosphere show no temperature or NOy response and are presumably driven by circulation changes. These results are important for diagnosing model-to-model discrepancy in QBO–ozone response and enhancing the reliability of ozone projections."

We modified the GEOS-Chem model to simulate the climate change by LACs based on a local emission inventory and explored the impacts of LAC properties and atmospheric variables on the corresponding direct radiative forcings (DRFs) in seven regions of China. The study confirms the warming effect of LACs and deepens our knowledge of their climatic effects. 
 Black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) are the dominant light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols (LACs) that contribute significantly to climate change through absorbing and scattering radiation. We used GEOS-Chem integrated with the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models to estimate LAC properties and direct radiative forcings (DRFs) in China. Primary BrC (Pri-BrC) and secondary BrC (Sec-BrC) were separated from organic carbon and modeled as independent tracers. LAC Chinese anthropogenic emissions and refractive indexes were updated. Additionally, we investigated the impacts of LAC properties and atmospheric variables on LAC DRFs based on principal component analysis. It was shown that BC exerts a warming effect at the top of the atmosphere, while Pri-BrC and Sec-BrC induce a cooling effect. At the surface, they collectively lead to surface cooling, whereas within the atmosphere, they all can contribute to atmospheric heating, with 1.848 ± 1.098, 0.146 ± 0.079 and 0.022 ± 0.008 W m−2, respectively. The atmospheric shortwave DRFs of BC and Pri-BrC were proportional to their corresponding concentrations, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and they were inversely proportional to the single scattering albedo, surface albedo and ozone concentration in most regions. The surface longwave DRFs for the LACs showed negative correlations with water vapor in most areas. The highest atmospheric warming effect of LACs was observed in Central China, followed by East China, owing to the high LAC concentrations, AOD and AAOD as well as the low surface albedo and ozone concentration. This study enhances our understanding of the climatic impacts of LACs."

To address these challenges, urgent global action is needed to monitor the distribution of trace gases and understand their effects on the atmosphere. 
 We examine the variability of diurnal tide (DT), semidiurnal tide (SDT), and terdiurnal tide (TDT) amplitudes in the Arctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) during and after sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events using meteor radar data at three polar-latitude stations, Sodankylä (67.37° N, 26.63° E), Tromsø (69.58° N, 19.22° E), and Svalbard (78.99° N, 15.99° E), as well as one station outside the polar vortex located at Collm (51.3° N, 13° E). By combining tidal amplitude anomalies with trace gas variations, induced by large-scale dynamical changes caused by the breaking of planetary waves, this study provides new observational insights into the variation of ozone and water vapor, transport, and tides at polar latitudes. We use short-wave (QRS) and long-wave (QRL) radiative heating and cooling rates simulated by the WACCM-X(SD) model to investigate the roles of polar ozone and water vapor in driving mesospheric tidal variability during SSWs in the polar regions. Our analysis reveals distinct tidal responses during SSW events. At the onset of SSWs, a significant negative anomaly in TDT amplitudes in zonal and meridional components is observed, with a decrease of 3 m s−1, approximately 25 % change compared to the mean TDT amplitude. Meanwhile, SDT shows a positive anomaly of 10 m s−1, with changes reaching up to 40 %, indicating an enhancement of tidal amplitude in both components. The DT amplitude exhibits a delayed enhancement, with a positive amplitude anomaly of up to 5 m s−1 in the meridional wind component, occurring approximately 20 d after the onset of SSWs. A similar but weaker effect is observed in the zonal wind component, with changes reaching up to 30 % in the zonal component and 50 % in the meridional wind component. We analyzed the contributions of ozone and water vapor to the short-wave heating and long-wave cooling before, during, and after the onset of SSW events. Our findings suggest that the immediate responses of SDT are most likely driven by dynamical effects accompanied by the radiative effects from ozone. Radiative forcing change during SSW likely plays a secondary role in DT changes but appears to be important 20 d after the event, particularly during the spring transition. Water vapor acts as a dynamical tracer in the stratosphere and mesosphere but has minimal radiative forcing, resulting in a negligible impact on tidal changes. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of mesospheric tidal variability in polar regions during sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), examining and linking the significant role of trace gases and radiative effects in modulating tidal dynamics."

Kleeman,Improving the computational efficiency of a source-oriented chemical mechanism for the simultaneous source apportionment of ozone and secondary particulate pollutants,"This paper introduces a novel approach for improving the computational efficiency and scalability of source-oriented chemical mechanisms by simplifying the representation of reactions involving source-tagged species and implementing a source-oriented Euler backward iterative (EBI) solver. These advancements reduce simulation times by up to 74 % while maintaining accuracy, offering significant practical benefits for long-term source apportionment studies. 
 Source-oriented chemical mechanisms enable direct source apportionment of air pollutants by explicitly representing precursor emissions and their reaction products in atmospheric models. These mechanisms use source-tagged species to track emissions and their evolution. However, scalability was previously limited by the large number of reactions required for interactions between two tagged species, such as the NOx–NOx or volatile organic compound (VOC)–NOx reactions. This study improves computational efficiency and scalability with a new method that tracks the total concentration of tagged species, reducing the n2 second-order reactions for n sources into 2n pseudo-first-order reactions. The overall production and removal rate of individual species remain unchanged in the new approach. The number of reactions and number of model species increase linearly with the number of source types, thus greatly improving the computational efficiency. In addition, a source-oriented Euler backward iterative (EBI) solver was implemented to replace the Gear solver used in previous applications of the source-oriented mechanism. The source-oriented EBI solver has been assessed by comparing predicted results with those of the Gear solver. Good agreement between those two methods has been achieved, as the results from the EBI scheme are linearly correlated to Gear and the average of absolute relative error is below 5 %. In the timing assessment, the proposed EBI scheme can effectively reduce the total chemistry time by 73 %–90 % for grids with different resolutions, which leads to a reduction in total simulation time by 46 %–74 %. The proposed source-oriented scheme is efficient enough for practical long-term source apportionment applications on nested domains."

Experiments, conducted in an atmospheric simulation chamber, tested different methods of sampling and analyzing carbonaceous aerosols, with a focus on workplace environments. Results highlight the need to understand the variability in aerosol optical properties for accurate monitoring and health and environmental impact assessments. 
 This study investigates the optical properties and variability of the mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of carbonaceous aerosols produced by the combustion of different fuels. Emissions were also characterized in terms of particle size distribution and concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC). Experiments were conducted in an atmospheric simulation chamber with a soot generator fueled with propane and a commercial diesel engine running on regular diesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). Different methods of sampling and analyzing carbonaceous aerosols were evaluated, focusing on workplace environments. The EC : TC (total carbon) ratios were found to be 0.7 ± 0.1 for propane, 0.15 ± 0.05 for diesel, and 0.4 ± 0.2 for HVO, indicating a higher proportion of OC in the diesel and HVO samples. Fresh soot particles showed monomodal log-normal distributions with peaks varying based on the fuel type and combustion process, with propane particles exhibiting a peak at larger particle sizes compared to HVO and diesel. The optical properties revealed that the MAC values varied across different fuel exhausts. Diesel combustion produced more light-absorbing particles compared to propane and HVO, with MAC values measured between 870 and 635 nm ranging from 6.2 ± 0.5 to 9.4 ± 0.4 m2 g−1 for commercial diesel, 5.2 ± 0.5 to 7.8 ± 1.1 m2 g−1 for propane, and 5.8 ± 0.2 to 8.4 ± 0.6 m2 g−1 for HVO."

Wu;Michelle Badalov;Manisha Ganeshan;Minghua Zheng,A machine-learning-based marine atmosphere boundary layer (MABL) moisture profile retrieval product from GNSS-RO deep refraction signals,"Marine boundary layer (MABL) water vapor is among the key factors to couple the ocean and atmosphere, but it is also among the hardest to retrieve from a satellite remote sensing perspective. Here we propose a novel way to retrieve MABL specific humidity profiles using the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Level-1 signal-to-noise ratio. Using a machine learning approach, we successfully obtained a retrieval product that outperforms the ERA-5 reanalysis and operational Level-2 retrievals globally, except in the deep tropics. 
 Marine atmosphere boundary layer (MABL) water vapor amount and gradient impact global energy transport through directly affecting the sensible and latent heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. Yet, it is a well-known challenge for satellite remote sensing to profile MABL water vapor, especially when cloud or a sharp vertical gradient of water vapor is present. Wu et al. (2022) identified good correlations between the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deep refraction signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) value and the global MABL water vapor specific humidity when the radio occultation (RO) signal is ducted by the moist planetary boundary layer (PBL), and they laid out the underlying physical mechanisms to explain such a correlation. In this work, we apply a machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) technique to demonstrate the feasibility of profile-by-profile MABL water vapor retrieval using the SNR signal. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models are trained using multi-months of global collocated hourly ERA-5 reanalysis and COSMIC-1, Metop-A, and Metop-B 1 Hz SNR observations between 975–850 hPa with 25 hPa vertical resolution. The COSMIC-1 ML model is then applied to both COSMIC-1 and COSMIC-2 in other time ranges for independent retrieval and validation. The Monte Carlo Dropout method was employed for the uncertainty estimation. Comparison against multiple field campaign radiosonde/dropsonde observations globally suggests that SNR-ML-method-retrieved water vapor consistently outperforms the wetPrf/wetPf2 standard retrieval product at all six pressure levels between 975 and 850 hPa and either outperforms or achieves similar performance against ERA-5, indicating real and useful information is gained from the SNR signal, though training was performed against the reanalysis. The climatology and diurnal cycle of MABL structure constructed from the SNR-ML technique are studied and compared to the reanalysis. Disparities of climatology suggest ERA-5 may systematically produce dry biases at high latitudes and wet biases in marine stratocumulus regions. The diurnal cycle amplitudes are too weak and sometimes off phase in ERA-5, especially in the Arctic and stratocumulus regions. These areas are particularly prone to PBL processes, where this GNSS SNR-ML water vapor product may contribute the most."

The absorption of solar energy by aerosols induces warming, altering the cloud dynamics. We developed an approach that combines polarimeter and lidar to quantify this. This methodology is assessed during the AEROCLO-sA (AErosol RadiatiOn and CLOud in Southern Africa) campaign. To validate it, we used irradiance measurements acquired during aircraft spiral descents. A major perspective is the generalization of this method to the global level. 
 Aerosols have important effects on both local and global climate, as well as on clouds and precipitations. We present original results derived from the airborne observations acquired from the AErosol RadiatiOn and CLOud in Southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) field campaign led in Namibia in August and September 2017. In order to quantify the aerosols' radiative impact on the Namibian regional radiative budget, we use an innovative approach that combines the OSIRIS polarimeter, an airborne prototype of the future 3MI polarimeter of ESA, and lidar data to derive the heating rate of the aerosols. To calculate this parameter we use a radiative transfer code, meteorological parameters provided by dropsondes, and OSIRIS-retrieved aerosol optical thickness, size, and absorption above clouds. This approach is evaluated during massive transports of biomass-burning particles above clouds. We present vertical profiles of heating rates computed in the solar and thermal parts of the spectrum. Our results indicate strong positive heating rate values retrieved above clouds due to aerosols, between +2 and +5 K per day (vertically averaged). Within the smoke layer, water vapor's cooling effect through infrared radiation generally balances its warming effect from solar radiation. At the top of the layer, a stronger cooling effect of −1.5 K d−1  often dominates due to water vapor. In order to validate this methodology, we use irradiance measurements acquired by aircraft during spiral descent during dedicated parts of their flights, which provides direct measurements of irradiance distribution and heating rates as functions of the altitude. Despite the challenges posed by cloud horizontal variability observed during the spiral descent, simulated and measured results generally agree in most cases. Finally, we discuss the possibility of applying this method to available and future spaceborne passive and active sensors."

 The Rock Glacier Inventories and Kinematics (RGIK) community has defined standards for generating Rock Glacier Inventories (RoGIs). In the framework of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Permafrost (ESA CCI Permafrost), we set up a multi-operator mapping exercise in 12 areas around the world. Each RoGI team was composed of 5 to 10 operators, involving 41 persons in total. Each operator performed similar steps following the RGIK guidelines (RGIK, 2023a) and using a similar QGIS tool.

It is based on satellite data on ocean winds, ice movement, and sea surface height. Sensitivity analyses address uncertainties, including variations in sea level products and ice–water drag. The dataset's accuracy is validated against in situ measurements, showing moderate to good agreement on monthly and longer timescales. 
 Ocean-surface stress is a critical driver of polar sea-ice dynamics, air–sea interactions, and ocean circulation. This work provides a daily analysis of ocean-surface stress on 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) grids across the ice-free and ice-covered regions of the polar oceans (2011–2021 for the Arctic, 2013–2021 for the Antarctic), covering latitudes north of 60° N in the Arctic and south of 50° S in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean. Ocean-surface stress is calculated using a bulk parameterization approach that combines ocean-surface winds, ice motion vectors, and sea surface height (SSH) data from multiple satellite platforms. The analysis captures significant spatial and temporal variability in ocean-surface wind stress and the resultant wind-driven Ekman transport, while providing enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. Two sensitivity analyses are conducted to address key sources of uncertainty. The first addresses the fine-scale variability in SSH fields, which was mitigated using a 150 km Gaussian filter to smooth 3 d SSH datasets and enhance compatibility with the other monthly product, followed by linear interpolation to achieve daily resolution. The second investigates uncertainty in the ice–water drag coefficient, which revealed that variations in the coefficient have a proportional influence on the computed ocean-surface stress under the tested conditions. These uncertainties are most pronounced during winter, with median values reaching 20 % in the Arctic and 40 % in the Southern Ocean. Validation efforts using ice-tethered profiler velocity records revealed weak to moderate correlations with satellite-derived stress (r= 0.4–0.8) between observed surface velocities and satellite-derived estimates (Ekman + geostrophic) at daily resolution, with significantly improved agreement when averaged to weekly means.

We have created a new database of observational seawater isotope data that is rich in metadata, publicly accessible, and machine readable to increase its availability and usability for a variety of Earth Science applications. 
 The stable isotope values of seawater (δ18O and δ2H) provide valuable information on the exchange of water between the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere and on ocean mixing processes. As such, observational seawater δ18O and δ2H data place powerful constraints on hydrologic changes in the modern ocean. Seawater δ18O data are also essential for calibrating paleoclimate proxies based on the δ18O of marine carbonates and are an increasingly critical diagnostic tool for assessing model performance and skill in isotope-enabled global climate models.

To improve the accessibility of seawater δ18O data for the Earth Science research community, the Past Global Changes (PAGES) CoralHydro2k project has created a new, machine-readable, and metadata-rich database of observational seawater δ18O data, paired with seawater δ2H and salinity data, that is compliant with findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) standards for digital assets. The data has been collected from public databases and repositories, direct researcher data submissions, scientific papers, and student theses. In total, the PAGES CoralHydro2k Seawater δ18O Database contains over 18,600 data points with extensive metadata that makes the database suitable for a myriad of research applications. For hidden data, we searched for and included all datasets within the global ocean. For public data, our data collation efforts were focused on the upper 50 m from 35° N to 35° S (to aid in CoralHydro2k’s seawater δ18O reconstruction studies using δ18O and Sr/Ca in tropical-subtropical coral skeletons). We also provide a set of best practices to the community for reporting seawater isotope data in the future."

By applying advanced machine learning techniques inspired by large language models, we developed a system that generates accurate and realistic weather predictions. We trained the model using 6 years of radar data from northern Italy, demonstrating its superior performance over leading ensemble extrapolation methods. 
 This work introduces GPTCast, a generative deep learning method for ensemble nowcasting of radar-based precipitation, inspired by advancements in large language models (LLMs). We employ a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model as a forecaster to learn spatiotemporal precipitation dynamics using tokenized radar images. The tokenizer is based on a Variational Quantized Autoencoder (VQGAN) featuring a novel reconstruction loss tailored for the skewed distribution of precipitation that promotes faithful reconstruction of high rainfall rates. This approach produces realistic ensemble forecasts and provides probabilistic outputs with accurate uncertainty estimation. The core architecture operates deterministically during the forward pass; ensemble variability arises from sampling the categorical probability distribution predicted by the forecaster during inference, rather than requiring external random inputs such as noise injection common in other generative models. All forecast variability is thus learned solely from the data distribution. We train and test GPTCast using a 6-year radar dataset over the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy, showing superior results compared to state-of-the-art ensemble extrapolation methods."

Combined with a numerical air pollution transport and chemistry model, it can follow the contributions from a large number of emission sources. The result is a series of maps that give the relative contributions from, for example, all European countries at any point on the map. 
 This paper presents an extension of the original Local Fraction methodology to allow  the tracking of the sensitivity of chemically active air pollutants to emission sources. The generalized Local Fractions are defined as the linear sensitivities of chemical species to source emission changes, as propagated through the full set of non-linear chemical transformations. The method allows us to simultaneously track sensitivities from hundreds of sources (typically countries or emission sectors) in a single simulation. The current work describes how the non-linear chemical transformations are taken into account in a rigorous manner while validating the implementation of the method in the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) Meteorological Synthesizing Centre – West (MSC-W) chemistry-transport model by examples. While effectively producing the same results as a direct “brute-force” method, where the impact of emission reductions in each source has to be computed in a separate scenario simulation, the generalized Local Fractions are an order of magnitude more computationally efficient when large numbers of scenarios are considered."

Comparisons with the fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and observational data indicate that iAMAS performs well in simulating the Antarctic atmosphere. 
 Regular latitude-longitude grids in global simulations encounter polar singularities in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In contrast, unstructured meshes have the potential to overcome this issue; however, so far, the performance of unstructured meshes in polar areas has barely been investigated. This study investigates the efficacy of unstructured meshes over Antarctica using the integrated Atmospheric Model Across Scales (iAMAS, v1.0) with multi-source observations. Four mesh configurations of the iAMAS model were assessed, varying in resolution (120, 60, 16, and 4 km) over the Antarctic region. The study evaluates the performance of the iAMAS simulation for both the surface layer and the upper meteorological fields (temperature, pressure, specific humidity, and wind speed), comparing simulations with data from the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) and measurements from automatic weather stations and radiosondes. The results indicate that the iAMAS model does not exhibit the polar singularity issue observed in ERA5, where the ERA5 with regular latitude-longitude grids significantly underestimates wind speeds at the polar grid center. In the relatively flat region of East Antarctica, all four iAMAS experiments at various resolutions demonstrate comparable and even superior performance in simulating temperature and wind speed compared to ERA5. In regions with complex terrain, such as near the Transantarctic Mountains, the iAMAS model (particularly at coarse grid resolutions like 120 km) exhibits a cold bias and stronger wind speeds, consistent with biases identified in other Antarctic simulations using regional models. In particular, mesh refinement at 4 km in complex terrains significantly enhances iAMAS's accuracy in simulating the meteorological fields for both the surface layer and upper atmosphere, suggesting that a grid resolution of 4 km (or even higher) is optimal in such regions. In contrast, in flatter areas, such as the high East Antarctic Plateau, increases in grid resolution yield minimal improvements in simulation accuracy, and a 60 km grid resolution appears sufficient."

However, the mechanisms by which the intruded soil microbes mediate the turnover of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in waters are unknown. Here, we prepared bacterial and phage-enriched inocula from the northern high-humic-composition (NHHS) and southern low-humic-composition (SLHS) soils in China, and investigated their roles in aquatic DOM transformation via microcosm experiments. The aquatic DOM was more rapidly degraded by the soil-derived microbes than the aquatic microbes. However, associated with the soil regions, phage-enriched inocula caused two different molecular transformation patterns. Unlike the NHHS soils, phage-enriched fractions from the SLHS soils can enhance the bacterial decomposition of DOM (especially many aromatic CHO and S-containing compounds), while inhibiting the accumulation of few aliphatic molecules with O/C < 0.5 and H/C > 1. Additionally, the potential effects of soil virus-enriched fractions on the microbial degradation of aquatic DOM can be largely predicted by the organic composition in soils. Our findings demonstrate the divergent and environment-associated roles of different soil microbial fractions in aquatic carbon cycling, which provide new insights into the biogeochemical consequences of soil microbiome transfer in the land-water continuum."

However, product diversification from syngas using pure cultures of these microorganisms remains a challenge. Here, we present a synthetic microbial community comprising the acetogen Acetobacterium wieringae JM, the propionigenic bacterium Anaerotignum neopropionicum and the chain elongator Clostridium kluyveri, which collectively produce odd- and even-chain carboxylic acids and higher alcohols from CO/CO2. In batch bioreactors, metabolite cross-feeding within the community enabled the production of valerate (0.61 g L–1) and pentanol (0.33 g L–1), which are rare products in CO-fermenting systems. Chemostat experiments showed a metabolic shift induced in the acetogen by the ethanol-consuming species. Furthermore, construction of the genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of A. wieringae JM and a community model of the triculture allowed us to predict the performance of the culture in continuous (steady-state) process. Simulations using flux balance analysis predicted a feasible triculture with A. wieringae JM dominating the community, and provided insights into the effect of H2 supplementation on the product spectrum.

Past ISCO column studies have mostly selected oxidant dose based on results from batch experiments, without considering mass transfer phenomena and have not thoroughly evaluated the byproducts. We selected peroxydisulfate (PDS) doses based on the second Damköhler (DaII) number and performed extensive monitoring of byproduct formation during heat-activated PDS treatment of toluene NAPL emplaced in sand columns. Toluene was removed by both oxidation as well as dissolution. The PDS utilization efficiency was lower for 50 mM PDS (DaII ≥ 1) columns than the 5 mM (DaII ≪1) columns. Toluene removal and formation/disappearance of its primary intermediate “benzaldehyde” were much higher in high PDS columns, which resulted in greater accumulation of secondary reaction products including precipitates that were observed visually and microscopically. Targeted/nontargeted GC–MS and LC-HR-MS analyses of effluents detected many CxHy, CxHyOz, and SwCxHyOz (organo-sulfur) compounds.

This study evaluates AF3′s performance in predicting protein–PFAS interactions using a curated data set from the Protein Data Bank, divided into a “Before Set” (seen during AF3 training) and an “After Set” (unseen). AF3 accurately predicts protein structures and pockets but shows reduced performance in pocket-aligned ligand predictions, achieving ∼74.5% success in “Before Set” but only ∼55.8% in “After Set”, indicative of possible overfitting. We further assess the effects of PFAS type on docking outcomes. Although AF3 accurately predicts binding pockets, it favors poses where the headgroup of environment-relevant PFAS interacts with polar or positively charged residues. This is different from another native binding mode in several cases, where the hydrophobic tail is inserted in the protein, but the headgroup is exposed to the solvent. Notably, a hybrid approach combining AF3 and Vina, especially considering multiple top-ranked poses, can improve prediction accuracy. These findings support the complementary use of AF3 and Vina for accurately modeling protein–PFAS interactions."

In this study, we demonstrate a less recognized  pathway that leads to LEVO degradation in BBOA particles under light, which is primarily driven by triplet excited states (3BBOA*) via hydrogen transfer in photosensitization reactions. Unlike •OH oxidation that relies on mass transfer of oxidants from the gas phase, 3BBOA* oxidation remains effective in viscous particles at low RH and accounts for ∼50% of LEVO decay, shortening its chemical lifetime in previous estimates by a half  to ∼1.8 days.

Combined with discrete phase model (DPM) simulations, the work reveals how cross-flow velocity and transmembrane pressure modulate early fouling behavior. Higher velocity (10 mL/s) significantly mitigated foulant accumulation, stabilizing the surface concentration at 28.9 ± 0.22 mg/L and reducing the fouling layer thickness to 5.8 ± 0.76 μm.

However, the architecture of predatory arthropod trophic interactions was simplified in response to synergisms between the pyrethroid and fungicides. Synergisms may act through multiple potential mechanisms to impact food web structure.

Upon contact with oversaturated silicic acid, the rate of silica polymerization on amine-terminated surfaces is nearly 6 times higher than that on carboxyl-, hydroxyl-, or methyl-SAMs. Silica polymerization on the surface of RO membranes over extended periods spontaneously transitions from a moderate to an accelerated regime, which corresponds to a structural transformation in silica scaling from the isotropic growth of aggregated particles to a gel-like glassy layer. Additionally, the presence of calcium ions in solutions significantly promotes silica scaling on membrane surfaces along with an increase in the viscoelastic properties of the formed scale layer.

We first compare model predictions from two macroscopic mixed-surfactant partitioning schemes, the multicomponent Eberhart model and the ideal mixture of homologues model. We then pair these models with size-dependent partitioning models, which take into account the droplet’s surface-area-to-volume ratio. Additionally, we tested the applicability of treating a complex mixture with a surrogate surfactant or an effective Langmuir isotherm for the prediction of ambient aerosol surface tension.

However, the metabolic response to the second hit of a high-fat diet (HFD) (prenatal PM2.5 exposure as the first hit) in adult offspring and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a whole-body inhalational exposure system, we achieved the following observations. First, prenatal PM2.5 exposure significantly increased the fat mass, inhibited the insulin signaling pathway in chow diet (CD)-fed offspring, and exacerbated HFD-induced metabolic disorders evidenced by impaired insulin signaling in metabolic organs like liver, epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Second, prenatal PM2.5 exposure enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation and hypertrophy of adipocytes in eWAT and BAT, accompanied by lipid metabolic disorders in the liver and eWAT. Finally, prenatal exposure to PM2.5 exaggerated HFD-induced cellular senescence in both hepatic and eWAT, as well as cell cycle arrest in BAT, which ultimately led to the activation of chronic inflammation in offspring. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to PM2.5 increased the vulnerability to the second hit of HFD feeding in  adult offspring, in which chronic inflammation triggered by cellular senescence may be involved. These findings underscore the heightened vulnerability to metabolic diseases in individuals following early life exposure to air pollution, particularly in the setting of compounding with a high-fat dietary pattern."

While multi‐year La Niña events often greatly enhance the volume transport of the ITF, the 2020–2023 La Niña caused only a modest increase in the ITF via Makassar Strait—0.3 Sv above the climatology of 12 Sv. Dominated by the 0–400 m velocity variations, the relatively weak transport is attributed to a milder Pacific easterly wind due to a weaker La Niña intensity.

However, future projections of lightning are uncertain since lightning is not directly simulated by most global climate models. To address this issue, we use convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based parameterizations of daily June‐September CG lightning. CNN parameterizations of daily CG lightning occurrence at each grid cell use fields of three thermodynamic variables—ratio of surface Moist Static Energy (MSE) to 500 hPa saturation MSE, 700–500 hPa lapse rate, and 500 hPa relative humidity. Applying these parameterizations to the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble, we find widespread increases in CG lightning days across much of the region by the mid‐21st century (2031–2060) under a moderate warming scenario. Projected increases are pronounced in the northern WUS where many grid cells experience 4–12 additional CG lightning days compared to 1995–2022 and are driven by increases in all three thermodynamic variables. To assess the risk of lightning‐ignited wildfire (LIW) ignition, we also quantify the concurrence of CG lightning with high Fire Weather Index (FWI) days. By 2031–2060, CG lightning will coincide more frequently with high FWI, but the magnitude of increases relative to CG lightning days varies across the region. Future projections of CG lightning and LIW risk can be useful for understanding the changing risks of associated hazards, and guide wildland fire management and suppression planning."

 The forthcoming sixth-generation and beyond wireless networks are poised to operate across an expansive frequency range—from microwave, millimetre wave to terahertz bands—to support ubiquitous connectivity in diverse application scenarios1–3. This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management4. However, existing electrical or photonic-assisted solutions face a lot of challenges in meeting this demand because of the limited bandwidths of the devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of system architectures5. Here we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless system. Leveraging the Pockels effect and scalability of the TFLN platform, we achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including baseband modulation, broadband wireless–photonic conversion and reconfigurable carrier and local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high-frequency stability and consistent coherence. Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we realize full-link wireless communication across nine consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a crucial ability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum environments.

 To orchestrate ribosomal peptide synthesis, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) must be aminoacylated, with activated amino acids, at their 2′,3′-diol moiety1,2, and so the selective aminoacylation of RNA in water is a key challenge that must be resolved to explain the origin of protein biosynthesis. So far, there have been no chemical methods to effectively and selectively aminoacylate RNA-2′,3′-diols with the breadth of proteinogenic amino acids in water3–5. Here we demonstrate that (biological) aminoacyl-thiols (1) react selectively with RNA diols over amine nucleophiles, promoting aminoacylation over adventitious (non-coded) peptide bond formation. Broad side-chain scope is demonstrated, including Ala, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser and Val, and Arg aminoacylation is enhanced by unprecedented side-chain nucleophilic catalysis. Duplex formation directs chemoselective 2′,3′-aminoacylation of RNA. We demonstrate that prebiotic nitriles, N-carboxyanhydrides and amino acid anhydrides, as well as biological aminoacyl-adenylates, all react with thiols (including coenzymes A and M) to selectively yield aminoacyl-thiols (1) in water. Finally, we demonstrate that the switch from thioester to thioacid activation inverts diol/amine selectivity, promoting peptide synthesis in excellent yield. Two-step, one-pot, chemically controlled formation of peptidyl-RNA is observed in water at neutral pH. Our results indicate an important role for thiol cofactors in RNA aminoacylation before the evolution of proteinaceous synthetase enzymes.

 Large urban gullies cause damage in many tropical cities across the Global South1,2. They can result from inappropriate urban planning and insufficient infrastructure to safely store and evacuate rainfall in environments that are already highly sensitive to soil erosion1,3,4. Although they can cause large destruction and societal impacts such as population displacement1,2,5, the magnitude of this geo-hydrological hazard remains poorly documented and understood6,7. Here we provide an assessment of the extent and impact of urban gullies at the scale of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Through mapping, we identify 2,922 urban gullies across 26 cities. By combining their formation and growth rates with population density data8, we estimate that around 118,600 people (uncertainty range: ± 44,400 people) have been displaced by urban gullies over the period 2004–2023. We find that average displacement rates increased from about 4,650 persons yr−1 (pre-2020) to about 12,200 persons yr−1 (post-2020). Between 2010 and 2023, the number of people living in the potential expansion zone of urban gullies doubled from 1.6 (±0.6) to 3.2 (±1.3) million, with more likely to be exposed due to urban sprawl9,10 and climate change11.

 To cope in uncertain environments, animals must balance their actions between using current resources and searching for new ones1. This exploration–exploitation dilemma has been studied extensively in paradigms involving positive outcomes, and neural correlates have been identified in frontal cortices and subcortical structures2–11, including the amygdala12. Importantly, exploration is just as essential for survival or well-being when trying to avoid negative outcomes, yet we do not know whether the single-neuron mechanisms that drive exploration are shared across positive and negative environments. Here we examined the dynamics of exploration when human participants engaged in a probabilistic learning task with intermixed loss and gain trials, while simultaneously recording single-neuron activity. We show that neurons of the amygdala and temporal cortex modulate their activity before a decision to explore in both loss and gain. Moreover, we find that humans exhibit more exploration when trying to avoid losses, and that an increase in the levels of noise in amygdala neurons contributes to this behaviour. Overall, we report that human exploration is driven by two distinct neural mechanisms, a valence-independent rate signal and a valence-dependent global noise signal. The results suggest a link between the heightened amygdala activity observed in mood disorders13,14 and higher exploration rates15–17 that underlie maladaptive and even pathological behaviours.

 Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the primary target of the partial agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive constituent of marijuana1. Here we report two agonist-bound crystal structures of human CB1 in complex with a tetrahydrocannabinol (AM11542) and a hexahydrocannabinol (AM841). The two CB1–agonist complexes reveal important conformational changes in the overall structure relative to the antagonist-bound state2, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and an increase in the surface area of the G protein-binding region. Furthermore, a twin toggle switch of Phe2003.36 and Trp3566.48 (where the superscripts denote Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering3) is experimentally observed and seems to be essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into the activation mechanism of CB1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the binding modes of Δ9-THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The plasticity of the binding pocket of CB1 seems to be a common feature among certain class A G protein-coupled receptors. These findings should inspire the design of chemically diverse ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.

 Prenatal stress (PS) is a repeated exposure to aversive situations during pregnancy, including high emotional strain, which is suspected to affect homeostatic systems in infants. Paediatric eczema develops quickly after birth at flexural sites subjected to continuous mechanical constraints1,2. Although epidemiological studies have suggested an association between PS and a higher risk of eczema in children3–6, no causative biological link has yet been identified. Here we show that eczema at birth originates from molecular dysregulations of neuroimmune circuits in utero, triggered by fluctuations in the maternal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. We found that offspring of stressed pregnant dams have dysregulated mast cells and skin-projecting neurons and quickly develop eczema in response to harmless mechanical friction. We demonstrated that PS transiently modulates amniotic fluid corticosterone concentrations, which directly alters the activation program of skin mast cells expressing the glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 and the adjacent sensory neurons conveying mechanosensation. Therapeutic normalization of maternal corticosterone concentrations or genetic depletion of Mcpt5+ mast cells during stressed gestation prevents fetal immune dysregulation and protects against eczema development after birth. Our findings support a new model in which early-onset paediatric eczema originates from dysregulations in the fetal immune system, caused by fluctuations in maternal glucocorticoids induced by stress. Prenatal stress triggers molecular dysregulations in fetal neuroimmune circuits, leading to altered mast cell and sensory neuron function, which predisposes offspring to develop eczema in response to otherwise harmless mechanical friction after birth."

Here we demonstrate an electrically driven perovskite laser, constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED (PeLED) sub-unit. Under pulsed electrical excitation, the dual-cavity perovskite device shows a minimum lasing threshold of 92 A cm−2 (average threshold: 129 A cm−2, at about 22 °C, in air), which is an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art electrically driven organic lasers9,10. Key to this demonstration is the integrated dual-cavity device architecture, which allows the microcavity PeLED sub-unit to deliver directional emission into the single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit (at a coupling efficiency of about 82.7%) to establish the lasing action. An operational half-life (T50) of 1.8 h (6.4 × 104 voltage pulses at 10 Hz) is achieved, outperforming the stability of electrically pumped organic lasers9,10. The dual-cavity perovskite laser can be rapidly modulated at a bandwidth of 36.2 MHz, indicating its potential for data transmission and computational applications. An electrically driven perovskite laser is constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED sub-unit."

White,Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,"Mechanical confinement of cancer cells at the tumour–microenvironment interface induces phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling by HMGB2, leading to a more invasive and drug-resistant state in melanoma. 
 Phenotype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes: proliferative versus invasive states1,2. Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma. Mechanical confinement of cancer cells at the tumour–microenvironment interface induces phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling by HMGB2, leading to a more invasive and drug-resistant state in melanoma."

 The medial prefrontal cortex (MPF) regulates autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stress1,2 and coordinates goal-directed behaviours such as attention, decision-making and social interactions3–8. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear due to incomplete circuit-level MPF characterization7. Here, using integrated neuroanatomical, physiological and behavioural approaches, we construct a comprehensive wiring diagram of the MPF, focused on the dorsal peduncular area (DP)—a poorly understood prefrontal area. We identify its deep (DPd) and superficial (DPs) layers, along with the infralimbic area, as major components of the visceromotor cortex that directly project to hypothalamic and brainstem structures to govern neuroendocrine, sympathetic and parasympathetic output. Notably, the DP functions as a network hub integrating diverse cortical inputs and modulating goal-directed behaviour through a largely unidirectional cortical information flow. On the basis of the mesoscale MPF connectome, we propose a unified network model in which distinct MPF areas orchestrate physiological and behavioural responses to internal and external stimuli.

 Protein–protein interactions are at the core of all key biological processes. However, the complexity of the structural features that determine protein–protein interactions makes their design challenging.

BindCraft leverages the weights of AlphaFold2 (ref. 1) to generate binders with nanomolar affinity without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR–Cas9. We showcase the functional and therapeutic potential of designed binders by reducing IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples, modulating Cas9 gene editing activity and reducing the cytotoxicity of a foodborne bacterial enterotoxin. Last, we use cell-surface-receptor-specific binders to redirect adeno-associated virus capsids for targeted gene delivery.

 Symmetry-protected topological phases1–4 cannot be described by any local order parameter and are beyond the conventional symmetry-breaking model5. They are characterized by topological boundary modes that remain stable under symmetry respecting perturbations1–4,6–8. In clean, gapped systems without disorder, the stability of these edge modes is restricted to the zero-temperature manifold; at finite temperatures, interactions with mobile thermal excitations lead to their decay9–11. Here we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge mode12–14, which is protected by emergent symmetries and persists across the entire spectrum, in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. Through digital quantum simulation of a one-dimensional disorder-free stabilizer Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles for a wide range of initial states. We show that the interaction between these edge modes and bulk excitations can be suppressed by dimerizing the stabilizer strength, leading to an emergent U(1) × U(1) symmetry in the prethermal regime of the system. Furthermore, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence, despite the system being disorder-free and at finite temperature. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach15–18 to experimentally study topological matter at finite temperature and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived, robust boundary qubits in disorder-free systems.

 Microorganisms have driven Earth’s sulfur cycle since the emergence of life1–6, yet the sulfur-cycling capacities of microorganisms and their integration with other element cycles remain incompletely understood. One such uncharacterized metabolism is the coupling of sulfide oxidation with iron(iii) oxide reduction, a ubiquitous environmental process hitherto considered to be strictly abiotic7,8. Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of sulfur metabolism across prokaryotes, and reveal bacteria that are capable of oxidizing sulfide using extracellular solid phase iron(iii). Based on a phylogenetic framework of over hundred genes involved in dissimilatory transformation of sulfur compounds, we recorded sulfur-cycling capacity in most bacterial and archaeal phyla. Metabolic reconstructions predicted co-occurrence of sulfur compound oxidation and iron(iii) oxide respiration in diverse members of 37 prokaryotic phyla. Physiological and transcriptomic evidence demonstrated that a cultivated representative, Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus, grows autotrophically by oxidizing dissolved sulfide or iron monosulfide (FeS) to sulfate with ferrihydrite as an extracellular iron(iii) electron acceptor. The biological process outpaced the abiotic process at environmentally relevant sulfide concentrations. These findings expand the known diversity of sulfur-cycling microorganisms and unveil a biological mechanism that links sulfur and iron cycling in anoxic environments, thus highlighting the fundamental role of microorganisms in global element cycles.

 Many chirality-sensitive light–matter interactions are governed by chiral electron dynamics. Therefore, the development of advanced technologies making use of chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and controlling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond timescales. Such endeavours have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized circularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been overcome1,2. Here we introduce chiroptical spectroscopy with attosecond pulses and demonstrate attosecond coherent control over photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD)3,4, as well as the measurement of chiral asymmetries in the forward–backward and angle-resolved photoionization delays of chiral molecules. We show that co-rotating attosecond and near-infrared (IR) pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign compared with single-photon ionization. We demonstrate that chiral photoionization delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of photoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring 3D momentum resolution. We measure forward–backward chiral-sensitive delays of up to 60 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionization delays of up to 240 as, which include an asymmetry of about 60 as originating from chirality in the continuum–continuum transitions. Attosecond chiroptical spectroscopy opens the door to quantitatively understanding and controlling the dynamics of chiral molecules on the electronic timescale.

 Terrestrial plant communities show great variation in their annual rhythms of growth, or seasonal phenology1,2. The geographical patterns resulting from this variation, known as land surface phenology (LSP)3, contain valuable information for the study of ecosystem function4,5, plant ecophysiology6–8, landscape ecology9,10 and evolutionary biogeography11–13. Yet globally consistent LSP mapping has been hampered by methods that struggle to represent the full range of seasonal phenologies occurring across terrestrial biomes14, especially the subtle and complex phenologies of many arid and tropical ecosystems1,15,16. Here, using a data-driven analysis of satellite imagery to map LSP worldwide, we provide insights into Earth’s phenological diversity, documenting both intercontinental convergence between similar climates and regional heterogeneity associated with topoclimate, ecohydrology and vegetation structure. We then map spatial phenological asynchrony and the modes of asynchronous seasonality that control it, identifying hotspots of asynchrony in tropical mountains and Mediterranean climate regions and reporting evidence for the hypothesis that climatically similar sites exhibit greater phenological asynchrony within the tropics. Finally, we find that our global LSP map predicts complex geographical discontinuities in flowering phenology, genetic divergence and even harvest seasonality across a range of taxa, establishing remote sensing as a crucial tool for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of allochrony by allopatry.

 Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in specialized microenvironments, referred to as niches, and the classical model suggests that HSC numbers are predominantly determined by the niche size1–5. However, the vast excess of niche cells relative to HSCs challenges this perspective. To rigorously define the role of niche size in regulating HSC numbers, we developed a femur-transplantation system, enabling us to increase available HSC niches. Notably, the addition of niches did not alter the total HSC numbers in the body, suggesting the presence of a systemic mechanism that limits HSC numbers. Additionally, HSC numbers in transplanted wild-type femurs did not exceed physiological levels when HSCs were mobilized from defective endogenous niches to the periphery, indicating that HSC numbers are constrained at the local level as well. The notion of dual restrictions at systemic and local levels was further supported by other experimental approaches, including parabiosis and non-conditioned transfer of HSCs after bone transplantation. Moreover, we found that thrombopoietin has a pivotal role in determining the total number of HSCs in the body, even in the context of increased niche availability. Our study redefines key principles underlying HSC number regulation, providing insights into this critical biological process.

 The mechanical properties of metallic materials often degrade under harsh cryogenic conditions, posing challenges for low-temperature infrastructures1. Here we introduce a dual-scale atomic-ordering nanostructure, characterized by an exceptionally high number density of co-existing subnanoscale short-range ordering (approximately 2.4 × 1026 m−3) and nanoscale long-range ordering (approximately 4.5 × 1025 m−3) domains, within a metallic solid-solution matrix in a CoNiV-based alloy to improve the synergy of strength and ductility at low temperatures. We observe an ordering-induced increase in dislocation shear stress as well as a more rapid dislocation multiplication owing to the dislocation blocking effect of nanoscale long-range ordering and the associated generation of new dislocations. The latter effect also releases stress concentrations at nanoscale long-range-ordered obstacles that otherwise would promote damage initiation and failure. Consequently, the alloy shows a strength–elongation product of 76 GPa % with a yield strength of approximately 1.2 GPa at 87 K, outperforming materials devoid of such ordering hierarchy, containing only short-range ordered or coherent precipitates of a few tens of nanometres. Our results highlight the impact of dual co-existing chemical ordering on the mechanical properties of complex alloys and offer guidelines to control these ordering states to enhance their mechanical performance for cryogenic applications.

 Our knowledge of the brain processes that govern vision is largely derived from studying primates, whose hierarchically organized visual system1 inspired the architecture of deep neural networks2. This raises questions about the universality of such hierarchical structures. Here we examined the large-scale functional organization for vision in one of the closest living relatives to primates, the tree shrew. We performed Neuropixels recordings3,4 across many cortical and thalamic areas spanning the tree shrew ventral visual system while presenting a large battery of visual stimuli in awake tree shrews. We found that receptive field size, response latency and selectivity for naturalistic textures, compared with spectrally matched noise5, all increased moving anteriorly along the tree shrew visual pathway, consistent with a primate-like hierarchical organization6,7. However, tree shrew area V2 already harboured a high-level representation of complex objects. First, V2 encoded a complete representation of a high-level object space8. Second, V2 activity supported the most accurate object decoding and reconstruction among all tree shrew visual areas. In fact, object decoding accuracy from tree shrew V2 was comparable to that in macaque posterior IT and substantially higher than that in macaque V2. Finally, starting in V2, we found strongly face-selective cells resembling those reported in macaque inferotemporal cortex9. Overall, these findings show how core computational principles of visual form processing found in primates are conserved, yet hierarchically compressed, in a small but highly visual mammal.

 Chemical feedback is ubiquitous in physiology but is challenging to study without perturbing basal functions. One example is addictive drugs, which elicit a positive-feedback cycle of drug-seeking and ingestion by acting on the brain to increase dopamine signalling1–3. However, interfering with this process by altering basal dopamine also adversely affects learning, movement, attention and wakefulness4. Here, inspired by physiological control systems, we developed a highly selective synthetic physiology approach to interfere with the positive-feedback cycle of addiction by installing a cocaine-dependent opposing signalling process into this body–brain signalling loop. We used protein engineering to create cocaine-gated ion channels that are selective for cocaine over other drugs and endogenous molecules. Expression of an excitatory cocaine-gated channel in the rat lateral habenula, a brain region that is normally inhibited by cocaine, suppressed cocaine self-administration without affecting food motivation. This artificial cocaine-activated chemogenetic process reduced the cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine rise in the nucleus accumbens. Our results show that cocaine chemogenetics is a selective approach for countering drug reinforcement by clamping dopamine release in the presence of cocaine. In the future, chemogenetic receptors could be developed for additional addictive drugs or hormones and metabolites, which would facilitate efforts to probe their neural circuit mechanisms using a synthetic physiology approach. As these chemogenetic ion channels are specific for cocaine over natural rewards, they may also offer a route towards gene therapies for cocaine addiction. Cocaine chemogenetics in rats is a selective approach for countering drug reinforcement by clamping dopamine release in the presence of cocaine."

 Generative models cover various application areas, including image and video synthesis, natural language processing and molecular design, among many others1–11. As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge12–14. Here we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models4, where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create images never seen before following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of the images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multicolour images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, human faces and artworks, following the data distributions of MNIST15, Fashion-MNIST16, Butterflies-10017, Celeb-A datasets18, and Van Gogh’s paintings and drawings19, respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural-network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate images of handwritten digits and fashion products. In addition, we generated Van Gogh-style artworks using both monochrome and multiwavelength illumination. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient and scalable inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial-intelligence-generated content. Optical generative models are demonstrated for the rapid and power-efficient creation of never-seen-before images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, human faces and Van Gogh-style artworks."

Capellini,The evolution of hominin bipedalism in two steps,"The human pelvis exhibits distinct spatiotemporal ossification patterns and an ilium cartilage growth plate that is shifted perpendicularly compared with those of other mammals and non-human primates—two key adaptations that underlie bipedalism. 
 Bipedalism is a human-defining trait1–3. It is made possible by the familiar, bowl-shaped pelvis, whose short, wide iliac blades curve along the sides of the body to stabilize walking and support internal organs and a large-brained, broad-shouldered baby4–6. The ilium changes compared with living primates are an evolutionary novelty7. However, how this evolution came about remains unknown. Here, using a multifaceted histological, comparative genomic and functional genomic approach, we identified the developmental bases of the morphogenetic shifts in the human pelvis that made bipedalism possible. First, we observe that the human ilium cartilage growth plate underwent a heterotopic shift, residing perpendicular to the orientation present in other primate (and mouse) ilia. Second, we observe heterochronic and heterotopic shifts in ossification that are unlike those in non-human primate ilia or human long bones. Ossification initiates posteriorly, resides externally with fibroblast (and perichondral) cells contributing to osteoblasts, and is delayed compared with other bones in humans and with primate ilia. Underlying these two shifts are regulatory changes in an integrated chondrocyte–perichondral–osteoblast pathway, involving complex hierarchical interactions between SOX9–ZNF521–PTH1R and RUNX2–FOXP1/2. These innovations facilitated further growth of the human pelvis and the unique formation of the ilium among primates. The human pelvis exhibits distinct spatiotemporal ossification patterns and an ilium cartilage growth plate that is shifted perpendicularly compared with those of other mammals and non-human primates—two key adaptations that underlie bipedalism."

 The armoured ankylosaurian dinosaurs are best known from Late Cretaceous Northern Hemisphere ecosystems, but their early evolution in the Early–Middle Jurassic is shrouded in mystery due to a poor fossil record1,2. Spicomellus afer was suggested to be the world’s oldest ankylosaur and the first from Africa, but was based on only a single partial rib from the Middle Jurassic of Morocco3. Here we describe a new, much more complete specimen that confirms the ankylosaurian affinities of Spicomellus, and demonstrates that it has uniquely elaborate dermal armour unlike that of any other vertebrate, extant or extinct. The presence of ‘handle’ vertebrae in the tail of Spicomellus indicates that it possessed a tail weapon, overturning current understanding of tail club evolution in ankylosaurs, as these structures were previously thought to have evolved only in the Early Cretaceous4. This ornate armour may have functioned for display as well as defence, and a later reduction to simpler armour with less extravagant osteoderms in Late Cretaceous taxa might indicate a shift towards a primarily defensive function, perhaps in response to increased predation pressures or a switch to combative courtship displays.

 The Great Fear of 1789, a wave of panic and unrest in rural France fuelled by the spreading of rumours, was an important moment at the onset of the French Revolution, marking the collapse of feudalism and the rise of the new regime1. The Great Fear provides a vivid example of the role the spreading of rumours has in driving political changes that might be relevant today2,3. Here, we collect existing historical records related to the Great Fear and use epidemiology tools and models4 to reconstruct the network of its transmission from town to town. In this way, we quantify the spatiotemporal spread of the rumours and compute key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number. Exploiting information on the structure of the road network in eighteenth century France5, we estimate the most probable diffusion paths of the Great Fear and quantify the distribution of spreading velocities. By endowing the nodes in our reconstructed network with indicators related to the institutional, demographic and socio-economic conditions of the time6, including literacy, population size, political participation, wheat prices7,8, income and ownership laws9, and the unequal distribution of land ownership, we compute factors associated with spread of the Great Fear. Our analysis sheds light on unresolved historiographic issues on the significance of the Great Fear for the French Revolution, providing a quantitative answer to the unresolved debate between the role of emotions and rationality in explaining its diffusion. Epidemiological methods are used to show that the Great Fear of 1789, a series of peasant insurrections in rural revolutionary France, was driven by deliberate political action rather than spontaneous fear."

They identify B55α and Greatwall levels as biomarkers of responses to Greatwall-targeted therapy. 
 The Greatwall kinase inhibits PP2A-B55 phosphatase activity during mitosis to stabilise critical Cdk1-driven mitotic phosphorylation. Although Greatwall represents a potential oncogene and prospective therapeutic target, our understanding of the cellular and molecular consequences of chemical Greatwall inactivation remains limited. To address this, we introduce C-604, a highly selective Greatwall inhibitor, and characterise both immediate and long-term cellular responses to the chemical attenuation of Greatwall activity. We demonstrate that Greatwall inhibition causes systemic destabilisation of the mitotic phosphoproteome, premature mitotic exit and pleiotropic cellular pathologies. Importantly, we show that the cellular and molecular abnormalities associated with reduced Greatwall activity are specifically dependent on the B55α isoform, rather than other B55 variants, underscoring PP2A-B55α phosphatases as key mediators of the cytotoxic effects of Greatwall-targeting agents in human cells. Additionally, we establish that sensitivity to Greatwall inhibition varies in different cell line models and that dependency on Greatwall activity reflects the balance between Greatwall and B55α expression levels. Our findings highlight Greatwall dependency as a cell-specific vulnerability and propose the B55α-to-Greatwall expression ratio as a predictive biomarker of cellular responses to Greatwall-targeted therapeutics.

Here, the authors find generalist and widespread species are key to propagating effects spatially, mediated by landscape characteristics and species provenance. 
 Species can directly and indirectly affect others across communities and habitats, yet the spatial scale over which such effects spread remains unclear. This uncertainty arises partly because the species traits and landscape structures allowing indirect effects to propagate may differ across scales. Here, we use a topological network metric, communicability, to explore the factors controlling spatial propagation of effects in a large-scale plant-frugivore network projected across the territory of Aotearoa New Zealand. We show that generalism, species prevalence, and morphological traits are important predictors of species’ capacity to propagate effects, but their importance differed across scales. Furthermore, native bird species (but not exotics) show a positive relationship between body size and their potential to propagate effects. Habitat composition is the most important landscape factor in our study, generating hotspots of effect propagation around forested areas, whereas landscapes containing a variety of habitats act as a buffer against propagation. Overall, our results indicate that species displaying specific sets of traits, including ubiquity, interaction generalism, and a combination of large body size and native status, are the most likely to propagate large-scale ecological impacts in the plant-frugivore communities studied, yet landscape properties may moderate this spread.

 Tropical deforestation induces local warming and is a potential human health risk, having been linked to elevated human heat stress and reduced safe outdoor working hours. Here we show deforestation-induced local warming is associated with 28,000 (95% confidence interval: 23,610–33,560) heat-related deaths per year using a pan-tropical assessment. Analysis of satellite data shows tropical deforestation during 2001–2020 exposed 345 million people to local warming with population-weighted daytime land surface warming of 0.27 °C. Estimated heat-related mortality rates are greatest in Southeast Asia (8–11 deaths for every 100,000 people living in deforested areas) followed by tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. In regions of forest loss, local warming from deforestation could account for over one third of total climate heat-related mortality, highlighting the important contribution of tropical deforestation to ongoing warming and heat-related health risks within the context of climate change.

 Urban mines—stockpiles of materials in discarded waste—include various metals, oxides, polymers and halogens with diverse implications in terms of materials sustainability, which are reflected in different environmental–economic–efficiency trade-offs when recycling them. Here we leverage the diverse composition of urban mines to develop ‘reciprocal recycling’—a self-assembly strategy that uses urban mine components to support their own recycling to ultimately activate sustainable urban mining. We screened tens of physicochemical componential interactions available for multimetal co-recovery, halogenated pollutants elimination and polymer conversion. Self-assembly prototypes with four fundamental componential interactions were presented for reciprocal recycling of representative urban mines. Under the guidance of revealed physicochemical interaction mechanisms, the reciprocal recycling process design enabled >96% recovery of copper–platinum–palladium–rhodium, >99% suppression of brominated pollutants and mediated epoxy resin conversion. The self-assembly strategy showcased joint environmental–economic–efficiency benefits and high flexibility, paving the way to sustainable urban mining and improving material circularity.

 Evidence has emerged of a discrepancy in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) trends over the satellite era, where most coupled climate models struggle to simulate the observed La Niña-like SST trends. Here we highlight wider implications of the tropical Pacific SST trend discrepancy for global circulation trends during boreal winter, using two complementary methods to constrain coupled model SST trends: conditioning near-term climate prediction (hindcast) simulations, and pacemaking coupled climate simulations. The robust circulation trend response to constraining the tropical Pacific SST trend resembles the interannual La Niña response. Constraining tropical Pacific SST robustly reduces tropical tropospheric warming, improving agreement with reanalyses, and moderately shifts the zonal-mean jets poleward. It also improves surface air temperature and precipitation trends in ENSO-sensitive regions, such as the Americas, South Asia, and southern Africa.

 Air transport has become the fastest-growing carbon/air pollutant emission sources. Landing-takeoff (LTO) management is a cost-effective way to address aviation’s low-emission, decarbonization and energy-conservation challenges. Accurate estimation of LTO fuel and emissions is crucial. However, the widely-used International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) method with constant time-in-mode resulted in huge uncertainties. We established the Aircraft Landing-takeoff Time, Fuel, and Emission Model (ALTFEM), substantially improving the capability of dynamically capturing time-in-mode, to estimate LTO fuel consumption and emissions for each flight. The time-in-mode estimation errors of ALTFEM-estimated taxi in/out durations were reduced by 30.2% and 118% compared to ICAO-suggested defaults (taxi-in:420 s, taxi-out:1140 s). Our work improved the accuracy of airport-specific estimates for fuel, HC, NOx, and CO2 by 14%–40%, compared to ICAO-based results.

 Global warming and heat stress can adversely affect crop yields and quality. Earlier planting that shifts the growing season to cooler periods is a widely considered adaptation strategy in climate change literature. We ask: How effective is earlier planting in reducing high-temperature-exposure across growth stages? What are the associated temperature-exposure tradeoffs, and can historical conditions be matched? With US spring wheat as a case study, growth-stage-specific temperature exposure signatures are developed to estimate tradeoffs from earlier planting. While earlier planting does reduce exposure to critical and lethal high temperatures during reproductive stages, it fails to replicate historical production conditions. The Pacific Northwest is an exception, although tail-end growth stages may require management. Historically-equivalent planting windows narrow presenting logistical challenges. Therefore, while many climate-change assessments list earlier planting as an effective adaptation strategy, it may not be as effective when tradeoffs are considered, and consideration of other strategies will be important.

 Pest control is critical to agricultural production and protects agronomic yield from damaging pest populations. Threshold-based programs, where insecticides are only applied when pest densities exceed a pre-determined population, can reduce agrichemical inputs. However, the impacts of these programs are poorly characterized and case-specific. To assess the broader impact of threshold-based insecticide programs for arthropod pests in agriculture, we conducted a meta-analysis of 126 studies reporting 466 trials in 34 crops where thresholds were compared to calendar-based (i.e., weekly or pest-independent) insecticide programs and/or untreated control. Threshold-based programs reduced insecticide applications by 44% and associated costs by 40%, without compromising pest control or overall yield compared to calendar-based programs. Threshold-based insecticide programs featured higher beneficial insect abundance and provided similar levels of arthropod-vectored disease control. Given the extent and consistency of these benefits, greater policy and financial support are needed to encourage this practice in agriculture.

 Interactions between deep-ocean currents and seafloor sediments create bedforms that are important for paleoenvironment reconstructions, resource exploration, and mapping ecosystems. Oceanographers recognize complex flow dynamics where deep ocean currents interact with submarine topography (i.e. seamounts) however the effects on below-wave base seafloor sediment remain unquantified. Here we show complex, highly variable bedforms in the sediments around a seamount are linked to deep-ocean current and topographic interactions, using in-situ, high-resolution footage from a <10 year-old, 1-km water depth volcanic seafloor. Bedforms record sediment reworking, vary spatially and temporally at the scale of m – 100 s m and reflect changes in current velocity over hours to days. These observations provide insights into the complex sedimentology associated with current-topography interactions in mid- to deep-ocean settings and demonstrates the limitations of existing sedimentological models.

 Mathematical models of photosynthesis–irradiance relationships in phytoplankton are used to compute integrated water-column photosynthetic rates and predict primary production. Models typically ignore an important phenomenon observed in most experiments: photosynthetic rate remains constant over a range of irradiances before declining due to photoinhibition. Here we develop an approach that captures both photoinhibition and this plateau. We test six new models of photoinhibition and ten more photoinhibition models from the literature against a database of 1808 photosynthesis–irradiance curves exhibiting photoinhibition. The best model improves adjusted R² by 6–37% and reduces RMSE by 15–70% compared to existing models. In the best model, photoinhibition is phenomenologically described by multiplication by a saturating function of the reciprocal of irradiance, simplifies to the widely-used Jassby & Platt photosynthesis–irradiance curve in the absence of photoinhibition, and only requires one new parameter. This photoinhibition parameter identifies the onset of photoinhibition and is the rate of decrease in photosynthetic rate at that irradiance. Simulations show that while parameter values vary up to 40% across existing models, particularly with and without photoinhibition, our representation of photoinhibition does not affect the interpretation or numerical values of parameters compared to the corresponding model without photoinhibition.

 Satellite-based fine-resolution (∼100 m) PM2.5 mapping remains challenging because broadband multispectral imagery struggles to decouple land and atmospheric signals, limiting accurate local emission source detection in regions with sparse ground monitoring networks. Here, we introduce LAD-GAT, a novel deep learning framework for 100 m-resolution PM2.5 estimation from SDGSAT-1––the first science satellite mission dedicated to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Specifically, LAD-GAT builds a high-dimensional scene-attribute graph by combining PM2.5-relevant geographical features, meteorological dynamics, top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and estimated surface reflectance (SR). A specialized land-atmosphere decoupling (LAD) module is introduced to separate latent aerosol signals from ground surface contributions, and a graph attention network (GAT) models nonlinear associations between in-situ PM2.5 observations and the input graph structure. In 10-fold cross-validation, LAD-GAT achieved RMSE = 5.042 μg m−3 (R2 = 0.875) using SDGSAT-1 TOA reflectance, and RMSE = 9.428 μg m−3 (R2 = 0.862) with Sentinel-2 TOA reflectance. Incorporating daily SR yielded an 8.68 % accuracy gain over TOA reflectance alone and outperformed multi-day composites by 7.27 %, highlighting the benefit of accounting for SR dynamics in fine-scale PM2.5 mapping. Overall, leveraging the proposed novel LAD-GAT method, SDGSAT-derived PM2.5 estimates rival those from Sentinel-2, providing fine-scale data to better support SDG 11.6.2 monitoring and targeted air-quality interventions."

 This study presents a new satellite ocean color data record of Secchi depth (ZSD) observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). As part of the NOAA enterprise satellite data processing, the decade-long ZSD data are derived from the visible and near-infrared reflectance measurements over oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Based on in situ data, the model is excellent in generating low-uncertainty ZSD data with an absolute percentage difference (APD) of 15%–29%. The satellite and in situ matchups confirm reliable satellite retrievals with APD = 19%–26% over the ZSD range of 0.1–60 m. Although the product uncertainties are dependent on optical water types, assessments show that the satellite ZSD estimations are very reliable, especially where ZSD ≥ 1 m. This new satellite product has enabled the ability to access Level-2 daily ZSD imagery and information as well as Level-3 data aggregated on daily to monthly scales. Our examination indicates that the ocean transparent windows are situated at 443 and 486 nm in the vast open oceans and 551 nm for most coastal waters. They shift to the red band at 671 nm for extremely turbid environments, such as large river estuaries. From a global perspective, the ZSD data extend from less than half a meter in nearshore environments to >70 m in the South Pacific Gyre, while demonstrating a strong dependency on the optical water types. Short-term fluctuations over time are registered in the satellite ZSD daily and monthly data from almost every aquatic environment. Trend analyses reveal significant increases in water transparency over many regions, especially the open ocean. We stress the necessity of normalizing satellite ZSD estimations to eliminate the uncertainties induced by different solar-zenith angles. The present satellite products can be further improved by accounting for the limitations imposed by the multispectral reflectance data with hyperspectral ocean color spectra."

 Global soil salinization and sodification threaten food security by causing excessive salt accumulation in soils, degrading productivity. However, their spatiotemporal patterns have not been well documented due to the lack of high-accuracy estimates of soil salinity and sodicity with a long-term perspective. Here we propose a novel framework combining the Box-Cox transformation that addresses the skewed distribution of samples and more critical predictors as well as remote sensing indices, to predict global soil salinity (electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract, ECe) and sodicity (exchangeable sodium percentage, ESP) from 1980 to 2024 with a 1 km × 1 km resolution using random forest. Model accuracy is higher than previous studies, with root mean square error (RMSE) of ECe and ESP as 2.24 and 6.04 respectively, and an R2 of 0.65, and 0.60 respectively. The implementation of the Box-Cox transformation significantly improved the model performance (R2) by approximately 100 % (from 0.35 to 0.79 for ECe and 0.59 to 0.85 for ESP), while the additional predictors further enhanced the performance (R2 increased by 15 %), ranking in the top 30 % of the feature importance list. Results revealed that global multiple-year average salinization and sodification are primarily concentrated in arid regions characterized by low precipitation and high temperatures. We also found a significant increasing trend of soil salinization in 20 % of global land and of sodification in 48 % of global land from 1980 to 2024, both most pronounced near the equator, as well as in central and eastern North America, Europe, southeastern China, and Mongolia. This study provides updated long-term soil salinity and sodicity maps with improved accuracies, offering critical insights for sustainable land management under climate change, serving as an essential resource for addressing food security and land degradation challenges worldwide."

 This study presents a robust methodology for segmenting an urban road network at multiple levels of granularity, leveraging Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point cloud data and the CityGML 3.0 framework. The proposed approach integrates semantic and geometric information to delineate road spaces into sections, intersections, sidewalks, parking areas, and individual driving lanes. The methodology achieves spatial accuracy and compliance with road design standards through the use of clustering algorithms, alpha shape methods, and geometric refinements. Case studies in two 2 km intra-urban networks—Santiago de Compostela and Madrid, both comprising local and collector streets with uninterrupted carriageways and white-colour markings—demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness, yielding highly accurate results with average Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.85 for Santiago de Compostela and 0.83 for Madrid across road features. Parking areas in Santiago de Compostela achieved 0.9 IoU, while zebra crossings in Madrid exhibited limitations with 0.68 IoU due to their smaller size and complex geometry. The results provide a standardized and detailed road network representation, suitable for urban planning, traffic management, and autonomous vehicle navigation.

 Forest canopy height is a key indicator for estimating forest carbon sinks and managing vegetation growth. Existing methods for fusing optical and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data still have limitations in canopy height estimation for boreal forests. In this study, we develop a forest canopy height estimation model (VGG-AdaBins) that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract deep features from multi-source remote sensing data. By introducing an adaptive tree height distribution estimation module, the model enables the coupling of multi-source remote sensing data for forest canopy height estimation. A joint validation dataset is constructed, including Sentinel-1/2, PALSAR images, airborne LVIS LiDAR, and spaceborne ICESat-2 photon-counting LiDAR data. This dataset is used to train the canopy height model. Finally, the performance of the canopy height prediction model is evaluated using 100 independent airborne datasets. The model’s prediction of tree height shows an MAE of 1.42 m and a RMSE of 2.25 m. The predicted 30 m canopy height map exhibits good consistency with the existing airborne data and demonstrated higher accuracy compared with current forest canopy height maps, with an accuracy improvement of at least 20%. The high prediction accuracy demonstrates that VGG-AdaBins, by integrating multi-source remote sensing data, can map continuous canopy height at the regional scale. This approach contributes to the advancement of large-scale canopy height mapping and forest carbon stock assessment in boreal forests."

 Using observational and reanalysis data, this study investigates the severe winter drought event in Eastern China during 2024/25, which is the most extreme in at least four decades. The event featured a record-low Eastern China winter precipitation (ECWP) of 36.24 mm, with over 80 % precipitation deficits in multiple Eastern China regions and numerous stations recording their lowest/second/third-lowest winter precipitation, 39 consecutive days of nearly no measurable precipitation. Statistical analysis and dynamic diagnostics reveal that the ECWP is synergistically influenced by the Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and Tibetan Plateau (TP) thermal conditions. The Equatorial-North Pacific (ENP) and Indian Ocean SSTs modulate the ECWP by affecting circulation to regulate moisture transport from the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal to Eastern China, respectively. The TP thermal effect exerts its effects through cold (warm) temperatures inducing an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) near the TP, which enhance (suppress) moisture transport to Eastern China and thereby increase (reduce) the ECWP. During the winter of 2024/25, both the Indo-Pacific SST and TP thermal conditions were unfavorable for the ECWP.

 Accurately predicting particulate matter is crucial for preventing health risks and protecting public health. This study improves the accuracy of particulate matter d≤10μm (PM10 ) forecasts over Morocco for the next five days using a U-Net-based deep learning model, marking the first work of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The U-Net model was used to post-process and improve PM10 forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), with reanalysis data from CAMS serving as a reference to guide the model's learning. The U-Net architecture was modified to predict outputs at a resolution different from the inputs, eliminating the need for interpolation and preserving critical spatial details. The results demonstrated significant improvements over two baselines—CAMS forecasts and the Analog Ensemble model (AnEn)—by enhancing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IOA), and biases, particularly in regions prone to dust storms, during the period prior to the CAMS forecast upgrade in mid-2023. In the second half of 2023, U-Net continued to improve predictions; however, the effect of the upgrade cycle became evident in its errors. This highlights the importance of retraining U-Net with updated data as it becomes available to maintain its reliability in operational forecasting systems. U-Net also proved effective in capturing particulate pollution, providing reliable predictions for values up to 500 μg/m3. These findings underscore U-Net's potential for operational forecasting, supporting accurate early warnings to mitigate the health and environmental impacts of PM10  pollution."

 Accurate, long-term records of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are crucial for understanding carbon cycle dynamics and evaluating the impacts of natural and anthropogenic emissions. In this study, we present a global dataset of column-averaged CO2 concentrations (XCO2) covering the period 2003–2022, generated using an enhanced version of the XCO2SAT+ method. This approach integrates satellite observations from four missions (ENVISAT, GOSAT, GOSAT, GOSAT-2 and OCO-2) harmonized through the EMMA v4.5 product, and applies a novel spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm to estimate monthly mean XCO2 values at 23 958 locations worldwide (≈95 km grid spacing). The dataset provides XCO2 estimates over global land surfaces and adjacent coastal regions. Validation against 28 TCCON sites yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.76ppm, comparable to NOAA’s CarbonTracker model (MAE=0.71ppm). The method reliably reconstructs XCO2 time series even in regions with sparse satellite coverage, while preserving spatial and seasonal variability. As a demonstration, we identify XCO2 anomalies linked to major wildfire events, including North American mega-fires in 2018 and recurring fire activity in tropical northern Africa, with localized monthly anomalies exceeding 2 ppm–4 ppm. Comparison with recent machine learning (ML) products confirms that the XCO2SAT+ method achieves higher accuracy across multiple TCCON sites and time frames.

Laboratory studies show that organisms adjust to changes in nutrient intake through flexible metabolic responses such as fuel switching. While the physiological effects of nutrient balance in humans have been studied, data from closely related species living in nature are lacking. We integrate macronutrient regulation and metabolic flexibility to elucidate how wild orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) are buffered against natural fluctuations in nutritional resources. We found that these orangutans regulate protein and regularly switch between exogenous and endogenous nutritional substrates as preferred food resource availability declines. When total caloric, lipid, and carbohydrate intake declined during episodes of fruit scarcity, orangutans drew on fat and endogenous amino acids for energy. This strategy is beneficial only in the context of alternating periods of fruit scarcity and abundance. We discuss our findings in relation to the current global obesity pandemic, which has arisen with transitions in human diets toward low-cost, energy-dense, protein-dilute foods."
10.1126/sciadv.adw0343,True,Science Advances,该研究论文探讨了海岸线波浪破碎对海岸海雾气溶胶（SSA）产生的影响，以及这种影响如何影响气候和空气质量。研究表明，近岸强烈的SSA产生会显著增加下风向的云凝结核（CCN）和气溶胶质量浓度。由于目前的区域模型未能充分考虑近岸波浪破碎产生的SSA，因此可能高估了SSA对气候的影响，并且无法准确评估其对沿海社区环境的影响。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术，但其结论对于利用卫星观测数据验证和改进气溶胶排放模型，以及更准确地评估沿海地区空气质量和气候变化具有重要意义。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术，尤其是气溶胶监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['sea spray aerosol (SSA)', 'cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'aerosol mass concentration', 'coastal air quality', 'climate impact', 'regional models']",Shengqian Zhou;Matthew Salter;Timothy Bertram;Eduardo Brito Azevedo;Francisco Reis;Jian Wang,Shoreline wave breaking strongly enhances the coastal sea spray aerosol population: Climate and air quality implications,"Sea spray aerosol (SSA) emission is a major source of atmospheric aerosols, influencing global climate and coastal air quality. Much of our knowledge about SSA derives from coastal observations near shorelines, but whether and when these observations accurately represent open oceans remain unclear. Here, we show that strong nearshore SSA production during high-wave periods greatly enhances downwind cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and aerosol mass concentrations. Strong shoreline wave breaking is widespread globally, and swell waves, which are decoupled from local winds, play a dominant role in many coastal regions. Therefore, extrapolating results based on coastal measurements to open oceans may significantly overestimate SSA concentration and its contribution to CCN and, by extension, the impact of SSA on clouds and climate. Additionally, the strong enhancement of coastal aerosol population by shoreline wave breaking and its environmental impact on coastal communities cannot be captured by current regional models, which do not parameterize nearshore SSA generation using wave energy or completely neglect it."

Evidence suggests that this pathway is influenced by “the gene for speed,”ACTN3(α-actinin-3). Given that one in five people lack α-actinin-3, it is possible that they may respond to androgens differently. Here, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency decreases AR in muscles of mice and humans (in males and females) and that AR positively correlates with α-actinin-3 expression in a dosage-dependent manner. α-Actinin-3 deficiency exacerbates gastrocnemius mass loss with androgen deprivation in male mice and stunts the muscle growth response to dihydrotestosterone in female mice at the onset of puberty. This is mediated by differential activation of pathways regulating amino acid metabolism, intracellular transport, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, MAPK, and calcineurin signaling, likely driven by seven key genes that are both androgen sensitive and α-actinin-3–dependent in expression. Our results highlight a role forACTN3as a regulator of muscle mass and a genetic modifier of androgen action in skeletal muscle."

Spectrum reconstruction with accurate diffusion coefficients or relaxation time is essential for the Laplace-related NMR experiments, but existing processing methods generally yield varying results because of the ill-posed nature of inverse Laplace transform, making it challenging to assess the accuracy and reliability of estimations without ideal references. To address this, we developed a deep learning–based method that not only recovers parameter distributions from exponential signals with improved accuracy but also provides an uncertainty estimation for each reconstruction result. This additional insight allows the user to assess the confidence across spectral regions, providing a clearer and more reliable framework for Laplace-related data interpretation, thus facilitating broader applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science."

Particularly, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a driving factor in foam cell formation, altering macrophage function and metabolism. The aim of our research was to understand the impact of oxLDL-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species on macrophage-to-foam cell differentiation. We demonstrate that macrophage oxLDL-derived superoxide modulates mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, facilitating foam cell formation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial superoxide drives signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation, leading to reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In parallel, mitochondrial superoxide enhances chromatin accessibility at STAT5 target genes, establishing a distinct STAT5 signaling signature in foam cells ex vivo and in human and mouse plaques in vivo. Inhibition of STAT5 during atherosclerosis progression prevents the differentiation of macrophages to mature Trem2hiGpnmbhifoam cells. Collectively, our data describe an oxLDL-induced, mitochondrial superoxide–dependent STAT5 activation that leads to a self-amplifying feedback loop of reciprocal mitochondrial superoxide production and STAT5 activation, ultimately driving macrophage-to-foam cell transition."

Here, we introduce PhoCoil, a dynamically tunable recombinant hydrogel formed from a single protein component with unique multistimuli responsiveness. Physical cross-linking through coiled-coil interactions promotes rapid shear-thinning and self-healing behavior, rendering the gel injectable, whereas an included photodegradable motif affords on-demand network dissolution via visible light.

Here, we characterize two mitophagy activators: a novel Parkin activator, FB231, and the reported PINK1 activator MTK458. Both compounds lower the threshold for mitochondrial toxins to induce PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, global proteomics revealed that FB231 and MTK458 independently induce mild mitochondrial stress, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and activation of the integrated stress response, effects that result from PINK1/Parkin-independent off-target activities. We find that these compounds impair mitochondria by distinct mechanisms and synergistically decrease mitochondrial function and cell viability in combination with classical mitochondrial toxins.

In this study, we evaluated 57 synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) for antiviral activity in cellulo using pseudotyped virus particles (PVPs) from six high-risk viruses across three families: Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Four SCRs inhibited all tested PVPs, and their efficacy was confirmed against live viruses including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, NiV, and HeV.

Using a comprehensive dataset including age-class, spatial, genetic, and experimental data, across a hunting pressure gradient, we show how paired declines in elephant and ebony populations are linked by a previously unrecognized mutualism in which elephant dung protects ebony seeds against seed predators.

Following USI-based American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, they were used to develop the ATA-Photoacoustic (ATAP) scoring system. The ATAP score achieved 97% sensitivity and 38% specificity in distinguishing nodules requiring FNAB. Our approach enabled better identification of benign nodules, reducing unnecessary FNAB in 11 of the 29 benign cases. This dual-modal strategy can assess thyroid nodules, effectively reducing unnecessary biopsies while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy."

The HERV-K envelope glycoprotein (Env) is aberrantly expressed in cancers, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, and is targeted by patients’ own antibodies. However, a lack of structural information has limited molecular and immunological studies of the roles of HERVs in disease. Here, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of stabilized HERV-K Env in the prefusion conformation, revealing a distinct fold and architecture compared to HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus. We also generated and characterized a panel of monoclonal antibodies with subunit and conformational specificity, serving as valuable research tools. These antibodies enabled structure determination of the postfusion conformation of HERV-K Env, including its unique “tether” helix, and antibody-bound prefusion Env. Together, these results provide a structural framework that opens the door to mechanistic studies of HERV-K Env and tools for its evaluation as a potential therapeutic target."

Prevailing motor control models emphasize Bayesian inference, where prior information is integrated to optimally estimate the current state. An alternative framework, efficient coding, proposes that the system dynamically reallocates encoding resources on the basis of environmental statistics—a mechanism highlighted in perception while underappreciated in motor control. We compared these frameworks in reaching movements, focusing on how the system leverages short-term priors in unpredictable environments. Unexpectedly, sequential effects aligned with the efficient coding model and contradicted Bayesian models. Specifically, current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements, and movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar. We further explored the temporal dynamics of these effects and showed that sequential bias is enhanced by intrinsic motor variability. These findings, accompanied by model comparisons, further support efficient coding in motor planning."

Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the zebrafish adult telencephalon, we identified different molecular clusters of quiescent NSCs, interpreted to sign different quiescence depths. Here, we show that these clusters, when challenged in vivo with an inhibitor of Notch signaling, a major quiescence promoting pathway, unfold different behaviors. Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid up-regulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion. In contrast, an NSC cluster predicted to be in the deepest quiescence state resists Notch blockade, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nr2f1b mediates this resistance to activation in vivo. These results together link the molecular heterogeneity of quiescent NSCs with bona fide biological properties and their molecular regulators."

To address this, we introduce mixture modeling for multiple-instance learning (MMIL), an expectation-maximization approach that trains cell-level binary classifiers using only patient-level labels. Applied to primary samples from patients with acute leukemia, MMIL accurately separates leukemia from nonleukemia baseline cells, including rare minimal residual disease (MRD) cells; generalizes across tissues and treatment time points; and identifies biologically relevant features with accuracy approaching that of a hematopathologist. MMIL can also incorporate cell labels when they are available, creating a robust framework for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled cells. MMIL provides a flexible modeling framework for cell classification, especially in scenarios with unknown gold-standard cell labels."

Here, we report a programmable timer switch of gene expression termed BioFuse, which allows the reaction time ranging from hours to days. BioFuse comprises a series of fuse-like tandem DNA cassettes that can be sequentially edited by the adenine base editors (ABEs), resulting in either the activation or deactivation of a downstream gene once the editing is complete. Adjusting the number of DNA cassettes incorporated allows precise programming of BioFuse’s reaction time. Applying BioFuse to control carotenoid biosynthesis genes decouples lycopene production from growth inE. coliand increases lycopene yield without external inducers. Using BioFuse in a bacterial autolysis system enables timely and efficient protein release. BioFuse offers a versatile tool for precise, wide-range timing of gene expression and metabolic activities in bacteria, with potential applications in industry and biomedicine."

Spielman,The Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a binary quantum fluid,"Instabilities, where small fluctuations seed the formation of large-scale structures, govern dynamics in a variety of fluid systems. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the “ripplon” interface modes. Last, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results—in agreement with our theory—demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids."

Here, we revisit Pianka’s 1966 hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity contributes to tropical biodiversity. Using a comprehensive survey of a fish community in a central Amazonian floodplain, conducted over the 2003, 2012, and 2022 hydrological cycles, we ask if the high levels of environmental heterogeneity (both temporal and spatial) that characterize this ecosystem constrain the capacity of species to dominate local assemblages. We find rapid replacement of dominant species, with local species richness inversely related to dominance. Marked turnover in fish community structure and composition is also present, with different functional groups favored under changing environmental conditions. By showing that turnover in dominant species fuels species coexistence, we identify an ecological mechanism that helps explain how environmental heterogeneity can foster tropical biodiversity."
