10.1088/1748-9326/ae1e8e,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是数据驱动的天气模型在预测大气河流方面的准确性，并将其与传统的数值天气预报系统进行比较。论文评估了两种领先的数据驱动模型（GraphCast和Pangu-Weather）在预测综合水汽输送（IVT）和大气河流（ARs）方面的性能，并使用欧洲中期天气预报中心（ECMWF）的IFS-HRES作为参考。研究结果表明，数据驱动模型在IVT的均方根误差方面与IFS-HRES相当或略好，但在IVT分布的较高分位数方面表现较差。虽然所有模型都能提前五天预测主要事件特征，但AR特征和检测性能因检测算法而异。总的来说，论文强调了针对衍生和极端现象的评估框架的重要性，因为它与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['weather forecasting', 'atmospheric rivers', 'integrated vapor transport', 'numerical weather prediction', 'data-driven models']",Ferran Lopez-Marti;Leonardo Olivetti;Sara M Vallejo-Bernal;Anna Rutgersson;Gabriele Messori,Can data-driven weather models accurately forecast atmospheric rivers?,"The rapid rise of data-driven weather forecasting has prompted increasing interest in how such models perform relative to traditional numerical weather prediction systems. While recent studies have highlighted the formers’ superior skill on standard forecast metrics, questions remain regarding their ability to forecast physically complex, derived variables, particularly in the context of extreme events. In this study, we assess the performance of two leading operational data-driven models (GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) in forecasting integrated vapour transport (IVT) and atmospheric rivers (ARs), using ECMWF’s IFS-HRES as a reference physics-based forecast. Forecasts are evaluated against ERA5 reanalysis over one year of global data, using three AR detection algorithms and lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days. Results show that data-driven models achieved root-mean-square errors for IVT comparable to or slightly better than IFS-HRES, particularly in the tropics and at shorter lead times. However, they achieved a poorer representation of the higher quantiles of the IVT distribution. A case study of a high-impact AR event revealed that all models could forecast the main event characteristics up to five days in advance. However, AR characteristics and detection performance varied substantially across detection algorithms. Notably, the geometrically stricter detection method highlighted a clearer advantage for IFS-HRES, especially in the midlatitudes and at shorter leads. Overall, while no model systematically outperformed the others across all AR detection algorithms, the results suggest that physics-based models may retain advantages in forecasting geometrically and physically consistent derived features like ARs, particularly under strict detection criteria. These findings underscore the importance of targeted evaluation frameworks for derived and extreme phenomena as data-driven models become more central in operational forecasting."

10.1088/1748-9326/ae2143,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注中国京津冀及周边地区PM2.5的区域传输演变。论文通过结合排放清单和化学传输模型，量化了区域传输对PM2.5浓度变化的影响，特别是在中国实施清洁空气行动期间。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究的PM2.5与空气质量监测密切相关，且化学传输模型的结果可以与遥感数据进行验证或结合使用，以更全面地了解大气成分和空气质量。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality monitoring', 'anthropogenic emission', 'regional transport', 'chemical transport model']",Yuxi Liu;Yixuan Zheng;Guannan Geng;Jingyuan Cao;Chuchu Chen;Hanwen Hu;Xuying Wang;Zhang Wen;Yueyi Feng;Yu Lei;Gang Yan,Evolving regional transport of PM2.5 in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and its surrounding areas from 2013 to 2020,"China’s successful implementation of two phases of stringent clean air actions from 2013 to 2020 (Phase I: 2013–2017; Phase II: 2018–2020) has substantially reduced PM2.5 concentration in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and its surrounding areas (BTHSA)—one of China’s most polluted regions. However, the specific role of regional transport in this improvement remains unclear. Here, we investigated the drivers of PM2.5 mitigation in the BTHSA and systematically quantified the contribution of regional transport during 2013–2020, by conducting multi-scenario analysis using a combination of a bottom–up emission inventory and a chemical transport model with an embedded source apportionment module. The simulated regional average PM2.5 concentration across the BTHSA declined by 56.1% from 2013 to 2020, primarily driven by anthropogenic emission control (78.1%), while the remaining 21.9% explained by meteorological variability. Within the anthropogenic impacts, reductions in local emissions, intra-regional transport, and extra-regional transport accounted for 49.0%, 32.9%, and 18.1%, respectively. Nevertheless, the relative importance of these drivers shifted, with local contributions declining while regional transport influences intensified and surpassed local abatement in Phase II, where intra-regional transport remained dominant, but the influence of extra-regional transport rose markedly to 1.4 times its Phase I level. Spatially, emission reductions in Hebei and Shandong contributed the most to the regional PM2.5 decline, representing over 50% of the transport-related improvement. Trends in regional contributions to Beijing, the core city of the BTHSA region, suggest the need for dynamically adjusting joint control policies, expanding coordinated mitigation efforts to extra-regional cities in Southern Shandong, as well as to key regions like the Yangtze River Delta. These findings underscore the growing importance of regional transport in air quality improvement and support more adaptive regional collaboration strategies moving forward."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae21f7,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是季节性预测系统在预测2024年欧洲热浪方面的能力。它评估了GCFS、SEAS5和Météo-France等预测系统在捕捉东欧地区异常高温方面的表现，并探讨了预测系统对副热带影响的预测能力。虽然该研究涉及大气现象，但其重点在于气象预测模型的性能和气候变化的影响，而不是直接利用大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['seasonal forecasting', 'heatwave prediction', 'temperature anomalies', 'climate change impacts', 'meteorological predictability']",Konstantia Tolika;Errikos Michail Manios;Alexandros Papadopoulos Zachos;Kondylia Velikou;Christina Anagnostopoulou,Can we predict the extreme? Assessing the skill of seasonal forecasts in capturing the 2024 European heatwave,"Eastern Europe experienced a pronounced warming trend in the summer of 2024, with average maximum temperature anomalies reaching 3.35 ∘C in June and 3.73 ∘C in July, and minimum temperature anomalies averaging 2.17 ∘C in June and 2.60 ∘C in July, significantly exceeding the 1991–2020 climatological baseline. Moreover, three distinct heatwave events were identified: 3–11 June (9 days), 17 June–1 July (15 days), and 6–21 July (16 days), highlighting the prolonged and intense nature of the heat stress. Seasonal forecasting systems (GCFS, SEAS5, and Météo-France) consistently demonstrated the capability to predict above-climatological-mean temperatures over the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly the Balkan Peninsula, showcasing robust regional warming trend capture, though with variations in accuracy across lead times. The accurate prediction of subtropical influences, as evidenced by consistent positive temperature anomaly forecasts over North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, underscores the forecasting systems’ capacity to represent large-scale circulation patterns, yet the predictive skill for midlatitude blocking events and their spatial extent remains subject to limitations and model-specific variations. Despite the inherent limitations in long-range meteorological predictability, particularly concerning heatwave timing and location, the study emphasizes the critical imperative for continued refinement of seasonal forecasting models to enhance societal resilience against the escalating impacts of climate change, particularly through improved representation of synoptic atmospheric drivers."

This study investigates Pan-Arctic climate responses to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) using nine CMIP6 models from the CDR Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP) and also analyzes two ScenarioMIP pathways, SSP126 and SSP534-over, which feature declining CO₂ concentrations. Our results reveal significant hysteresis and asymmetric responses in both temperature and precipitation during CO₂ increase and decrease phases. The multi-model mean shows that when CO₂ concentrations return to pre-industrial levels, the pan-Arctic region retains a warming of approximately 1.5 °C and increased precipitation of about 0.1 mm d−1 compared to initial conditions. Notably, temperature and precipitation changes in the pan-Arctic at peak CO₂ are approximately twice the global average. We identify substantial inter-model uncertainties, primarily driven by divergent representations of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) responses and associated North Atlantic cooling patterns in the ramp-up period. Two models (CESM2 and NorESM2-LM) simulate particularly strong AMOC weakening during the ramp-up phase, resulting in reduced warming and wetting trends across the pan-Arctic. A similar persistence of warmer and wetter conditions is also found under the SSP126 and SSP534-over scenarios. These findings highlight the irreversible nature of Arctic climate change even under aggressive CDR scenarios and emphasize the need for improved representation of Arctic processes in climate models to reduce uncertainties in climate projection and mitigation strategy design."

However, several studies have reported that wildfires can also reduce the concentrations of certain gaseous species. This study investigated the impacts of smoke plumes from wildfires that occurred in late July 2014 in Siberia, Russia, on downwind gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ozone (O3). The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was employed for air quality simulations, and wildfire emissions were obtained from the Fire INventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Wildfire-induced CO, VOCs, and O3 were transported to Northeast China (NEC), the Yellow Sea (YS), and the Korean Peninsula (KP), resulting in elevated pollutant levels in these downwind regions. Interestingly, despite the transport of plumes, surface-level NOx concentrations over NEC, YS, and KP even decreased. Such reductions were not evident near the Siberian source areas but became apparent after the plumes reached the NEC region. In these regions, NO was converted through reactions with wildfire-induced VOCs (84.54%) and NO3 radicals (13.18%), while NO2 was primarily transformed into NO3 radicals via reactions with O3 (90.08%) or into organic nitrates through reactions with VOCs (9.92%). We found that the observed conversions in NOx concentrations were attributable to anthropogenic sources, as the conversion patterns varied depending on the level of anthropogenic NOx emissions in the sensitivity experiments. These results suggest that wildfire-driven NOx concentration changes in downwind regions cannot be fully explained by wildfire emissions alone. This study underscores the importance of accurately characterizing anthropogenic emission sources in regions affected by smoke plume transport to predict changes in gaseous pollutant concentrations following wildfire events. We expect that this study will enhance future wildfire-related research by improving the prediction of the spatial distribution and atmospheric behavior of gaseous pollutants."

In the context of globalization, the transnational flow of biodiversity loss footprints caused by international crop trade has raised questions about the allocation of ecological responsibility. However, most existing research tends to attribute such loss exclusively to either consumers or producers, which overlooks a more equitable perspective that integrates both parties’ responsibilities. By drawing upon welfare economics, this study allocates the biodiversity loss arising from crop trade between producers and consumers. We developed a high-resolution distribution map illustrating the allocation of export-induced biodiversity loss among consumers and producers. We also trace the origin of biodiversity loss allocated to consumers. These findings provide a basis for global ecological compensation initiatives and assist policymakers in optimizing land-use strategies."

This update addresses a large low bias of -80 % in simulated NO2 nocturnal deposition velocities evaluated against long-term eddy covariance flux observations over Harvard Forest. We highlight the importance of canopy surface area effects as well as soil NO emissions in formulating and evaluating NO2 dry-deposition parameterizations. 
 Dry deposition is a major loss pathway for reactive nitrogen species from the atmospheric boundary layer. We evaluate isolated components of the parameterization for species-specific gaseous dry-deposition velocity Vd(x) for HNO3 and NO2 from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model by running a stand-alone version of Vd code in single-point mode to enable a more direct comparison to field observations. Improved measurement–model agreement results mainly from (i) updates to the calculation of molecular diffusivities and (ii) the representation of ground surface NO2 hydrolysis in the formulation of non-stomatal uptake. We evaluate the parameterization for non-stomatal dry deposition of NO2 by comparing to eddy-covariance-inferred nocturnal Vd(NO2) over Harvard Forest. We address a large low bias (−80 %) in simulated nocturnal Vd(NO2) by representing NO2 heterogeneous hydrolysis on deposition surfaces, paying attention to chemical flux divergence, soil NO emission, and canopy surface area effects. Finally, we evaluate the updated oxidized reactive nitrogen (NOy) dry-deposition parameterization by comparing to eddy-covariance-inferred Vd(NOy) over Harvard Forest, finding that a modest nocturnal low bias (−19 %) remains in simulated Vd(NOy) due to the compensating effects of updates to the calculation of molecular diffusivities (28 % reduction in nocturnal Vd(NOy)) and the representation of NO2 heterogeneous hydrolysis (25 % increase in nocturnal Vd(NOy)). These developments are a first step towards a tractable representation of NO2 hydrolysis in a dry-deposition scheme and have important implications for the near-surface NO2 lifetime through a mechanism involving HONO emission."

Berthelemy;Corwin J. Wright;Neil P. Hindley;Phoebe E. Noble;Lars Hoffmann,A novel identification method for stratospheric gravity waves in nadir viewing satellite observations,"Atmospheric gravity waves are one of the key mechanisms for moving energy upwards through the atmosphere. We use temperature data to see them from a satellite, and here have made a new method to automatically detect them. This works by seeing if points next to each other are from the same wave. This is useful for creating larger gravity wave datasets without noise, which can then be used by climate forecasters to improve their understanding of the atmosphere. 
 Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are an important mechanism for vertical transport of energy and momentum through the atmosphere. Their impacts are apparent at all scales, including aviation, weather, and climate. Identifying stratospheric GWs from satellite observations is challenging due to instrument noise and effects of weather processes, but they can be observed from nadir sounders such as the AIRS instrument onboard Aqua. Here, a new method (hereafter “neighbourhood method”) to detect GW information is presented and applied to AIRS data. This uses a variant of the 3D S-transform to calculate the horizontal wavenumbers of temperature perturbations, then find areas of spatially constant horizontal wavenumbers (assumed to be GWs), which allow for creating a binary wave-presence mask. We describe the concept of the neighbourhood method and use it to investigate GW amplitudes, zonal pseudomomentum fluxes, and vertical wavelengths over 5 years of AIRS data. We compare these results to those calculated from GWs detected using another widely used method based on an amplitude cutoff. 35 % of regions of wave activity detected using the neighbourhood method have amplitudes lower than is visible using the amplitude cutoff method. Three regions are studied in greater depth: the Rocky Mountains, North Africa, and New Zealand/Tasmania. GWs detected using the neighbourhood method have wave phase propagation angles consistent with linear theory. Using the neighbourhood method produces new statistics for regional and global GW studies, which compare favourably to the amplitude cutoff GW detection method."

Nitrate levels peak near the ground in spring/winter due to humidity and temperature, while wind and sunlight drive high-altitude pollution in late autumn. Winter shows unique daytime peaks linked to sunlight and nighttime chemistry. Findings help cities design targeted strategies, like timing emissions cuts, to improve air quality by addressing pollution at specific heights and times. 
 The vertical distribution of particulate nitrate is crucial for understanding its formation mechanisms and developing urban haze reduction strategies. Advanced technologies were used in this study to collect continuous vertical data on nitrate concentrations in Beijing for 2021, providing a seasonal analysis of their distribution and influencing factors. Spring exhibited the highest nitrate concentration below 2 km (8.29 ± 3.14 µg m−3), followed by winter (7.34 ± 2.78 µg m−3), autumn (6.65 ± 2.11 µg m−3), and summer (2.23 ± 0.82 µg m−3). Below 300 m, thermodynamic factors dominated nitrate formation in spring and summer (RH: R = 0.64; temperature: R = −0.76), whereas winter formation was driven by both atmospheric oxidizing capacity (AOC, R = 0.52) and thermodynamic factors (R = 0.68). Between 0.8 and 2 km, dynamic drivers prevailed in spring and autumn (TKE: R = −0.41; vertical wind speed: R = −0.43), while photochemical factors dominated in winter and summer (AOC: R = 0.58; O3: R = 0.60). High nitrate levels were observed at the boundary layer top (0.7–1.2 km), peaking at 118.11 µg m−3 in late autumn, closely linked to photochemical processes and dynamic drivers. In winter, nitrate concentrations exhibited distinct diurnal variations, peaking at 13:00, 18:00, and 22:00 LST, with variations and peak concentrations increasing with altitude due to the accumulation of photochemical products and enhanced AOC at night. These findings support targeted emission controls by reducing photochemical precursor emissions at the boundary layer top and strengthening NOx reductions at major sources."

Emerging evidence highlights the vital role of vertical pollutant transport in influencing surface air quality. In this study, we summarized the vertical profiles of key pollutants based on aircraft surveys up to 4000 m. The influence of regional transport on the vertical distribution patterns was analyzed, offering essential data for evaluating the impact of aloft pollutants on surface air quality. 
 The vertical distribution of reactive trace gases can greatly help understand the complex atmospheric evolution under the joint impacts of surface emission, chemical removal, and regional transport. Focusing on the core area of the North China Plain, aircraft-based observations were conducted in September 2017 and July 2019 to reveal the vertical distributions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured by high-time resolution mass spectrometry. Generally decreasing trends of VOC concentrations with altitudes were captured, indicating strong surface source emissions and chemical removal within the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Ethanol exhibited the highest concentration within the PBL with an average of 46.7 ppbv and the largest ratio (16.5) between the average below and above the PBL heights. The vertical-averaged VOCs above Baoding were greater than those in Beijing by factors ranging from 1.2 to 3.5, suggesting richer precursors for secondary pollutant formation in Baoding. Increases of several VOC species, including styrene and acetonitrile, at high altitudes (>2500 m) were captured in Beijing. Correlation analysis further revealed the significant influences of industrial and biomass burning emissions. Our results highlight the critical role of both local emissions and regional transport in shaping the VOC vertical distributions, which may affect atmospheric organic chemistry across various atmospheric layers in the region."

Fung,Abundance of volatile organic compounds and their role in ozone pollution management: evidence from multi-platform observations and model representation during the 2021–2022 field campaign in Hong Kong,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) affect ozone formation and air quality. However, our understanding is limited due to insufficient measurements, especially for oxygenated VOCs. This study combines land, ship, and satellite data in Hong Kong, showing that oxygenated VOCs make up a significant portion of total VOCs. Despite their importance, many are underestimated in current models. These findings highlight the need to improve VOC representation in models to enhance air quality management. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a diverse group of species that contribute to ozone formation. However, our understanding of VOC dynamics and their effect on ozone pollution is limited by the lack of long-term, continuous, and speciated measurements, especially of oxygenated compounds. To address this gap, this study integrates on-land, shipborne, and spaceborne measurements from a field campaign in Hong Kong during 2021–2022, analyzing 45–98 VOC species over land and water. Results show that oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) account for 73 % (37 ppbv) of the total VOC concentration and 56 % of the total ozone formation potential (OFP), underscoring their indispensable role in VOC chemistry. Despite such importance, OVOCs are underestimated by 45 %–70 % in the CMAQ model, while non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) face a lesser underestimation of 47 %–48 % (i.e., “model underestimation”). Meanwhile, the model does not currently account for 17–56 species of the total measured VOCs (i.e., “model omission”). According to this, we break down the observed overwater VOC concentration of 51 ppbv into three components: 9 ppbv (18 %) successfully represented, 35 ppbv (69 %) underestimated, and 7 ppbv (14 %) omitted in the model. For OFP, the breakdown shows 26 % successful representation, 54 % underestimation, and 20 % omission. Together, both “omission” and “underestimation” reveal the overall “VOC underrepresentation” in the model, which partly results in greater ozone sensitivity to VOCs than observed by spaceborne TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in polluted areas. The findings provide valuable insights into regional pollution dynamics, and inform VOC-related model development and air quality management."

We studied how these extreme conditions affect the sources of summer ozone in California's Central Valley. Using a state-of-the-art modeling tool, we found that weather changes can greatly shift which, where, and when to reduce emissions for the largest air quality benefits. Our results highlight the need to account for extreme weather in designing effective air quality strategies. 
 Extreme weather events like heatwaves and stagnation are increasing with climate change. While their effects on ozone levels have been extensively studied, how extreme weather alters O3-NOx-VOC sensitivity and optimal mitigation strategies is less explored. Here, we apply the CMAQ adjoint model over central California to quantify ozone sensitivity to spatiotemporally resolved precursor emissions under three meteorological scenarios (baseline, high-T, and stagnation) and three emission years (2000, 2012, and 2022). Results show that meteorology-induced changes in sensitivity are comparable in magnitude to those from decadal emission reductions. Higher temperature (+5 °C) amplifies ozone sensitivity to both NOx and VOC, with the largest relative increase in biogenic VOC sources. High-T conditions shift ozone chemistry toward NOx limitation under a VOC-limited emission scenario, but increase the relative importance of VOC control for a NOx-limited scenario. Stagnation consistently pushes ozone chemistry toward VOC limitation across emission scenarios, increasing VOC sensitivity by a factor of ∼ 3–4. Stagnation also spatially shifts influential source areas, especially for NOx, and temporally amplifies prior-day emission impacts due to enhanced pollutant carryover. As the study domain transitions to a NOx-limited regime over time, we identify a growing subset of “climate-resilient” source targets that remain impactful across meteorological scenarios, along with spatial convergence in optimal locations for NOx and VOC emission control. These findings underscore both the need and feasibility to consider meteorological extremes in the design of ozone mitigation strategies for a warming climate."

Bowen;Siteng Fan;Yang Su;Hongxi Pang;Laurent Z. X. Li,Correcting for water vapor diffusion in air bag samples for isotope composition analysis: case study with drone-collected samples,"We developed and validated a model to correct for water vapor diffusion in sampling bags, enabling reconstruction of the original isotopic composition. We quantified all major sources of error and their uncertainties and introduced permeability experiments as a necessary step before field sampling. This study improves the accuracy, reliability, and standardization of atmospheric isotope observations using air bags. 
 Mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy have been widely employed for precise water vapor isotope measurements. Nevertheless, these techniques are limited by logistical challenges in fieldwork, consequently constraining the temporal and spatial resolution of measurements. Specifically, water vapor isotope measurements are primarily limited to near-surface levels, while measurements in the free troposphere are notably scarce. Portable sampling devices, such as air bags and glass bottles, have therefore become necessary alternatives for collecting, storing, and transporting gaseous samples in diverse environments prior to analysis with less portable instruments. In drone-based high-altitude vapor sampling, air bags are preferred for their lighter weight and greater flexibility compared to glass bottles. Nevertheless, they present specific challenges, such as potential sample contamination and isotopic fractionation during storage, primarily due to the inherent permeability of air bags. Here, we developed a theoretical model for water vapor diffusion through the sampling bag surface, with parameters calibrated through laboratory experiments. This model enables the reconstruction of the initial isotopic composition of sampled vapor based on measurements obtained within the bag and from the surrounding environment. This diffusion model underwent rigorous validation through experiments conducted under varying humidity and isotopic composition differences between the inside and outside of the air bag, confirming its reliability. We applied this correction method to air samples collected at various pressures up to the upper troposphere using an air bag-mounted drone that we developed, thereby estimating the initial isotopic composition and uncertainty based on our observations. Our correction method enhances the reliability and applicability of water vapor isotope observations conducted using drones equipped with air bags, and provides a detailed assessment of all potential sources of error and quantifies the uncertainty range of the observations. This approach leverages the strengths of drone-based air bag sampling while mitigating its limitations, thus facilitating the convenient collection of isotopic data throughout the troposphere."

It aims to improve understanding of interactions between water vapor and clouds to enhance models. Integrated into the C3IEL space mission planned for 2028, it uses a Bayesian method and shows good accuracy, except for thin or low clouds. 
 A retrieval algorithm of integrated water vapor content above cloud, using shortwave infrared observations, is developed and evaluated through idealized and realistic atmospheric profiles, with its application currently limited to oceanic regions and latitudes within ±60°. Water vapor plays a crucial role in cloud formation and development, particularly in the formation of clouds resulting from convective processes. The resulting convective cloud locally influences the spatio-temporal variability of atmospheric water vapor content, through exchanges between cloud and its immediate environment. Therefore, a better understanding of the water vapor content above and around clouds is necessary to improve our comprehension of interactions between water vapor and cloud to better constrain Large-Eddy Simulations and numerical weather forecasting models. The algorithm was developed for the Cluster for Cloud evolution, ClImatE and Lightning space mission project. This mission, scheduled for 2028, aims to enhance our knowledge of the 3D convective cloud development velocities, the electrical activity associated with convective systems, and the water vapor content above and around the cloud. The retrieval algorithm presented in this study uses a Bayesian probabilistic approach, the optimal estimation method. The atmosphere is assumed to be composed of homogeneous plane-parallel layers, and synthetic radiance datasets were generated to test the developed retrieval algorithm. The feasibility of retrieving the integrated water vapor content above the cloud over the ocean from shortwave infrared radiances is shown to have, under idealized vertically homogeneous cloud profiles, absolute errors less than 2 kg m−2 for optically thick clouds or when the integrated water vapor content is below 20 kg m−2 and less than 1 kg m−2 for very thick clouds with an optical thickness exceeding 150. Tests using realistic water vapor and cloud extinction profiles that present non-homogeneous vertical distributions show that integrated water vapor content above water type clouds could be retrieved with a Root-Mean-Square Error related to cloud vertical penetration of approximately less than 1 kg m−2 except for optically thin and low-level clouds (cloud optical thickness less than 50 and cloud top height less than 2 km). For very low water vapor content encountered in the presence of high deep convective clouds, the retrieval algorithm tends to systematically overestimate the retrieved water vapor content due to an overestimation of the cloud extinction profile in the upper part of the cloud in the inversion model."

Gueymard;Martin János Mayer;Yanbo Shen,Validating physical and semi-empirical satellite-based irradiance retrievals using high- and low-accuracy radiometric observations in a monsoon-influenced continental climate,"We tested two satellite-based irradiance datasets against both high- and low-accuracy ground-based measurements. The dataset is unique: it includes irradiance measurements from a new research-grade monitoring station in a rare climate, along with new satellite data from China's Fengyun-4B geostationary satellite. Findings suggest that using low-accuracy measurements as a reference for validation can be risky. 
 Are high-accuracy radiometric observations strictly indispensable for the validation of satellite-based irradiance retrievals, or might low-accuracy observations serve as adequate substitutes? Owing to the scarcity of sites with redundant radiometers, such inquiries have seldom been contemplated, much less subjected to systematic examination; rather, it has been customary to employ all accessible observations during validation, frequently with only minimal quality control. In this investigation, we address this question by validating two distinct sets of satellite-retrieved irradiance – one derived through physical methods, the other through statistical means – against collocated high- and low-accuracy observations. Departing from the majority of validation studies, which rely exclusively upon an array of performance measures, we advocate and implement a rigorous distribution-oriented validation framework, yielding more profound insights and more comprehensive conclusions. Beyond the validation methodology itself, the dataset utilized in this study is noteworthy in its own regard: It incorporates radiometric observations from the newly established and first-ever Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station situated within a monsoon-influenced continental climate (specifically, the Dwa Köppen classification), in conjunction with irradiance retrievals from the Fengyun-4B geostationary satellite, which are likewise new to the community. The accumulated evidence strongly suggests that the use of low-accuracy observations as a reference in validating irradiance retrievals may entail significant risks, because the discrepancies they introduce can be of a magnitude comparable to the commonly accepted margins of error or improvement (approximately several W m−2 or a few percent) upon which numerous scientific assertions depend."

The new estimates showed improved accuracy and coverage relative to previous estimates, but highlighted remaining uncertainty in some poorly sampled regions. The work was largely motivated by a need for accurate input data for regional ocean models. 
 Accurate and gap-free historical datasets of oceanic nutrient concentrations, dissolved oxygen, and carbonate chemistry, are needed for the analysis of anthropogenic impacts and development of predictive models, including as boundary conditions for regional ocean models. We developed low-bias, quasi-optimal 4D interpolations of observed values at latitudes >40° N, excluding Mediterranean and Black Seas, for years 1980–2020 inclusive. Our approach used output from the NorESM-OCv1.2 ocean model hindcast as a basis for kernel-smoothing bias correction and optimal interpolation of anomalies, obtaining monthly reanalysis data at NorESM grid points (30–90 km spatial resolution) and all model depth levels. Based on cross-validation tests with spatially-separated training and test subset locations, the resulting products showed equal or better out-of-sample accuracy compared to standard climatological products from the World Ocean Atlas 2023 and GLODAPv2, and also compared to existing non-climatological products from machine learning and biogeochemical reanalysis/hindcast datasets from CMEMS/Copernicus. The new products showed skill in tracking smooth seasonal and interannual variations not included in the standard climatologies, and improved spatial coverage and detail resolution in northern/Arctic regions, compared to all tested alternatives. Significant uncertainties remained, however, largely due to sparse observational coverage in seasonal and permanent ice-covered regions, and limited resolution in coastal regions.

 Publicly available datasets for oil spill detection are scarce, making it difficult to compare the performance of different detection algorithms. To address this, this paper introduces a comprehensive labeled dataset of oil slicks, look-alikes, and other remarkable oceanic phenomena, derived from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) products in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in 2019. The dataset contains 3225 oil objects across 1365 image patches, along with an additional 2290 image patches featuring look-alikes or other phenomena.

To facilitate this, the performance of an oil spill detector from a previous study on the dataset is provided as a baseline. In addition, to help the researchers better understand what phenomena their object detector might be confusing with oil slicks, the image patches without oil objects were sorted into several subgroups. On the other hand, for researchers looking to apply object detection models to oil slick detection but lacking a starting dataset, this dataset can serve as a valuable training resource.

 The TV-SAT signals received by the ground antennas of Satellite Microwave Links (SMLs) can be opportunistically used for identifying and quantifying precipitation. Hence, SMLs can serve as low-cost rainfall sensors complementary to conventional instruments. However, a significant challenge for opportunistic sensors, such as SMLs and their terrestrial counterpart, i.e., commercial microwave links (CMLs), stems from potential ownership issues, possibly hindering progress in the development of processing tools and validation studies. This underscores the critical need for open data. While CML open datasets are already available, there are no large SML datasets in public repositories.

Validation of sea ice concentration using Arctic sea ice charts from the US National Ice Center shows an overestimation of open-water SIC of up to 20 % in some places and an underestimation of SIC in sea ice covered regions near the ice edge. Validation also shows that local dynamical tie points (LDTP) improve the mapping of sea ice concentration for different types of ice, while estimates of the extent of sea ice are identical to the previous processing of the same data in Kolbe et al. (2024). A new set of quality control (QC) filters has been developed that discards far fewer data points (57.7 % reduction) than the filters in the previous processing. The data set therefore closes significant gaps in the sea ice concentration and sea ice extent record compared to the earlier data record. Of the 1.6 billion data points recorded by the satellite, 23.0 % have been discarded. 1136 days during the 1616-day period from 1972 to 1977 are covered (at least partly), which gives estimates of the mean monthly sea ice minimum and maximum extent in the Arctic and Antarctica during this period, except for some dropouts in 1973 and 1975."

Firstly, we integrated multiple publicly available crop mapping products within a harmonized framework that applies a unified cropland extent and cropping intensity, providing a systematic assessment of their consistency at pixel level. Consistency analysis results classify the study area into areas with consistency and areas with confusion, the latter serving as the mapping focus.

We contribute to bridging this gap by coupling a animal population model with a vegetation and thus enable future research in this topic. 
 Animal herbivory can have large and diverse impacts on vegetation and hence on the state and function of ecosystems. Despite this, quantitative understanding of vegetation responses to consumption of green leaf tissue by herbivores is currently lacking. The large-scale impacts of changes in herbivore abundance on ecosystem function have yet to be investigated. Process-based modelling can help to quantify how animals affect important processes, such as ecosystem carbon cycling. To do so, we linked the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS with Madingley, a model of multi-trophic functional diversity. This implementation allows us to simulate feedbacks between the availability of green vegetation biomass, herbivory and the whole trophic chain in response to monthly consumption of leaf biomass. In the coupled model system, we see an overall reduction in ecosystem productivity (NPP −5.2 %), leaf area index (−9.0 %) and carbon mass (−9.7 %), compared to the stand-alone version of LPJ-GUESS, with the highest impact on carbon mass in the boreal ecosystems (−42 %). We observe ecosystem composition to shift from boreal coniferous forests (without animals) to boreal mixed forests (with animals), as well as a general increase in herbaceous vegetation. Indirect effects like an increased light transfer facilitating growth of lower canopy layers are also captured by the model system. Overall, the results of this study underpin the important role of animals in ecosystem functioning and highlight the important contribution of process-based modelling towards a better understanding of complex food web interconnections."

Lecavalier;Kevin Hank;David Pollard,The glacial systems model (GSM) Version 25G,"We document the glacial system model (GSM), a 3D glaciological ice sheet systems model specifically designed for large ensemble modelling in glacial cycle contexts. The model is distinguished by the breadth of relevant processes represented for this context. This ranges from meltwater surface drainage with proglacial lake formation to state-of-the-art subglacial sediment production/transport/deposition. The other key distinguishing design feature is attention to addressing process uncertainties. 
 We document the glacial system model (GSM), which is designed for large ensemble ice sheet modelling in glacial cycle contexts.  A distinguishing feature is the extent to which it addresses relevant forcing and process uncertainties.  The GSM has evolved from three decades of effort to constrain the last glacial cycle evolution of each ice sheet that was present (North American, Greenlandic, Icelandic, Eurasian, Patagonian, and Antarctic, and soon Tibetan).  The core ice dynamics uses a hybrid shallow-shelf and shallow-ice approximation with full thermo-mechanical coupling. It also includes one of the largest range of relevant processes for the above context of any model to date, ranging from visco-elastic glacial isostatic adjustment with 0-order geoidal deflection to state-of-the-art subglacial sediment production, transport, and deposition. Furthermore, the GSM is to date the only model to have all of the above processes bidirectionally coupled with each other. Other relevant distinguishing features include: permafrost resolving bed-thermodynamics, a fast diagnostic solution of down-slope surface drainage and lake filling, subgrid hypsometric surface mass balance and ice flow, simple thermodynamic lake and sea ice representations, subglacial hydrology with dynamically evolving partitioning between distributed and channelized flow, and surface melt that physically accounts for insolation changes via a novel insolation above freezing scheme.To address the most challenging part of paleo ice sheet modelling, the GSM includes both a 2D energy balance climate model and variants of traditional input time series weighted interpolation (aka “glacial indexing”) of fields from General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations, all under ensemble parametric specification.  It also includes options for one and two way scripted coupling with climate models.We demonstrate the significant errors that can ensue in the glacial cycle simulation of a single ice sheet when three aspects of glacial isostatic adjustment are ignored (as is typical). These are geoidal deformation, global ice load input, and correction of initial topography for present-day isostatic disequilibrium.  We also draw attention to the relatively high sensitivity of the GSM (and presumably other ice sheet models) to the specification of the temperature dependence for basal sliding activation.The associated code archive includes configuration options for all major last glacial cycle ice sheets as well as idealized geometries and validation test setups."

Do;Daouda Ngom;Aude Valade,Sensitivity of a Sahelian groundwater-based agroforestry system to tree density and water availability using the land surface model ORCHIDEE (r7949),"Agroforestry in the Sahel help store carbon and support food production, but land surface models struggle to capture their dynamics. We adapted the ORCHIDEE model to simulate Faidherbia albida, a tree that taps deep groundwater. This work highlights the need to integrate deep water uptake in land surface models for groundwater-dependent ecosystems, as it could enhance predictions, helping to sustain agroforestry in a changing climate. 
 The Sahel region is characterized by its semi-arid climate and open-canopy agroforestry systems, which play an important role in global carbon dynamics. Parkland agroforestry has the potential to sequester carbon at an average rate of 0.4 tC ha−1 yr−1, which, if expanded to its maximum potential extent, would correspond to an additional carbon stock of approximately 558 TgC compared to treeless croplands. However, land surface models (LSM) used in global climate modeling struggle to represent carbon dynamics in these ecosystems due to the inadequate representation of deep-roots tapping groundwater during dry periods, key environmental control for many agroforestry systems such as the widespread parklands based on the phreatophytic species Faidherbia albida. This study explores the sensitivity of Faidherbia albida parklands to tree density and water availability (rainfall and soil water content in the capillary fringe of the groundwater table) using a new configuration of the ORCHIDEE LSM. To this aim, the ORCHIDEE LSM was modified to simulate the growth of Faidherbia albida by simulating its inverted phenology based on forced temporal series of soil water content of soil layers between 4 and 5 m and water saturation below 5 m and by adjusting the photosynthesis and carbon allocation parameters for Faidherbia albida and associated crops. The model was evaluated against independent eddy covariance and meteorological data from the Niakhar agroforestry site in Senegal. Simulation outputs were analyzed in terms of leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H) and net radiation (Rn). The model simulated tree GPP of 4.08 ± 0.21 tC ha−1 yr−1 compared to observed GPP of 5.06 ± 0.49 tC ha−1 yr−1. For croplands, the model produced GPP of 7.97 ± 0.89 tC ha−1 yr−1 compared to observed values of 7.78 ± 1.75 tC ha−1 yr−1. Simulations revealed that tree density positively influenced annual carbon uptake but reduced crop harvest at highest tree densities, indicating a trade-off between carbon sequestration and crop yield. Sensitivity analyses showed that interannual variability in soil water content in the capillary fringe of the groundwater table and rainfall influenced differently crop, tree and ecosystem carbon and energy fluxes. Despite its strengths, the model exhibited limited responsiveness of tree productivity to soil water content variability in the capillary fringe of the groundwater table, highlighting the need for enhanced representation of water uptake by tree roots in the model. These findings emphasize the importance of accurately modeling both surface soil water and groundwater dynamics and phenology to predict the responses of semi-arid agroforestry systems to climate variability. This study enhances our understanding of carbon and energy flux partitioning in complex, water-stressed and groundwater dependent agroforestry systems."

The model includes a single-layer aquifer and is designed to capture long-term mean groundwater dynamics under varying climate types. The manuscript describes the model structure, input datasets, and evaluation against available observations. 
 Groundwater plays a critical role in regulating the global hydrological cycle and serves as the most stable freshwater resource for human daily water consumption. However, many global water models, including H08, a global water model considering human water use activities, downplay the groundwater component, i.e., the underground aquifer is often described as a simple lumped model where no lateral groundwater movement or the water table is represented. Here, we present a global H08-MODFLOW groundwater model (H08-GM), built at a five-arcmin spatial resolution, aiming to enhance the capability of the original H08 model in simulating groundwater flows. We describe the basic model setups and simulations under steady-state conditions in this paper. The Local One-At-A-Time (OAT) Sensitivity Tests are first conducted to select the best-run model simulations against in-situ observations. At the global scale, all model runs demonstrate overall good performance of groundwater head, whereas perform poorly in simulating Water Table Depth (WTD, groundwater table below land surface), which is shown to be a common issue in other global groundwater models. Our analysis also reveals two complementary global relationships: one between groundwater depth and topographic slope, and another along gradients of human activity (irrigation and population), together demonstrating how natural and anthropogenic processes jointly control the spatial distribution of WTD. We further use the model to reveal the mechanisms controlling groundwater flow dynamics and present the global cell-to-cell net groundwater lateral flow map. We found that the magnitude of the net groundwater lateral flow in some regions is non-negligible to annual groundwater recharge. This highlights the important role of the lateral groundwater flow in maintaining the regional water budget. The steady-state simulation from this study provides the necessary initial condition for the transient simulations, which is essentially important to analyze the global groundwater decline trends and will be presented in another paper. Although developed in the one-way coupled manner, the H08-GM model can provide a powerful tool for large-scale groundwater studies, which enables direct comparison with other groundwater models joined the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), and is essential to advance the development of the next-generation global water models."

We also show how simulations can more efficiently meet applications needs by targeting appropriate resolution, time slices, experiments and variable groups. 
 The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 7 (CMIP7) undertook an extensive process to gather community input and refine data requests related to impacts and adaptation applications of Earth System Model (ESM) outputs. The Impacts and Adaptation (I&A) Data Request Team worked with CMIP7 leadership to distribute an open solicitation across many communities that use climate model outputs requesting inputs for new and existing variables, the most applicable temporal characteristics, and groupings of variables that together allow for specific application opportunities. This input was then collated and translated into CMIP7 standard templates for inclusion in the broader data request, leading to 13 I&A data request opportunities, 60 variable groups and 539 unique variables sought by vulnerability, impacts, adaptation, and climate services user communities. Here, we describe these opportunities and variable groups, as well as new insights into how ESM groups can prioritize outputs that set off a chain of further analyses, ultimately informing decisions impacting society and natural systems. These include an emphasis on high-resolution outputs to allow further modeling of climate impacts at regional and local scales, improved representation of extreme weather events, enhanced accuracy of downscaling and bias-adjustment techniques, and support for more detailed assessments for decision-making in adaptation and mitigation strategies. There is also broad interest in more extensive provisioning of two-dimensional variables at the Earth's surface, prioritizing experiments that enhance our understanding of both the recent past and future scenarios, and providing outputs that allow further downscaling and bias adjustment. We emphasize that variable groups are the fundamental level at which to engage with the I&A data request, matching the scale of input and the way output provision enables specific I&A applications. Given resource constraints, we applaud CMIP7 efforts to foster strong engagement and communication between ESM groups and the I&A team to build consensus around prudent compromises in priority variables, temporal resolutions, simulation experiments, time subsets, and ensemble members."

 The Sargasso Sea, at the centre of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, draws its name from the endemic floating brown macroalgae, Sargassum, which provides shelter and habitat for life in the pelagic zone. In 2011, the Sargassum footprint expanded to include the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in the tropical Atlantic, but little is known about how Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea changed thereafter. Here we use satellite and in situ data to show that Sargassum in the north Sargasso Sea has declined dramatically since 2015. Accompanying this decline is a disruption in local Sargassum seasonal growth cycles, whereby the previously consistent fall-to-winter north Sargasso Sea biomass maxima have shifted to spring-to-summer peaks that mirror those of the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt—a result of advection from this latter region. We posit that the north Sargasso Sea decline is due to reduced Sargassum supply from a historical Gulf of Mexico source region, possibly attributable to increasing sea surface temperatures and more frequent marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Mexico. Together, proliferation in the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt and decline in the north Sargasso Sea may represent the beginnings of a regime shift in Sargassum distribution.

 The Great Oxidation Event across the Archaean–Proterozoic transition was one of the most transformative environmental changes in Earth history. However, uncertainties remain about when and where it began. Here we synthesize the phylogenetic record of cyanobacteria and geochemical records of nitrogen and thallium isotopes and find converging evidence for oxygenated bottom waters on marine shelves in the Neoarchaean about 200 million years before the Great Oxidation Event. The O2 was produced by benthic microbial mats, the dominant morphotypes of cyanobacteria at that time. Conditions were sufficiently oxidizing to stabilize nitrate and manganese oxides in sediments. Box modelling shows that micromolar levels of dissolved O2 were attainable in this scenario under plausible Archaean conditions. The rise of O2 was initiated on marine mud according to our synthesis. Productive Neoarchaean shelves may have been more oxidizing at the bottom than the top, consistent with the ‘upside down’ Archaean biosphere hypothesis.

 DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s), formed by guanine-rich sequences in mammalian genomes, are non-canonical structures implicated in gene regulation. However, their strand-specific genomic distribution and mechanistic roles in transcription remain poorly understood. Here, we report a strand-specific G4 sequencing (ssG4-seq) method for global profiling of G4 structures across multiple mammalian genomes. This method faithfully recapitulates known G4 structures and identifies thousands of previously unannotated G4s in human K562 cells. Remarkably, over 95% of G4s are located at enhancers and promoters across species, with promoters containing dual-strand G4s exhibiting significantly stronger transcriptional activation compared to those with single-strand G4s. Mechanistically, we identify SP1 as a potent G4 reader that facilitates transcription by modulating enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cancer-associated mutations can destabilize G4 structures, impair SP1-mediated chromatin interactions, and contribute to tumorigenesis. Our study demonstrates the power of ssG4-seq in elucidating G4 functions in gene regulation and disease. DNA G-quadruplexes help regulate genes, but their strand-specific roles are unclear.

The study shows that PGK1-serine axis regulates and drives aging and damage of podocytes. 
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue, with podocyte injury with senescence playing a central role in glomerulosclerosis. This study investigates the link between glycolysis-derived serine metabolism and podocyte injury with senescence, focusing on the role of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in the regulation of L-serine synthesis and podocyte homeostasis. Using in vivo and in vitro models, we examined the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced metabolic dysregulation on serine metabolism and its impact on podocyte function. The results demonstrate that Ang II downregulates PGK1 expression through the transcription factor FOXA1, leading to reduced L-serine biosynthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased cellular senescence in podocytes. Supplementing with L-serine or enhancing PGK1 expression in podocytes alleviated these pathological changes, restored mitochondrial function, and reduced senescence-associated phenotypes in CKD mouse models. Moreover, PGK1 was found to interact with keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1 (KRT1), stabilizing the cytoskeletal integrity of podocytes. These findings identify a novel metabolic pathway linking glycolysis, serine metabolism, and podocyte injury with senescence, suggesting that targeting the PGK1-serine axis may offer therapeutic potential for slowing podocyte senescence and CKD progression.

 Combinatorial optimization underpins applications in artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design, yet classical techniques such as greedy search and dynamic programming struggle to balance efficiency and solution quality at scale. We present a probabilistic framework that embeds true random number generators based on spin-transfer-torque magnetic tunnel junctions into a greedy solver. Intrinsic stochastic switching enables configurable random number distributions, which we use to inject controlled randomness via a temperature parameter that interpolates between deterministic and stochastic choices, balancing exploration and exploitation. Applied to the traveling salesman problem, the framework yields high-quality tours and outperforms simulated annealing and genetic algorithms in solution quality and convergence speed. In larger instances with up to 70 cities, it maintains its advantage, reaching near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational cost. These results show that hardware true randomness with tunable statistics can improve heuristic search and motivate integrated, energy-efficient probabilistic hardware for scalable optimization.

 Aqueous zinc metal batteries often encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under thermal environments, primarily due to the severe side reactions caused by aqueous electrolytes. Here, an organic-inorganic-H2O multiphase aqueous soggy sand electrolyte is reported to enhance high-temperature performance of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Soggy sand components form strong interactions between the heterogeneous phases, reconstructing hydrogen-bond networks and forming water-deficient solvation structures, which greatly limits water activity and improves thermal stability, eliminating parasitic reactions and inspiring a uniform Zn deposition at elevated temperatures. As a result, multiphase aqueous soggy sand electrolyte enables aqueous zinc metal batteries to achieve an operating temperature of 140 °C, a lifespan of 1700 cycles, and a current density of 8 A g−1. More importantly, the application of this electrolyte allows the stable cycling of Zn metal pouch cells under continuous operation at elevated temperatures.

 A thorough understanding of vegetation resilience to climate variability is critical for sustaining ecosystem functions and terrestrial carbon sinks. Although the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a key driver of global extreme weather events and vegetation dynamics, its impacts on vegetation resilience remain unclear. Here we estimate global present-day (1981–2018) and future (2015–2100) vegetation resilience using a lag-1 autocorrelation analysis of global leaf area index (LAI) time series and investigate its teleconnection to ENSO. Our findings reveal that ENSO significantly affects vegetation resilience across 53% of the global vegetated area. Within these regions, 15% are linked primarily to large-scale atmospheric synchrony with ENSO, 51% are mainly shaped by ENSO-driven local climate anomalies, and the remaining 34% are influenced by both processes. Future projections suggest that the area impacted via ENSO-driven climate anomalies may expand by 7-10%, with Eastern Siberia and northern North America newly affected. Our study provides a coherent global assessment of vegetation resilience sensitivity to ENSO, identifies teleconnected hotspots and potential influential pathways, and informs targeted restoration and climate-adaptive ecosystem governance under climate change.

Here, authors introduce a urea-based hydrotrope to create a high-concentration ferrous sulfate electrolyte, enabling stable, dendrite-free cycling and advancing cost-effective, sustainable energy storage. 
 Iron metal-based energy storage devices hold great potential in stationary grid-scale sustainable energy due to the high theoretical specific capacity, ultralow cost, and abundance of iron. However, their practical deployment is limited by the poor reversibility of iron plating and stripping, as well as competitive hydrogen evolution. Here we introduce the concept of hydrotropy into iron electrolytes by developing an environmentally friendly and cost-effective high-concentration ferrous sulfate electrolyte using urea as a hydrotropic agent. The designed electrolyte increases the Coulombic efficiency of iron metal electrodes to approximately 96.5%, compared with ~84.6% for the dilute electrolyte. Molecular dynamics simulations and Raman spectroscopy illustrate that urea regulates the competitive coordination of anions and urea in the iron solvation sheath, while reconstructing the hydrogen-bond network in free water molecules. This reduces the activity of both solvated and free water, thereby alleviating hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the coordinated anions and urea molecules facilitate the in-situ formation of an organic-inorganic hybrid protective layer on the metallic iron, establishing a physical barrier against water and promoting homogeneous interfacial reactions. This work demonstrates an appealing opportunity to design cost-effective and high-performance electrolytes and propels the practical application of iron metal-based energy storage devices.

 Accurate prediction of biomolecular complex structures is fundamental for understanding biological processes and rational therapeutic design. Recent advances in deep learning methods, particularly all-atom structure prediction models, have significantly expanded their capabilities to include diverse biomolecular entities, such as proteins, nucleic acids, ligands, and ions. However, comprehensive benchmarks covering multiple interaction types and molecular diversity remain scarce, limiting fair and rigorous assessment of model performance and generalizability. To address this gap, we introduce FoldBench, an extensive benchmark dataset consisting of 1522 biological assemblies categorized into nine distinct prediction tasks. Our evaluations reveal critical performance dependencies, showing that ligand docking accuracy notably diminishes as ligand similarity to the training set decreases, a pattern similarly observed in protein-protein interaction modeling. Furthermore, antibody-antigen predictions remain particularly challenging, with current methods exhibiting failure rates exceeding 50%. Among evaluated models, AlphaFold 3 consistently demonstrates superior accuracy across the majority of tasks.

 Many mountain belts - such as the Pyrenees, European Alps, Greater Caucasus, or Atlas - form through inversion of pre-collisional extensional basins. These orogens exhibit three-dimensional complexity, with along-strike variations in topography, orientation, and deformation patterns. Yet, the relationship between these characteristics and the inherited extensional architecture remains enigmatic. Here, we use 3D geodynamic models coupled to a landscape evolution model to investigate how pre-collisional rift-linkage controls rift inversion and mountain belt evolution. Our results show that initial mountain belt structure reflects the inherited basin geometry, while later growth is governed by subduction polarity. This polarity depends on the magnitude of basin offset and the presence of pre-existing structural weaknesses. Comparison with natural examples suggests that along-strike variations observed in the Greater Caucasus, Atlas, and Pyrenees can be explained by the inversion of segmented and offset rift basins. Building on these insights, we propose a simple diagnostic framework that establishes a direct link between topography and deep lithospheric structures, showing how extensional inheritance influences mountain building on Earth.

 The electrochemical co-reduction of abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrates (NO3−) offers a more sustainable strategy for synthesizing urea, which is a critical nitrogen source for fertilizers.

The as-prepared catalyst demonstrates excellent performance for the co-reduction of CO2 and NO3− to urea. At −0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, the production rate of urea can reach 140 μmol h−1 cm−2 (~42,000 mg h−1 gcat−1), with a Faradaic efficiency toward urea of 55.3%. A total of 0.53 g of pure urea was generated over a 25-cm2 IL@Cu-ZIF-8 electrode after 5 h of electrolysis.

Here this work shows an organic formulation that is non-corrosive and delivers better performance, opening vast chemical space for electrolyte design. 
 The transition to clean energy necessitates the development of alternative or complementary battery chemistries to lithium-ion batteries. Aluminium (Al) metal batteries (AMBs) are a promising option owing to their high energy density and advantages in terms of abundance, recyclability, manufacturability and sustainability. However, state-of-the-art AMBs rely primarily on electrolytes featuring chloroaluminate anions such as Al2Cl7−. Unfortunately, such electrolytes create a disparity between achievable energy density and potential, in addition to having high corrosivity, high cost, high viscosity and poor transport kinetics. Here we break this paradigm by formulating an organochloro electrolyte with AlCl3 salt in dipropyl ether (DPE) solvent. Notably, this AlCl3/DPE electrolyte shows no corrosion behaviour towards stainless steel current collectors during 90-day soaking. It enables stable cycling of the Al anode for over 2,000 h at 0.2 mA cm−2 and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85%, and prototype Al//Mo6S8 full cells survive 300 cycles. Underlying these unprecedented performances is the unique organochloro solvation structure, AlCl2(DPE)2+, which is desolvatable and immobilizes free Cl−. By extending the horizon of electrolyte design into the organic domain, this work addresses the notorious issues facing AMBs and paves the way for the implementation of multivalent rechargeable batteries. Despite various advantages of aluminium batteries, their application is hindered by the use of ionic liquid electrolytes. Here this work shows an organic formulation that is non-corrosive and delivers better performance, opening vast chemical space for electrolyte design."

 Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) was used for the first time to track the sources of acoustic signals associated with triggered lightning. A 4.2-km-long optical fiber cable, encompassing the lightning triggering site, was recast as 2100 acoustic sensors using the DAS technique to advance understanding of lightning processes. Two lightning flashes with return strokes and one without a return stroke were recorded. Thunder sources during three triggered lightning flashes were reconstructed in three-dimensional space with high precision using high-frequency DAS observations. The location accuracy near the ground surface reached ~30 m, taking high-speed video observations as reference. DAS provides an acoustic imprint of lightning polarity asymmetry. Moreover, DAS recordings revealed that thunder events mainly originate from the return stroke process rather than the leaders. Our results demonstrate that DAS, as a novel acoustic observation technology, can clearly identify and accurately locate thunder sources, yielding new insights into the origins and development of triggered lightning."

 Previous studies using an emergent constraint have suggested that climate models underestimate the winter jet stream response to sea ice loss, casting doubt on the quality of mid-latitude climate projections. However, the robustness of this emergent constraint has been questioned. Here, we propose a more robust emergent constraint based on lower stratospheric winds. Using coordinated sea ice loss experiments with bespoke versions of two state-of-the-art climate models along with a multi-model archive, we identify a strong relationship between these winds and the jet stream response. The new emergent constraint reduces the uncertainty in the response by 62% and indicates that the real-world response closely matches the multi-model mean—suggesting no systematic underestimation, in contrast to earlier studies. Our results underscore the importance of reducing lower stratospheric wind biases and increase confidence in climate model projections of a future poleward shift of the jet stream in response to global warming."

 While ecological shifts in lakes within populated regions are often attributed to local or regional human activities, the impact of large-scale (e.g., hemispheric or global) anthropogenic forces on the ecology of extremely remote lakes remains unclear. Here we present a well-dated diatom record from Shuanghu Lake in the Altai Mountains, spanning the past 2400 years with a ~ 20-year resolution. This record, together with elemental data, vegetation cover reconstruction, and historical emission records from upwind Europe, enables us to examine the response of lake ecology to natural climate change and human activities. Our results indicate an ecological shift around 1870 CE, primarily due to lake acidification and eutrophication induced by the transport and deposition of European air pollutants. These findings suggest that even extremely remote lakes may experience ecological shifts driven by hemispheric-scale anthropogenic influences, providing valuable insights for ecologically sustainable development from a long-term and global perspective.

 Human activities are expected to delay the next glacial inception because of the long atmospheric lifetime of anthropogenic CO2. Here we present Earth system model simulations for the next 200,000 years with dynamic ice sheets and interactive atmospheric CO2, exploring how emissions will impact a future glacial inception. Historical emissions (500 PgC) are unlikely to delay inception, expected to occur under natural conditions around 50,000 years from now, while a doubling of current emissions (1000 PgC) would delay inception for another 50,000 years. Inception is generally expected within the next 200,000 years for emissions up to 5000 PgC. Our model results show that assumptions about the long-term balance of geological carbon sources and sinks has a strong impact on the timing of the next glacial inception, while millennial-scale variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation influences the exact timing.

 Billions of birds have adapted to traveling life, with the atmosphere playing an essential role in their migration. In Asia, monsoons represent a dominant large-scale circulation that may shape migration along the East Asia-Australasian Flyway. Here we combined satellite tracking of three migratory shorebirds, including Chinese egrets (Egretta eulophotes), Vega gulls (Larus vegae), and pied avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta), with analyses of monsoon index to examine how wind influence migration. We estimated flight speeds, energy use and atmosphere circulation patterns to assess the contribution of monsoon winds. The results reveal that monsoon provides substantial support to migratory shorebirds, enhancing flight speeds and reducing energetic costs, and the initiation of migration is associated with synchronous changes in monsoons systems. We suggest the monsoon creates continuous wind fields, and forms wind expressways for migratory birds in East Asia.

 The Main Marmara Fault (MMF), a major strand of the North Anatolian Fault beneath the Sea of Marmara, includes a 150 km locked segment that poses a critical seismic risk to İstanbul, a megacity of over 15 million people. Although significant progress has been made in characterizing rupture segmentation along the MMF, the underlying physical controls remain poorly understood. Here, we use seismic cycle simulations to explore the influence of along-strike variations in sediment thickness and temperature on earthquake rupture and recurrence behavior. We construct a three-dimensional rheological model by integrating regional heat flow and laboratory-derived frictional properties for basement rocks and basin sediments. The simulations reproduce key features of the historical seismic record, including the 1766 and 1912 M > 7 earthquakes. A rheological barrier in the Central Basin segment associated with the thick sedimentary cover and a regional thermal anomaly restricts earthquake size and the multiple fault bends influence epicentral locations. Over 10,000 years of simulated seismic cycles, earthquakes do not exceed M 7.3. Earthquake hazard in the Marmara region is controlled by the interaction between fault geometry and rheology, underscoring the need for integrated structural, thermal, and lithological models in seismic hazard assessment.

 Instability at volcanic edifices poses significant hazards, yet the processes driving rock weakening, particularly on steep, eroding flanks, remain poorly understood due to limited accessibility. Hydrothermal alteration is a key factor in weakening volcanic rocks, contributing to edifice destabilization and flank instability. La Fossa cone (Vulcano, Italy) provides an ideal setting for this study, with accessible hydrothermal alteration at the crater rim and similar alteration along inaccessible flanks that have a recent history of mass wasting. Here, we developed an integrated methodology combining drone photogrammetry with in situ Schmidt hammer testing to derive an empirical alteration-to-strength relationship for the crater rim and applied this knowledge to alteration sites on inaccessible flanks. An alteration map was generated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to aid our classifications. This map was used to transpose over 1000 Schmidt hammer measurements (R-values ranging from 10.5 to 82), creating a thematic strength-alteration map. Results indicate a ~50% reduction in relative rock strength correlating with areas of degassing and hydrothermal activity, which coincides with past mass-wasting events. This integrated approach offers a transferable workflow for assessing volcanic slope instability, with direct applications to hazard monitoring and early warning systems.

 The first wave of the second plague pandemic, the Black Death, claimed much of Europe’s human population in just a few years after 1347 CE. While it is accepted that the causative bacterium Yersinia pestis originated from wildlife rodent populations in central Asia and reached Europe via the Black Sea region, reasons for the timing, spread and virulence of the onset of the Black Death are still debated. Here, we argue that a post-volcanic climate downturn and trans-Mediterranean famine from 1345–1347 CE forced the Italian maritime republics of Venice, Genoa and Pisa to activate their well-established supply network and import grain from the Mongols of the Golden Horde around the Sea of Azov in 1347 CE. This climate-driven change in long-distance grain trade not only prevented large parts of Italy from starvation but also introduced the plague bacterium to Mediterranean harbours and fueled its rapid dispersal across much of Europe.
