This paper describes a systematic evidence synthesis of climate action (co)benefits and trade-offs as well as the development of a decision-support tool that enables policy makers to explore that evidence-base. The term ‘(co)benefit’ is used deliberately to encompass both the direct benefits of averted impacts due to climate change as well as the indirect or ancillary benefits resulting from mitigation and adaptation interventions. We conducted a systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, Web of Science, and the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change Reports. Our search strategy prioritised synthesised evidence (e.g. reviews, assessments) excluding primary studies and single case-studies. Data were extracted from 74 distinct records meeting our inclusion criteria and a total of 1785 rows of evidence were analysed. Scientific and technical teams then worked together to develop a tool interface that underwent iterative testing among a small group of potential users. The resulting (Co)Benefits Portal presents an assessment of the available scientific evidence of health, ecosystem, economic, energy, and socio-cultural (co)benefits and trade-offs associated with 40 different mitigation and adaptation actions for both global and regional scales. We then apply the (Co)Benefits Portal into a UK context, in combination with national policy documents and departmental guidance, to connect evidence about relevant climate interventions and reveal cross-sectoral policy implications that are essential for optimising opportunities and avoiding risks. We discuss how evidence-based tools can be developed to bridge critical climate adaptation and mitigation research, policy, and decision-making gaps."

As global warming intensifies, MHWs are expected to become more extreme, emphasizing the need for precise model evaluations and deeper understanding of the underlying causes of bias to improve MHW simulations. In this study, we evaluated the MHW intensity simulated by 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models in the North Pacific Ocean by comparing them with the optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) dataset over a 33 year period (1982–2014). Over 80% of the CMIP6 models showed a dipole-pattern bias in the mean MHW intensity over the Kuroshio Extension, characterized by overestimation to the north and underestimation to the south. Hierarchical clustering based on the spatial pattern of the intensity bias in the Kuroshio Extension identifies four distinct clusters: two showing a dipole-pattern bias with slightly different magnitudes and the other two showing weaker or stronger intensity. The separation latitude based on the maximum surface current revealed that the models with the dipole bias pattern simulated the northward overshooting of the Kuroshio Current. This northward overshooting likely enhanced the transport of warmer sea surface temperatures to higher latitudes, thereby intensifying the MHWs. These findings highlight the critical role of ocean currents in the simulation of MHW in the western boundary current regions, including the Kuroshio region."

The effectiveness of diversification, however, may be diminished if there is a threshold above which compensatory changes are weakened and species abundance tends to move in the same direction. We analyse this hypothesis using data from an open-access artisanal fishery in an estuarine ecosystem, located in a Colombian Biosphere. Reserve. We find evidence of a threshold in salinity levels in the 25–30 g kg−1 range for most gears employed in the fishery. Below the threshold, catch diversification stabilises the mean catch rate, but above it, catch rates decline. The evidence of a threshold defining a high salinity conditions regime calls for the adoption of adaptive fishery management strategies, as well as social protection mechanisms for vulnerable fishers."

Multi-member ensemble average over single-model large ensemble (LE) simulations is frequently used to isolate an externally-forced climate response from internal variability, but whether it can cleanly extract the forced ENSO response to greenhouse warming remains unclear. Using eight LE models, here we show that compared to low-frequency fitting methods that can be applied directly to observation and a single-member simulation, the ensemble-mean detrending approach induces spurious SST variability in the equatorial Pacific, resulting in an underestimated ENSO amplitude response to greenhouse warming. The source of spurious variability relates to a residual effect associated with ENSO nonlinear rectification, which is inherently unavoidable though its influence decreases with ensemble size. Our finding highlights the importance of ENSO nonlinearity in choosing specific ways of detrending for ENSO-related projection studies."

However, the effects of these movements on cold extremes remain understudied. This study classifies the movements of atmospheric blocking into westward-moving, eastward-moving, and quasi-stationary across different regions during winters from 1979/80–2020/21 and investigates their respective impacts on surface air temperature. We found that, in the western North Pacific, westward-moving blocking events exhibited the highest frequency, while other regions showed quasi-stationary blocking occurring most frequently. These results reveal the regional difference in the frequency of blocking movement types, but the blocking persistence showed a common characteristic across all regions, with westward-moving blocking events persisting longer compared to other types. Interestingly, these long-lasting and westward-moving blockings were associated with notable cold temperature anomalies in downstream areas during blocking dissipation phase. This arises from the enhanced advection of high-latitude mean cold temperature by blocking-induced wind anomalies at low levels, despite their relatively low occurrences. These characteristics were successfully reproduced in Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble (CESM1-LENS) simulations, suggesting that better understanding of blocking mobility can improve our ability to predict extreme cold winters."

Menang;Stefan A. Buehler;Lukas Kluft;Robin J. Hogan;Florian E. Roemer,Variation in shortwave water vapour continuum and impact on clear-sky shortwave radiative feedback,"We investigated the impact of the shortwave water vapour continuum absorption on clear-sky shortwave radiative feedback. For current temperatures, the impact is modest (<2%). In a warmer world, continuum-induced uncertainty in estimated feedback would be up to ~5%. Representing continuum absorption with the widely used semi-empirical model in radiative transfer calculations leads to an underestimation of this feedback. Constraining the shortwave continuum will help reduce these discrepancies. 
 This work assesses the impact of the current differences in the strength of the shortwave water vapour continuum on clear-sky calculations of shortwave radiative feedback. Three continuum models were used: the MT_CKD (Mlawer–Tobin–Clough–Kneizys–Davies; versions 2.5 and 4.1.1) and CAVIAR_updated (Continuum Absorption at Visible and Infrared Wavelengths and its Atmospheric Relevance) models. Radiative transfer calculations were performed with the ECMWF radiation scheme (“ecRad”). The correlated k-distribution gas-optics tables required for ecRad computations were trained with each of these continuum models using the ECMWF correlated k-distribution software tool. The gas-optics tables trained with the different continuum models were tested individually in the shortwave. The atmosphere configuration was as follows: fixed surface temperatures (TS) between 270 and 330 K, fixed relative humidity at 80 %, a moist adiabatic lapse rate for the tropospheric temperature, and an isothermal stratosphere with the tropopause temperature fixed at 175 K. At TS = 288 K, it was found that the revisions of the MT_CKD model in the shortwave over the last decade and a half have a modest effect (∼ 0.3 %) on the estimated shortwave feedback. Compared to MT_CKD_4.1.1, the stronger CAVIAR_updated model has a relatively greater impact; the shortwave feedback is ∼ 0.006 W m−2 K−1 (∼ 1.6 %) more positive. Thus, for the clear-sky situation investigated, uncertainties due to the shortwave continuum are insignificant for the present-day climate. The uncertainty in the shortwave feedback increases up to 0.008 W m−2 K−1 (∼ 2.0 %) between the MT_CKD models and 0.018 W m−2 K−1 (∼ 4.6 %) between the CAVIAR_updated and MT_CKD_4.1.1 models at TS ≈ 300 K. At TS ≈ 300 K, a large portion of shortwave feedback originates at windows where CAVIAR_updated and MT_CKD_4.1.1 differ substantially, leading to the larger feedback uncertainty."

The impact of this process on several climate variables is studied, showing, in particular, significant changes in long-wave radiation and daily surface minimum temperature. Other changes in atmospheric fields are also simulated. The findings of this study highlight the importance of incorporating aerosol scattering in the long-wave spectrum in climate models. 
 The few studies that considered aerosol scattering in the long-wave (LW) typically relied on using simple corrective factors instead of including it in the radiative code. To analyse the climatic effects of physically accounting for this process, simulations have been performed with the ARPEGE-Climat atmospheric global climate model over the 1985–2014 period using the ecRad radiation scheme and updated optical properties of coarse aerosols, particularly dust. The evaluation of the model coarse-aerosol optical depth (AOD) against AERONET data over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula shows the ability of ARPEGE-Climat to capture spatio-temporal variations in coarse AOD despite regional biases. The comparison of simulations with and without LW aerosol scattering shows that this process leads to a significant increase in downwelling surface LW radiation in dust-emitting regions (+5 W m−2 on average) between March and September, correlated with the largest coarse AOD. This increase results in a rise in minimum near-surface temperatures of up to +1 °C. It is also associated with an outgoing LW radiation decrease at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). However, during certain months and in certain regions, near-surface temperatures can be significantly reduced due to short-wave surface radiation decreases related to increases in low-level clouds. A precipitation increase over Sahel during September, linked to wetter atmospheric layers, is also simulated. Neglecting LW aerosol scattering in climate simulations therefore has significant impacts on climate, notably in dust-emitting regions. Globally, the LW aerosol-scattering contribution to radiation is 0.4 W m−2 at both the surface and TOA."

This paper presents the most comprehensive observational review of ozone distributions and evolution over East Asia and Southeast Asia across different spatiotemporal scales in the past two decades, which will have important implications for assessing ozone impacts on public health and crop yields and for developing future ozone control strategies. 
 The high level of ozone throughout the troposphere is an emerging concern for East Asia and Southeast Asia. Here, we analyze available surface ozone measurements from the past two decades (2005–2021) over eight countries, with 10 ozonesonde and aircraft measurements within this region. At the surface, the seasonal mean ozone over 2017–2021 varies from 30 nmol mol−1 (i.e., 30 ppb) in Southeast Asia to 75 nmol mol−1 in summer in northern China. The metric of seasonal 95th percentile ozone can identify the multiple hot spots of ozone pollution of over 85 nmol mol−1 in Southeast Asia. The new World Health Organization (WHO) peak-season ozone standard indicates that both East Asia and Southeast Asia face a widespread risk of long-term exposure. The surface ozone increase in South Korea and Southeast Asia from 2005 was leveling off or even decreasing in the past decade, while the ozone increase in the 2000s over China has amplified since 2013. Surface ozone trends in Japan and Mongolia were flat in the past decade. In the troposphere, the available measurements show an overall increasing tendency at different altitudes from a three-decade perspective, although the trend in the past decade remains unclear due to data availability. The difference in the tropospheric ozone level between East Asia and Southeast Asia is likely due to the high background ozone from the stratospheric intrusion over Northeast Asia. In terms of ozone controls, our results suggest that anthropogenic emissions determine the occurrence of high ozone levels, but the underappreciated strong ozone climate penalty, particularly over Southeast Asia, will make ozone controls harder under a warmer climate."

During the summer monsoon season, d-excess and δ18O mainly reflect the effect of raindrop evaporation which leads to lower vapor δ18O but higher d-excess values. These findings provide new insights into using water isotopes to track moisture sources and dynamics over the TP. 
 The Southeast Tibetan Plateau (SETP) has experienced a significant drying trend in recent decades, which is likely linked to shifts in moisture sources. To investigate the roles of ocean surface evaporation, continental air mass intrusion, and precipitation-vapor interactions, we present a three-year daily time series of near-surface vapor δ18O and d-excess data from the SETP station. Our analysis reveals that apparent negative correlations between d-excess and relative humidity over the Indian Ocean are primarily due to anticorrelated seasonal cycles, which become insignificant or marginal when examined seasonally. This result underscores the need for caution in interpreting d-excess as a conservative tracer of ocean surface evaporation. Instead, we identify local and upstream specific humidity as the primary determinants of non-monsoon season d-excess variability, which is influenced by the intrusion of cold and dry air from upper levels. During the summer monsoon season, both d-excess and δ18O reflect the effect of raindrop evaporation during transport, which decreases δ18O but increases d-excess. These findings offer new insights into the use of water isotopes to track moisture sources and circulation changes across the SETP, especially under varying seasonal circulation systems. In particular, the findings for d-excess will contribute to our understanding of shifts in moisture sources and provide a framework for interpreting d-excess in various hydroclimatic applications, including ice core studies."

Our results also demonstrate that atmospheric photooxidation may represent a significant source of black-carbon-like substances. 
 Biomass and coal combustion represent substantial contributors to atmospheric water-soluble organic matter (WSOM). This was exposed to intense photochemical oxidation once it entered the atmospheric environment, but the resulting changes in WSOM are largely unclear. This study examines the changes in the optical properties, fluorophores, and molecular composition of WSOM derived from the combustion of biomass, specifically rice straw (RS) and coal from Yulin (YL) during aqueous photolysis and hydroxyl radical (•OH) photooxidation. The results indicate that photochemical aging induces distinct changes in the light-absorbing properties of RS and YL WSOM, characterized by pronounced photobleaching in RS WSOM and photoenhancement in YL WSOM. Additionally, more pronounced alterations were observed during •OH photooxidation than direct photolysis, for both RS and YL WSOM. Furthermore, a greater proportion of molecules in both RS (61.6 %) and YL (65.0 %) WSOM was degraded during •OH photooxidation compared to photolysis (14.9 % and 23.1 %, respectively), resulting in products with a larger molecular weight and higher oxidation levels, including tannin-like substances and newly formed compounds that are similar to black carbon, whereas the products of photolysis were characterized by a relatively minor alteration. These findings provide new insights into the photochemical evolution of combustion-derived WSOM and help to predict its effects in environmental and climatic changes."

We find that future emissions vary widely across emission projections, with differences in sectoral emission distributions. Using the Oslo chemical transport model, we show that air pollution exposure in some regions of Africa could increase significantly by 2050, increasing pollution-related deaths, with most scenarios projecting aerosol-induced warming over sub-Saharan Africa. 
 Limited data availability and distinct regional characteristics of sources lead to a wide range of future aerosol emission projections for Africa. Here, we quantify and explore the implications of this spread for climate and health impact assessments. Using the Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSE), the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) emission projections, we find high scenario diversity and regional heterogeneity in projected air pollution emissions across Africa. Baseline emissions also vary in their sectoral split. Using 10 different emission pathways as input to the Oslo chemical transport model version 3 (OsloCTM3), we find that regionally averaged annual mean population-weighted fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations exhibit divergent trends depending on scenario stringency, with the eastern Africa PM2.5 concentrations increasing by up to 6 µg m−3 (37 %, SD ± 2.7 µg m−3) by 2050 under the UNEP Baseline, SSP370, and ECLIPSE current legislation scenarios. In almost all cases, excess deaths increase substantially, with increases of up to more than 2.5 times compared to the baseline.

 Solar radiation management is a method in the field of geoengineering that aims to modify the Earth's shortwave radiation budget. One idea is to inject sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, where sulfate aerosols are then formed. Such experiments can probably be observed, for example, with satellite occultation instruments like SAGE III/ISS. The aim of the current study is to analyse, using MAECHAM-HAM simulations and retrievals with the radiative transfer program SCIATRAN, whether it is possible to detect the formed stratospheric aerosols from emissions of 1 and 2 Tg S yr−1 (sulfur per year) with the currently active satellite occultation instruments, taking into account an error estimate that is as realistic as possible. If these smaller amounts of sulfur are detectable, larger amounts will also be detectable.

The ATMONSYS DIAL aims to resolve turbulence throughout the PBL with a sampling frequency of 10 s and vertical resolutions of less than 200 m. General measuring capabilities during high-noon, clear-sky, summer conditions with a maximum vertical measurement range of >3 km and statistical uncertainties of <5 % are demonstrated. The analysis of turbulence spectra shows good agreement with Kolmogorov's law, demonstrating the system's capability to resolve turbulence. However, deviations from Kolmogorov behavior are observed at certain frequency ranges. By combining the ATMONSYS DIAL with an adjacent high-quality Doppler wind lidar, some of these deviations are mitigated in the co-spectra due to independent noise from both instruments. However, intermediate deviations from Kolmogorov behavior persist, likely due to surrounding surface heterogeneities. The agreement of the co-spectra with Kolmogorov's law at the highest frequencies demonstrates that the ATMONSYS DIAL is capable of resolving turbulent latent energy fluxes down to the measurement's Nyquist frequency of 5×10-2Hz. A system cross-intercomparison of the ATMONSYS DIAL with two adjacent water vapor Raman lidars and radiosondes shows overall good agreement between the sensors, despite minor DIAL deficiencies under certain conditions with broken clouds passing over the lidar. The observed profile-to-profile DIAL fluctuations and sensor-to-sensor deviations, in combination with low statistical uncertainty, highlight the advantage of humidity lidars, such as the ATMONSYS DIAL, in capturing both short-term and small-scale dynamics of the lowermost atmosphere."

When both observations are used together, the model can actuate the moisture fields, correcting their dynamics. Our research shows that, in regions with very few stations, assimilating tropospheric gradients on top of zenith total delay observations can enhance the performance of existing improvements. 
 The assimilation of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) zenith total delays (ZTDs) into numerical weather models improves weather forecasts. In addition, the GNSS tropospheric gradient (TG) estimates provide valuable insight into the moisture distribution in the lower troposphere. In this study, we utilize a newly developed forward operator for TGs to investigate the sensitivity effects of incorporating TGs into the Weather Research and Forecasting model at varying station network densities. We assimilated ZTD and TGs from dense and sparse station networks (0.5 and 1°, respectively). Through this study, we found that the improvement in the humidity field with the assimilation of ZTD and TGs from the sparse station network (1° resolution) is comparable to the improvement achieved by assimilating ZTD only from the dense station network (0.5° resolution). These results encourage the assimilation of TGs alongside ZTDs in operational weather forecasting agencies, especially in regions with few GNSS stations. Conversely, assimilating TGs alongside ZTDs from sparse GNSS networks can be a cost-effective way to enhance the accuracy of the model fields and subsequent forecast quality."

By combining advanced modeling with real-world observations, it captures fine-scale wind patterns near the surface, especially in urban and mountainous areas. This dataset supports improved weather forecasts, air quality studies, and planning for wind energy and aviation in rapidly developing regions. 
 High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) wind field data are critical for a wide range of applications, including wind energy assessment, low-altitude aviation, air quality modeling, and extreme weather forecasting. Although ERA5 reanalysis remains widely used, its relatively coarse spatial resolution (~31 km) limits its ability to capture local-scale atmospheric processes. To address this, this study develops an hourly 3D dynamic wind field dataset with 1 km horizontal resolution covering the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region during the summer months (June–August) from 2021 to 2023, namely YRD1km, generated through advanced dynamical downscaling of ERA5 using a customized Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model configuration. The methodology integrates multi-source observational nudging with high-resolution land use parameterization to enhance near-surface wind accuracy and terrain-induced flow representation, particularly in urban clusters and mountainous areas. Validation against ground-based observations confirms the superior performance of YRD1km over ERA5 for hourly 10-m wind components, with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduced by approximately 22 % for U and 26 % for V, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduced by 18 % for U and 23 % for V, and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improved by 33 % and 40 %, respectively. On a daily mean basis, both MAE and RMSE are reduced to below 0.4 m/s, and NSE reaches approximately 0.88. Spatially, YRD1km captures finer spatial wind speed gradients and localized terrain-induced circulations that are not captured by ERA5. Temporally, consistent accuracy improvements with approximately 20 % lower hourly error variability are seen when compared to ERA5. Vertically, 42.2 % accuracy gains are observed in the near-surface layer when compared with radiosonde profiles. Moreover, in a representative convective storm case, YRD1km captures multi-level wind structures that are closely linked to the initiation and continuous development of deep convection, highlighting its diagnostic advantage in high-impact weather events. Overall, the YRD1km 3D wind field dataset and its integrated methodological framework provide a robust foundation for regional meteorological applications, including high-resolution AI-based forecasting, renewable energy planning, and weather risk management in rapidly developing regions such as the YRD.

This is important for dry ecosystems, as they are often driven by changes in soil water availability. We showed that this update resulted in a better match with observations and that the updated model is more sensitive to soil texture. The new model can also simulate a groundwater table. This updated model can help us to better understand the future of dry ecosystems under climate change. 
 Dryland ecosystems are globally important, yet state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models often lack specific processes or parameterizations that are critical for accurately simulating dryland dynamics. These missing processes include a realistic calculation of soil water movement, detailed plant–water relations, or a representation of deep water uptake. In this study, we show how including a process-based soil hydrology scheme in the LPJ-GUESS (Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) model can improve its usefulness for simulating the functioning of dryland ecosystems. By replacing the default 15-layer bucket representation of soil hydrology in LPJ-GUESS v4.1 with a mechanistic description of soil water movement based on the 1D Richards equation, we show that the model is better able to capture seasonal patterns of water cycling through dryland ecosystems at both the site and regional levels. In addition, the inclusion of a new set of bottom boundary conditions, such as a permanent groundwater layer, further expands the range of ecosystems the LPJ-GUESS model can simulate. We show that soil bottom boundary conditions, in particular varying levels of groundwater depth, can have a large influence on vegetation composition and water cycling.

It has not yet been extensively explored, using observation, how such a collaborative evolution changes systematically from region to region over tropical oceans. In this study, the ERA5 reanalysis data and satellite measurements from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar are analyzed to examine the variability of the large‐scale vertical velocity (ω) and diabatic heating (Q1 ${Q}_{1}$) profiles over tropical oceans. Hour‐to‐hour variability in these variables is examined based on composite time series to delineate the evolution of ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ before and after Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) precipitation peaks. Four tropical basins are selected to study regional differences: western Pacific (WP), eastern Pacific (EP), Indian Ocean (IO), and Atlantic Ocean (AO). The composite time series reveal that the ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ distributions align with the typical life cycle of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition is applied to the vertical structure of ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ in terms of top‐heaviness. The ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ top‐heaviness ratio (THR) delineate similar evolutionary curves in that THR enhances as convection intensifies, but the peak hour occurs earlier for Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ by several hours than for ω. The top‐heaviness of ω and Q1 ${\,Q}_{1}$ exhibits a notable regionality that they are bottom‐heavier in EP and AO than in WP and IO.

Although super resolution deep learning models such as YNet show promise in global downscaling efforts, we found their performance on ISMR less effective, particularly for extreme rainfall and intraseasonal variability. The transferability of downscaling algorithms trained on reanalysis data to climate model simulations, as well as a comprehensive evaluation across key timescales of ISMR variability, remain unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose two variants of YNet: YNet_D, which incorporates atmospheric variables to enhance downscaling accuracy, and YNet_DE, which prioritizes extreme rainfall using a weighted loss function. YNet_D and YNet_DE outperform YNet, reducing root mean squared error from 12.41 to 12.25 mm and 11.97 mm, respectively. For extremes, they lower the R95p bias from 78.27 to 56.52 mm and 40.22 mm.

Skinner,The Impact of CO2‐Driven Vegetation Changes on the Future of Flash Drought in the Northern Hemisphere,"Vegetation plays a crucial role in soil moisture regulation and the development of rapid‐onset droughts known as flash droughts. We use climate model experiments with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) to examine how the vegetation response to rising CO2 impacts projections of future flash drought in the Northern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes. By isolating the influences of CO2 fertilization and CO2 stomatal conductance effects from CO2 radiative forcing, we find that: (a) CO2‐induced changes to plant characteristics are of sufficient magnitude to modify flash drought characteristics, (b) CO2 fertilization effects counteract the CO2 stomatal conductance effects on projected flash drought occurrence, and (c) the combined influence of the vegetation response to rising CO2 can either amplify or counteract CO2 radiative‐driven flash drought changes depending on location. In water‐limited regions such as the western United States, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, and west/central Asia where CO2 fertilization dominates and surface vegetation strongly controls water availability, elevated leaf area offsets reductions in stomatal conductance and transpiration, increasing the likelihood of future flash droughts. Vegetation‐driven increases in flash drought in these areas are generally aligned in sign with projected increases due to radiative forcing. Conversely, in more energy limited regions such as western Canada, East Asia, and parts of Europe, preserved soil moisture from reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration suppresses flash droughts despite increased leaf area from CO2 fertilization. These reductions in flash drought from vegetation counteract radiative‐driven increases. This study elucidates physical processes underlying projected flash drought development, improving predictive capabilities and mitigation strategies."

Compositions of carbonyls and terpenoids varied synchronously among different tree species across the altitude gradient, and the potential sources of carbonyls and terpenoids in southeast Tibet were mainly distributed on the pathway of Asia monsoon in alpine forest, which imply that local air‐ground exchange is the major contributing factor for the ambient VOCs.

At Limassol, both ICNC and INPC in dust‐embedded MPC range from 0.05 to 3 L−1 and show good correlation.

Distinct differences were generally found between OA mass spectra from various anthropogenic sources. Additionally, subtypes of COA and CCOA mass spectra showed notable differences, allowing for finer OA source apportionment. Cluster analysis of existing 57 OA mass spectra further demonstrated their efficacy in identifying OA sources, and revealed certain sources were grouped into distinct clusters.

However, as the kinds and frequencies of satellite observations are increased, it is desirable to switch to physics‐based objective analysis. This study is conducted to test its feasibility by examining the assimilation of high‐resolution atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) obtained by a recently proposed method. Even though the method can retrieve low‐level high‐speed winds near the inner edge of the eyewall cloud, it cannot directly measure the maximum wind speed, which is normally achieved in the eyewall. On the basis of an ensemble Kalman filter assimilation system, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are performed by assimilating pseudo‐AMV observations created from a nature run during the mature stage in a real TC. Mimicking the real AMVs, the pseudo‐observations are limited to low‐level AMVs in the eye without the maximum wind in the eyewall. The AMV assimilation limited to the eye reduces the spread of the TC‐center position among the ensemble members.

Despite significant advancements in transferring hydrological knowledge from data‐rich to data‐sparse basins, such as regionalization techniques for hydrological prediction and novel deep learning (DL)‐based Transfer learning (TL) methods, the application of models trained in data‐rich basins introduces inevitable noise into predictions within data‐sparse basins. This potential distortion could misinterpret rainfall‐runoff patterns within specific basins. This study introduces a TL framework based on data augmentation (DA‐TL) within the context of hydrological modeling. The framework employs augmented rainfall data as input for conceptual models to generate pretraining runoff samples, addressing the challenges of sample scarcity and imbalance in target basins. Subsequently, TL is applied to fine‐tune predictions in the target basin, thereby mitigating inappropriate hydrological knowledge transfer associated with cross‐basin learning. The DA‐TL framework was validated across nine river basins in China, representing three distinct climate zones (semi‐arid, semi‐humid, and humid regions). Results indicate that the DA‐TL approach outperforms current DL methods for regionalized hydrological modeling. Specifically, under varying data scarcity scenarios, DA‐TL achieved average Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency improvements of 3.8% and 1.0% compared to similar‐basin modeling and all‐basin modeling strategies, respectively. Model interpretability analyses reveal that the effectiveness of the DA‐TL framework primarily stems from its adept learning of the runoff generation and routing processes in target basins. These findings underscore the potential of using synthetic data derived from process‐based models for pretraining in TL, offering promising avenues for improving hydrological extremes forecasting accuracy in observation‐limited regions."

This study performed a nationwide time‐stratified case‐crossover study to assess the association between short‐term PM2.5 and mortality in South Korea (2015–2019) by each cause of death and age group. A machine‐learning ensemble PM2.5 prediction model was used to cover unmonitored districts. We estimated the excess mortality and Years of Life Lost (YLL) attributable to PM2.5 and non‐compliance with the 2021 WHO guidelines (>15 μg/m3). We examined the effect modifications by district‐level accessibility to green spaces and medical facilities in the living sphere. In the total population, PM2.5 was positively associated with mortality for non‐accidental causes (OR: 1.008 with 95% CI: 1.006–1.010), circulatory diseases (1.007, 95% CI: 1.003–1.011), and respiratory diseases (1.007, 95% CI: 1.001–1.013). Based on the point estimates, the association was generally greater in younger age groups (0–59 or 60–69 years) than in older age groups (70–80 and 80 years or older), and this pattern was pronounced in mortality for cerebrovascular diseases and pneumonia. The excess mortality fraction and YLL due to non‐compliance with WHO guidelines were 0.80% and 186,808.52 years.

In Papua New Guinea (PNG), malaria is widespread in lowland areas but rarely transmitted above 1,600 m. This study assessed changes in malaria transmission suitability across PNG from 1960 to 2019 and projected shifts through 2040, using satellite‐derived temperature data and climate models. We applied a temperature‐dependent basic reproduction number (R0) to identify shifts in geographic suitability, estimate the population at risk, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Malaria temperature suitability ranges have subtly changed between 1960 and 2019, with the proportion of people living in suitable areas increasing from 58% to 61% (equivalent to an additional 249,125 people). Under a conservative climate change model, this proportion is expected increase to 74% by 2040 (equivalent to an additional 2,802,709 people). Interventions had a larger impact on malaria incidence in areas with R0 < 0.3, mitigating the current and future impact of climate change. Nevertheless, the number of people requiring access to malaria control is expected to double by 2040, to 13.4 million with 2.8 million attributed to climate change alone. The impacted areas are densely populated highlands regions with a more susceptible population and an increased potential for epidemics and clinical disease. These findings underscore the challenges of climate change for malaria elimination in PNG and highlight the need to accurately guide preparedness and forecast the additional resource requirements."

 Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded). By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.

Here, Liu and Zhu argue that the claimed orbital torques in Tantalum arise instead from self-induced spin-orbit torques in the adjacent ferromagnet. 
 It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and Fe50Pt50), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency. This agrees with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (≥2 nm for Ni) results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM. These results indicate the absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet systems, regardless of the type, the spin-orbit coupling, and the layer thickness of the ferromagnets.

Here, the authors propose a method for the rapid detection and identification of such defects by combining thermographic and electromagnetic signals. 
 Thermal barrier coating system plays key role in high temperature gas turbine blades. During the manufacture and in-service processes, defects are inevitable due to the inconsistent deformation and fatigue loading. The typical defects, e.g. interfacial debonding and crack in substrate, may significantly degrade the performance, safety and service life of gas turbine. However, it is challenging to non-destructively evaluate the small defects and/or coexistent multi-defects in thermal barrier coating system. Here, we propose a non-destructive method to detect the defects in thermal barrier coating system using the results of both infrared thermography and eddy current testing. Using this method, we detect interfacial debonding as small as 0.7 mm within 0.2 s and identify defect types which are essential for turbine blade fabrication and maintenance. By leveraging multi-physical fields, we achieve effective and quantitative evaluation of coexisting defects in thermal barrier coating system. This method integrates multiple non-destructive evaluation techniques and provides an approach to assess defects in multilayer structures without damaging them.

 Altered histone post-translational modifications are frequently associated with cancer. Here, we apply mass-spectrometry to study the epigenetic landscapes of breast cancer subtypes, with a particular focus on triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a heterogeneous group lacking well-defined molecular targets and effective therapies. The analysis of over 200 tumors reveals epigenetic signatures that discriminate TNBCs from the other BC subtypes, and that distinguish TNBC patients with different prognoses. Employing a multi-OMICs approach integrating epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, we investigate the mechanistic role of increased H3K4 methylation in TNBCs, demonstrating that H3K4me2 sustains the expression of genes associated with the TNBC phenotype. Through CRISPR-mediated editing, we establish a causal relationship between H3K4me2 and gene expression for several targets. Furthermore, treatment with H3K4 methyltransferase inhibitors reduce TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results unravel a novel epigenetic pathway implicated in TNBC pathogenesis and suggest new opportunities for targeted therapy.

Here, the authors present a readily fabricated, organised human motor assembloids-on-a-chip approach for neuromuscular research and hypoxia disease modelling. 
 Precision medicine leverages stem cell-derived models to dissect complex interactions underlying disease-driven neuromuscular damage. However, such reductionist models form stochastic structures without external guidance, while available engineering solutions remain intricate. Here, simplified surface modification engineering is used to render spatially patterned human motor assembloids-on-a-chip by geometric confinement. The anisotropic architecture of skeletal muscle organoids (hSkM) can be conferred solely by localized mechanobiological cues within this predefined device without aligned scaffolds or adjuncts. The hSkM-orchestrated coupling of motor neuron spheroids (hMNS) promotes synergistic neuromuscular development. Furthermore, integration of optogenetic and microelectrode array mapping enables visualization of functional patterning in assembloids. Applied to oxygen deprivation model, hSkM exhibits structural anomalies, fatigable muscle remodeling and dysfunction, recapitulating muscle pathologies in intermittent hypoxia (IH)-associated respiratory disorders. Electrical activity mapping reveals the heterogeneity in neuromuscular responses to IH, indicating the neuroregulatory etiology of muscle dysfunction. Finally, we identify mitochondrial bioenergetic imbalance as a key IH target, proposing evaluation of NAD+ salvage pathway-targeting agents.

In this work, Soubias et al, using an integrated structure-function approach, discovered a mechanism where a GAP PH domain binds directly to a GTPase to induce allosteric changes facilitating GTP hydrolysis. 
 GTPase-activating proteins are important regulators of small GTPases; among these, ASAP1 stimulates GTP hydrolysis on Arf1 and is implicated in cancer progression. ASAP1 contains a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain essential for maximum Arf·GTP hydrolysis. The prevailing view of PH domains is that they regulate proteins through passive mechanisms like membrane recruitment. In sharp contrast, we show that the PH domain of ASAP1 actively contributes to Arf1 GTP hydrolysis. By combining NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, kinetic assays, and mutational analysis, we find that the PH domain binds Arf·GTP at the membrane, to establish an active state primed for GTP hydrolysis. We identify key residues on the PH domain and Arf that drive this allosteric mechanism, which mathematical modeling shows contributes as much to GTPase activation as membrane recruitment. The finding that PH domains directly modulate small GTPases has broad implications for the Ras and Rho oncoprotein families. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) often contain regulatory PH domains.

 Riverine floods that occur simultaneously over multiple regions often lead to amplified societal and environmental impacts compared to individual events. However, the pattern and mechanisms governing the global interconnection of peak river discharge across spatially distant and proximate locations remain largely unexplored. Here, on the basis of a global annual peak discharge database from 4,407 observational hydrometric stations, we identify hubs for remotely linked discharge peaks spanning thousands of kilometres. We show increasing trends in the number of remotely linked watersheds and the total drainage area, pointing to amplified synchronization of global peak river discharge since the 1980s. Ocean–atmosphere oscillations, through the perturbation of both temperature and precipitation anomalies, dictate the global coupling pattern and temporal evolution of discharge peaks. Our findings highlight an emergent profile of global peak river flow in a warming climate that can benefit coordinated flood risk management. River floods that occur simultaneously in multiple locations can lead to higher damages than individual events. Here, the authors show that the likelihood of concurrent high river discharge has increased over the last decades."

 Urban aerosol pollution is evolving rapidly with global change and poses significant risks to public health. Measurements and machine learning-enabled chemical analysis of aerosol from a suburb of New York City in 2023 reveal emerging sources and drivers in a modern megacity. Regional wildfire smoke averaged 25% of organic aerosol (OA) mass and drove variability via enhancements of biogenic OA formation within smoke plumes. This biogenic OA contributed 40% of aerosol mass. Urban heatwaves enhanced both biogenic and anthropogenic sources, with ~20% of OA mass exhibiting significant heatwave sensitivity. For the first time, volatile chemical product (VCP) compounds were directly observed, speciated, and characterized in urban aerosol. Contributions to total OA averaged 15%, double the contribution from traffic. Together, this work identifies wildfire smoke, biogenic emissions, heat, and emerging anthropogenic emissions as critical global change vulnerabilities for North American urban aerosol pollution that pose unique challenges for control strategies."

 While the potential intensity (PI) theory provides a foundation for projecting future tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, uncertainties remain regarding how future TC maximum intensity will change due to potential offsets from interaction between TCs and their ambient environment. Using high-resolution downscaling simulations based on future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phases 5 and 6, this study examines the relative influence of local environment along TC tracks and large-scale atmospheric conditions on TC lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) in future projections. Analyzing TC intensity distributions for the final two decades of the 21st century in the western North Pacific (WNP) basin shows that the LMI increases in all future scenarios in this basin, despite less favorable local conditions along TC tracks. This increase in LMI is driven by a rise in the occurrence of long-lived TCs and a decline in short-lived TCs, enabling more TCs to reach higher intensities during their lifetime even as local environments become more hostile to TC development in warmer climates. The mechanism behind this LMI increase is linked to a northeastward shift in the Western Pacific Subtropical High, which alters TC track patterns in the WNP basin. These findings highlight the critical role of large-scale environment in TC intensity projections, underscoring the need to move beyond basin-wide PI analyses when assessing future TC activity."

 Arctic winter warming is stronger than in summer, but its driving mechanisms remain debated, particularly the roles of local processes, like sea-ice loss, versus remote factors, like atmospheric heat transport. Here we introduce a novel decomposition framework that characterizes Arctic warming as a function of historical atmospheric circulation, sea ice concentration, and carbon dioxide changes using observational and reanalysis data. We show that sea ice changes explain about 55% of the winter Arctic near-surface temperature trend during 1959–2015, after removing the effects directly connected to atmospheric circulation. Dynamically induced warming accounts for about 20% at surface and up to 80% in mid-troposphere. The remaining ~25% is attributed to the increase in carbon dioxide, though it also indirectly affects sea-ice loss and circulation-related warming. These findings highlight the dominant role of sea ice loss and change in atmospheric dynamics in affecting the historical Arctic winter warming.

 Wing dams, used in rivers like the Mississippi and Danube, improve navigation by increasing water depth during low flow. Their hydromorphological effects are complex, and their influence on flood risk remains debated. Here we developed an approach that identifies local physical patterns from detailed numerical calculations, enabling extension to larger river sections and longer time scales previously difficult to study. We apply this numerical method to assess wing dam impacts on water and bed levels over decades to centuries. Our results show that rivers with bed materials prone to armouring tend to experience long-term water level increases due to wing dams, while others may see decreases. Adjustments to new stable conditions take decades, with temporary water level rises even in uniform beds. For the Mississippi River, wing dams likely caused initial water level increases, but effects declined over time, indicating evolving riverbed responses. These findings help design flood risk–optimal wing dam configurations.

 Understanding the mechanisms controlling hydrocarbon seepage in marine environments is crucial due to the toxicity of liquid components and the contribution of the gaseous fraction to carbon budgets. While natural seepage is common, the role of earthquakes remains poorly understood.

Though social media offers a proxy for public attention to geohazards, previous studies have been limited to single events, short timescales, and/or monolingual analyses.

 Extraction of agricultural field parcels is of great importance for agricultural condition monitoring, farm management, and food security. Several methods have been developed to map the distribution of agricultural field parcels, among which deep learning-based supervised learning is increasingly employed. Nevertheless, advanced deep learning models face two major limitations: limited ability to generalize across different spatial，temporal and sensor contexts with varying scene and object characteristics, and high requirement for annotated datasets to support training and validation. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework (UDA-Field Teacher, UDA-FT) for agricultural field parcel instance segmentation, which is designed to transfer knowledge from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. UDA-FT is based on the Mask R-CNN framework and incorporates a target-oriented teacher model and a cross-domain student model. This cross-domain student model embeds an image adaptation module and an instance adaptation module, employing adversarial learning strategies to mitigate cross-domain distribution differences. Additionally, we propose a consistency mutual learning module based on soft pseudo-label technology, overcoming the limitations of traditional hard pseudo-labeling in confidence threshold selection and improving model robustness in the target domain. Furthermore, to address the difficulty in generating independent instance labels for densely packed agricultural field parcels and capturing spatial contextual relationships during soft pseudo-label generation, we propose two data augmentation methods, namely CutMatch (CM) and LeakyMask (LM). We adopted the proposed framework on cross-scene and cross-sensor datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and robustness under different scenes. Quantification and visualization results demonstrate our UDA-FT outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for cross-scene and cross-sensor agricultural field parcels across all metrics. Ablation studies highlight the substantial impact of strong data augmentation on model performance, emphasizing the importance of learning from out-of-distribution data. As an innovative application of unsupervised domain adaptation in agricultural field parcel instance segmentation, this research provides a novel method for domain shift in agricultural remote sensing imagery, enabling more accurate field instance segmentation with significant implications for global agriculture."

Furthermore, the cloud-removed Sentinel-2 images are used as year-round inputs for farmland segmentation in the Netherlands, providing temporal context that improves segmentation accuracy compared to using limited timesteps. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our diffusion model framework in integrating multi-sensor data for robust cloud removal and highlight the benefits of incorporating temporal information for accurate semantic segmentation of farmland."

 Accurate farm-level yield estimation is crucial for informed agricultural decision-making and food security, particularly in data-scarce, small-scale rainfed systems such as those found in South Africa. This study explores the integration of remote sensing-derived leaf area index (LAI) into the WOFOST crop model using a recalibration-based data assimilation (DA) approach. Data from eight farms across two growing seasons (2020–2021) in the Eastern Cape were used. Key phenological parameters were calibrated, and a yield gap factor influencing daily gross assimilation was introduced and optimized alongside the specific leaf area using LAI observations from two farms in 2020. The optimized parameters were validated across additional farms and seasons. Results show that DA significantly improved yield predictions (RMSE = 472 kg.ha−1; NRMSE = 11%) compared to simulations without assimilation (RMSE = 4817 kg.ha−1; NRMSE = 112%). These findings highlight the method’s potential to adapt crop models to data-limited contexts, quantify yield gaps, and support efficient resource management. The approach offers scalable benefits for decision-making in similarly constrained agricultural systems."

 Atmospheric iron (Fe)-bearing particles are crucial in human health and climate systems. In this study, we investigated the elemental concentrations and morphological characteristics of Fe-bearing particles during a non-dust period and two dust periods in the spring of 2023. Analyses were conducted using an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and a scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The results showed that the mass concentrations of Fe in PM2.5 were 0.74 μg m−3 during non-dust period and 8.17 μg m−3 during the dust periods, indicating a substantial contribution of dust storms to Fe transport toward downstream regions. Fe-bearing particles accounted for 65.6 % and 91.1 % (by number) of total analyzed non-carbonaceous particles during the non-dust and dust periods, respectively. Notably, the proportion of Fe-rich particles, likely composed of iron oxides, was higher in the non-dust period (8.6 %) compared to the dust periods (1.4 %). Individual particle analysis further revealed that Fe-bearing particles contained a higher sulfur (S) content during the non-dust period than the dust periods. Moreover, within the dust periods, the relative abundance of S-containing Fe-bearing particles increased in the later stages compared to the initial stages, suggesting progressive atmospheric aging. These findings highlight significant differences in the mineralogical composition and aging processes of Fe-bearing particles between dust and non-dust conditions, with implications for iron solubility and its subsequent effects on human health and climate feedbacks. This study underscores the necessity for further experimental investigations into iron dissolution under varying atmospheric conditions."

 In December 2022, Japan experienced its first rare winter sand and dust storm (SDS) in 10 years. In this study, the structure and mechanism of dust generation in December 2022 were clarified based on the dust prediction model, ground-based dust observations, satellite data, and atmospheric reanalysis data. The winter SDS was caused by strong surface winds associated with an extratropical cyclone passing over the Gobi Desert on December 11, 2022; the meteorological mechanism was the same as that for spring SDSs. The negative snow cover anomaly over the source region and the synoptic factors causing the unusual winter SDS were identified by using the satellite data and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts fifth-generation global climate reanalysis (ERA5). Usually, the strong wind frequency in the Gobi Desert in December is low because of a stable cold winter high, whereas in 2022, the frequency was clearly increased. Based on the anomaly and composite analysis of the geopotential height at 500 hPa, the characteristics of the winter SDS years were identified as westward displacement of the Siberian High and the weakening of Aleutian Low over the North Pacific Ocean. The negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation corresponded well with winter SDS years, especially since 2000, suggesting that favorable synoptic conditions for winter SDSs were formed during this negative phase."

 Climate change has fundamentally altered global seasonal patterns, yet quantifying these shifts remains challenging due to heterogeneous definitions of seasons. Here, we develop a standardized 5d temperature-based classification system for seasons from 1971 to 2021 using the fifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5). Our analysis reveals a pronounced redistribution of seasonal durations. Specifically, summer expanded by 3.2 % grid globally, while spring, autumn, and winter decreased by −2.8 %, −12.1 %, and − 0.9 % in 2021, respectively, compared to 1971. The prolongation of summer in mid-latitude regions is due to an earlier onset and delayed termination, as well as the poleward migration of thermal transition zones (1.1° latitude over 1971–2021). Additionally, hemispheric asymmetry is quantified by the poleward migration of warm-side boundaries: 0.22°N decade−1 vs. 0.20°S decade−1, i.e., 10.3 % faster in the North Hemispheric, attributed to its greater landmass and thermal sensitivity. This study provides a unified framework for understanding global seasonal dynamics, which is critical for predicting climate-ecosystem interactions."

 Atmospheric aerosols serve as critical drivers of haze pollution formation through bidirectional feedback mechanisms with planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure. Here, ground and aircraft observations from a severe haze pollution event in the North China Plain (NCP) in 2016 were analyzed to study the spatial and temporal distribution, as well as the vertical distribution and evolutionary characteristics of aerosols. Results suggested that PM2.5 in the haze pollution gradually accumulated through three outbreak phases (OB) and three maintenance phases (MT). A unimodal distribution was observed from ground-based observations of aerosol number concentration (Na), revealing the different formation and evolution characteristics of haze pollution across different pollution phases. Notably, NO3− drove the accumulation of pollution while SO42− drove the maintenance. The aircraft observations data showed that the influence height of haze pollution varied at different phase, which were 850 m (OB1), 1450 m (OB2), 2200 m (early MT2) and 1500 m (late MT2). The proportion of NO3− decreased above influence height during OB1 and OB2, whereas that of SO42− exhibited the opposite trend. Compared with OB phases, the contributions of NO3− and SO42− significantly increased below influence height during MT2, whereas the contribution of Org decreased. Na of OB phases initially increased and then decreased with height below influence height, while during the MT phase, it exhibited a significant decreasing trend with height. The spectra distribution of Na was similar at different altitudes and phases, but the differences increased gradually with altitude. A narrow spectral width was found during late MT2 at 2000 m, the backward trajectory analysis showed that air masses from long-distance transport over Mongolia may be a main cause."

 Freezing precipitation (rain and drizzle) is a complex atmospheric phenomenon with severe impacts on transport, energy and infrastructure. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of freezing precipitation climatology in the Far East for a 30-year period (1994–2024) using the ERA5 reanalysis data set. The wide spatial coverage (25–65°N, 110–150°E) and the application of regional diagnostic algorithms for the detection of freezing precipitation provided valuable information on their frequency variability, areas of high activity, and the temporal characteristics of their distribution. It was found that: the maximum activity of freezing precipitation is observed in the southeastern China and on the northwestern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk (up to 13 h/season); freezing precipitation in the Far East is characterized by pronounced seasonal variability. In autumn, freezing precipitation is concentrated in two latitudinal zones (46–50°N and 39–44°N), in winter it prevails in China, and in spring it shifts to the northern regions and island territories (Sakhalin and Hokkaido). The key result is the detection of an autumn “southern shift” of the increased freezing precipitation activity area in the third decade (2014–2024). The composite analysis showed that this change was accompanied by a displacement of the cyclonic activity area 600–700 km to the south and a strengthening of the tropospheric circulation meridionality. The results obtained are of important practical significance for forecasting extreme weather events and assessing climate risks in the Far East. The research highlights the need for a further study of the impact of global warming on the spatial and temporal distribution of freezing precipitation."

Kun,Potential impact of a near-surface baroclinic boundary on supercell intensification: A case study from Hungary on 24 April 2022,"•A thermal boundary near a Hungarian mountain range was analyzed. •Supercell intensification along the boundary was confirmed by radar. •The simulated supercell intensified while moving parallel to the thermal boundary. •The trajectory analysis revealed the baroclinic term dominated over the tilting term. •The baroclinic term was the main contributor to the total horizontal vorticity. 
 On 24 April 2022, a low-topped supercell developed in northeastern Hungary along a near-surface thermal boundary that separated a warm, dry air mass to the south from a cool, moist air mass to the north. The storm produced large hail (>2 cm) and damaging winds (>25 m s−1). To assess the role of the thermal boundary in this case, we analyzed the convective environment based on surface observations and examined the evolution and intensification of the supercell along the boundary using Doppler radar data. To further investigate the role of the boundary in the intensification of the storm, a one-way nested high-resolution numerical simulation was performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 600 m horizontal grid spacing. Lagrangian diagnostics were used to quantify baroclinic and tilting contributions to horizontal vorticity generation along parcel trajectories, while Eulerian fields characterized the spatial structure of the boundary. Between 1230 and 1250 UTC, most inflow parcels passed through or near the boundary before entering the supercell updraft. During this period, the baroclinic term was approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the tilting term. Moreover, the cumulative baroclinic contribution approached the total amount of absolute horizontal vorticity present in the parcels by the end of the trajectory period, underscoring its dominant role in the generation of inflow vorticity. Given the complexity of supercell dynamics, no final conclusions can be drawn; however, the results point to the thermal boundary as a major contributor to near-surface baroclinic horizontal vorticity. Parcels that traversed this zone appear to have imported substantial amounts of horizontal vorticity into the supercell inflow, which likely supported the development of a stronger low-level mesocyclone through subsequent tilting and stretching processes. These findings highlight the potential influence of mesoscale thermodynamic boundaries on storm evolution, particularly in regions with complex terrain and convective variability."
