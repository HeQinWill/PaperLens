This article presents the first bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature on the environmental impacts of the cocaine value chain in Latin America, aiming to uncover its specific effects across four stages: (i) coca cultivation, (ii) coca farming, (iii) cocaine manufacturing and (iv) cocaine trafficking. Using a four-step selection process, we reviewed 121 studies published between 1979 and 2022, retrieved from 10 search engines and scientific databases, complemented by an extensive screening of gray literature. The article identifies and quantifies most frequent study sites, research methods, data sources and metrics, followed by a critical review of the research findings. Key findings highlight that land use land cover change and deforestation in the coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking phases, along with soil degradation under the coca farming stage, are the main variables examined to evaluate impacts. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of how these impacts are distributed across study areas, their applicability to the broader region, and the consistency and rigor of the research methodologies used. The article concludes by incorporating research and policy recommendations that underscore how these environmental impacts are deeply intertwined with the failures of the drug war, emphasizing the need to develop more comprehensive and evidence-based policy responses."

This study aimed to improve understanding of global land cover dynamics to enable more effective future land management practices and conservation actions. This study quantified interannual changes in global land cover types from 2001 to 2020 and distinguished intermittent transitions from stable gains and losses. From the interannual perspective, we found that global barren lands, forests, shrublands, and snow-covered areas decreased by 5281, 1804, 952, and 188 kha yr−1, respectively. In contrast, grasslands, croplands, urban areas, and water bodies increased at 6529, 1407, 237, and 51 kha yr−1, respectively, from 2001 to 2020. According to the definitions provided in this paper, of the global forest areas, 75% was Stable (no change), 4% was Gain, 5% was Loss, and 16% was Unstable. Of the cropland areas, 56% was Stable, 9% was Gain, 9% was Loss, and 26% was Unstable. Hotspots for forest loss were Brazil, the Rest of South America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and grassland was the most common land cover classification following forest loss. The global cropland expansion hotspots were Brazil, Canada, China, India, and the Rest of South America. The cropland gains were mainly converted from grasslands. On the other hand, barren areas in China and Middle Eastern and North Africa were changed to grasslands. A certain amount of shrublands were changed to forest in temperate regions. This paper provided land cover changes at a 500 m spatial resolution as a benchmark for future assessments. The findings showed that unstable pixels play an important role in determining the sources of uncertainty when assessing land cover changes using satellite data. Land cover assessments are sensitive to the time steps used for analysis and the definition of changes."

In 2023–2024, coastal terrestrial ecosystems in Western Australia were particularly affected, experiencing their driest and hottest summer since observations began in the early 1900s. Banksia woodlands are a threatened ecological community in this region that are endangered by the cumulative impacts of climate change, clearing and changing groundwater regimes, the last of which is strongly influenced by the dual use of groundwater resources by the ecosystem and by the ∼2 million people in the city of Perth. Within the banksia woodlands is a Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) long-term ecological observatory that has been measuring ecosystem phenology, groundwater levels and carbon, water and energy fluxes since 2011. The 11-year site records confirm 2023 rainfall was the lowest in the record. Groundwater monitoring showed an ∼1 m drop in 2023–2024 alone, in addition to a long-term reduction of ∼4 m in water table depth since observations began in 1977. The resulting extreme water deficits manifested in reduced ecosystem evapotranspiration and altered carbon flux dynamics. Phenocam imagery revealed the consequences of this water deficit at the site level through visible canopy dieback and shifts in vegetation greenness indices. Vegetation indices from remote sensing products showed widespread vegetation stress across the ecosystem range. Continued monitoring at local and regional scales with these combined methodologies will determine (a) how well the Banksia ecosystems are able to recover from this extreme climate event and (b) the ramifications for the carbon and water cycle of the region. This ecosystem is a sentinel of climate change, providing early insight into how ecosystem-climate interactions are altering globally."

A systematic review from South Asia,"Trees have emerged as a key focus of global environmental policy. Several programs promote planting of trees outside forests (ToF), in places such as farms and grazing lands, due to the potential of trees to provide a wide variety of benefits to people and nature. Yet, our knowledge of human well-being outcomes of ToFs is limited, especially in South Asia. In this systematic literature review, we examine multidimensional human wellbeing outcomes of a wide range of ToF practices in rural landscapes of South Asian countries; including Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Relying on six databases, we uncover a large body of research in 325 articles considered for this review. Articles from Bangladesh and India dominate our review, with 71% of the studies. Further, two ToF systems, tree and forest gardens and multipurpose trees on farms, were the most commonly studied, accounting for approximately 43% of the dataset. About 62% of publications reported increases in incomes, representing economic wellbeing, 34% and 36% of publications reported an increase in material wellbeing (access to biomass and fuelwood respectively), and 10% in dietary diversity. ToF systems also created opportunities for vocational training. Trade-offs include negative and mixed outcomes on people’s sense of agency, political voice, and social equity in particular with afforestation and monoculture plantation projects in which governmental agencies took leadership or influential roles. Some research designs were weak and it was unclear whether the studied tree-based systems reflect the actual distribution of tree-based systems in South Asia. This review offers useful insights to guide ongoing and future tree-based natural-climate solutions projects in the region and worldwide to ensure ecological security and human wellbeing are well considered. It also points to areas where future research is needed."

This area faces pressures from climate change, land use and cover change (LULC), and infrastructure. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of current environmental policies on native vegetation conservation, water availability, and fire dynamics in the UPRB under current legislation in the state of Mato Grosso (MT). We used LULC data from 1985–2022 to estimate changes in water, native vegetation, exotic grasslands, and areas that could be converted to exotic grasslands for cattle ranching under state Decree N°.774/2024. We analyzed water coverage trends, including riparian preservation areas (RPAs) protected by federal law N°.12651/2012. Evapotranspiration comparisons were made between regions with and without artificial drainage. We also investigated trends in burned areas and the effectiveness of fire ban decrees. Our results indicate a significant increase in exotic grasslands across the entire UPRB portion of MT. We also found a significant decrease in water cover in the Pantanal, accompanied by an increase in native grass cover. Exotic grasslands can cover an area similar to native vegetation due to the new decree (774/2024), which includes 21 000 km2 of legal reserves (sustainable use areas) now available for grazing. The Pantanal has lost more than 8000 km2 of water over the past 37 yrs, with similar decreasing trend in water cover found within RPAs. Areas with artificial drainage showed lower evapotranspiration. Fire ban decrees were ineffective in reducing burned areas to expected levels. Current policies are insufficient to protect the interconnected ecosystems across the UPRB. Immediate measures, including adaptive management, strengthened legislation, and sustainable land and fire management practices, are essential to mitigate environmental impacts in the UPRB and safeguard its ecological and economic integrity."

Our results demonstrate that the 11-year solar signals in the shortwave heating rate, temperature, and ozone anomalies are significant and robust. The simulated dynamical responses are model-dependent, and solar imprints in the polar night jet are influenced by biases in the model used. 
 To better understand possible reasons for the diverse modeling results and large discrepancies of the detected solar fingerprints, we took one step back and assessed the “initial” solar signals in the middle atmosphere based on a set of ensemble historical simulations with multiple climate models – the Flexible Ocean Climate Infrastructure (FOCI), the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC), and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model in high-resolution configuration (MPI-ESM-HR). Consistent with previous work, we find that the 11-year solar cycle signals in the shortwave heating rate (SWHR) and ozone anomalies are robust and statistically significant in all three models. These initial solar cycle signals in the SWHR, ozone, and temperature anomalies are sensitive to the strength of the solar forcing. Correlation coefficients of the solar cycle with the SWHR, ozone, and temperature anomalies linearly increase along with the enhancement of the solar cycle amplitude. This reliance becomes more complex when the solar cycle amplitude –  indicated by the standard deviation of the December–January–February mean F10.7 – is larger than 40. In addition, the cold bias in the tropical stratopause of EMAC dampens the subsequent results of the initial solar signal. The warm pole bias in MPI-ESM-HR leads to a weak polar night jet (PNJ), which may limit the top-down propagation of the initial solar signal. Although FOCI simulated a so-called top-down response as revealed in previous studies in a period with large solar cycle amplitudes, its warm bias in the tropical upper stratosphere results in a positive bias in PNJ and can lead to a “reversed” response in some extreme cases. We suggest a careful interpretation of the single model result and further re-examination of the solar signal based on more climate models."

Ground-based T inversions and thermal winds were studied during the 10 months of the campaign. The comparison between the observations and the COSMO-1E model provides good model performance for monthly climatologies. T inversions are however frequently missed, and important differences for particular cases are found, especially for foehn events. 
 Thermally driven valley winds and near-surface air temperature inversions are common in complex topography and have a significant impact on the local and mesoscale weather situation. They affect both the dynamics of air masses and the concentration of pollutants. Valley winds affect them by favoring horizontal transport and exchange between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, whereas temperature inversion concentrates pollutants in cold stable surface layers. The complex interactions that lead to the observed weather patterns are challenging for numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. To study the performance of the COSMO-1E (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling) analysis, which is called KENDA-1 (Km-Scale Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation), a measurement campaign took place from October 2021 to August 2022 in the 1.5 km wide Swiss Alpine valley of the Haslital. A microwave radiometer and a Doppler wind lidar were installed at Meiringen, in addition to numerous automatic ground measurement stations recording meteorological surface variables. Near the measurement site, the low-altitude Brünig Pass influences the wind dynamics similarly to a tributary. The data collected show frequent nighttime temperature inversions for all the months under study, which persist during the day in the colder months. An extended thermal wind system was also observed during the campaign, except in December and January, allowing for an extended analysis of the winds along and across the valley. The comparison between the observations and the KENDA-1 data provides good model performance for monthly temperature and wind medians but frequent and important differences for single profiles, especially in the case of particular events such as foehn events. Modeled nighttime ground temperature overestimation is common due to missed temperature inversions, resulting in a bias of up to 8 °C. Concerning the valley wind system, modeled flows are similar to the observations in their extent and strength but suffer from too early a morning transition time towards up-valley winds. The findings of the present study mostly based on monthly averages allow for a better understanding of the temperature distributions, the thermally driven wind system in a medium-sized valley, the interactions with tributary valley flows, and the performance and limitations of KENDA-1 in such a complex topography."

Our study examines the optimal sampling time for the TSI Nanometer Aerosol Sampler 3089 at different input concentrations. Aerosols from low-, medium-, and high-concentration environments were sampled over 1, 3, and 6 h. A linear relationship was observed using a regression model between the deposition densities and the product of input concentration and sampling time. 
 Physicochemical characterisation of airborne particles requires appropriate sampling and deposition methods. The TSI Nanometer Aerosol Sampler 3089 (TSI NAS) has predominantly been used as an electrostatic precipitator for depositing airborne particles, enabling subsequent offline characterisation through techniques such as electron microscopy. However, the optimal sampling time of TSI NAS for varying input concentrations has not been thoroughly investigated. This is extremely important as the concentrations of particles in different environments differ significantly. This study aimed to establish the appropriate sampling durations of TSI NAS for various input concentrations or, conversely, to determine suitable input concentrations for a fixed sampling duration. We developed an experimental setup and a linear regression model to predict conditions conducive to efficiently collecting loaded samples, particularly at low concentrations, such as exhaled particles from the human respiratory tract or marine aerosol particles. Experiments were conducted using the TSI NAS 3089 at a flow rate of 1 L min−1 and a voltage of −9 kV. Three particle types, nebulised from different solutions at low, medium, and high concentrations, were sampled over durations of 1, 3, and 6 h. Deposition densities were subsequently analysed using ImageJ software. The findings revealed a linear relationship between deposition density and the product of particle concentration and sampling time, with a recommended density range of 0.015 to 0.1 particles µm−2 for particles with a count median diameter of approximately 100 nm and average circularity of 0.56 ± 0.25. Despite potential factors affecting the accuracy of the model, such as the number of samples, random collisions, and potential overload in high-concentration experiments, it provides a valuable predictive tool for determining optimal sampling times. The suggested linear regression model is applicable across various research areas, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of airborne particle characterisation."

The study supports the use of remote sensing data to mapping long-time continuous annual vegetation. 
 The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), known as the Third Pole of the Earth and the “water tower of Asia”, plays a crucial role in global climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, and regional socio-economic development. Continuous annual vegetation types and their geographical distribution data are essential for studying the response and adaptation of vegetation to climate change. However, there are very limited data on vegetation types and their geographical distributions on the QTP due to the harsh natural environment. Currently, land cover and surface vegetation data are typically obtained using traditional classification methods for each period's product based on remote sensing information. These approaches do not consider the temporal continuity of vegetation presence, leading to a gradual increase in misclassified pixels and uncertainty in their locations, consequently decreasing the interpretability of the long-time-series remote sensing products. To address this issue, this study developed a new method for long-time continuous annual vegetation mapping based on reference vegetation maps and annual updates and mapped the vegetation of the QTP from 2000 to 2022 at a 500 m spatial resolution through the MOD09A1 product. The overall accuracy of continuous annual QTP vegetation mapping from 2000 to 2022 reached 83.27 %, with the reference annual 2020 data reaching an accuracy of 83.32 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.82.

Comparisons of mixing schemes and settings have usually been done with a single model, sometimes yielding conflicting results. We systematically compare two widely used schemes with different parameter settings in two different ocean models and show that most effects from mixing scheme parameter changes are model-dependent. 
 Ocean general circulation models still have large upper-ocean biases, including in tropical sea surface temperature, that are possibly connected to the representation of vertical mixing. In earlier studies, the ocean vertical mixing parameterization has usually been tuned for a specific site or only within a specific model. We present here a systematic comparison of the effects of changes in the vertical mixing scheme in two different global ocean models, ICON-O and FESOM, run at a horizontal resolution of 10 km in the tropical Atlantic. We test two commonly used vertical mixing schemes: the K-profile parameterization (KPP) and the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) scheme. Additionally, we vary tuning parameters in both schemes and test the addition of Langmuir turbulence in the TKE scheme. We show that the biases of mean sea surface temperature, subsurface temperature, subsurface currents, and mixed layer depth differ more between the two models than between runs with different mixing scheme settings within each model. For ICON-O, there is a larger difference between TKE and KPP than for FESOM. In both models, varying the tuning parameters hardly affects the pattern and magnitude of the mean state biases. For the representation of smaller-scale variability like the diurnal cycle or inertial waves, the choice of the mixing scheme can matter: the diurnally enhanced penetration of equatorial turbulence below the mixed layer is only simulated with TKE, not with KPP. However, tuning of the parameters within the mixing schemes does not lead to large improvements for these processes. We conclude that a substantial part of the upper-ocean tropical Atlantic biases is not sensitive to details of the vertical mixing scheme."

Through optimized processing procedures, NSOAS24 resolves previous issues and demonstrates improved accuracy. Compared to NSOAS22, NSOAS24 shows a reduction of approximately 0.7 mGal in standard deviation when validated against recent shipborne data. Notably, its accuracy now rivals internationally recognized models DTU21 and V32.1. 
 Judging by the early release of the NSOAS22 model, there were some known issues, such as boundary connection problems in blockwise solutions and a relatively high noise level. By solving these problems, a new global marine gravity model, NSOAS24, is derived based on sea surface slopes (SSSs) from multi-satellite altimetry missions. Firstly, SSSs and along-track deflections of vertical (DOVs) are obtained by retracking, resampling, screening, differentiating, and filtering procedures on the basis of altimeter waveforms and sea surface height measurements. Secondly, DOVs with a 1′×1′ grid interval are further determined using Green's function method, which applies directional gradients to constrain the surface, least-squares fit to constrain noisy points, and tension constraints to smooth the field. Finally, the marine gravity anomaly is recovered from the gridded DOVs according to the Laplace equation. Throughout the entire processing procedure, improvements in accuracy are expected for the NSOAS24 model due to the following changes, e.g., supplementing recent mission observations and removing old mission data, optimizing the step size during Green's function method, and special handling in nearshore areas. These optimizations effectively resolved the known issues of signal aliasing and the “hollow phenomenon” in coastal zones. Typical altimetry-derived marine gravity models are the DTU series released by the Technical University of Denmark and the S&S series released by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of California San Diego (UCSD). Their latest models, DTU21 and SS V32.1, were used for comparison and validation. Numerical verification was conducted in three experimental areas (the Mariana Trench area, Mid-Atlantic Ridge area, and Antarctic area, representing low-, mid-, and high-latitude zones) with DTU21, SS V32.1, and shipborne data. Taking NSOAS22 for comparison, NSOAS24 showed improvements of 1.2, 0.7, and 1.0 mGal in the three test areas by validating with SS V32.1, while declines of 0.6, 0.5, and 0.3 mGal and 0.2, 0.4, and 0.3 mGal occurred in SD statistics with DTU21 and shipborne data. Finally, NSOAS24 was assessed using two sets of shipborne data (the early National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) dataset and the later dataset from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), the Marine Geoscience Data System (MGDS), the French Oceanographic Cruises Directory (FOCD), and the French Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOM)) on a global scale.

This feature allows for data exchange between WRF and any other model (e.g. an ocean model) using the coupling library Ocean–Atmosphere–Sea–Ice–Soil Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT). This coupling interface is designed to be non-intrusive, flexible and modular. It also offers the possibility of taking into account the nested zooms used in WRF or in the models with which it is coupled. 
 The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been widely used for various applications, especially for solving mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. Its high-order numerical schemes and nesting capability enable high spatial resolution. However, a growing number of applications are demanding more realistic simulations through the incorporation of coupling with new model compartments and an increase in the complexity of the processes considered in the model (e.g., ocean, surface gravity wave, land surface, and chemistry). The present paper details the development and the functionalities of the coupling interface we implemented in WRF. It uses the Ocean–Atmosphere–Sea–Ice–Soil Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) coupler, which has the advantage of being non-intrusive, efficient, and very flexible to use. OASIS3-MCT has already been implemented in many climate and regional models. This coupling interface is designed with the following baselines: (1) it is structured with a two-level design through two modules: a general coupling module and a coupler-specific module, allowing for easy additions of other couplers if required; (2) variable exchange, coupling frequency, and any potential time and grid transformations are controlled through an external text file, offering great flexibility; and (3) the concepts of external domains and a coupling mask are introduced to facilitate the exchange of fields to/from multiple sources (different models, fields from different models/grids/zooms, etc.). Finally, two examples of applications of ocean–atmosphere coupling are proposed. The first is related to the impact of ocean surface current feedback to the atmospheric boundary layer, and the second concerns the coupling of surface gravity waves with the atmospheric surface layer."

However, reported data inconsistencies and incomplete analysis of potential determinants of thermoelectric water use hinder such understanding. We address these challenges by introducing a novel data filtering method and a more complete assessment of water use determinants. First, we applied a power-cooling ratio as an operations-based data filter that removed operationally implausible records while retaining more original data, outperforming previous statistical filtering methods. Second, we found that different water use reporting methods (WURMs) provided statistically significantly different WW and WC values, revealing the importance of this previously unrecognized feature in reported water use records. Third, our data-driven approach showed that traditionally emphasized features─such as cooling technology and gross generation─are of primary importance but can be surpassed by other, often overlooked, features when modeling WW or WC individually. The plant configuration, cooling technology, and gross generation were the most important features of WW, whereas WURM, cooling technology, and reporting month were the most important for WC. These findings can improve thermoelectric power plant management, water use reporting accuracy, and water use modeling."

Characterizing emissions from the transportation sector is challenging due to uncertainties in emission-producing processes and in fleet composition and activity–factors that lead to differences across modeled vehicle emissions data sets. Here, we compare four data sets─Fuel-Inventory Vehicle Emissions, Neighborhood Emission Mapping Operation, Lake Michigan Air Director Consortium-Northwestern University, and University of Vermont─over the Greater Chicago region at three shared spatial resolutions (1.0, 1.3, and 4 km2). While domain-level data set agreement is strongest at the coarsest resolution, at finer resolutions we find notable inconsistencies, particularly at local scales. At 1 km2, simulated domain total NOx emissions across the four data sets differ up to 82% (∼32–58 k tons/year), while grid cell maximum PM2.5 emissions vary up to 272% (∼1.5–5.5 tons/km2/year). Intercompared emissions data sets share similar inputs; however, divergent outcomes arise from differences in emission factors, simulated vehicle processes, and characterization of traffic data. While domain-level emission burdens among racial/ethnic subgroups are generally ranked similarly across data sets, the magnitude of relative disparities can vary up to 11%–a potentially consequential factor to consider in downstream impact analyses."

However, biodiversity loss driven by the production and consumption of different renewable energy deployment scenarios remains largely unquantified. Quantifying biodiversity loss associated with land occupation of renewable energy infrastructure is essential for a sustainable energy transition. Here, we developed a novel data set to evaluate renewable energy-related biodiversity loss by considering the current infrastructure setting and future development pathways. We found that the land occupation of renewable energy infrastructure resulted in global biodiversity loss equivalent amounting to 19 × 10–4 global pdf in 2015. Severe biodiversity loss was concentrated primarily in densely populated and economically advanced countries, such as China, the United States, Brazil, India, Australia, Russia, and countries across Western Europe. International trade accounted for 14% of the biodiversity loss. Future renewable energy transition scenarios will lead to a global cumulative biodiversity loss of 1.2 × 10–2–2.2 × 10–2 global pdf during 2015–2060. By 2060, ambitious energy transition policies are projected to increase the biodiversity loss by 1.7–1.8 times.

In this study, 16 soils contaminated from different sources were chosen to determine their Cr accumulation in mouse tissues and changes in Cr speciation in soils, and mouse intestinal contents, organs and excreta based on a steady-state mouse model. The Cr accumulation in mouse organs after exposing to CrVI was 1.6–2.6 fold greater than those exposing to CrIII. Further, Cr relative bioavailability (RBA) was measured using a mouse urinary excretion bioassay. Results show that Cr via oral digestion was mainly accumulated in the kidneys, with Cr-RBA in soils being 5.12–50.0%, averaging 15.6%. Besides soil properties, variation in Cr-RBA also depended on its contamination sources, with soils near electronic waste dismantling and tannery sites showing greater values. Further, instead of the CrVI contents in contaminated soils, Cr-RBA was closely related to the unreduced CrVI contents in mouse intestines, with 90.1% of CrVI being reduced before its absorption. This study helps to evaluate the health risks associated with Cr-contaminated soils by measuring Cr-RBA via a newly developed mouse model and its influence by Cr speciation. Our data suggest a potential risk associated with incidental exposure to Cr-contaminated soils via an oral pathway."

Current approaches to recognize unknown I-DBPs in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis rely on negative ionization mode, in which the characteristic I– fragment can be observed in tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). Still, many I-DBPs ionize exclusively in positive ionization mode, where the I– fragment is absent. To address this gap, this work developed a machine learning-based strategy to recognize iodinated compounds (I-compounds) from their MS/MS in both electrospray positive (ESI+) and negative ionization (ESI−) modes. Investigating over 6000 MS/MS spectra of 381 I-compounds, we first identified five characteristic I-containing neutral losses and one diagnostic I– fragment in ESI+ and ESI– modes, respectively. We then trained Random Forest models and integrated them into IodoFinder, a Python program, to streamline the recognition of I-compounds from raw LC-MS data. IodoFinder accurately recognized over 96% of the 161 I-compound standards in both ionization modes. In its application to DBP mixtures, IodoFinder discovered 19 I-DBPs with annotated structures and an additional 17 with assigned formulas, including 12 novel and 3 confirmed I-DBPs.

These challenges make it difficult to analyze and monitor TCs as a class of molecules simultaneously. In this study, a broad-spectrum aptamer capable of recognizing TCs was developed by artificially editing a single-specific aptamer. Subsequently, based on the mathematical proof of broad-spectrum aptamer detection of TCs, an electrochemical sensor was constructed to enable simple and rapid monitoring of TCs with high sensitivity, high selectivity, and a wide detection range. The sensor exhibits a detection range of 0.01 to 1000 nM and a detection limit of 1.18 pM, while maintaining excellent selectivity even in the presence of interfering substances at concentrations up to 100 times the test concentration. This sensor is suitable for quantifying the overall level of TCs in various environmental scenarios, facilitating the study of TCs transport and transformation processes in environmental systems. Finally, the broad-spectrum recognition mechanism of the aptamer was elucidated, which makes the method rational and universal, and will help future researchers to obtain broad-spectrum aptamers for rapid monitoring and analysis of multiple classes of pollutants."

Thus, this study mapped Pb, Ca, and Mg distributions in Chinese cabbage leaves following PM2.5-Pb stress using synchrotron and fast micro-X-ray fluorescence. Findings revealed that PM2.5-Pb was transported and localized in guard cells, the epidermal cell wall, and chloroplasts.

Hospital effluents contain both natural and synthetic hormones that might significantly contribute to endocrine disruption in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, HT-EDA has been implemented to identify the main effect-drivers (testosterone, androsterone and norgestrel) from hospital effluent using microplate fractionation, the AR-CALUX bioassay and an efficient data processing workflow. Through nontargeted screening, over 5000 features (ESI+) were initially detected, but our workflow’s prioritization based on androgenic activity prediction reduced the number of features requiring further analysis by over 95%, significantly streamlining the workload. In addition, the semiquantitative nontarget analysis allowed for the calculation of the contribution of an identified compound to the total activity of the sample without the need for reference standards. While this contribution was low (∼4.3%) and applicable to only one compound (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), it presents the first approach for calculating such contributions without relying on standards. Compared to the available alternatives our workflow demonstrates clear environmental relevance by enhancing HT-EDA for more efficient identification and prioritization of effect-drivers in hospital effluents, and it can be adapted to address other environmental threats in complex mixtures."

Here, we present experimental data on Ni isotope fractionation during binding by common Ni-binding amino acids: glutamate (carboxylate side chain), histidine (imidazole side chain), and cysteine (sulfhydryl side chain). We used an equilibrium Donnan dialysis approach to separate free versus bound Ni and measured the isotopic composition of both pools via multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Our results reveal that the glutamate and cysteine favor heavy 60Ni (Δ60/58Niglutamate = +0.80 ± 0.08; Δ60/58Nicysteine = +1.27 ± 0.08‰), while histidine causes little isotope shift (−0.12 ± 0.16‰). We then conducted experiments using a short peptide that is a structural analogue for acetyl-CoA synthetase and Ni-iron hydrogenase metal-binding sites. The peptide preferentially bound the heavy 60Ni with a Δ60/58Nipeptide value of +0.74 ± 0.04‰.

However, as a crucial component in high-performance PSCs, highly toxic lead may leak from discarded PSCs and cause environmental and health risks. Implementing the effective recovery of lead from discarded PSCs is crucial for the sustainable development of the PSC industry. Existing lead recovery methods commonly use toxic organic solvents as leaching reagents, i.e., dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, impeding the potential application of recycling technologies. This study proposes a facile ultrasonic water leaching technique for effectively recovering lead from the glass substrate of discarded PSCs. During the ultrasonic water leaching process, the perovskite layer undergoes rapid degradation, generating PbI2. Most of the PbI2 dissolves in the water, yielding a leaching solution containing a low lead concentration, while a minor fraction is converted into insoluble Pb(OH)I particles. The cumulative Pb removal ratio from the first two cycles of ultrasonic water leaching processes can reach 99.84%.

In this study, nine kinds of MPs or microrubbers (MRs) from dust fall (DF) in Xi’an, a megacity in northwestern China, were measured by pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy, namely, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon 88, polybutylene, polytetrafluorethylene, polyisoprene, polyvinyl chloride, natural rubber, and synthesis rubber. Here, 51.20% of MPs were extracted from the original DF (samples denoted DF-O). After the subtracting procedure, MPs and their residual (DF-S samples) were divided into two parts. Our results indicated that the DF-O and MPs samples exhibited higher cytotoxicity, inflammatory, and oxidative stress levels than the DF-S samples did. The DF-O and MPs samples suppressed autophagy by decreasing expression levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3B), p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated AKT protein (p-Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) while increasing the level of p62. Meanwhile, DF-O and MPs samples induced apoptosis through increasing levels of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 in Raw264.7 cells. These trends could be reversed through removing half of the MPs in DF-O. Therefore, dust fall microplastics inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis via activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 ratios. Here we provide a comprehensive perspective into the studies of atmospheric MPs pollution status and mechanisms of inhalation toxicity for health risk assessment of MPs in DF."

Here, we show that poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) films undergo ultraviolet photoaging, resulting in increased surface roughness and a higher quantity of MNPs on the surface. This aging process involves the generation of carbon- and oxygen-centered free radicals, chain scission, and the formation of oxidation products with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. These MNPs can be released under water shear force, significantly increasing the normalized mass loss of aged films to approximately 0.128 mg/cm2 (18 times higher than that of unaged films in water). In the gastrointestinal environment, the normalized mass loss further increases to about 0.196 mg/cm2 (28 times higher), likely due to potential enzymatic digestion and ion-swelling effects. These MNPs, primarily composed of PLA, are smaller and carry more negative charges under gastrointestinal conditions. In the THP-1 cell model, these MNPs affect cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. MNPs obtained through ultrafiltration, compared to those collected via centrifugation, display a broader size distribution and induce more pronounced toxicity in THP-1 cells, with an EC50 of 243 mg/L. Preliminary comparative analysis indicates that PLA/PBAT-derived MNPs present toxicity risks comparable to, or greater than, those of conventional plastic MNPs.

Here, we employed different estrogen exposure scenarios to compare the applicability of mucus VTG and other conventional biomarkers in zebrafish for EE monitoring. After acute exposure to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) at various concentrations, mucus VTG demonstrated higher sensitivity in male zebrafish than in female zebrafish. Mucus VTG change patterns were similar to liver and blood VTG change patterns in males. Time-course exposure experiments revealed that male mucus VTG responded to EE2 much earlier than male liver and blood VTG, underlining the promise of mucus VTG as an early warning signal of aquatic estrogenicity. Exposure to multiple EEs further validated the high sensitivity of male mucus VTG. Proteomics analysis revealed that EE2 exposure potently shifted the proteome structure of male mucosa, and the VTG1 isoform was noted to be the most suitable biomarker. Overall, our results refine the roles of mucus VTG1 from male fish as a noninvasive, rapid, and sensitive biomarker of aquatic xenoestrogens, applicable to ecological risk assessment for animal welfare and ecosystem protection.

Environmental pollutants could activate astrocytes into A1 (toxic) or A2 (protective) types and induce different effects. Meanwhile, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an environmental molecule sensor in the body and has various ligands. But the difference between exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands on the astrocytic activation is unclear; in this study, we employed rat primary cultured cortical astrocytes to reveal the effects and mechanisms of AhR ligands on astrocytic activation. We found that, after treatment with exogenous AhR ligand (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 nmol/L, astrocytes mainly exhibited A2 type activation. The specific manifestation includes the increase in the expression of A2 marker genes, the enhancement of cellular autonomous movement, the expression and secretion of chemokines, such as Cxcl10, Cxcl2, and Ccl7. And TCDD-induced A2 type astrocytes show a positive impact on neuronal synaptic formation. Although both TCDD and endogenous AhR ligand (6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole, FICZ) could activate AhR pathway in astrocytes, FICZ (50 nmol/L) neither induces activation of A2 type astrocytes nor upregulation of chemokines.

This study aimed to clarify the health impacts of cockroaches by investigating the microbial interactions among cockroaches, the indoor environment, and humans. We simultaneously collected cockroach, indoor environment (indoor air and floor dust), and human (exhaled breath condensate and skin) samples from residential areas in five cities representing distinct climate zones in China. The 16S rDNA sequencing results revealed that cockroaches harbor diverse bacterial populations that vary across different cities. The prevalence of potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB) in cockroaches ranged from 1.1% to 58.9%, with dominant resistance genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, macrolide, and beta-lactam. The relationships between the cockroach microbiome and the associated environmental and human microbiomes were explored by using fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST). The potential contribution of cockroach bacteria to the floor dust-borne microbiome and indoor airborne microbiome was estimated to be 5.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Similarly, the potential contribution of cockroach PPB to the floor dust-borne microbiome and indoor airborne microbiome was calculated to be 4.0% and 1.2%, respectively.

Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in  human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under Aβ exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under Aβ exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The Aβ induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that Aβ exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered  detoxification by the lysosome.

Previous studies identified deposits of aliphatic organics in and around the Ernutet crater, and at small locations at Inamahari and Urvara craters. The origin of organics, either endogenic or exogenic, in these fresh exposures is still under debate. This study addresses the origin of the organics by analyzing their global distribution and geologic context. Our first step involved a global search for organic‐rich sites that might have escaped previous detections. We achieved this by using a deep neural network, utilizing spectral redness in the Dawn's Framing Camera multispectral data to identify potential organic‐rich sites. The identified sites were further studied by using IR spectrometer data to infer the compositions of materials showing spectral redness. Of the newly identified red‐sloped sites, only two can be considered certain to be organic‐rich. We also identified sites with spectral redness, but without any signature of organics in their infrared spectra. These sites could be attributed to the aqueous alteration of magnetite into ferric‐iron bearing phases. At Ernutet, Inamahari, and Urvara, the organic‐rich material is confined to the near surface only. Additionally, the absence of tectonic/volcanic features at these sites makes an endogenic origin questionable. The global rarity of detectable organics also supports this assessment. Consequently, we suggest that organics at these sites were originally delivered by low‐velocity, organic‐rich impactor(s) from the main belt and subsequently excavated, rather than originating from endogenous processes."

Our study estimates total annual premature deaths (APDs) associated with global SB‐attributable PM2.5 and O3 exposure as 1.11 million [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.00–1.22 million] in 2000 up to 1.43 million (95% CI: 1.30–1.56 million) in 2019. China's SB emissions and associated APDs have reduced substantially, whereas India and ROA had a major leap in both estimates in 2019 compared to 2000. China's progress in cutting residential SB emissions accounts for its improvements. Our study urges the reduction of SB usage and emissions to potentially improve overall air quality and human health conditions, especially in highly populated, low‐ and middle‐income countries, where the poor air quality and associated health burden attributable to SB emissions are estimated to be higher."

 The lower mantle occupies over half of Earth’s volume, and accordingly, its mineralogy is crucial in determining the structure and dynamics of Earth. Davemaoite, the calcium silicate perovskite, was believed to coexist with bridgmanite in the lower mantle and is considered essential for understanding the chemical evolution and dynamics of Earth’s lower mantle. However, the presence of davemaoite is challenged due to the potential for high calcium silicate solubility in bridgmanite. Here we use an ultrahigh-pressure multi-anvil technique to show experimentally that the calcium solubility in bridgmanite is insufficient to eliminate davemaoite under mantle conditions, including typical mantle pressure, temperature and chemical compositions. We conclude that davemaoite has been stable in Earth’s lower mantle since its formation. Due to the limited calcium solubility in bridgmanite, davemaoite-enriched domains are expected at the core–mantle boundary. These domains could serve as the principal reservoir for incompatible elements in the lower mantle and may be the source for some ocean island basalts. Furthermore, our study offers an explanation for the observed large low-shear-wave-velocity provinces at the bottom of the lower mantle. These provinces may consist of davemaoite-enriched materials crystallized from basal magma ocean in early Earth history.

Here, the authors use genome-wide association meta-analysis to discover psoriasis susceptibility loci and genes, which encode existing and potential new drug targets. 
 Psoriasis is a common, debilitating immune-mediated skin disease. Genetic studies have identified biological mechanisms of psoriasis risk, including those targeted by effective therapies. However, the genetic liability to psoriasis is not fully explained by variation at robustly identified risk loci. To refine the genetic map of psoriasis susceptibility we meta-analysed 18 GWAS comprising 36,466 cases and 458,078 controls and identified 109 distinct psoriasis susceptibility loci, including 46 that have not been previously reported. These include susceptibility variants at loci in which the therapeutic targets IL17RA and AHR are encoded, and deleterious coding variants supporting potential new drug targets (including in STAP2, CPVL and POU2F3). We conducted a transcriptome-wide association study to identify regulatory effects of psoriasis susceptibility variants and cross-referenced these against single cell expression profiles in psoriasis-affected skin, highlighting roles for the transcriptional regulation of haematopoietic cell development and epigenetic modulation of interferon signalling in psoriasis pathobiology.

 Somatic mobilization of LINE-1 (L1) has been implicated in cancer etiology. We analyzed a recent TCGA data release comprised of nearly 5000 pan-cancer paired tumor-normal whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples and ~9000 tumor RNA samples. We developed TotalReCall an improved algorithm and pipeline for detection of L1 retrotransposition (RT), finding high correlation between L1 expression and “RT burden” per sample. Furthermore, we mathematically model the dual regulatory roles of p53, where mutations in TP53 disrupt regulation of both L1 expression and retrotransposition. We found those with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) heritable TP53 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants bear similarly high L1 activity compared to matched cancers from patients without LFS, suggesting this population be considered in attempts to target L1 therapeutically. Due to improved sensitivity, we detect over 10 genes beyond TP53 whose mutations correlate with L1, including ATRX, suggesting other, potentially targetable, mechanisms underlying L1 regulation in cancer remain to be discovered.

 Topological dislocation modes resulting from the interplay between spatial dislocations and momentum-space topology have recently attracted significant interest. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate time-dislocation topological modes which are induced by the interplay between temporal dislocations and Floquet-band topology.

 Light-induced phenomena in materials can exhibit exotic behavior that extends beyond equilibrium properties, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling electronic phases. So far, non-equilibrium phenomena in solids have been predominantly explored using femtosecond laser pulses, which generate transient, ultra-fast dynamics. Here, we investigate the steady non-equilibrium regime in graphene induced by a continuous-wave (CW) mid-infrared laser. Our transport measurements reveal signatures of a long-lived Floquet phase, where a non-equilibrium electronic population is stabilized by the interplay between coherent photoexcitation and incoherent phonon cooling. The observation of non-equilibrium steady states using CW lasers stimulates further investigations of low-temperature Floquet phenomena towards Floquet engineering of steady-state phases of matter.

Using high-resolution models, this work shows that western boundary currents will shift shorewards as a result of increased stratification driven by climate change. 
 Subtropical western boundary currents (WBCs) refer to swift narrow oceanic currents that flow along the western edges of global subtropical ocean basins. Earlier studies indicated that the WBCs are extending poleward under a warming climate. However, owing to limited observations and coarse resolution of climate models, how greenhouse warming may affect the zonal structure of the WBCs remains unknown. Here, using seven high-resolution climate models, we find an onshore intensification of the WBCs in a warming climate. The multimodel ensemble mean of onshore acceleration ranges from 0.10 ± 0.08 to 0.51 ± 0.24 cm s−1 per decade over 1950–2050. Enhanced oceanic stratification associated with fast surface warming induces an uplift of the WBCs, leading to the projected change. The onshore intensification could induce anomalous warming that exacerbates coastal marine heatwaves, reduces ability of the coastal oceans to absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide and destabilizes methane hydrate stored below the sea floor of shelf regions. Western boundary currents flow along the western edge of subtropical oceans, transporting heat polewards, and are integral in the climate system.

In this study, the ability of Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models to capture the northward propagation of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) is examined using a counting algorithm. A composite moisture budget reveals the difference in moisture dynamics between the above-average-performing (AAPM) and below-average-performing (BAPM) models. The AAPM composite has a stronger horizontal moisture advection ahead of the convection centre than the BAPM composite. The weaker wind and moisture perturbations in the BAPM mainly cause this difference in the horizontal moisture advection between AAPM and BAPM. The BAPM composite shows a weaker equatorial convection signal compared to the AAPM composite, resulting in weaker wind and moisture perturbations and a lesser number of northward propagations. Finally, we understand the future of BSISO by examining the projections of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 370 (SSP370) from the available AAPMs. The background moisture will be enhanced uniformly in the future, leading to no substantial change in gradients. The equatorial convection amplifies and broadens in the future projections, leading to very little change in the wind perturbations. This results in the enhancement of BSISO rainfall by 63% in the Bay of Bengal and 42% in the Arabian Sea. However, the proportion of northward propagations remains the same as moisture advection remains the same. The study implies that with a correct representation of BSISO’s equatorial convection, the prediction of BSISO and extreme rainfall associated with BSISOs becomes more reliable."

 Recent investigations based on sea–air transfer physical mechanistic studies suggest that the global ocean’s contribution to atmospheric microplastic emissions is significantly lower (four orders of magnitude) than previously estimated. However, no atmospheric models or observations have yet validated this lower emission flux, leaving the analysis without adequate validation and practical significance. Here, we provide quantitative estimates of the global atmospheric microplastic budget based on this reduced oceanic flux. Our model aligns well with observed atmospheric microplastic concentrations and suggests that the ocean functions more as a sink than a source, contributing only ~0.008% of global emissions but accounting for ~15% of total deposition. This challenges the previous view of the ocean as the primary atmospheric microplastic source, urging a reassessment of pollution mitigation strategies."

 The zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere shows a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which is an important reference for climate prediction and stratosphere-troposphere interaction. However, the periodicity of the QBO was disrupted during the 2015/16 and 2019/20 Northern Hemisphere winters, raising big challenges to its predictability and attracting widespread attention. Previous studies have indicated that planetary wave (PW) activity from mid-latitude in the lower stratosphere is one of the main sources for the reversal of the zonal wind field, our results show that in addition to that, the presence of dissipated eastward-moving waves in the middle stratosphere can be important for the formation of QBO disruptions. The above two wave signs appear successively before the disruption, exert strong negative forcing on the background flow, and together form a dynamic configuration that occurs before the tropical stratospheric circulation anomalies. It may be necessary to take this PW dynamic configuration into account when predicting future QBO disruptions."

Instead of using local planktonic radiocarbon age, the source water radiocarbon age is derived from global planktonic data weighted by their water mass contributions, with weights simulated by dye tracers. An iterative approach is used to account for the effect of the temporal variation of the atmospheric radiocarbon or the so-called projection age issue. In this ocean model, we demonstrate that our BwP age effectively reproduces the pure water age that results from the interior ocean circulation. Preliminary application to the North Pacific suggests that the pure water age at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is not much older than today."

 While the influence of ENSO on Antarctic sea ice variability is well-known, its role in sea ice predictability, both linear and nonlinear, remains unexplored. This study utilizes deep learning models to quantify ENSO’s impact on Antarctic sea ice predictability. We find that ENSO events exert cross-timescale influences on sea ice’s subseasonal linear and nonlinear predictability. Within a 3-week lead time, ice persistence is the primary source of predictability. Beyond this period, ENSO becomes a key source of Antarctic sea ice predictability, with El Niño enhancing ice linear predictability more than La Niña. Specifically, El Niño improves ice linear predictability by 25.6%, 19.6%, and 30.4% in the A-B Sea, Ross Sea, and Indian Ocean, respectively, at an 8-week lead time. La Niña mainly enhances ice nonlinear predictability, particularly in the Ross Sea. We demonstrate that ENSO provides additional sources for Antarctic sea ice predictability primarily through generating more extensive ice anomalies. These insights deepen our understanding of sea ice predictability and are crucial for advancing forecasting models."

 Hydrogen is of interest for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors because it does not produce carbon dioxide when combusted. However, hydrogen has indirect warming effects. Here we conducted a life cycle assessment of electrolysis and steam methane reforming to assess their emissions while considering hydrogen’s indirect warming effects. We find that the primary factors influencing life cycle climate impacts are the production method and related feedstock emissions rather than the hydrogen leakage and indirect warming potential. A comparison between fossil fuel-based and hydrogen-based steel production and heavy-duty transportation showed a reduction in emissions of 800 to more than 1400 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of steel and 0.1 to 0.17 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne-km of cargo. While any hydrogen production pathway reduces greenhouse gas emissions for steel, this is not the case for heavy-duty transportation.

 Spring persistent rainfall is a unique climate phenomenon that prevails in East Asia today, providing precious water resources to this densely populated region.

The contrasting evolution of spring persistent rainfall in East Asia and North America is determined by paleogeography and further influenced by CO2-induced warming.

 Sediment resuspension of blue carbon ecosystems (e.g., seagrass beds) and muddy sediments exposes buried particulate organic carbon to oxygenated waters and remineralization, potentially enhancing carbon dioxide fluxes. However, the kinetics of carbon degradation under oxic and anoxic conditions are poorly constrained. We report the results of incubation experiments with sediments from Kiel Bight to simulate sediment resuspension events induced by natural and anthropogenic resuspension in this area. A numerical model determined that oxic carbon remineralization rates were up to two-fold higher than those under anoxic conditions. A coupled sediment-water column model demonstrated that pyrite oxidation, rather than carbon oxidation, has the potential to induce large carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere following anthropogenic sediment disturbance by trawling. Upscaling to muddy areas of Kiel Bight suggests an annual emission of up to ~14 k tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Pyrite oxidation may contribute to a weakening of the carbon shelf pump and a reduction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide uptake.

 The Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) is the first satellite developed specifically for implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The multispectral imager (MII) onboard SDGSAT-1 provides advanced capabilities for coastal and inland water environment analysis but requires comprehensive radiometric performance evaluation for effective water monitoring. In this study, the radiometric performance of SDGSAT-1 MII was evaluated for water quality monitoring by assessing its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and radiometric sensitivity to variations in suspended particulate matter (SPM). The SNR was statistically estimated from homogeneous waters over the South China Sea (SCS), and radiometric sensitivity was simulated using the Hydrolight software under varied SPM conditions. Results indicated that SDGSAT-1 MII exhibits significantly improved SNR and radiometric sensitivity compared to commonly used satellite sensors (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2B MSI), extensively applied in turbid water monitoring. Preliminary validation of SDGSAT-1 MII remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) derived from Acolite DSF against Aeronet-OC measurements demonstrated strong agreement at 438 nm (r2=0.98 and NRMSE = 9.04 %), 495 nm (r2=0.94 and NRMSE = 16.39 %), 553 nm (r2=0.99 and NRMSE = 7.97 %) and 657 nm (r2=0.77 and NRMSE = 35.85 %).

However, the consistency of Rrs at the 401 nm and near-infrared bands (776 nm and 854 nm) was substantially lower relative to other bands.

Overall, these findings highlight the strong potential of SDGSAT-1 MII for monitoring coastal turbid waters, while also noting certain spectral limitations, especially for the shorter (401 nm) and near-infrared bands.

 Climate change significantly compromises global water resources, particularly shallow aquifer systems, which are vulnerable to variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration. This study investigated the impacts of climate change on a shallow aquifer system in the Gniezno Lakeland, Poland, by analysing the relationship among ground motion, hydraulic head changes, surface water variations, and meteorological trends. We used EGMS-based InSAR ground motion products to detect subtle land surface displacements across the study area, combined with hydrogeological data, meteorological records, and surface water measurements. Our results revealed a slight but ongoing subsidence of −0.9 mm/year across the area, with variations observed across different land cover types and wetlands being the most affected. Seasonal oscillations in hydraulic head (8–50 cm) and ground motion (2–7 mm) highlighted the aquifer's elastic response to climate variability. Long-term meteorological data indicated a trend towards a drier climate, with annual increases in temperature (+0.5 °C), insolation (+6.8 h), and evaporation (+3.8 mm), coupled with decreasing humidity (−0.13 %/year). The annual negative vertical water exchange, exceeding the volume of groundwater extraction, suggests that climate-driven factors are the primary drivers of aquifer storage decline. The aquifer system exhibited greater resilience to climate change than surface water, as evidenced by its annual storage change (∼2 % of lake volume fluctuations). Localized subsidence patterns near the lake shoreline further underscored the interplay between surface water and groundwater in this region. Our findings provide insights into the impacts of climate change on shallow aquifer systems and highlight the importance of integrating multisource data for comprehensive hydrogeological assessments."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in agricultural, hydrological, and ecological studies. Microwave remote sensing can retrieve soil moisture at regional or global scales, but is limited by coarse spatial resolution. In order to generate large-scale, spatiotemporally seamless soil moisture of high precision, we propose a two-stage downscaling and correction cascade learning framework by fusing multi-sourced remote sensing and in-situ data. Under the framework, the Hybrid Attention based residual dense Network for soil moisture Downscaling (HAND) is developed to downscale the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM products from 36 km to 1 km effectively. The Random Forest method is subsequently employed to correct the downscaled SM products by in-situ measurements and the 1 km seamless daily SM products of high precision are then generated. The soil moisture downscaling network adopts the Residual Dense connection Network (RDN) as the backbone and embeds a multi-factor interactive attention module, a cross-attention module, and the hybrid attention block with increased/ decreased receptive field, to comprehensively extract the complex relationships between geoscience parameters and soil moisture. The western continental of the United States is served as the study area of this paper, covering 2016–2020. The Pearson correlation (R, unitless) and the Unbiased Root-Mean-Square Error (UbRMSE, m3/m3) values of the HAND downscaled products with SMAP are 0.65 and 0.066 m3/m3, showing the ability of HAND model to achieve satisfactory accuracy while maintaining consistency with original SMAP products, as well as restoring fine spatial details. After the in-situ correction, the R and UbRMSE values of ten-folder cross validation against the in-situ SM reach 0.92 and 0.033m3/m3, while the metrics of SMAP SM against the in-situ SM are 0.46 and 0.083 m3/m3, which demonstrates great potential of the proposed method in water resources management at regional scale."

 New advancements in satellite technology enable more accurate observation of woody population dynamics, providing greater insights into the underlying processes that influence their change. In this study, we evaluate the use of PlanetScope NDVI time series to track the phenology of individual trees in the Sahel, where ground-based environmental surveys are scarce. Five-year NDVI time series were produced for 398 trees with known species recorded in Mali, Senegal, and Niger. Clouds and high aerosol contamination were filtered using MODIS products and focused on the dry season to minimize the influence of background NDVI directly (through crown influence) or indirectly (through adjacency effects). Each NDVI time series profile was fitted with a spline model to obtain the minimum NDVI day of year during the dry season. PlanetScope NDVI time series accurately captured the photosynthetic phenology of individual tree crowns in the Sahel, with discernable differences between individuals and species. When species were grouped based on four phenology types, deciduous and inverse deciduous species exhibited a relatively consistent phenological pattern across all sites. The phenology of semi-evergreen species and evergreen species, which include species with few leaves, was more heterogeneous. Intra-species variation was relatively modest between sites, and most species maintained a similar NDVI profile, with shifts in leaf phenology events correlating with the timing of the wet season in each site. Overlap between the different phenology groups indicates that transitions between phenology types and species are not clear-cut, and even individuals of the same species can demonstrate plasticity. Furthermore, NDVI profiles were extracted for 500 randomly selected tree samples within eight 10 km2 clip boxes distributed along the West African rainfall gradient from 9.9° to 16.6° latitude at −1.6° longitude. This analysis showed a strong relationship between the phenology of woody plants and the timing and distribution of rainfall at each latitude. Green-up of woody vegetation before herbaceous vegetation was marked in the more southern Sahelo-Sudanian latitudes. Additionally, despite the prolonged dry season in the more northern semi-arid latitudes, trees retained their greenness remarkably late into the dry season. Increased air temperature and dryness as a result of climate change could impact tree function in this region and needs individual-based monitoring."

In the latest USGS Landsat Collection 2 processing, <1 % MSS archive could be geometrically processed to the highest-level Tier 1 category. We present a novel methodology to characterize and correct MSS geometric distortions using Landsat 8 and 9 OLI L1TP images as references, and using a new many-to-many matching strategy applied to MSS and OLI time series to provide large quantities of tie-points needed for effective MSS image geometric characterization and correction. The method is demonstrated at four U.S. sites (Landsat path/rows), including a site over Las Vegas that had significant surface change, and considering 182 MSS and 38 OLI Collection 2 images. Significant and spatially-variable MSS geometric distortions were found, with mean RMSE distortions of 43.2, 25.2, 24.0, 22.2, and 21.0 m for Landsat 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 MSS L1TP images, respectively, and 327.0 m for Landsat 1 MSS L1GS images. After geometric correction, these mean RMSE values were reduced to 12.0, 12.0, 13.8, 12.0 and 11.4 m for the Landsat 1–5 MSS L1TP images, and 15.0 m for the Landsat 1 MSS L1GS images. The geometrically corrected MSS L1TP images acquired over each site were mutually well registered with site mean RMSE values from 9.6 to 20.4 m. The results indicate the methodology can be applied to the MSS archive in support of Landsat time series applications extending back to the 1970s, and to include a greater proportion of the MSS archive in the USGS Landsat analysis ready data (ARD) data suite that requires Tier 1 processing."

 Forest fires significantly threaten Indonesia’s tropical forests, driven by complex interactions between human activity, environmental conditions and climate variability. This research aims to identify and analyze the factors influencing forest fires in Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua during the rainy, dry and all-season conditions using machine learning techniques and create vulnerability prediction maps and categorize risk zones. Eight years (2015–2022) of forest fire data were combined with 15 forest fire susceptible factors that consider of human, environmental, meteorological, and land use/land cover conditioning factors. Random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models were used to train and validate the dataset through hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for accuracy assessment. The XGB model was selected as the best performer based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score and was used to generate probability values. The evaluation showed that the accuracies and AUC values for the nine models were greater than 0.7, with AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.95, indicating good performance. Papua had the highest accuracy, with 90.5%, 91.6%, and 92.5% for all, rainy, and dry seasons, respectively. Population density, elevation, precipitation, soil moisture, NDMI, NDVI, distance from roads and settlements, land surface temperature and peatlands are the key contributing factors of forest fire occurrences. Vulnerability maps categorized into five risk zones, identifying high-risk areas that aligned with observed fire occurrences. This research highlighted the diverse characteristics of factors that determine forest fires and examined their impact on fire occurrences. The findings provide actionable insights for targeted fire management strategies, though future research should incorporate additional variables to improve predictive accuracy and address long-term environmental changes."

The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system is a powerful tool for analyzing inducible protein loss in vitro, but it is toxic to mice. Here, we use an optimized second-generation AID system to achieve the conditional and reversible loss of the essential centrosomal protein CEP192 in live mice. We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly. Sustained CEP192 loss in vivo led to cell division failure and cell death in proliferative tissues. Thus, the second-generation AID system is well suited for rapid and/or sustained protein depletion in live mice to study essential functions in vivo."

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation."

Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface.

However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungusTrichoderma guizhouense, whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway.

In the long-wavelength IR (8 to 14 μm) region, near-unity emissivity was successfully achieved by 100-μm-deep metal microcavities with ultralow structural aspect ratios, facilitated by laser-textured multiscale surface morphologies that substantially enhance the light-trapping capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that microcavity-based patterns can produce local emissivity, tunable radiative intensity gradients, wide-angle feasibility, and high-temperature resistance, thereby enabling diverse applications in thermal IR displays such as thermal illusion, IR encryption, and grayscale thermal imaging.

However, the impact of temporally activating microglial Gi signaling on microglial dynamics and neuronal activity in the homeostatic brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we used Gi-based designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (Gi-DREADD) to selectively and temporally modulate microglial Gi signaling pathway. By integrating this chemogenetic approach with in vivo two-photon imaging, we observed that exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling transiently inhibited microglial process dynamics, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired neuronal synchronization. These altered neuronal functions were associated with a decrease in interactions between microglia and neuron somata. Together, this study demonstrates that acute, exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling regulates neuronal circuit function, offering a potential pharmacological target for the neuromodulation through microglia."

We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry.

Unique many-body quantum characteristics, such as gaped excitations, strong spin entanglement, and fractionalized excitations, have been demonstrated, but the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a single antiferromagnetic couplingJvalue remained unexplored. Here, we realized the entangled antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with diazahexabenzocoronene oligomers (up to 7 units) on Au(111). Extensive low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory and many-body calculations show that even-numbered spin chains host a collective state with gapped excitations, while odd-numbered chains feature a Kondo excitation. We found that a given antiferromagnetic couplingJvalue between first neighbors in the entangled quantum states is responsible for the quantum phenomena, strongly relating to their parities of the chain.

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 1012Jones and low detection errors (ΔS1–3≤ 5.0%). We further showcase their application in full-stokes imaging polarimetry with the lowest detection errors yet."

However, grave concerns associated with stack emissions from incineration exist because mechanistic studies have thus far relied on ex situ analyses of end products and theoretical calculations. Here, we used synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry to study the pyrolysis of a representative PFAS—perfluorohexanoic acid—and provide direct evidence of fluorocarbon radicals and intermediates. A key reaction pathway from perfluorocarboxylic acids to ketenes via acyl fluorides is proposed.

These samples exhibit a homogeneous single-phase structure at macroscopic and microscopic scales, yet display notable chemical fluctuations at the atomic to nanoscale. These fluctuations, along with the unusual atomic occupations, lead to an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity akin to that of amorphous materials. Combining the optimized carrier concentration and well-maintained carrier mobility, we ultimately achieved a highzTvalue of 1.2 at 750 kelvin, outperforming most previously reported AB2Sb2-type Zintls.

Here, we investigate the influence of PS in the precision spectroscopy of the 23S− 23Ptransition of helium (4He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that PS based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately −55 kHz.

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader.

In comparison, alkynes had lower kO3 (∼102 M–1 s–1) and higher activation energies (36.7–48.1 kJ mol–1).

However, the impact of fluctuation duration on biogeochemical processes remains unclear. We hypothesized that rates of FeIII reduction and CH4 production are sensitive to the duration of soil oxygenation. To test this, surface soil from the Luquillo Forest, Puerto Rico, was subjected to fluctuating redox conditions with an anoxic interval of 6 days followed by oxic intervals of either 8, 24, or 72 h. Shorter oxic intervals enhanced Fe reduction, while longer oxic intervals enhanced CH4 emissions. As O2 exposure decreased from 72 to 8 h, Fe reduction rates increased from 0.12 ± 0.02 to 0.26 ± 0.05 mmol kg–1 h–1, whereas cumulative CH4 decreased from 44.0 ± 4.7 to 12.7 ± 4.6 μmol kg–1. 13C-amino acid spikes were preferentially incorporated into the DNA of iron reducers (Anaeromyxobacter sp.) in the shorter oxic treatment (8 h vs 24 h), suggesting that Fe reducers are less inhibited by shorter periods of oxidation. Conversely, longer oxygen pulses appear to suppress Fe reducers more than methanogens, leading to increased CH4 emissions.

Deaths Attributable to Unsafe Sanitation in Rural areas (DAUSRs) are influenced by demographic factors, disease mortality rates, and environmental sanitation conditions. However, most studies have been limited in scope and scale and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework for global DAUSRs. Therefore, this study estimated the global DAUSRs from 2000 to 2030, using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We employed methods such as comparable risk assessment, Bayesian age (period) models, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Changes in the DAUSRs and their influencing factors were evaluated by applying a decomposition method to assess the impact of population dynamics, sanitation conditions, age structure, and disease mortality rates. The results indicated that despite improvements in rural sanitation, 12.2% of rural populations will still lack access to sanitary toilets in 2030, with an estimated 243,000 deaths (CI: 147,000–441,000) due to unsafe rural sanitation environments. This outcome highlights the need for better rural sanitation governance to provide for demographic shifts, such as aging and declining fertility rates, which are key drivers of DAUSRs. Regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia are at a higher risk with higher diarrhea-related mortality rates in rural areas. We suggest comprehensive measures, including enhancing rural medical facilities, improving sanitation infrastructure, and focusing on vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and children. These measures could inform global rural environmental and public health policies."

Isotopic analyses, including δ18O‐δ2H, 3H in water bodies, and Pb isotopes in soil, reveal that the LP is predominantly recharged by deep‐circulating groundwater from the Tibetan Plateau. During soil formation, groundwater traversing the lithosphere reached supercritical temperatures, extracting and transporting mineral elements that precipitated to form features characteristic of the red clay layer, such as dolomite and iron‐manganese deposits. This process persisted until approximately 2.6 Ma, when groundwater temperatures dropped below supercritical levels, initiating the accumulation of loess."

In Antarctica, they manifest primarily as a muted and phase‐shifted temperature signal, but recent studies suggest an additional in‐phase component. Here, we analyze the Southern Hemisphere (SH) response to spontaneous DO‐type oscillations in a general circulation model. The dominant Antarctic temperature mode is phase‐shifted compared to Greenland temperature variations and consistent with the oceanic pathway described by the bipolar seesaw model. However, the leading SH atmospheric circulation mode varies synchronously with Greenland temperatures.

Subsurface released methane is reactively transported toward ground surface with a portion converted to carbon dioxide by soil microbes. Currently, the extent to which fugitive CH4 oxidation occurs, including microbial taxa responsible and controlling parameters are poorly understood. Here, we examined fugitive CH4 leakage at a legacy well in the Montney region of British Columbia, Canada and find up to 90% is oxidized at rates as high as 230 g of CH4/m2 of soils/day during summer. Meanwhile, a profound difference in microbiome between soils at the wellhead and background was observed, while modeling suggests that prevailing seasonal temperature will moderate CH4 oxidation extent.

Here we find that the amplitude of SSS decadal variability in the WTP has been intensified significantly since the early 1950s. A comprehensive analysis of the salinity budget indicates that the amplifying of SSS decadal variability in the WTP is primarily attributed to changes in both the freshwater flux and ocean dynamics. During the past decades, surface currents in the WTP get stronger and result in enhanced salinity advection. In addition, the amplitude of decadal variability of freshwater flux is increased as well due to anomalous atmospheric circulation associated with the Victoria mode."

Here, we report the inverse melting of vortices in an amorphous Re6Zr thin film with moderate vortex pinning under the application of a magnetic field. By imaging the vortex state using a scanning tunnelling microscope, we show that at low fields and temperatures, the vortices form a “pinned liquid”, that is characterised by low mobility of the vortices and vortex density that is spatially inhomogeneous. As the temperature or magnetic field is increased, the vortices get ordered, eventually forming a nearly perfect vortex solid before melting again into a liquid.

 Cholestatic liver diseases are characterized by excessive bile acid accumulation in the liver. Endothelial cells (ECs) shape the local microenvironment in both normal conditions and liver injury, yet their role in cholestasis is unclear. Through a comparative analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from various murine models of liver injury, we identify distinctive Myc activation within ECs during obstructive cholestasis resulting from bile duct ligation (BDL). Myc overexpression in ECs significantly upregulates P-selectin, increasing neutrophil infiltration and worsening cholestatic liver injury. This process occurs through the FXR, activated by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its conjugate TCDCA. Inhibiting P-selectin with PSI-697 reduces neutrophil recruitment and alleviates injury. Cholestatic patient liver samples also show elevated Myc and P-selectin in ECs, along with increased neutrophils. The findings identify ECs as key drivers of cholestatic liver injury through a Myc-driven program and suggest that targeting the CDCA/FXR/Myc/P-selectin axis may offer a therapeutic approach.

 High kinetic inductance superconductors are gaining increasing interest for the realisation of qubits, amplifiers and detectors. Moreover, thanks to their high impedance, quantum buses made of such materials enable large zero-point fluctuations of the voltage, boosting the coupling rates to spin and charge qubits. However, fully exploiting the potential of disordered or granular superconductors is challenging, as their inductance and, therefore, impedance at high values are difficult to control. Here, we report a reproducible fabrication of granular aluminium resonators by developing a wireless ohmmeter, which allows in situ measurements during film deposition and, therefore, control of the kinetic inductance of granular aluminium films. Reproducible fabrication of circuits with impedances (inductances) exceeding 13 kΩ (1 nH per square) is now possible. By integrating a 7.9 kΩ resonator with a germanium double quantum dot, we demonstrate strong charge-photon coupling with a rate of gc/2π = 566 ± 2 MHz.

 The apicoplast, a relic plastid organelle derived from secondary endosymbiosis, is crucial for many medically relevant Apicomplexa. While it no longer performs photosynthesis, the organelle retains several essential metabolic pathways. In this study, we examine the four primary metabolic pathways in the Toxoplasma gondii apicoplast, along with an accessory pathway, and identify conditions that can bypass these. Contrary to the prevailing view that the apicoplast is indispensable for T. gondii, we demonstrate that bypassing all pathways renders the apicoplast non-essential. We further show that T. gondii lacking an apicoplast (T. gondii−Apico) can be maintained indefinitely in culture, establishing a unique model to study the functions of this organelle. Through comprehensive metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of T. gondii−Apico we uncover significant adaptation mechanisms following loss of the organelle and identify numerous putative apicoplast proteins revealed by their decreased abundance in T. gondii−Apico. Moreover, T. gondii−Apico parasites exhibit reduced sensitivity to apicoplast targeting compounds, providing a valuable tool for discovering new drugs acting on the organelle. The capability to culture T. gondii without its plastid offers new avenues for exploring apicoplast biology and developing novel therapeutic strategies against apicomplexan parasites.

 Prenatal exposure to metals has been associated with impaired neurodevelopment in children, but the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Based on the Wuhan Healthy Baby Cohort, China (N = 1088), eleven metals were measured in maternal urine during early pregnancy (13.1 ± 1.1 weeks) and metabolomics profiling was conducted in cord blood.

The weighted quantile sum index of the metal mixture showed a significant inverse association with MDI and PDI scores, with aluminum contributing the most to the associations.

Our results show that the EAMS circulation underwent twice abrupt changes: a rapid initiation of its modern structure when sea level rise exceeded −40 m, followed by a temporary overshoot of the Japan-Sea throughflows at −5 m. These nonlinear processes are caused by the opening of the Soya Strait and thus formation of the modern EAMS-circulation structure, and a transient absence of the circulation resembling a Kuroshio Large Meander following around-island integral constraint, respectively.

 Observational records during the past several decades show a marked increase in boreal winter extreme US hydroclimate events, with extreme floods and droughts becoming more common. Coincidentally, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a key driver of US precipitation and associated extreme hydroclimate on interannual time scales, has also increased in amplitude and is projected to continue increasing throughout the 21st century. This study examines future changes in ENSO and its impacts on the US winter extreme hydroclimate events (e.g., drought and flood) by using a large ensemble simulation. Results in this study show that both the amplitude of ENSO and ENSO-induced atmospheric teleconnections are projected to strengthen, leading to a significant increase in US precipitation variability and extreme hydroclimate events, albeit with notable regional differences. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis shows that the ENSO signal explains a significantly increased fraction of the total variance in US winter precipitation compared to non-ENSO factors (i.e., noise), suggesting a growing role of ENSO in future US extreme hydroclimate events.

 There is ongoing debate about whether lunar magnesian suite (Mg-suite) magmatism was a global, nearly synchronous event with a genetic link to potassium, rare-earth element and phosphorus components (KREEP). Arguin 002, the first whole-rock meteorite classified as a lunar norite, offers a unique opportunity to explore the genesis and timing of Mg-suite rocks. Here we investigated the petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry, and chronology of Arguin 002, revealing it to be an evolved, KREEP-free Mg-suite rock with chemical similarities to atypical Apollo-15 Fe-norites. It likely formed through plutonic magmatism originating from low-degree partial melting of a deep, KREEP-free mantle source and has a 207Pb/206Pb age of 4341.5  ± 9.3 Ma. The potential source of Arguin 002 is within the South Pole-Aitken basin, near the Chang’e-6 landing site.

 Soil moisture is coupled with vegetation and atmosphere, influencing global cycling of water, carbon, and energy. However, it remains unclear how soil moisture-atmosphere interactions affect land-atmosphere carbon and water exchanges simultaneously. Using Earth system model experiments, we show widespread carbon-water trade-offs between net ecosystem production and precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration driven by soil moisture dynamics. Soil moisture positively controls net ecosystem production and negatively affects precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration, through direct soil water stress and indirect soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks. While soil moisture variability magnifies the interannual variability of net ecosystem production, it moderates that of precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration over land. These opposing effects lead to a pronounced carbon-water trade-off, which originates from the interplay between carbon acquisition through photosynthesis and water extraction through evapotranspiration. This trade-off is projected to intensify in a warming and drying future, as soil moisture increasingly regulates carbon and water exchanges, posing a serious challenge to sustaining both terrestrial carbon sink and water supply.

 Rivers are crucial to biogeochemical cycles, connecting terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric systems. However, their ecosystems are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events. Here we used the environmental DNA approach to assess the impact of extreme drought-heatwave events on the aquatic plankton communities of the Yangtze River. We showed that an extreme drought-heatwave event reduced the α diversity of communities, increased their β diversity, and simultaneously simplified and destabilized community network structure. This event also shifted the dominant algae taxa from Bacillariophyta to Cyanobacteria, accompanied by increases in organic carbon and labile organic carbon contents. Globally, temperature rises during this extreme drought-heatwave event are more pronounced in high-latitude regions, likely amplifying impacts on river ecosystem biodiversity and stability.

 Basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves is primarily driven by heat delivery from warm Circumpolar Deep Water. Here we classify near-shelf water masses in an eddy-resolving numerical model of the Southern Ocean to develop a unified view of warm water intrusion onto the Antarctic continental shelf. We identify four regimes on seasonal timescales. In regime 1 (East Antarctica), heat intrusions are driven by easterly winds via Ekman dynamics. In regime 2 (West Antarctica), intrusion is primarily determined by the strength of a shelf-break undercurrent. In regime 3, the warm water cycle on the shelf is in antiphase with dense shelf water production (Adélie Coast). Finally, in regime 4 (Weddell and Ross seas), shelf-ward warm water inflow occurs along the western edge of canyons during periods of dense shelf water outflow.

Considering agriculture, forestry, land use, and energy, we assess the carbon footprint of biomass production and examine its end-use by provisioning systems. The footprint increased by 3.3 Gt CO2-eq, with 80% driven by international trade, mainly beef and biochemicals (biofuels, bioplastics, rubber). Biochemicals showed the largest relative increase, doubling due to tropical land-use change (feedstock cultivation) and China’s energy-intensive processing.

 The increasing frequency of extreme hot events poses significant societal and scientific challenges due to their adverse impacts on human and natural systems, compounded by their unpredictable nature. Climate models are essential for investigating root causes and anticipating long-term changes, yet their accuracy is limited by inherent uncertainties and errors. While observational constraint theories offer promise in addressing model issues, they often rely on empirical region-specific relationships. Here, we show that future changes in hot extremes and their uneven spread critically depend on historical thermal distributions, with variability playing a key role. We develop a universal analytical approach that combines observations with model outcomes, aiming for more reliable projections. Results reveal that hot event probabilities may grow faster than models imply across much of the global land. In vulnerable regions, increases could exceed model predictions by nearly twofold, even at low global warming levels.

 Understanding if earthquakes of different sizes start in the same way and whether the growth process of the rupture of large earthquakes is predictable are fundamental questions in earthquake physics. Recent studies indicate the onsets of seismic waves from small and large earthquakes exhibit similar characteristics, suggesting that an earthquake’s onset does not dictate its final size. However, the factors controlling this process remain unclear. A systematic comparison of 24 years of high-sensitivity seismograph records using cross-correlation for ~75,000 events reveals 125 extremely similar and 1939 similar pairs of co-located large and small earthquakes. An extremely high similarity is observed for pairs of earthquakes occurring on simple faults (44 of 55 large events), whereas large earthquakes occurring on complex faults have a low probability of cascading rupture. Estimating the probability of cascading rupture based primarily on fault geometry can improve the predictability of future earthquakes with a more quantitative size estimation.

 Accurate retrieval of sea surface wind speed is crucial for ecological research and marine resource development. The advent of satellite technology provides a feasible approach for global wind speed retrieval. As a photon-counting lidar, ICESat-2 provides unparalleled details of the sea surface and has the potential for sea surface wind speed retrieval. To facilitate the retrieval of sea surface wind speed from ICESat-2, a vertical ocean signal distribution model of ICESat-2 was established, and then training samples were collected by changing the parameters and inputted into the back propagation neural network to fit the relationship between the ICESat-2 vertical distribution signal and the sea surface wind speed. The model considered both environmental factors (solar noise, atmospheric absorption, sea surface reflection, water backscattering, etc.) and hardware characteristics (the spatial and temporal distribution of laser energy, dead time, and dark noise of the detectors, etc.). The validation against MERRA-2 data revealed that the RMSE is 1.57 m/s for nighttime and 1.89 m/s for daytime, while buoy comparisons showed RMSE values of 1.53 m/s for nighttime and 1.82 m/s for daytime.

 Unmixing optical properties (OP) of land covers from coarse spatial resolution images is crucial for microclimate and energy balance studies. We propose the Unmixing Spectral method using Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model (US-DART), a novel approach for unmixing endmember OP in the shortwave domain from mono- or multispectral remotely sensed images. US-DART comprises four modules: pure pixel selection, linear spectral mixture analysis, gradient iterations, and spectral correlation. US-DART requires a surface reflectance image, a 3D mock-up with facets’ group information, and standard DART parameters (e.g., spatial resolution and skylight ratio) as inputs, producing an OP map for each scene element. The accuracy of US-DART is evaluated using two types of scenes (vegetation and urban) and images (Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and DART-simulated pseudo-satellite images). Results demonstrate a median relative error of approximately 0.1 % for pixel reflectance, with higher accuracy for opaque surfaces compared to translucent materials. Excluding co-registration errors and sensor noise, the median relative error of OP is typically around 1 % for opaque elements and 1–5 % for translucent elements with an accurate a priori “reflectance-transmittance” ratio. US-DART enhances our ability to derive detailed OP from coarse-resolution imagery, potentially enabling more accurate modeling of spatial resolution conversions, and energy dynamics, including albedo and shortwave radiation balance, across diverse environments."

 Consideration of spatial dependence in heterogeneous urban landscapes is crucial for understanding how urban landscapes shape biodiversity. However, understanding the linkage between urban landscape patterns, both vertically and horizontally, and urban-dwelling bird species at various spatial scales remains an unsolved question. Here, we investigated how patterns of vertical and horizontal urban landscape structure influence urban-dwelling bird species at various spatial scales in the Chicago Region. We utilize a high-density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) dataset to exam ALS-derived metrics (foliage height diversity, canopy openness, and building volume) in relation to bird diversity.Our results show that LiDAR-derived metrics exhibited significant variation across spatial scales. The negative impact of building volume on bird species is greatest at the smallest scale (slope = -0.24 at 50 m radius), but its effect declined as the scale increased (slope = 0.00 at 500 m radius). Foliage height diversity did not influence bird diversity at small spatial scales but shows a positive effect on bird diversity over 150 m radius (slope = 0.05 to 0.11). Canopy openness changed its sign of slope from negative to positive as the buffer radius increased (between 150 and 200 m buffer radii), indicating that openness may have different roles depending on the spatial scale. Based on our findings, a buffer radius of 150–200 m was concluded to be the threshold distinguishing local and landscape-level variables in this study.In general, horizontal landscape patterns have a stronger influence on urban biodiversity than vertical structures. However, our findings suggest that enhancing the vertical complexity of canopy structures in existing green spaces could be an effective strategy for sustaining bird diversity in urban areas, particularly where expanding green spaces is not feasible.

 Satellite video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) frames from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames. To exploit motion cues under complicated motion patterns, most CNN-based methods first perform motion compensation and then aggregate motion cues in aligned frames (features). However, due to the low spatial resolution of satellite videos, the moving scales are usually subtle and difficult to be captured in the spatial domain. Furthermore, various scales of moving objects challenge current satellite video SR methods in motion estimation and compensation. To address these challenges for satellite video SR, we propose PhaseVSRnet to convert satellite video frames into the phase domain. By representing the motion information with phase shifts, the subtle motions are enlarged in the phase domain. Specifically, our PhaseVSRnet employs deep complex convolutions to better exploit the inherent correlation of complex-valued decompositions obtained by complex-valued steerable pyramids. Then, we adopt a coarse-to-fine motion compensation mechanism to eliminate phase ambiguity at different levels. Finally, in hierarchical reconstruction stage, we use the multi-scale fusion module to aggregate features from multiple levels and use an upsampling layer to upsample the feature maps for resolution enhancement. With PhaseVSRnet, we effectively address the subtle motions and varying scales of moving objects in satellite videos. We assess its performance on a satellite video SR dataset from Jilin-1 satellites and evaluate its generalization ability on another SR dataset from OVS-1 satellites. The results show that PhaseVSRnet effectively captures motion cues in the phase domain and exhibits strong generalization capability across different satellite sensors in unseen scenarios."

 Understanding the dynamic variations, potential sources and corresponding health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is essential for developing emission reduction strategies to lower their concentrations and associated health risks. Measurements with 2-h resolution of 16 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority-controlled PAHs in atmospheric PM2.5 were carried out at the beginning and midterm of the heating season in urban Beijing during 2020. The measurements utilized an enhanced comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry with aerosol thermal desorption technique. The daily average concentrations of PM2.5-bound PAHs range from 27.3 to 34.8 ng/m3 in November at the beginning of the heating season, while elevated to 47.9–77.8 ng/m3 in December during the midterm of the heating season. The ratio of PAHs to PM2.5 during the midterm of the heating season is four times higher than that at the beginning. This increase was due to the rise in concentrations of naphthalene (NaP), fluorene (FLR), and phenanthrene (PHE), along with the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in December. The overall diurnal variations exhibit high levels at night and early morning, contrasting with lower levels in the afternoon. However, compared to the beginning of the heating season, the diurnal variations of PAHs during the midterm show more pronounced enhancement and stronger fluctuations. Throughout the observation periods, coal and wood combustion from the local region surrounding Beijing are the primary emission sources of the 16 PAHs, indicating increased combustion emissions in winter due to higher heating demands. High time-resolution measurements captured transient high health risks by 16 PAHs, with the benzo(a)pyrene equivalent concentration (BaPeq) temporarily exceeded 5 ng/m3, which may result in short-term acute or subacute health effects.

 This study examines the three-dimensional (3D) microphysical and dynamical structure of the lower positive (LP) charge region within a normal tripole charge structure in a supercell thunderstorm that occurred over the Kanto Plain on August 27, 2018. The investigation utilizes hydrometeor classification and 3D wind retrieval data from dual-polarization radars, along with charge polarity classification data from a 3D lightning mapper. Key findings reveal that water-related hydrometeors (inferred as large raindrops, water-coated graupel, and/or water-coated hail) accounted for 52 % of the LP charges. Among these, water-coated hail exhibited a propensity for LP charging approximately 40 times greater than that of other hydrometeors, whereas graupel exhibited a propensity approximately 2.5 times greater. This suggests that radar-inferred graupel is not the most suitable proxy for LP charges in this event. LP charges were distributed from the bounded weak echo region associated with updrafts to the rear convergence zone. Liquid-water-related particles were more prevalent in the updraft region, while graupel and hail were more commonly observed in the downdraft. Based on these findings, the mechanisms underlying LP charge generation were elucidated. The presence of water-related particles in specific differential phase columns accompanying the updraft suggests that the shedding process may contribute to LP charge formation.

In this study, ultraviolet (UV)-aged PBS-NPs and PBAT-NPs are found to have a higher propensity to accumulate within the body of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) by prolonging the defecation interval, which could induce severe neuronal damage compared to pristine NPs. The increased accumulation of biodegradable nanoplastics (BNPs) and subsequent impairments of neurobehavior are highly attributed to their reduced particle size and altered surface properties, including changed chemical bonds and functional groups after photoaging. Aged BNPs also cause more severe damage to GABAergic neurons and neurotransmitter receptors, resulting in disrupted neuronal homeostasis and behaviors. Overall, BNPs of both PBS and PBAT components show no significant differences in biological accumulation and mechanisms of neural damage, highlighting the commonalities and characteristics of the adverse effects of petroleum-based BNPs on the nervous system.

Particle Imaging Velocimetry measurements are supplemented by numerical simulations to estimate variables not measured directly. The results with a topographic beta effect broadly support Fick's first law, and are consistent with the GEOMETRIC framework in which eddy buoyancy flux is constrained by total eddy energy. With the topographic beta effect, a relatively simple relation is observed between the eddy buoyancy flux and the total eddy energy, with the ratio quantifying the eddy transport efficiency. This efficiency decreases in more complex flow regimes with larger rotation rates, associated with the changing energy partition between eddy available potential energy and eddy kinetic energy.

We simulate the transient as an antisunward‐ and dawnward‐moving slab of hot tenuous solar wind plasma and weak magnetic field strengths on magnetic field lines connected to the bow shock. The slab elicits large‐amplitude outward bow shock motion with a stronger jump in plasma and magnetic field parameters on the trailing than the leading edges of this motion. The outward bulge in the bow shock bounds a magnetosheath region containing a hot tenuous plasma with weakened magnetic field strengths and flows deflected away from the Sun‐earth line. The magnetopause bulges outward into this magnetosheath region to distances beyond the nominal bow shock. Despite the large amplitude magnetopause motion, perturbations at geosynchronous orbit are miniscule.

Implications for Flux Measurements,"Top‐down entrainment shapes the vertical gradients of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes, influencing the interpretation of eddy covariance (EC) measurements in the unstable atmospheric surface layer (ASL). Using large eddy simulations for convective boundary layer flows, we demonstrate that decreased temperature gradients across the entrainment zone increase entrainment fluxes by enhancing the entrainment velocity, amplifying the asymmetry between top‐down and bottom‐up flux contributions. These changes alter scalar flux profiles, causing flux divergence or convergence and leading to the breakdown of the constant flux layer assumption (CFLA) in the ASL. As a result, EC‐measured fluxes either underestimate or overestimate “true” surface fluxes during divergence or convergence phases, contributing to energy balance non‐closure. The varying degrees of the CFLA breakdown are a fundamental cause for the non‐closure issue. These findings highlight the underappreciated role of entrainment in interpreting EC fluxes, addressing non‐closure, and understanding site‐to‐site variability in flux measurements."

The model has no significant bias for time‐mean temperature and snow accumulation over the ice sheet. Sensitivity test on parameterized supersaturation strength highlights its opposite effect on precipitation δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O and d‐excess. Selecting an intermediate supersaturation strength resulted in a minimal bias for surface snow δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O across the continent, with a reduced but systematic positive bias in surface snow d‐excess (∼ ${\sim} $5‰). We then assessed seasonal and diurnal isotope variability with daily precipitation and continuous vapor isotopes at Dumont d’Urville (DDU, coastal station) and Concordia (inland station). On a seasonal scale, LMDZ6iso accurately reproduces the seasonal cycle of precipitation δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O and d‐excess at both stations. Moving from statistical evaluation to physical analysis, we use the individual process contributions to boundary‐layer water vapor isotopes to identify the main drivers controlling the clear‐sky isotopic daily cycles. At Concordia, daily isotope variations are mainly driven by surface sublimation, whereas at DDU they are driven by surface sublimation and advection by the katabatic flow. Our results suggest that to further improve water isotopes in LMDZ6iso, fractionation during surface sublimation should be included and fractionation at condensation for low temperature should be better constrained."

Here the authors show that targeting ACER3, a ceramidase upregulated in cholestatic liver, alleviates liver injury in mice by enhancing bile acid sulfation to reduce bile acid overload through unsaturated ceramide-activated LXRβ signaling. 
 Bile acid overload critically drives the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury (CLI). While ceramide metabolism has garnered increasing interest in liver research, the role of ceramides in CLI remains unclear. This study investigates the function of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3)-catalyzed hydrolysis of unsaturated ceramides in CLI. Using clinical specimens, this work finds that ACER3 expression is upregulated in the cholestatic liver and positively correlated with the severity of CLI in patients. Acer3 ablation increases ceramide(d18:1/18:1) and attenuates bile duct ligation-induced CLI in female mice with reduced hepatic necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, it does not significantly impact CLI in male mice. Moreover, ceramide(d18:1/18:1) treatment attenuates CLI in wild-type female mice. Similarly, ACER3 knockdown and ceramide(d18:1/18:1) treatment prevent lithocholic-acid-induced cell death in human-liver-derived HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, ceramide(d18:1/18:1) binds the ligand binding domain of the liver X receptor β, acting as an agonist to activate its transcriptional functions. This activation upregulates sulfotransferase 2A1-catalyzed bile acid sulfation, normalizes bile acid metabolism, and restores lipogenesis, thereby reducing bile acid overload in hepatocytes to attenuate CLI. Our findings uncover the role of ceramide(d18:1/18:1)-liver X receptor β signaling in mitigating bile acid overload in the cholestatic liver, offering mechanistic insights and suggesting therapeutic potential for targeting ACER3 and ceramide(d18:1/18:1) for CLI.

Swapping rice for climate resilient cereals such as millets, maize, and sorghum in India could reduce climate-induced losses by 11% and increase farmer profits by 11%, achievable through targeted economic incentives. 
 The rising homogeneity of global crop supply has increased vulnerability to climatic and economic disruptions. While substantial work has examined yield variations in relation to climate variability, little is known about the influence of harvested area on production stability. To investigate this, here we take the example of monsoon cereal production in India, which has steadily shifted towards climate-sensitive rice and away from alternative cereals (finger millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum). We find that variations in harvested area are significantly associated with current and past price fluctuations for all cereals except rice. This suggests that farmer decisions based on economic factors may exercise great influence in determining variations in harvested area. We also show that optimized allocations of harvested area can reduce climate-induced production loss by 11% or improve farmer net profit by 11% while maintaining calorie production and cropland area. Such improvements would be possible by reducing harvested areas dedicated to rice and increasing areas allocated to alternative cereals. Our findings show that strategies using harvested area to address cereal yield fluctuations and improve farm profits could complement ongoing efforts to improve alternative cereal yields and stabilize cereal production. Production stability depends on both yield and harvested area.

 The Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor (TF) with two major splice isoforms (α and β). In chronic hyperglycemia and glucolipotoxicity, ChREBPα-mediated ChREBPβ expression surges, leading to insulin-secreting β-cell dedifferentiation and death. 14-3-3 binding to ChREBPα results in cytoplasmic retention and suppression of transcriptional activity. Thus, small molecule-mediated stabilization of this protein-protein interaction (PPI) may be of therapeutic value. Here, we show that structure-based optimizations of a ‘molecular glue’ compound led to potent ChREBPα/14-3-3 PPI stabilizers with cellular activity. In primary human β-cells, the most active compound retained ChREBPα in the cytoplasm, and efficiently protected β-cells from glucolipotoxicity while maintaining β-cell identity. This study may thus not only provide the basis for the development of a unique class of compounds for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes but also showcases an alternative ‘molecular glue’ approach for achieving small molecule control of notoriously difficult to target TFs.

 Expansion microscopy enhances the microscopy resolution by physically expanding biological specimens and improves the visualization of structural and molecular details. Numerous expansion microscopy techniques and labeling methods have been developed over the past decade to cater to specific research needs. Nonetheless, a shared limitation among current protocols is the extensive sample processing time, particularly for challenging-to-expand biological specimens (e.g., formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections and large three-dimensional specimens). Here we present BOOST, a rapid and robust expansion microscopy workflow that leverages a series of microwave-accelerated expansion microscopy chemistry. Specifically, BOOST enables a single-step 10-fold expansion of cultured cells, tissue sections, and even the challenging-to-expand FFPE sections under 90 minutes. Notably, BOOST pioneers a 10-fold expansion of large millimeter-sized three-dimensional specimens, previously unattainable to the best of our knowledge. The workflow is also easily adaptable based on stable and common reagents, thus boosting the potential adoption of expansion microscopy for applications.

Here, authors show that maternal high-fat diets trigger immune-metabolic dysregulation, elevating neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites in fetal brains, and blocking these pathways rescues social deficits in male mice, highlighting preventive strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders. 
 Diet-related maternal obesity has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders in progeny. Although the precise mechanisms and effective interventions remain uncertain, our research elucidates some of these complexities. We established that a prenatal high-fat diet triggered maternal immune activation (MIA), marked by elevated serum lipopolysaccharide levels and inflammatory-cytokine overproduction, which dysregulated the maternal tryptophan metabolism promoting the accumulation of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites in the embryonic brain. Interventions aimed at mitigating MIA or blocking the kynurenine pathway effectively rescued the male mice social performance. Furthermore, excessive kynurenine metabolites initiated oxidative stress response causing neuronal migration deficits in the fetal neocortex, an effect that was mitigated by administering the glutathione synthesis precursor N-Acetylcysteine, underscoring the central role of maternal immune-metabolic homeostasis in male mice behavioral outcomes. Collectively, our study accentuated the profound influence of maternal diet-induced immuno-metabolic dysregulation on fetal brain development and provided the preventive strategies for addressing neurodevelopmental disorders. Diet-related maternal obesity is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, yet underlying mechanisms are unclear.

 The Eurasian ice sheet complex (EIS) was the third largest ice sheet complex at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Although temporal and spatial evolution of the EIS during the last glacial cycle has not been well-established, strong evidence indicates the existence of nearly ice-free conditions during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3). Between MIS 3 and the LGM, the EIS likely experienced substantial expansions. These expansions were accompanied by decreasing boreal summer insolation, a slight reduction in greenhouse gases, and millennial-scale abrupt shifts between stadial and interstadial conditions. Using the state-of-the-art Earth system model AWI-ESM with asynchronously coupled dynamic ice sheets, we performed transient simulations focusing on this period. Our study shows that the formation of the EIS resembles a bifurcation transition. Only in case of a relatively weak background Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a sufficiently large thin ice/snow cover develops to accommodate a subsequent ice volume growth as Northern Hemisphere summer insolation further decreases. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments show a large non-linearity in surface mass balance changes in response to varying temperature and precipitation, indicating a high sensitivity of the EIS buildup. Our study highlights the large complexity and strong non-linearity of the Earth system induced by internal climate feedbacks, particularly the interactions between ice sheets and other climate components."

 Radiative transfer (RT) theories formulate vegetation radiative transfer models (RTMs) that link the biophysical properties of vegetation with remote sensing signals. Compared to classical RT theories, the recollision probability theory (also known as p-theory) is distinctive as it predicts some optical properties of vegetation canopies using fewer spectral invariants and simpler mathematical functions. This theory commonly employs an effective recollision probability (pE) that is assumed to spectrally independent for vegetation-photon interactions, to describe the absorptive and reflective properties of a vegetation canopy at any wavelength. Most p-theory studies approximate pE using the canopy-average recollision probability at different locations within the canopy, enabling its estimation based on canopy structural properties. However, the canopy-average recollision probability and pE different meanings. As an effective parameter, pE should be obtained by fitting the p-theory formulations, as done in previous studies using simulated and measured canopy optical properties for specific canopies. These studies have empirically shown that pE generally increases with canopy leaf area and exhibits some spectral variability. Building on this empirical evidence, we explore an analytical expression for pE and its dependence on leaf optical and canopy structural properties.In this study, we link the recollision probability theory with the classical Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory, a two-stream RT theory which predicts canopy optical properties by solving the corresponding differential equations. By using the KM theory as applied in the SAIL model, we derive the analytical expression for the absorptance of vegetation canopies illuminated by diffuse radiation. This absorptance is then used to derive pE based on its relationship with absorptance in the p-theory. In this way, we express pE as a function of leaf albedo (ωl) and canopy leaf area index (LAI, L). Our findings demonstrate that, for a given canopy, pE could be approximated as a function of LAI (pL) by using Taylor series expansion. This approximation aligns with Stenberg's, 2007 canopy-average recollision probability, although the two have different meanings and are derived using different approaches. More importantly, we demonstrate that pE increases with leaf albedo and that the difference between the LAI-based and true spectrally-dependent pE scales with 1−ωl·L, reaching up to 0.15. Consequently, the use of LAI-based pE in the p-theory could lead to some errors in simulating canopy absorptive and reflective properties. This study bridges two widely used RT theories and presents an estimation of pE. We provide an analytical expression for spectrally-dependent pE for turbid canopies, and mathematically demonstrate how it can be approximated by spectrally-independent pL. These findings clarify the rationale and limitations of assuming spectral invariance in the p-theory."

 The response of vegetation to drought is a crucial aspect of understanding ecosystem adaptation to climate change. Response time (RT) to drought serves as a key metric to quantify vegetation anomalies induced by drought events. However, it remains unclear from the perspective of event. Therefore, we quantified the RT of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to meteorological drought across various vegetation types and climatic zones in China. Additionally, we analyzed the spatial distribution of vegetation loss during response periods and the factors influencing RT. Our findings indicated that the primary RT of LAI and GPP to Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was short-term (<4 months), with LAI's longer RT concentrated in southern China. In contrast, the spatial distribution of GPP's RT largely opposed that of LAI. Grasslands exhibited notably different RT spatial distributions compared to other vegetation types. Additionally, we found LAI experiencing greater losses than GPP during response periods. For RT of both LAI and GPP, near-surface temperature (TEM) emerged as the paramount influencing factor, with RT significantly increasing with rising TEM. Secondary factors included surface solar radiation (SSRD) and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), but LAI and GPP showed distinct differences in their biased dependence on SSRD and VPD respectively. Most regions displayed a significant positive correlation between RT of LAI and GPP with TEM, and a negative correlation with SSRD. The study clarifies the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation response to drought and provides a scientific basis for water resource allocation and future drought prevention and mitigation to reduce drought's negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems."

This current system is linked to the ocean’s vertical overturning circulation, and is thus pivotal to the uptake of heat and CO2 in the ocean. The strength of the ACC has varied substantially across warm and cold climates in Earth’s past, but the exact dynamical drivers of this change remain elusive. This is in part because ocean models have historically been unable to adequately resolve the small-scale processes that control current strength. Here, we assess a global ocean model simulation which resolves such processes to diagnose the impact of changing thermal, haline and wind conditions on the strength of the ACC. Our results show that, by 2050, the strength of the ACC declines by ∼20% for a high-emissions scenario. This decline is driven by meltwater from ice shelves around Antarctica, which is exported to lower latitudes via the Antarctic Intermediate Water. This process weakens the zonal density stratification historically supported by surface temperature gradients, resulting in a slowdown of sub-surface zonal currents. Such a decline in transport, if realised, would have major implications on the global ocean circulation."

The results suggest that prolonged use of heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low ambient temperatures leads to reduced engine combustion efficiency, which in turn increases tailpipe emissions significantly. 
 The role of intermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs) in heavy-duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) exhaust remains a significant research gap in previous studies, with limited focus on cumulative mileage and ambient temperature effects. This study analyzed gaseous and particulate I/SVOCs from four in-use HDDVs using thermal desorption two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC × GC–MS). The total I/SVOC emission factors (EFs) ranged from 9 to 406 mg km−1, with 79 %–99 % in the gaseous phase. High-mileage vehicles (HMVs) emitted I/SVOCs at levels 8 times greater than low-mileage vehicles (LMVs), highlighting the influence of cumulative mileage. Emission deterioration occurred under both cold-start and hot-running conditions, though HMVs showed no extra sensitivity to cold starts. HMVs also exhibited increasing emissions with component volatility, alongside a higher proportion of oxygenated I/SVOCs (O-I/SVOCs) than LMVs (65 % vs. 42 %). Unique compounds such as phenol, alkenes, and cycloalkanes were detected exclusively in HMV emissions. Temperature effects were most pronounced at 0 °C, where only HMV emissions increased significantly, while LMV emissions remained relatively stable. A strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.93) between I/SVOC EFs and modified combustion efficiency (MCE) suggested that reduced combustion efficiency is a key driver of higher I/SVOC emissions. HMVs also showed 4 times greater secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) compared to LMVs. This increase was smaller than the 8-fold rise in EFs, likely due to the higher O-I/SVOC content in HMV emissions."

We are proposing an update of our simulation protocol to make the models more applicable to key questions for climate variability and hazard in present-day and future projections and to build links with other communities to provide more robust climate information. 
 Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. Consequently, the role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system continues to be of great interest. Recent simulations suggest the possibility of significant changes in both large-scale aspects of the ocean and atmospheric circulations and in the regional responses to climate change, as well as improvements in representations of small-scale processes and extremes, when resolution is enhanced.The first phase of the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP1) was successful at producing a baseline multi-model assessment of global simulations with model grid spacings of 25–50 km in the atmosphere and 10–25 km in the ocean, a significant increase when compared to models with standard resolutions on the order of 1° that are typically used as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) experiments. In addition to over 250 peer-reviewed manuscripts using the published HighResMIP1 datasets, the results were widely cited in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and were the basis of a variety of derived datasets, including tracked cyclones (both tropical and extratropical), river discharge, storm surge, and impact studies. There were also suggestions from the few ocean eddy-rich coupled simulations that aspects of climate variability and change might be significantly influenced by improved process representation in such models.The compromises that HighResMIP1 made should now be revisited, given the recent major advances in modelling and computing resources. Aspects that will be reconsidered include experimental design and simulation length, complexity, and resolution. In addition, larger ensemble sizes and a wider range of future scenarios would enhance the applicability of HighResMIP.Therefore, we propose the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (HighResMIP2) to improve and extend the previous work, to address new science questions, and to further advance our understanding of the role of horizontal resolution (and hence process representation) in state-of-the-art climate simulations. With further increases in high-performance computing resources and modelling advances, along with the ability to take full advantage of these computational resources, an enhanced investigation of the drivers and consequences of variability and change in both large- and synoptic-scale weather and climate is now possible. With the arrival of global cloud-resolving models (currently run for relatively short timescales), there is also an opportunity to improve links between such models and more traditional CMIP models, with HighResMIP providing a bridge to link understanding between these domains. HighResMIP also aims to link to other CMIP projects and international efforts such as the World Climate Research Program lighthouse activities and various digital twin initiatives. It also has the potential to be used as training and validation data for the fast-evolving machine learning climate models."

 Cropland cultivation is fundamental to food security and plays a crucial role in the global water, energy, and carbon cycles. However, our understanding of how climate change will impact cropland functions is still limited. This knowledge gap is partly due to the simplifications made in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which often overlook essential agricultural management practices such as irrigation and fertilizer application and simplify critical physiological crop processes.Here, we demonstrate how, with minor, parsimonious enhancements to the TBM T&C, it is possible to accurately represent a complex cropland system. Our modified model, T&C-CROP, incorporates realistic agricultural management practices, including complex crop rotations and irrigation and fertilization regimes, along with their effects on soil biogeochemical cycling. We successfully validate T&C-CROP across four distinct agricultural sites, encompassing diverse cropping systems such as multi-crop rotations, monoculture, and managed grassland.A comprehensive validation of T&C-CROP was conducted, encompassing water, energy, and carbon fluxes; leaf area index (LAI); and organ-specific yields.

Field, defines the flux below which the filtration resistance remains constant over time. Notably, this concept, originally for cross-flow filtration, faces challenges in dead-end filtration (the dominant mode used in drinking water ultrafiltration (UF)). Herein, leveraged by regulated membrane biofilms, we proposed a novel biofilm-induced critical flux specific to dead-end filtration. Below this critical flux, the membrane biofilm could act like a cross-flow to maintain mass balances by the biodegradation of foulants, thereby preventing a continuous increase in filtration resistance. Additionally, we demonstrated an optimized strategy to improve the critical flux─backwashing without air scouring, which doubled the critical flux from 6 to 12 L·m–2·h–1. A life cycle analysis revealed that operating at the biofilm-induced critical flux can reduce energy consumption and minimize membrane cleaning, thereby effectively lowering the overall operating costs (52%) and carbon emissions (61%) compared to conventional UF. Sensitivity analysis also indicated that extending membrane life and reducing membrane costs were crucial for lowering overall operating costs, while minimizing fossil energy usage was decisive for reducing carbon emissions. Overall, our study demonstrates that operating at a biofilm-induced critical flux offers a low-maintenance, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable strategy for drinking water UF."

Among the three degradation pathways, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps from neutrophils is the dominant, with myeloperoxidase (MPO) playing an important role. Molecular dynamics simulations show that MPO spontaneously attach onto h-BN surface, and leverage the active sites of MPO to form favorable contacts with h-BN to initiate the degradation. Hypochlorite produced by MPO is responsible for h-BN degradation. With the assistance of hypochlorite, B–O and N–O bonds are formed on h-BN, along with B–N bond breakage and the release of ionic boron and nitrogen based on byproduct identification and first-principle calculations. Additionally, h-BN nanosheets are significantly degraded into small pieces, and the particle concentration of h-BN with a size of 0–100 nm increases by 58.7% after degradation.

Direct experimental evidence of free solutal convection in porous rocks is to-date still lacking, leaving large uncertainties on the realized rate of CO2 dissolution and its contribution toward storage. Using an analogue solute–solvent pair and 4D X-ray computed tomography, we report direct observations of this mixing process in rock core samples, including sandstones and carbonates. The imagery is used to characterize the mixing structures that arise upon solute dissolution and to quantify differences between the rock types. Thus, we compute the temporal evolution of spatial moments of the concentration distribution to derive practical properties, such as the effective transport velocity of the solute plumes. Unlike previous studies on random bead packs, we observe that these measures do not scale well with core-scale rock properties (permeability, porosity, Rayleigh number) and are influenced by microscale rock characteristics (subcore and pore-scale heterogeneities). The latter may need consideration when evaluating the CO2 storage potential of candidate formations."

Homoaggregation and heteroaggregation were evaluated as a function of CaCl2 (0–100 mM) and natural organic matter (NOM) (50 mg L–1) at a designated concentration of nanoplastics (200 μg L–1). Critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) of nanoplastics were determined in homoaggregation and heteroaggregation experiments with SiO2 and CaCl2. The attachment efficiency (α) was calculated by quantifying the number of nanoplastics in the presence of CaCl2, NOM, and SiO2 using single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) and pseudo-first-order kinetics. The calculated α was fed into the SimpleBox4Plastics model to predict the fate of nanoplastics across air, water, soil, and sediment compartments. Nanoplastics exhibited high stability against homoaggregation, while significant heteroaggregation with SiO2 occurred at CaCl2 concentrations above 100 mM. The influence of NOM was also evaluated, showing a reduction in heteroaggregation with SiO2 for both nanoplastic types. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the degradation half-life of the tested nanoplastics had a more significant impact on persistence than did α. The results emphasize the environmental stability of nanoplastics, particularly in freshwater and soil compartments, and the critical role of NOM and emission pathways in determining their fate."

However, the intricate identification process often results in the underutilization of many mass spectrometry features. Even when chemical structures are identified, their toxicological effects and health outcomes may remain unknown. To address these challenges, this study introduces MSFragTox, a novel approach that leverages the rich fragmentation spectra inherent in high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to directly predict toxicity. This method integrates MS/MS data with high-throughput screening (HTS) assays, focusing on seven endocrine disruption-related endpoints  from Tox21, and uses MS-derived fingerprints: substructure fragmentation probability vectors to construct toxicity predictions using machine learning algorithms. The best model demonstrated robust performance with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.845 on the test set, outperforming models based on traditional molecular fingerprints and descriptors. Additionally, a web client (http://ms.envwind.site:8500) is provided for users to screen toxicity based on chemical MS/MS data. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of commonalities and differences in substructures reveal the mechanisms underlying across toxicity endpoints. Using MSFragTox, we validated the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of substances corresponding to MS/MS from real samples, highlighting the feasibility of directly studying toxicity through MS/MS and its potential applications in risk prediction and early warning for environmental samples."

However, limited Alk-PAHs data have hindered their LRAT characterizations on a global scale. In this study, 49 Alk-PAHs were measured in the atmospheric samples collected across the Western Pacific to the Southern Ocean. The summed concentration of 39 frequently detected Alk-PAHs (Σ39Alk-PAHs) was 25.8 ± 25.3 ng m–3. The concentrations of Σ39Alk-PAHs significantly declined with the decrease in latitude (°N). Higher concentrations (55.8 ± 33.8 ng m–3) were linked to continental air mass compared to oceanic/Antarctica air mass (17.0 ± 13.6 ng m–3), highlighting continental emissions as the primary source of marine atmospheric Alk-PAHs. An unexpected increase in the G/P partitioning ratio (KP) was found in samples farther away from the continent, which cannot be explained by the influence of temperature on the partitioning process. Deposition analysis suggested that gaseous concentrations and the G/P partitioning largely influenced deposition patterns. Hypothetical scenario analysis indicated that increased KP under snowy conditions could enhance the total Alk-PAH deposition. These findings emphasize the need for accurate characterization of partitioning and deposition processes when studying the global fate of Alk-PAHs, particularly in remote and polar regions."

In order to investigate the pollution characteristics of CUPs in a large-scale multimedium environment, a comprehensive and comparative study was conducted on occurrence, spatial-seasonal distribution, and air–soil exchange of CUPs across 30° latitude in Eastern China. A total of 72 target CUPs were detected, and 43 CUPs had a detection frequency over 30% in both air and soil samples. Herbicides, fungicides, and organophosphorus insecticides predominantly exhibited volatilization from soil to air, while pyrethroids exhibited deposition from air to soil. In the high-latitude Northeastern China, the air–soil exchange net flux of CUPs was the lowest due to the lower temperature, especially in winter. Along with decreasing latitude and increasing temperature, the air–soil exchange flux increased, which was significantly influenced by cultivation practices and the usage frequency of CUPs. Therefore, the grasshopper effect driven by temperature difference caused further migration and deposition of CUPs toward higher latitude regions. Moreover, the emission fluxes of CUPs to soil exhibited significant variations closely linked to local climatic conditions and types of crops. In summary, this study obtained valuable baseline information for the pollution characteristics and air–soil exchange of CUPs on a large scale, which also provided a better understanding of the environmental fate of CUPs from the migration perspective."

Here we investigate the potential to improve prediction skill in the North Pacific by identifying predictable patterns of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in climate simulations, and then applying them to observations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is first trained to predict basin‐wide SSTs in the North Pacific on 1–5 year time‐scales in nine global climate models (GCMs), and a pattern of high skill is identified from the GCM data. This pattern of high skill learned from GCMs is then skillfully predicted by the CNN when given observations as inputs. The identified pattern is notably not the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and instead corresponds to basinwide warming and cooling focused in the North Pacific Gyre. We conclude that investigating the mechanisms that contribute to predictability (rather than variability) is an effective avenue for improving near‐term climate predictions."

This study employs a systematic approach to examine feature co‐occurrences and their relationships to mean and extreme precipitation. Four features are identified using existing data sets for atmospheric rivers (ARs), mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), low‐pressure systems (LPSs), and fronts (FTs). Often, a single atmospheric phenomenon satisfies the criteria set by multiple feature identification algorithms, yielding an association between precipitation and multiple features. Over the extra‐tropics, the number of features attributed to a single event typically increases with precipitation intensity. Over two‐thirds of the precipitation is from co‐occurring features, with a considerable fraction related to AR‐FT co‐occurrences. Over the tropics, about one‐quarter of precipitation is associated with co‐occurring features, with LPS‐MCS co‐occurrences contributing substantially in monsoon regions. MCSs are the leading single‐feature contributors over tropical land and oceans. In the extra‐tropics, FTs, ARs, and their co‐occurrences account for over half of the total precipitation over oceans. AR‐FT‐MCS and FT‐MCS co‐occurrences contribute to extremes (precipitation exceeding the 95th percentile) over both oceans (over 30%) and land (over 20%). Any combination of features involving MCSs shows a larger contribution to high percentiles of precipitation intensity. A case analysis indicates that AR‐FT‐MCS co‐occurrences exhibit convective instability and deep vertical motion, suggesting that the feature trackers and reanalysis are capturing physics relevant to both convective and frontal systems. The results here emphasize the need for simultaneous identifications of multiple features when attributing precipitation to atmospheric phenomena."

Using ERA5 data from 1980 to 2023, we investigated the relationship between winter extratropical storm tracks, atmospheric circulation patterns, and sea ice area (SIA) in three key Arctic regions. We classified the winters into two categories: atmosphere‐driven winters (ADWs), when atmospheric circulation influences sea ice, and ice‐driven winters (IDWs), when sea ice influences atmospheric circulation. This classification was based on the sign of SIA and surface turbulent heat flux anomalies in the Barents‐Kara Sea (BKS), Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, and Labrador Sea (BDL), and Chukchi‐Bering Seas (CBS). Our findings show that in IDWs, reduced SIA has a minor effect on extratropical storm tracks. However, we observed significant midtropospheric cooling over northeastern Asia, aligning with the effects of reduced ice in the BKS during IDWs. This emphasizes the importance of considering the entire tropospheric temperature profile to capture the impact of sea ice loss. In contrast, during ADWs, the BKS and CBS regions experience amplified surface warming and SIA loss due to storm‐induced intrusion of warm and moist air, with sea ice loss in the BKS contributing to strengthening Ural blocking. Although cyclone‐induced heat and moisture intrusion is prevalent, we found no significant trend in track density or mean intensity of positive V extrema in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic, suggesting that changes in atmospheric circulation are unlikely to be the driver of recent sea ice loss in the BKS."

This study examines the future changes in MJO projected by 23 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models that produce a realistic MJO propagation in their historical runs. Results from the multi‐model mean show a ∼17% increase in MJO precipitation amplitude, a ∼11%–14% increase in MJO circulation amplitude, a ∼9% increase in propagation speed, a ∼2‐day decrease in MJO period, and a ∼5° eastward extension. Analysis of the lower tropospheric moisture budget suggests the dominant role of an increased meridional advection of mean moisture caused by the steepening of mean moisture gradient over the Indo‐Pacific warm pool in a warming climate in the majority of models. The enhanced zonal moisture advection plays a secondary or comparable role in some models. The stronger anticyclonic gyres to the east of the MJO convection center along with the enhanced moisture gradient favor an enhanced export of moisture away from the Equator and a local moistening at the flanks of the MJO convection center. This leads to a stronger positive moisture tendency to the east of MJO convection and hence an enhanced eastward MJO propagation with strengthened amplitude and faster speed. As the MJO changes in the future, its relationships with the precipitation and temperature extremes over the western United States (US) are found to change accordingly. The MJO impacts on precipitation tend to be stronger with the stronger MJO amplitude, whereas its impacts on temperature are generally weaker."

Data from three high‐frequency eddy‐covariance systems at a northwest‐facing slope, and at two ridgetops at the south and north valley sidewalls were used for the analysis, and combined with large‐eddy simulations at 90 m horizontal grid spacing. The observed data and simulations focused on a sunny summer day when turbulence was well‐developed, and cross‐ridge flows interacted with thermally driven circulations. The observed TKE time series compared reasonably well with simulations at the northwest‐facing slope and southern ridgetop. The model was then used to evaluate the vertical and horizontal TKE‐budget equation. Analysis of the TKE budget showed that horizontal shear production and advection of TKE driven by horizontal wind‐gradients in cross‐ridge flows, and the interaction of these flows with the up‐valley flow could be an important source of TKE production on the northwest‐facing slope station in the Fortress Valley. The variability observed in TKE budget components across different locations within this high mountain basin indicates the significance of both horizontal and vertical exchange processes in the mechanisms governing TKE production."

We employed a novel causal inference approach to quantify the effects of SSTs on East Asian winter precipitation, focusing on its leading mode (denoted as Pr). Using the PCMCI method, we first derived a causal graph between the Pr and SSTs in the tropical eastern/western Pacific and Indian Ocean (denoted as EP, WP, and IO respectively). Based on the causal graph, we then applied a quantitative analysis using Wright's path method. The results indicated that WP‐SST had the most substantial impact on the Pr, with a 1 Standard Deviation (SD) increase leading to a 0.24 SD decrease in Pr at a 1‐month lag and 0.17 SD decrease at a 2‐month lag. The winter monsoon winds and subtropical jet stream are identified as critical mediators of this effect. Additionally, EP‐SST had a notable positive influence on the Pr, with a 1 SD warming leading to a 0.12 SD increase in Pr at a 2‐month lag, while IO‐SST exhibits a minor effect. It is essential to note that, traditional regression analysis indicates that EP‐SST explained the largest portion of the Pr variance among the three SSTs, but the causal analysis revealed that WP‐SST exerts a more significant role in driving Pr variations, aligning with numerical experiments."

However, understanding how annual floods may change and impact local vulnerabilities remains limited. Daily precipitation and temperature projections were obtained from five CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) General Circulation Models in the Inter‐Sectoral Model Inter‐Comparison Project (ISIMIP). These were input into a coupled hydrological‐hydraulic model of the Barotse Floodplain, Zambia to obtain data on flood pulse timing, duration, and magnitude. Future decades (2030s, 2050s, 2070s) under three Shared Socio‐Economic Pathways (SSPs 1–2.6, 3–7.0, 5–8.5) were compared with baseline data from the 1990s and 2000s to assess the impact of climate change. Climatic indices were also correlated with flood pulse characteristics to assess whether a driver of changes could be determined. Future floodwaves in the Barotse showed reduced durations and magnitudes, and altered timings of flood rise and recession compared to baseline periods. These differences were significant in the mid‐to far‐future. Large areas of the floodplain experience 1‐to‐2 month reductions in inundation duration, and some areas experienced no inundation in a hydrological year for the first time. The northern Barotse Floodplain, western escarpment, and Luena Valley exhibit the greatest sensitivity to future changes. The Barotse Floodplain will become increasingly arid under all climate scenarios, exacerbating existing challenges for transhumance communities dependent on floods, who face periodic food insecurity, malnutrition, and limited healthcare access. Intensified drought conditions under future climate change will undermine the resilience of local livelihoods, reflecting broader vulnerabilities faced by floodplain‐dependent communities globally."

This study examines projected changes in extreme water available for runoff (W) events in two snow‐dominated basins in the western United States: the Yakima River Basin (YRB) in Washington State and the Walker River Basin (WRB) spanning the California‐Nevada border. We analyze changes in W magnitudes, mechanisms, hyetograph shapes, and ARFs, and study their compounded impacts on flood hazard. Our findings suggest increased extreme W magnitudes across a large portion of the basins, with steeper or flatter hyetographs, and higher ARF values under the future climate. These changes are driven by a shift from seasonal snowmelt to more rain‐on‐snow events at higher elevations and by increased rainfall at lower elevations. We then use a single event‐based rainfall‐runoff model to estimate flood hazard changes based on extreme W magnitudes, hyetograph shapes, ARFs, and their compounded impacts. Our analysis reveals that focusing solely on the magnitude of changes in extreme W can significantly underestimate future flood hazards and uncertainties.

Bridgham,Can Restoring Tidal Wetlands Reduce Estuarine Nuisance Flooding of Coasts Under Future Sea‐Level Rise?,"Wetland restoration is an increasingly popular nature‐based method for flood risk mitigation in coastal communities. In this study, we present a novel method using hydrodynamic modeling and harmonic analysis to quantify wetlands' ability to reduce future nuisance flooding. The method leverages a hydrodynamic model calibrated to present day data and was run for a range of future sea‐level rise (SLR) and wetland restoration scenarios to quantify changes to tidal harmonic amplitudes and phases. The harmonic constituents are used to generate water surface elevations over a time period of interest (e.g., one year) and compared to critical exceedance thresholds such as levee elevations. Then, changes to nuisance flooding are calculated by counting the number of hours critical thresholds are exceeded under different SLR and wetland restoration scenarios. We applied the method to Coos Bay, Oregon, USA as a test case. We found restoration reduces the number of hours nuisance flooding occurs in downtown Coos Bay from 15 hr (present day conditions) to 0 hr (fully restored condition) under median SLR (82 cm by 2100). Restoration had spatially variable impacts on reducing peak flood elevations with minimal impacts near the estuary mouth and greatest impact 32 km inland. The effectiveness of restoration was heavily dependent on future SLR. Restoration was maximally effective in 2050 under all SLR scenarios, less effective in 2100 under median SLR, and not effective under high SLR. Modeling results suggest increased tidal prism and accommodation space are driving restoration‐associated reductions in tidal amplitudes."

 As the body’s primary source of energy, the maintenance of blood glucose is indispensable for overall health and metabolic homeostasis. It is predominantly regulated by the glucagon receptor family which is highly conserved in vertebrates1–4. Compared to other vertebrates, avian blood glucose levels are relatively high5,6, yet its regulatory mechanisms have remained obscure for more than a century. We show that high hepatic expression of the avian glucagon receptor (GCGR) in association with constitutively active Gs signaling was dependent upon the interaction of different domains. In vivo experiments focusing on the regulation of constitutively active GCGR expression in hepatic cells led to correspondingly high blood glucose, rapid hepatic lipid utilization and high metabolic rates via downstream signaling pathway activation in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Furthermore, we identified a point mutation in chicken at the proximal gene region that resulted in GCGR mRNA reduction and weight increase. Overexpressing a natural human GCGR mutation (hsGCGRH339R) with modest constitutive activity in mice, demonstrated that high level expression of this variant augmented high blood glucose, while reducing body weight. The combination of high expression and constitutive activity of the glucagon receptor may have contributed to the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds."

 Rapid genotype-based drug susceptibility testing for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) relies on a comprehensive knowledgebase of the genetic determinants of resistance. Here we present a catalogue of resistance-associated mutations using a regression-based approach and benchmark it against the 2nd edition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) mutation catalogue. We train multivariate logistic regression models on over 52,000 MTBC isolates to associate binary resistance phenotypes for 15 antitubercular drugs with variants extracted from candidate resistance genes. Regression detects 450/457 (98%) resistance-associated variants identified using the existing method (a.k.a, SOLO method) and grades 221 (29%) more total variants than SOLO. The regression-based catalogue achieves higher sensitivity on average (+3.2 percentage points, pp) than SOLO with smaller average decreases in specificity (−1.0 pp) and positive predictive value (−1.6 pp). Sensitivity gains are highest for ethambutol, clofazimine, streptomycin, and ethionamide as regression graded considerably more resistance-associated variants than SOLO for these drugs. There is no difference between SOLO and regression with regards to meeting the target product profiles set by the WHO for genetic drug susceptibility testing, except for rifampicin, for which regression specificity is below the threshold of 98% at 97%. The regression pipeline also detects isoniazid resistance compensatory mutations in ahpC and variants linked to bedaquiline and aminoglycoside hypersusceptibility. These results inform the continued development of targeted next generation sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and other commercial molecular assays for diagnosing resistance in the MTBC.

 Inclusivity and transparency are the foundations of procedural justice in climate governance. However, concerns persist around the influence of business interest groups at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conferences of Parties (COPs). COPs have increased in size and complexity, obscuring agendas and organizational relationships. Here we analyse the discourse and networks of actors at COP side events from 2003 to 2023 using machine learning-based topic modelling and social network analysis. We trace how discussions on energy, food and forests have evolved. Focusing on energy topics, we show that fossil fuel lobbyists gain COP access through developed-country business non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and developing-country governments. Their nominators focus on renewable energy and system approaches but are peripheral in the anti-fossil fuel discourse which grew from a collaborative network of environmental NGOs. Despite data availability challenges, systematically tracing the inclusivity of COP processes can uncover power dynamics at the highest levels of climate governance.

This study explores such impacts across 4,718 cities worldwide and reveals divergent dynamics of vegetation loss and urban vegetation growth. 
 Urban vegetation, the core component of green infrastructure and critical for sustainable cities, is profoundly affected by the process of urbanization. Urbanization not only leads to substantial vegetation loss (direct impact) but also fosters urban vegetation growth (indirect impact). However, the extent to which these direct and indirect impacts affect vegetation dynamics across cities worldwide and how urban greening will change in the future remain unclear. Using satellite-based greenness and impervious surface datasets, we show that positive indirect impacts mitigated 56.85% of the negative direct impacts across 4,718 cities worldwide from 2000 to 2019. Notably, the offsetting coefficient is much greater in Global North cities (79.13%) than in Global South cities (38.01%) partly due to their socioeconomic differences. This disparity in urban greening dynamics will continue in the future. Approximately 60% of Global North cities and 30% of Global South cities will become greener by 2040. Our results reveal the divergent trade-offs between vegetation loss and enhanced vegetation growth in cities of different socioeconomic levels and stages of urbanization. Such insights are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of urban greening dynamics and for devising strategies to attain sustainable development goals.

The authors show that polymeric flame retardants break down in the environment into small toxic molecules that can pose environmental hazards. 
 The industrial use of monomeric halogenated flame retardants has now gradually been phased out due to their toxicity to humans and ecosystems. Polymeric flame retardants are emerging as a ‘safe’ alternative and so have a high production and consumption volume. However, the environmental fate and toxicity of their derivatives remain unknown, making it difficult to understand and adequately manage the associated risk. We take two tetrabromobisphenol A-based polymers (polyTBBPAs) that are widely used in electronics as model flame-retardant chemicals, and we study their behaviour when they break down in the environment and the toxicity of the derivative products. Our results show that polyTBBPAs break down into smaller products in the environment. Using a non-target screening strategy called BrMiner developed by us, we identified 76 breakdown products of polyTBBPAs with molecular weights in the range 400–2,000 Da. These were detected in environmental samples taken from electronic waste recycling facilities in South China. Toxicity tests with zebrafish embryos showed that when they break down in the environment, polyTBBPAs become more toxic, with mitochondrial dysfunction representing a key toxicity mechanism. This study reveals that there are environmental risks associated with polymeric flame retardants, and therefore, their use should be adequately assessed and regulated.

Here the authors report a draw spinning/de-acetylation method to fabricate cellulose fibres that exhibit mechanical strength exceeding that of existing fibre materials. 
 Developing high-performance bio-based fibres is highly desirable for improving the sustainability of materials. Cellulose is one of the most abundant bio-derived feedstocks to fabricate such materials. However, the fabrication of high-strength macro cellulose fibres is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining ordered packing of cellulose molecular chains and nanocrystals in the macro-fibres. Here we develop a draw spinning/de-acetylation method to prepare cellulose fibres with highly ordered molecular packing that incorporates high strength in the obtained fibres. Specifically, a fibre draw spun from well-dispersed cellulose triacetate solution was de-acetylated to generate cellulose fibres, which were then twisted to spirally align the molecular chains. The resulting fibres exhibited mechanical strength of 3.08 GPa and toughness of 215.1 MJ m−3, much higher than existing fibre materials. This work paves the way to obtaining high-performance bio-based fibres.

 Possible existence of dense iron-rich silicate melt layer above Mars’ core is important in understanding the nature and evolution of Mars. However, gravitational stability of iron-rich silicate melt in the Mars’ interior has not been well constrained, due to experimental difficulties in measuring density of iron-rich peridotitic melt. Here we report density measurements of iron-rich peridotitic melts up to 2465 K by using electrostatic levitation furnace at the International Space Station. Our experimentally obtained densities of iron-rich peridotitic melts are markedly higher than those calculated by first principles simulation, and are distinct from those estimated by extrapolating a density model for SiO2-rich basaltic melts. Our determined density model suggests that peridotitic melt with the Fe/(Mg+Fe) ratio more than 0.4-0.5 has higher density than that at the base of the Mars’ mantle, which indicates gravitational stability of the iron-rich peridotitic melt at the core-mantle boundary in Mars.

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), as key oceanic boundary conditions, play a pivotal role in modulating regional climate variability. However, their influence on subseasonal dynamical prediction has yet to be fully understood. Focusing on Central Southwest Asia (CSWA), a region urgently needing accurate subseasonal prediction and significantly influenced by ENSO and IOD, this study investigates whether and how these interannual climate anomalies affect regional subseasonal rainfall prediction skills during early boreal winter using state-of-the-art Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) prediction models. First, the study finds that both deterministic and probabilistic prediction skills for domain-averaged rainfall anomalies and dry/wet events at a 2–4-week lead are significantly enhanced under La Niña and active IOD conditions compared to neutral states, while El Niño conditions show limited enhancement. This asymmetry in the ENSO impact is attributed to the inherent uncertainty in El Niño's influence on CSWA rainfall. Second, the analysis reveals that currently operational models exhibit higher skill in predicting ENSO at a 1-month lead, whereas predictions for IOD are comparatively less accurate. Nonetheless, prediction errors for both strong ENSO and IOD events at a 1-month lead are found to be significantly correlated with rainfall anomaly prediction errors over CSWA during the early boreal winter. This study confirms the significant effect of oceanic boundary conditions on regional subseasonal dynamical predictions and emphasizes the need to improve subseasonal prediction skills related to sea surface temperature variability associated with ENSO and IOD in order to reduce rainfall forecast errors and enhance the reliability of S2S predictions."

While they are mostly meteorology-centric, there is an increasing need to consider their health implications. Our methodology involved a review of biometeorological indices, followed by a systematic policy search of country-level heat wave definitions to explore the variability of heat protection mechanisms. We analyzed the regional coverage of heat wave definitions and warnings by examining the diversity of variables and threshold limits for 112 countries/territories. We identified the upper-most heat stress limits of biometeorological indices that trigger illness or death. The findings highlight that a large proportion of countries define heat waves based solely on maximum temperature, while only a few countries combine them with minimum temperature and/or humidity. We also find significant geographical variability in the incorporation of temperature limits with most countries in northern latitudes defining heat waves at lower thresholds. We highlight the need for policy reforms towards adjustment of heat warning thresholds to regionally appropriate levels considering rising extreme heat conditions. Given the predominance of maximum temperature-centric approaches, we argue that the focus of heat protection at the policy level must shift beyond projecting heat wave episodes and consider broader heat-health associations beyond mortality."

Projections of future temperature trends can provide essential information for decision makers, but they are subject to a number of uncertainties. One important source of uncertainty is the rather high internal climate variability in that region. Separating internal variability and forced trends is therefore paramount. Particularly powerful tools for this separation are Single-Model Initial-condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs). In such ensembles, the same model is run multiple times with similar forcing but varying initial conditions, resulting in different realizations of internal variability. This study employs two SMILEs to decompose European sea surface temperatures (SSTs) into forced trends and internal variability and to investigate whether and how the latter is affected by the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) in the historical period and different future emission scenarios. It is shown that on a decadal scale, the effect of the AMV on the European SSTs will stay important, especially in lower emission scenarios. However, on longer time scales, forced trends will be much higher and in all but the lowest emission scenario considered, more than 2 C warming compared to 1950 are very likely to be reached until the end of the century in all semi-enclosed European seas."

However, whether these record-shattering extremes were connected to each other remains unknown. Here we identify a dynamical linkage behind the spatiotemporal compounding nature of heatwaves over those three regions. By investigating the 2023 case and conducting historical analysis, we show that the Northern Hemispheric concurrent heatwaves in July 2023 can be attributed to a recurrent wave-6 pattern. In particular, pre-existing warmth and drought over Eastern Canada in early-July intensified the wave-6 teleconnection; which then led to extreme heatwaves over the Mediterranean and Central Asia in mid-July 2023. Furthermore, we reveal that the wave train was generated by early-July convection over the subtropical western Pacific. This, combined with the lowest May snow cover over North America in the past 40 years helped to warm Eastern Canada. Multiple models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 are able to simulate those compound extremes connected by the wave-6 pattern with a high inter-model agreement.

Furthermore, we adjust our baseline model to see how adding the MF of transport infrastructure use affects the outcomes. The MFs decrease strongly with an increasing degree of urbanisation when infrastructure is taken into account, but much less so, when only household material consumption is considered. Surprisingly, household metal footprints are higher in rural than urban areas. This is mainly because household vehicles have a larger impact on metal footprints than electronic devices, for example.

Changes in precipitation regimes, temperature fluctuations, and the frequency of extreme hydro-climatic events driven by climate change accelerate the deterioration of GWQ, thereby threatening ecosystems and human health. In response to these challenges, recent research has increasingly focused on developing and refining analytical models (AM) and machine learning (ML) techniques to understand better and predict the impacts of climate change on GWQ. This systematic literature review critically examines the current state of knowledge on applying AM and ML models in the context of GWQ assessment under climate-induced stressors. By synthesizing findings from a comprehensive review of existing studies, this paper discusses the capabilities, limitations, and future directions of hybrid ML and traditional AM in GWQ prediction, vulnerability, and threshold estimation.

This paper aims to provide GWQ researchers, water resource managers, and policymakers with an advanced understanding of the interactions between climate change and GWQ and the innovative AM and ML modelling approaches available to address these challenges.

Moreover, a high-precision, long-term gridded water demand dataset is developed as the basis of establishing this index. For the East River basin, DSSEDI accurately detected significant socioeconomic droughts in 2002, 2004–2005, 2009, and 2011, mostly during autumn-winter-spring.

The aerosol NOC pollution during winter in China is closely associated with the intensity of precursor emissions and the aqueous-phase processes. Our results highlight the importance of emission reduction strategies in controlling aerosol NOCs pollution during winter in China. 
 Nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) impact air quality and human health. Here, the abundance, potential precursors, and main formation mechanisms of NOCs in PM2.5 during winter were compared for the first time among Haerbin (dependent on coal for heating), Beijing (natural gas and coal as heating energy), and Hangzhou (no centralized heating policy). The total signal intensity of CHON+, CHN+, and CHON− compounds was highest in Haerbin and lowest in Hangzhou. Anthropogenic aromatics accounted for 73 %–93 % of all identified precursors of CHON+, CHN+, and CHON− compounds in Haerbin. Although the abundance of aromatic-derived NOCs was lower in Beijing than in Haerbin, aromatics were also the main contributors to NOC formation in Beijing. Hangzhou exhibited the lowest levels of aromatic precursors. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated an overall reduction in the impact of fossil fuel combustion on NOC pollution along the route from Haerbin to Beijing to Hangzhou. We found that aqueous-phase processes (mainly condensation, hydrolysis, or dehydration processes for reduced NOCs and mainly oxidization or hydrolysis processes for oxidized NOCs) can promote the transformation of precursors to produce NOCs, leading to the most significant increase in aromatic NOC levels in Haerbin (particularly on haze days). Reduced precursor emissions in Beijing and Hangzhou (the lowest) constrained the aqueous-phase formation of NOCs. The overall results suggest that the aerosol NOC pollution in coal-dependent cities is mainly controlled by anthropogenic aromatics and aqueous-phase processes. Thus, without effective emission controls, the formation of NOCs through aqueous-phase processes may still pose a large threat to air quality."

 In situ cloud studies are fundamental to study the variability in cloud chemical and biological composition as a function of environmental conditions and assess their potential for transforming chemical compounds. To achieve this objective, cloud water collectors have been developed in recent decades to recover water from clouds and fogs using different designs and collection methods. In this study, a new active ground-based cloud collector was developed and tested for sampling cloud water to assess the cloud microbiology and chemistry. This new instrument, BOOGIE, is a mobile sampler for cloud water collection that is easy to operate with the objective of being cleanable and sterilisable, respecting chemical and microbial cloud integrity, and presenting an efficient collection rate of cloud water. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to theoretically assess the capture of cloud droplets by this new sampler. A 50 % collection efficiency cutoff of 12 µm has been estimated. The collector was deployed at Puy de Dôme station under cloudy conditions for evaluation. The water collection rates were measured at 100 ± 53 mL h−1 for a collection of 21 cloud events; considering the measured liquid water content, the sampling efficiency of this new collector has been estimated at 69.7 ± 11 % over the same set of cloud events. BOOGIE was compared with other active cloud collectors commonly used by the scientific community (Cloud Water Sampler and Caltech Active Strand Cloud Collector version 2). The three samplers presented similar collection efficiencies (between 53 % and 70 % on average). The sampling process can affect the endogenous cloud water microflora, but the ATP / ADP (adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate) ratios  obtained from the samplers indicates that they are not stressful for the cloud microorganisms. The chemical compositions of hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, and major ions are similar between the collectors; significant variability is observed for magnesium and potassium, which are the less concentrated ions. The differences between collectors are the consequence of different designs and the intrinsic homogeneity in the chemical composition within the cloud system."

 The Chilean Observation Network De Meteor Radars (CONDOR) commenced deployment in June 2019 and became fully operational in February 2020. It is a multi-static meteor radar system consisting of three ∼ 1° latitudinally separated stations. The main (central) station is located at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO; 30.25° S, 70.74° W) and is used for both transmission and reception. The two remote sites are located to the north and south and are used for reception only. The southern station is located at the Southern Cross Observatory (SCO; 31.20° S, 71.00° W), and the northern station is located at the Las Campanas Observatory (LCO; 29.02° S, 70.69° W). The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 measurements of horizontal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and permit the retrieval of spatially resolved horizontal winds and vertical winds. This is possible because of the high meteor detection rates. Over 30 000 quality-controlled underdense meteor echoes are detected at the ALO site each day, and in total ∼ 88 000 events are detected each day over the three sites. In this paper, we present the configuration of the CONDOR system and discuss the validation and initial results of its data products. The motivations of deploying the CONDOR system also include combining measurements from other co-located ground-based instruments at the ALO site, which provide uniquely cross-validated and cross-scale observations of the MLT dynamics with multiple scientific goals."

Haerter;Romain Fiévet,DiuSST: a conceptual model of diurnal warm layers for idealized atmospheric simulations with interactive sea surface temperature,"The daily cycle of sea surface temperature (SST) impacts clouds above the ocean and could influence the clustering of thunderstorms linked to extreme rainfall and hurricanes. However, daily SST variability is often poorly represented in modeling studies of how clouds cluster. We present a simple, wind-responsive model of upper-ocean temperature for use in atmospheric simulations. Evaluating the model against observations, we show that it performs significantly better than common slab models. 
 The diurnal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) may play an important role in cloud organization above the tropical ocean, with implications for precipitation extremes, storminess, and climate sensitivity. Recent cloud-resolving simulations demonstrate how imposed diurnal SST oscillations can strongly and delicately impact mesoscale convective organization. In spite of this nuanced interaction, many idealized modeling studies of tropical convection either assume a constant, homogeneous SST or, in the case of a responsive sea surface, represent the upper ocean by a slab with fixed thickness. Here we show that slab ocean models with constant heat capacity fail to capture the wind-dependence of observed diurnal sea surface warming. To alleviate this shortcoming, we present a simple yet explicitly depth-resolved model of upper-ocean temperature dynamics under atmospheric forcing. Our modular scheme describes turbulent mixing as diffusion with a wind-dependent diffusivity, in addition to a bulk mixing term and heat fluxes entering as sources and sinks. Using observational data, we apply Bayesian inference to calibrate the model. In contrast to a slab model, our model captures the exponential reduction in the diurnal warming amplitude with increasing wind speed. Further, our model performs comparably to a more elaborately parameterized diurnal warm-layer model. Formulated as a single partial differential equation with three key tuning parameters, the model is a suitable  interactive numerical boundary condition for idealized atmospheric simulations."

X-ray absorption spectroscopy determined that 0–98% of mineral-bound P was recycled inorganic P (Pi). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with mass spectrometry demonstrated short-lived triphosphorylated and monophosphorylated ribonucleotides bound to goethite. Based on Michaelis-Menten type modeling of the kinetic evolution of both dissolved and mineral-bound Pi, maximal Pi production rates from  triphosphorylated ribonucleotides reacted with goethite (1.9–16.1 μmol Pi h–1 ggoethite–1) were >5-fold higher than with hematite and ferrihydrite; monophosphorylated ribonucleotides generated only mineral-bound Pi at similar rates (0.0–12.9 μmol Pi h–1 gmineral–1) across minerals. No clear distinction was observed between purine-based and pyrimidine-based ribonucleotides. After normalization to mineral-dependent Pi binding capacity, resulting catalytic turnover rates implied surface chemistry-controlled reactivity.

While the number of adsorbent cations plays a key role in separation, their influence on purification under low humidity remains insufficiently understood. The breakthrough results indicate that, even under extremely low humidity, the adsorption capacity of CO2 and CO can decrease by up to 6 and 24%, respectively. It is found that  the presence of water could increases the CO2/CO separation factor from 6.91 to 9. This enhancement occurs because CO, with its lower quadrupole moment, experiences a more significant reduction in adsorption capacity than CO2. The  quantity and accessibility of cations significantly influence the water tolerance in adsorption processrs. As the number of cations decreases, CO adsorption stabilizes due to the associated hydrophobicity. However, for CO2, the high accessibility of cations at the S3 site in NaX(88) facilitates its conversion to stable carbonates and bicarbonates in the presence of water, enabling exceptional water resistance. These findings offer valuable insights into designing high-performance adsorbents for efficient CO2 capture and separation from industrial flue gas under low-humidity conditions."

This study demonstrates that conventional advanced oxidation processes (UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate) are ineffective in degrading CA, while the UV/sulfite system successfully achieves its breakdown. Hydrated electrons (eaq–) were identified as the primary reactive species responsible for cleaving the stable triazine ring, with minimal contributions from SO3•– and H•. The pH value influences both the activity of eaq– and the degradability of CA by altering its structure; lower pH increases the electron-deficient regions in dihydrogen CA, enhancing its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack by eaq–. The high concentrations of Cl– can inhibit CA removal, likely due to the formation of reactive chlorine species that react with sulfite and suppress eaq– production. Effective CA degradation was also demonstrated in real wastewater, highlighting the UV/sulfite system as a sustainable solution for water treatment. These findings offer valuable insights into CA transformation and present effective approaches for eliminating emerging contaminants in the context of the extensive use of disinfectants."

Simulations reveal a strong hysteresis effect: equilibrium ice volumes differ significantly for equivalent CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ levels, depending on the initial ice sheet geometry. Crucially, the albedo‐melt feedback is accounted for in our coupled setting, resulting in a nonlinear response of the ice sheet to the CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ forcing.

Sea‐ice perturbation experiments from the Polar Amplification MIP provide evidence of a causal influence of residual sea‐ice loss on the atmospheric circulation.

In this study, we conducted in situ and controlled field experiments on subtropical Eucalyptus trees using a portable LI‐6800 photosynthesis system to isolate and quantify the temperature and light responses of major MTs. Additionally, we qualitatively assessed the light dependence of minor MTs and SQTs through dynamic chamber measurements. Our results revealed distinct light dependence across different compounds: β‐ocimenes were fully light‐dependent but exhibited unexpected suppression under high light conditions, whereas α‐pinene and 1,8‐cineole were light‐independent. Temperature response experiments indicated that the temperature sensitivity (β) for light‐dependent β‐ocimenes (0.095 K−1) and light‐independent α‐pinene (0.071 K−1) and 1,8‐cineole (0.102 K−1) were similar to the model value (0.1 K−1), but significantly lower than previously reported values from uncontrolled tropical measurements (0.2 K−1), suggesting an influence of light on observed temperature sensitivity. Chamber‐based results revealed that acyclic MTs and α‐phellandrene were fully light‐dependent, similar to β‐ocimenes, while cyclic MTs and the SQT α‐longipinene were light‐independent and followed an exponential temperature function. Other SQTs exhibited partial light‐dependence and would need a hybrid modeling approach. These results provide valuable insights into the emission mechanisms of various terpene types, with important implications for enhancing predictive models of BVOC emissions."

Blaine,3D Radio Frequency Mapping and Polarization Observations Show Lightning Flashes Were Ignited by Cosmic‐Ray Showers,"Previous 2D radio frequency interferometric observations showed that lightning is commonly started with a positive fast discharge (+FD) before a normal negative leader continues from the origin of the +FD to the ensuing lightning flash. However, the inception and development of the +FD cannot be convincingly explained by existing discharge theories. With our new 3D broadband interferometric mapping and polarization system, we observed that the +FD was sometimes followed by an even faster and more extensive negative discharge (−FD) that propagated backward and overshoot the origin by a few hundred meters, as reported by an earlier 2D study. Surprisingly, the signal polarization, which measures the orientation of the discharge current, systematically slanted from the discharge propagation direction and rotated between the two opposite discharges, showing the +FD and −FD were driven by other storm‐independent factors in addition to the storm electric field, or otherwise all would align in the same direction. Assuming a cosmic‐ray shower (CRS) piercing through the cloud immediately before the +FD/−FD discharge, we found that their path is consistent with a pre‐ionized path by the CRS, and the polarizations for the two opposite discharges are consistent with the respective deflected trajectories of high‐energy positrons and electrons in the geomagnetic and an electric field. We further analyzed the more commonly observed +FD and showed that it is consistent with the CRS interpretation, suggesting these flashes in thunderstorms were ignited by cosmic‐ray showers."

To address this challenge, the IAP‐CAS A2D dynamical ensemble climate prediction system has been developed by expanding the existing operational sub‐seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction system approved by the WMO/WWRP S2S panel. Using a full‐field atmosphere‐ocean initialization experiment which covers the period from 1981 to 2015, several key findings are revealed: First, the model demonstrates significant positive skill for regional surface temperature predictions globally, except for the North Atlantic, likely due to the initial shock. Despite this, the model effectively captures the global mean surface temperature warming trend. Second, the model exhibits relatively high predictability for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with correlation skill up to 3 years, comparable to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Decadal Climate Prediction Project multi‐model ensemble mean. The spread‐error ratios close to 1 in the PDO predictions indicate high reliability. Additionally, the model shows significant skill in predicting the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for up to 1 year, comparable to leading seasonal dynamical prediction models. Further analysis reveals an established teleconnection between ENSO and the North Pacific atmosphere in the IAP‐CAS model, likely underpinning the PDO predictive skill at forecast year 1.

Here, we identify two types of BSISO events, one which propagates northward over South Asia from the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO), and the other which doesn't. Contrasting their behavior shows that the northward propagation occurs in multiple stages after convection is initiated over the EIO. First, the convection moves into the southern Arabian Sea (AS) due to moistening of the free troposphere via horizontal BSISO anomalous winds acting on the background moisture distribution, and forms a northwest‐southeast (NW‐SE) oriented convection band. Subsequently, in the presence of an easterly vertical shear of monsoon winds and meridional gradient of anomalous vertical velocity, a NW‐SE oriented tilting term is generated that results in a tilted gyre north of the existing convective anomaly and south‐easterly BSISO winds over the South Asian landmass. In the second stage, these winds tap the ambient north‐westward moisture gradient and help move the convection further north over land. Moreover, the background winds advect anomalous moisture to initiate convection over the Bay of Bengal. For the non‐propagating events, though a Rossby gyre results as a response to the nascent EIO convection, it is smaller, thus the BSISO advection of background moisture is weaker and does not initiate convection over the southern AS. In turn, the meridional gradient of the anomalous vertical velocity is weak, and the background vertical shear cannot generate sufficient tilting over the northern AS. Therefore, the convective wind response stalls, and large‐scale convection does not propagate north of 15N. Thus, free‐tropospheric moisture advection and vortex tilting due to the background vertical shear work together for robust northward propagation of the BSISO, and strong BSISO easterlies over the southern AS is critical behind this propagation."

 Realizing high electroluminescence dissymmetric factor and high external quantum efficiency at the same time is challenging in light-emitting diodes with direct circularly polarized emission. Here, we show that high electroluminescence dissymmetric factor and high external quantum efficiency can be simultaneously achieved in light-emitting diodes based on chiral perovskite quantum dots. Specifically, chiral perovskite quantum dots with chiral-induced spin selectivity can concurrently serve as localized radiative recombination centers of spin-polarized carriers for circularly polarized emission, thereby suppressing the relaxation of spins, Meanwhile, improving the chiral ligand exchange efficiency is found to synergistically promote their spin selectivity and optoelectronic properties so that chiroptoelectronic performance of resulting devices can be facilitated.

 Disorder is known to have a profound influence on classical phase transitions, and it is anticipated to be even more important for quantum phase transitions. However, experimental investigation of the influence of disorder on phase transitions normally requires numerous samples over the range of disorder. Here, we investigate the field-driven quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnet LiErF4. The isotopic distribution of natural Er permits us to probe the transition in the clean and dirty regimes in the same sample. 167Er, with non-zero nuclear spin on 23% of the Er sites, induces random mass disorder in the dirty (low-temperature) regime. We use specific heat and ac magnetic susceptibility experiments to identify a crossover between the two regimes at T = 150 mK.

Here this group reports the role of antibiotic Nifuroxazide as a potent anti-CSC compound and fabricates it into an anti-breast CSC prodrug using click chemistry strategy. 
 The targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has proven to be an effective approach for limiting tumor progression, thus necessitating the identification of new drugs with anti-CSC activity. Through a high-throughput drug repositioning screen, we identify the antibiotic Nifuroxazide (NIF) as a potent anti-CSC compound. Utilizing a click chemistry strategy, we demonstrate that NIF is a prodrug that is specifically bioactivated in breast CSCs. Mechanistically, NIF-induced CSC death is a result of a synergistic action that combines the generation of DNA interstrand crosslinks with the inhibition of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway activity. NIF treatment mimics FA-deficiency through the inhibition of STAT3, which we identify as a non-canonical transcription factor of FA-related genes. NIF induces a chemical HRDness (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) in CSCs that (re)sensitizes breast cancers with innate or acquired resistance to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) in patient-derived xenograft models. Our results suggest that NIF may be useful in combination with PARPi for the treatment of breast tumors, regardless of their HRD status.

 The connection between amino acid metabolism and pyroptosis remains elusive. Herein, we screen the effect of individual amino acid on pyroptosis and identify that methionine inhibits GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Mechanistic analyses unveil that MYO6, a unique actin-based motor protein, bridges the GSDME N-terminus (GSDME-NT) and the endocytic adaptor AP2, mediating endolysosomal degradation of GSDME-NT. This degradation is increased by the methionine-derived metabolite spermidine noncanonically by direct binding to MYO6, which enhances MYO6 selectivity for GSDME-NT. Moreover, combination targeted therapies using dietary or pharmacological inhibition in methionine-to-spermidine metabolism in the tumor promotes pyroptosis and anti-tumor immunity, leading to a stronger tumor-suppressive effect in in vivo models. Clinically, higher levels of tumor spermidine and expression of methionine-to-spermidine metabolism-related gene signature predict poorer survival. Conclusively, our research identifies an unrecognized mechanism of pyroptotic resistance mediated by methionine-spermidine metabolic axis, providing a fresh angle for cancer treatment.

 Characterizing the HIV-1 reservoir in blood and tissues is crucial for the development of curative strategies. Using an HIV Tat mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticle (Tat-LNP) in combination with panobinostat, we show that p24+ cells from blood and lymph nodes exhibit distinct phenotypes. Blood p24+ cells are found in both central/transitional (TCM/TTM) and effector memory subsets, mostly lack CXCR5 expression and are enriched in GZMA+ cells. In contrast, most lymph node p24+ cells display a TCM/TTM phenotype, with approximately 50% expressing CXCR5 and nearly all lacking GZMA expression. Furthermore, germinal center T follicular helper cells do not appear to harbor the translation-competent reservoir in long-term suppressed individuals. Near full-length HIV-1 sequencing in longitudinal samples from matched blood, lymph nodes, and gut indicates that clones of infected cells, including those carrying an inducible provirus, persist and spread across various anatomical compartments. Finally, uniform genetic diversity across sites suggests the absence of ongoing replication in tissues under treatment.

The results show particularly strong losses of connectivity in deeper ocean strata, affecting 95% of abyssopelagic species. 
 Marine life are expected to have fewer thermal barriers restricting their movement to adjacent habitats than terrestrial species do. However, it remains unknown how this warming-induced connectivity loss varies in different ocean strata, limiting the predictability of warming impacts on biodiversity in the whole ocean. Here, we developed a climate connectivity framework across seascape strata under different climate change scenarios, which combines thermal gradient, human impacts and species tolerance thresholds. We show that warming may lead to connectivity loss, with its magnitude increasing with depth. Connectivity loss is projected to increase rapidly in 2050, particularly in deep strata, and may impair the movement capacity of deep-sea phyla in adapting to warming. With the compression of habitat ranges, over one-quarter of deep-sea species inhabit areas that may experience disrupted connectivity, threatening the maintenance of deep-sea biodiversity. Our results highlight the challenges that climate change poses to biodiversity conservation through disruption of deep-sea connectivity.

 Certification schemes for agriculture aim to incentivize sustainable land management. To be credible, they need robust metrics to assess the practices of producers. We demonstrate an approach for evaluating practice, which is repeatable and explicitly representative of stakeholders. We apply it to nomadic pastoralism in Mongolia, where livestock overgrazing is of concern. Our approach uses judgements from stakeholders about the sustainability of hypothetical but realistic herding scenarios. From these, we create models to predict sustainability scores. These can be applied as tools to assess the actual practices of herders. We use two judgement datasets: one representing producers’ judgements, another a subset that also conforms to the environmental expectations of the certifier. The differences must be negotiated when we choose evaluation methods. The approach could be used for any production system, provided variables are devised that summarize practice and appropriate stakeholders are available to judge the sustainability of different practices. Credible sustainability certifications require robust evaluation to ensure trustworthiness; however, judgements of sustainable practices may differ between the practitioners and the certifiers.

 Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features in the ocean affecting the cycles of nutrients and carbon. Cyclonic eddies formed in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems can substantially modulate primary production by phytoplankton and the vertical and lateral export of organic carbon. However, the impact of eddy activity on the biochemical composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton, bacteria and archaea and associated consequences for carbon and energy flows are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the microbial lipidome in the surface ocean in and around a cyclonic eddy formed in the coastal upwelling system off Mauritania. We show that the eddy contained almost three times the amount of lipids compared to the surrounding open-ocean and coastal waters. The eddy lipid signature with energy-rich triacylglycerols and essential fatty acid-containing membrane lipids of eukaryotic phytoplankton origin was further significantly different from the ambient waters. Strong variability in lipid distributions within the eddy was related to differences in microbial community composition. Estimates indicate that in the Mauritanian upwelling area, as much as 9.7 ± 2.0 gigagrams of lipid carbon per year is delivered to the open ocean by coastal cyclonic eddies potentially fueling higher trophic levels and contributing to the maintenance of secondary productivity and carbon export offshore.

 Anthropogenic activities such as hydraulic fracturing (HF) can trigger destructive earthquakes, the triggering mechanisms of which are still in debate. We utilize near-fault seismic recordings to study the preparatory phase of the 2019 ML 5.6 earthquake in the Weiyuan shale gas field (WSGF), Sichuan Basin, China, which struck 3 months after stimulation completion. This is one of the largest HF-triggered earthquakes worldwide. We observed an 11-month-long precursory fault activation, during which continuous seismicity illuminated the fault plane and provided warnings for a potential destructive earthquake. The fault activation is a consequence of injections in multiple HF well pads, with a variety of mechanisms at play. Numerical simulation reveals that the occurrence of the mainshock involves stress perturbation from post-injection aseismic slip. This work promotes our understanding of HF-induced earthquakes and suggests incorporating long-term near-fault observations and taking post-injection aseismic slip into account for effective hazard management.

 The increasing impacts on regional climate of sea ice anomalies have spatio-temporal uncertainties, this study investigates the possible relationships between Arctic sea ice anomalies and intra-seasonal evolution of winter temperature in Northwest China (with a particular emphasis on Xinjiang). The reanalysis dataset during 1990–2022 from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are utilized, with multiple statistical methods including season-reliant empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and regression analysis being employed. The results show that the first and second EOF modes of intra-seasonal temperature evolution in winter over Xinjiang are characterized by in-phase and out-of-phase variations, explaining 32 % and 19 % variance, respectively. The in-phase (out-of-phase) evolution of intra-seasonal temperature is affected by the in-phase (out-of-phase) variations of sea ice in the Kara Sea-East Siberia Sea-Chukchi Sea (KEsC) and the Barents Sea (BS) during the preceding October. The reduction in the KEsC sea ice triggers upward-propagating wave energy anomalies, which is favorable for the wave train shaping as a meridional dipole pattern from the Ural Mountains to Central Asia in early winter through the stratosphere-troposphere coupling, thereby leading to temperature anomalies in Xinjiang during the following December and January. The BS sea ice anomalies favor the formation and maintenance of a North Atlantic Oscillation-like pattern, the wave energy disperses downstream and enhances in February, triggering a Scandinavian teleconnection pattern-like wave train. This leads to circulation anomalies over Xinjiang, further causes temperature anomalies in February. In summary, the KEsC and BS sea ice in October serves as key precursor signals impacting the intra-seasonal evolution of winter temperature in Xinjiang, with the significant impacts of sea ice in these two key regions on intra-seasonal temperature variations occurring at different times."

 This study, using a dataset consisting of in-situ daily temperature records and ERA5 reanalysis data, analyses the extreme temperature events (i.e., heat waves and warm spells) occurred in the Apennine Mountains (Italy) over the period 1961–2022. The available dataset has been employed to meet the following two main goals: i) to assess the linear trends of the heat waves and warm spells in terms of number of events, duration, and severity by applying the Seasonal Kendall test; ii) to shed light, on a seasonal basis, on the synoptic climatology of such events. From the linear trend analysis, it emerged that the Apennines, as many other regions of the world, experienced an increasing trend in extreme temperature episodes. In particular, in the last 30-year reference period (1991–2020), the number of regional extreme heat events increased by 134 % in summer and 102 % in spring compared to the 1961–1990 period, while in winter and autumn the increase in warm spells is smaller (53 % and 27 %, respectively) and generally not statistically significant in terms of duration and severity. Using Principal Component Analysis and k-means clustering, several synoptic-scale patterns that can trigger extreme hot conditions in the study area are identified. In the last 30-year period, notable changes in the synoptic climatology of extreme heat events have been detected in summer, as well as in spring and autumn. Specifically, in summer the large-scale patterns characterised by a cyclonic area over the eastern North Atlantic (over the British Islands or off the coasts of Ireland) and by a ridge from North Africa to the eastern Europe provide a larger relative contribution to the total number of events. Such patterns promote the advection, over the study area, of hot subtropical air masses, mainly at mid-tropospheric levels. Summer heat waves in the Apennines are generally preceded and accompanied by negative sea surface temperature anomaly with a negative tendency in the eastern North Atlantic area.Such results supply new insights about the links between extreme heat events in the central Mediterranean area and large-scale atmospheric types as well as useful tools to improve the predictability of heat waves and warm spells at both meteorological and climatological time scales."

 The abrupt alternation between floods and droughts can have catastrophic impacts on local communities. In 2019, Southeast China experiences an extreme flood-drought abrupt alternation (FDAA), characterized by record-breaking flood in July and extreme drought in August. This study investigates the atmospheric circulations driving this FDAA and identifies the key mechanisms involved. Both the flood in July and the drought in August are closely associated with cyclonic circulation anomalies, but with distinct locations and dynamics. In July, a cyclonic anomaly over the East China Sea causes moisture convergence and ascending motions, leading to heavy rainfall. In contrast, two cyclonic anomalies in August—one over Northeast China and the other over the Western North Pacific (WNP)—induce northerly winds, moisture divergence, and descending motions, resulting in rainfall deficits. The July cyclonic anomaly is linked to positive soil moisture anomalies over Eastern Europe, which, through cooling surface air temperature, triggers eastward-propagating wave trains that induce cyclonic anomalies over the East China Sea. The August anomalies, on the other hand, are connected to North Atlantic and tropical Indian/Pacific SST anomalies. North Atlantic SST anomalies induce the anomalous Northeast China cyclone through modifying overlying atmosphere and triggering eastward-propagating wave trains.

Through the provision of consistent and reliable data, CHM_Drought enhances our understanding of drought patterns, aiding in effective water management and agricultural planning. 
 Drought indices are crucial for assessing and managing water scarcity and agricultural risks; however, the lack of a unified data foundation in existing datasets leads to inconsistencies that challenge the comparability of drought indices. This study is dedicated to creating CHM_Drought, an innovative and comprehensive long-term meteorological drought dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.1° and with data collected from 1961 to 2022 in mainland China. It features six pivotal meteorological drought indices: the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), evaporative demand drought index (EDDI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), of which the SPI, SPEI, and EDDI contain multi-scale features for periods of 2 weeks and 1–12 months. The dataset features a comprehensive application of high-density meteorological station data and a complete framework starting from basic meteorological elements (the China Hydro-Meteorology dataset, CHM). Demonstrating its robustness, the dataset excels in accurately capturing drought events across mainland China, as evidenced by its detailed depiction of the 2022 summer drought in the Yangtze River basin. In addition, to evaluate CHM_Drought, we performed consistency tests with the drought indices calculated based on Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and CN05.1 data and found that all indices had high consistency overall and that the 2-week-scale SPI, SPEI, and EDDI had potential early-warning roles in drought monitoring. Overall, our dataset bridges the gap in high-precision multi-index drought data in China, and the complete CHM-based framework ensures the consistency and reliability of the dataset, which contributes to enhancing the understanding of drought patterns and trends in China.

By using multidirectional mean sea surface data, it reduces the impact of ocean dynamics and provides detailed global gravity anomaly change rates. This model provides critical insights into seafloor structures and ocean mass distribution, contributing to research in marine geophysics and oceanography. The dataset is freely available on Zenodo. 
 Satellite altimetry is a vital tool for global ocean observation, providing critical insights into ocean gravity and its gradients. Over the past 6 years, satellite data from various space agencies have nearly tripled, facilitating the development of high-precision ocean gravity anomaly and ocean vertical gradient of gravity anomaly (VGGA) models. This study constructs a global ocean VGGA model named SDUST2023VGGA using multidirectional mean sea surface (MSS). To address computational limitations, the global ocean is divided into 72 sub-regions. In each sub-region, the DTU21 MSS model and the CNES-CLS22 mean dynamic topography (MDT) model are used to derive the geoid. To mitigate the influence of long-wavelength signals on the calculations, the study subtracts the long-wavelength geoid derived from the XGM2019e_2190 gravity field model from the (full-wavelength) geoid, resulting in a residual (short-wavelength) geoid. To ensure the accuracy of the VGGA calculations, a weighted least-squares method is employed using residual geoid data from a 17′×17′ area surrounding the computation point. This approach effectively accounts for the real ocean environment, thereby enhancing the precision of the calculation results. After combining the VGGA models for all sub-regions, the model's reliability is validated against the SIO V32.1 VGGA (named curv) model. The comparison between the SDUST2023VGGA and the SIO V32.1 model shows a residual mean is −0.08 Eötvös (E) and the RMS is 8.50 E, demonstrating high consistency on a global scale. Analysis of the differences reveals that the advanced data processing and modeling strategies employed in the DTU21 MSS model enable SDUST2023VGGA to maintain stable performance across varying ocean depths, unaffected by ocean dynamics. The effective use of multidirectional MSS allows for the detailed capture of ocean gravity field information embedded in the MSS model. Analysis across diverse ocean regions demonstrates that the SDUST2023VGGA model successfully reveals the internal structure and mass distribution of the seafloor.

The model has a high skill level in simulating sea ice production driving the AABW source water formation and AABW properties when assessed against observations. A model experiment shows a significant impact of ice shelf melting on the AABW characteristics. 
 The Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean is a key region for the formation of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) that supplies the lower limb of the global overturning circulation and contributes to 20 %–40 % of the total AABW production. AABW primarily originates from polynyas characterized by strong sea ice production and ocean convection that lead to the formation of Dense Shelf Water (DSW), the precursor of AABW. The production and characteristics of DSW in the Ross Sea and AABW in the surrounding ocean are significantly affected by ice shelf meltwater transported from the nearby Amundsen Sea. The scarcity of long-term observations in the Ross Sea hinders the understanding of DSW and AABW variability, and numerical models are needed to explore the multi-scale variations in these water masses and the forcing mechanisms. In this work, a coupled high-resolution ocean–sea ice–ice shelf model is developed for the Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea, named the Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea Ice–Sea Model (RAISE). Detailed descriptions of the model configurations are provided. This study represents an attempt to thoroughly evaluate the DSW properties and associated ocean–sea ice–ice shelf coupling processes among modeling studies in the Southern Ocean, using multiple datasets including satellite-based observations and hydrographic measurements from the World Ocean Database, Argo profilers and seal-tag sensors. In particular, the modeled temporal variations in DSW properties in polynyas and key export passages are compared with long-term mooring observations, which are rarely seen in studies of the DSW temporal variability before. RAISE demonstrates a high skill level in simulating the observed sea ice production rates in the Ross Sea polynyas, and the modeled spatial and temporal variability in DSW are significantly and strongly correlated with observations. RAISE can also effectively capture the observed long-term freshening trend of DSW prior to 2014 and the rebounding of DSW salinity after 2014. RAISE shows an overestimate of DSW density in the Ross Sea, which is associated with an underestimate of ice shelf melting rates in the Amundsen Sea, missing ice shelf calving processes and subglacial discharge in the model. A sensitivity experiment simulating increased freshwater discharge from these processes can significantly improve the simulation of DSW properties."

It can preserve not only standard but also extreme rainfall statistics across various timescales. Notably, compared to traditional frequency analysis methods, the BL model requires only half the record length (or even shorter) to achieve similar consistency in estimating sub-hourly rainfall extremes. This makes it a valuable tool for modelling rainfall extremes with short records. 
 The Bartlett–Lewis (BL) model is a stochastic framework for representing rainfall based upon  Poisson cluster point process theory. This model has been used for over 30 years in the stochastic modelling of daily and hourly rainfall time series. Historically, the BL model was known to underestimate sub-daily rainfall extremes, but recent advancements have addressed this issue, making it a viable alternative to traditional rainfall frequency analysis methods, such as those based on annual maxima time series. Despite its potential, calibrating the BL model is a not a trivial task. The model's formulation is complex, and calibrating it involves a nonlinear optimisation process that can be numerically unstable, which has limited its broader application. To promote the use of the BL model and demonstrate its capabilities in modelling sub-hourly rainfall – both standard and extreme statistics – we have developed an open-source Python package called pyBL. This paper details the design of the BL model and summarises the key features of the pyBL package. It includes a brief explanation of how to use the package in selected user scenarios. In addition, we report on scientific experiments that resemble real-world situations to showcase pyBL's ability to model sub-hourly rainfall extremes with short records and its flexibility in utilising records of various timescales and lengths."

Parsons,Hydro-geomorphological modelling of leaky wooden dam efficacy from reach to catchment scale with CAESAR-Lisflood 1.9j,"Leaky wooden dams are a type of natural flood management intervention that aims to reduce flood risk downstream by temporarily holding back water during a storm event and releasing it afterwards. These structures alter the river hydrology, and therefore the geomorphology, yet often this is excluded from numerical models. Here we show that by not simulating geomorphology, we are currently underestimating the efficacy of these structures to reduce the flood peak and store water. 
 Leaky wooden dams (LDs) are woody structures installed in headwater streams that aim to reduce downstream flood risk through increasing in-channel roughness and decreasing river longitudinal connectivity in order to desynchronise flood peaks within catchments. Hydrological modelling of these structures omits sediment transport processes since the impact of these processes on flow routing is considered negligible in comparison to in-stream hydraulics. Such processes are also excluded on the grounds of computational expense. Here we present a study that advances our ability to model leaky wooden dams through a roughness-based representation in the landscape evolution model CAESAR-Lisflood, introducing a flexible and representative approach to simulating the impact of LDs on reach and broader catchment-scale processes. The hydrological and geomorphological sensitivity of the model is tested against grid resolution and variability in key parameters such as leaky dam gap size and roughness. The influence of these parameters is also tested in isolation from grid resolution whilst evaluating the impact of simulating sediment transport on computational expense, model domain outputs, and internal geomorphological evolution. The findings show that simulating sediment transport increased the volume of water stored in the test reach (channel length of 160 m) by up to an order of magnitude, whilst it reduced discharge by up to 31 % during a storm event (6 h, 1-in-10-year event). We demonstrate how this is due to the leaky dam acting to induce geomorphic change and thus increasing channel roughness. When considering larger grid resolutions, however, our results show that care must be due to overestimations of localised scour and deposition in the model and that behavioural approaches should be adopted when using CAESAR-Lisflood in the absence of robust empirical validation data."

Results indicate that optimizing scrap allocation can reduce carbon emissions by 173.97–215.66 million tons, achieving a 99% reduction by 2060 compared to 2020 levels.

However, the microbial mechanism underlying MP-induced SOC and nutrient dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impacts of two common MPs (polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride) on microbial hierarchical groups (bacteria, fungi, and protists) and the cascading effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient dynamics in two typical agricultural soils (Mollisol and Ultisol). Our results showed that MP inputs consistently reduced NO3––N concentration but increased the content of DOC and specific dissolved organic matter (DOM) components. Despite divergent responses of microbial hierarchical groups to MPs, MP inputs consistently strengthened the connectivity and cross-trophic associations of microbial multitrophic networks. Protistan nodes belonging to Cercozoa, Ciliophora, and Chlorophyta played essential roles in maintaining network connectivity in MP-treated soils. The enhanced network connectivity and cross-trophic associations primarily explained variations in soil DOC and nutrient turnover. These findings collectively indicate that MP inputs trigger DOC and nutrient turnover by enhancing the potential multitrophic interactions and species connectivity within soil micro-food webs.

Cues that lead animals to respond differently to MPs are key factors driving MP ingestion, yet they remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the susceptibility of three fish species to different types of MPs across different social contexts. Our results showed that bass were more attracted to MPs that resembled food visually, whereas carp tended to select MPs that shared olfactory cues with food. Goldfish relied more on oral processing to make foraging decisions on MPs. Structural differences in the oropharynx supported these discriminated oral processes. Enlarged group size and fasting time altered the foraging behaviors of MPs of goldfish and bass, both of which were suction-feeding species. Such behavioral changes, regardless of whether fish ultimately ingested or rejected MPs, could pose indirect costs to fish. However, changed group sizes and fasting times did not affect the intake of MPs by the filter-feeding carp. We also proposed four pathways causing the MP-induced evolutionary trap and discussed the potential of fish to escape this trap.

The cumulative concentrations of 6:2 FTEOs ranged from below the limit of detection (<LOD) to 2600 ng/g (median: 21.7 ng/g) in house dust and from <LOD to 24.9 ng/mL (median: 0.40 ng/mL) in human serum. 6:2 FTEO8, 6:2 FTEO9, 6:2 FTEO10, and 6:2 FTEO11 appeared to be the dominant homologues consistently found in antifog products, house dust, and human serum. Molecular docking revealed a high binding affinity of major 6:2 FTEO homologues to human serum albumin and liver fatty acid binding protein, suggesting substantial bioaccumulation potency and potential biological effects. As the first report on human exposure to 6:2 FTEOs, our study calls for further monitoring and toxicological investigations to better understand the potential risks of this specific group of PFAS to human health."

Emilson,Mixed Model Approaches Can Leverage Database Information to Improve the Estimation of Size-Adjusted Contaminant Concentrations in Fish Populations,"Concentrations of bioaccumulative contaminants in fish increase with their size and age; thus, research and monitoring of these contaminants in fish across space and time can be confounded by size covariation. To account for this, size-standardization of contaminant concentrations within fish samples is a common practice. Standardized concentrations are often estimated using within-sample regression models, also known as power series regression (referred to here as sampling event regressions, or SERs). This approach requires higher sample sizes than mixed effect models (MEMs), which are suited for this application but are not as commonly used. Herein we compare SERs to three MEM approaches; restricted maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and approximate Bayesian inference with nested Laplace approximation (INLA). We did this for two contaminants: mercury (Hg), a contaminant known to bioaccumulate, and arsenic (As), where the bioaccumulative potential is less understood. The MEM approaches generated size-standardized concentrations for small populations (e.g., <5 fish) and/or populations that lacked the range of sizes required for SER estimates, with comparable residual and root mean squared error to SER estimates. INLA was determined to be the best method in most cases because it was computationally less intensive than other approaches and showed consistent performance across a range of scenarios with sample-size limitations. Additionally, we provided example code for prediction using the R-INLA package to enable use and application in fisheries’ contaminant monitoring and research."

Despite the ecological and economic significance of coastal environments, monitoring efforts to identify PFAS in these regions are limited. Bivalves have been used as biomonitors for many pollutants, but their effectiveness in reflecting environmental PFAS contamination and the mechanisms of PFAS bioaccumulation is poorly understood. This study examined the impact of biological, chemical, and ecological variables on PFAS bioaccumulation in two bivalve species (i.e., Eastern oyster and Atlantic ribbed mussel) and developed a statistical model to predict the PFAS content in wild bivalves. Overall, the summed PFAS concentration in the bivalves closely mirrors that in water. We observed higher bioaccumulation factors for some perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides and branched PFAS isomers than for terminal PFAS of equivalent chain length. The isomer distribution and precursor-to-terminal compound ratios provide compelling evidence that the biotransformation of PFAS precursors likely drives these elevated factors. Additionally, the bioaccumulation factors of PFAS decrease with increasing organism size and age, suggesting that smaller and younger bivalves have greater bioaccumulation potential and are more susceptible to PFAS contamination. These findings provide critical information that guides the use of bivalves as biomonitors to evaluate PFAS contamination in aquatic environments."

In this study, the mice received a 28-day subchronic oral exposure to PFOA. The results of spatial mass spectrometry imaging indicated that the eye-enriched PFOA dispersed into the subretina primarily through the outer BRB (oBRB), which subsequently resulted in significantly increased apoptosis and decreased thickness of multiple oBRB-associated layers. BRB integrity and function were compromised due to decreased expression of the tight junction (TJ). Mechanistically, PFOA outcompeted lysophosphatidic acid to bind strongly with lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) in its antagonism, abolishing its ability to stimulate the TJ assembly-related signaling pathway. This subsequently attenuated phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, rendering insufficient contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, leading to decreased TJ assembly and BRB leakage. This, in turn, facilitated PFOA translocation across the BRB and accumulation within the subretinal space. Our findings suggest that oBRB is particularly vulnerable to PFOA, which targets directly LPAR1 to disable its function of maintaining TJ assembly cascades, leading to adverse visual effects."

Here we employ a multisector energy system model of the contiguous United States to study competition among low-carbon hydrogen production options and the interplay between the electricity and hydrogen sectors in a net-zero energy system. When hydrogen storage is available without constraints and electrolyzers are grid-connected, they account for most hydrogen production, while providing demand-side flexibility to the electricity system. This decreases battery storage deployment to achieve similar shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power system. When electrolyzers are not grid-connected but rely on islanded VRE power to produce “green” H2, we find that power system flexibility and the share of electrolytic hydrogen are reduced, all else equal. Without hydrogen storage, natural gas-based hydrogen (i.e., “blue” H2) accounts for most hydrogen production, although increasing flexibility of blue H2 can enable some electrolytic H2 production. Finally, we find that hydrogen deployment does not substantially drive energy transmission expansion, although there is a modest increase in CO2 transmission when blue H2 is deployed in regions with limited CO2 storage."

We find that CMS technologies can distinguish between different operational states of engine-driven compressors with large CH4 emissions contribution from compressor exhaust. Combining known events at these facilities with in situ controlled releases, we observe that all CMS technologies generally struggle in identifying short-duration (<30 min) or low emission rate (relative to baseline) events. Critically, we find that positive event detection, based on analysis of underlying methane signals, frequently did not translate to alerts sent to the operators.

Highly oblique propagation leads to sharp harmonic structures at frequencies closer to local proton gyrofrequency. An increase in ring energy, ωpe/Ωce ${\omega }_{pe}/{{\Omega }}_{ce}$ ratio, and heavier ion concentration decreases the wave growth rates. When the background ions have very low temperatures, O2+ ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}^{+}$ ions lower the growth rate more as compared to O+ ${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$ ions. Additionally, the increase in temperatures of cold electrons and ions have opposite effects, with the former increasing the growth rate and the latter decreasing it."

Model studies suggested a fast interaction between the IPO and AMV through atmospheric teleconnections, but observations exhibit a weak IPO–AMV contemporaneous correlation. To address this paradox, we apply linear inverse model (LIM) in observations to decode the interaction. We reveal that a cancel effect of the interaction lowers the observed IPO–AMV contemporaneous correlation. When only retaining the one‐way modulation (the IPO forces the AMV or the reversed one) in the observational LIM, their correlation peaks nearly simultaneously, consistent with the fast IPO–AMV interaction in model experiments. We further demonstrate that the fast interaction is associated with both tropical and extratropical processes. Our study reconciles the discrepancy between observations and models on the IPO–AMV interaction."

Plasma measurements with high time resolution at altitude of 630–670 km in the nightside auroral oval often detected inverted‐V signatures of precipitating ions adjoining active electron inverted‐Vs, suggesting downward ion acceleration by downward FAEFs associated with intense downward FAC. The energy‐pitch angle distributions indicate that the altitudes of these FAEF accelerations producing ion inverted‐V precipitation are estimated to be a few thousand kilometers, lower than those of electron inverted‐Vs.

However, identifying PF and its environmental control mechanisms remains challenging, primarily due to soil spatial heterogeneity. In this study, 20 sensors were installed on two hillslopes with distinct soil thicknesses to monitor moisture at 5‐min intervals. PF types were identified based on moisture response sequence to rainfall across layers, and relationships among PF frequency (PFF), soil depth, and rainfall characteristics were determined. Macropore flow was the main PF type, followed by soil‒bedrock interface flow. On the hillslope with deep soil cover, PFF was significantly negatively correlated with soil depth. Comparison, on the hillslope with shallow soil cover, PFF was not influenced by soil depth but more notably controlled by rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture.

The in situ observations from the Swarm spacecraft show a rapid depletion of plasma density in the dawn and dusk sectors following the storm. The in situ data are further complemented by the ground‐based total electron content maps. Both the in situ and the ground‐based observations show significant depletion of electron density during the super storm in regions above 50° magnetic latitude. The density depletion originates from a polar hole in the morning high latitude sector. It is suggested that the strong convection speed under substantial solar wind forcing leads to chemical composition changes and rapid recombination in the ionosphere. The region of depleted plasma density is not confined to the polar cap but expands to auroral and mid‐latitude regions. The depleted plasma density lasts for about 3 days before it recovers to the pre‐storm levels.

Dunes evolve in response to environmental change, offering a record of recent geologic and climate history. A global analysis reveals that Titan's dunes become more narrowly spaced and increasingly more regular along a continuous eastward transport path, starting east of the Xanadu region, around the equator, and terminating abruptly at Xanadu's western margin. Xanadu is a rugged, tectonically active, water‐ice‐rich region with low topography and a thin layer of atmospherically deposited organic‐rich material. Our results demonstrate that windblown grains must withstand long transport distances. Furthermore, environmental conditions along the eastern margin of Xanadu set a template over which dunes evolve, only gradually modified as sediment supply or availability increases downwind. Together, these results highlight the oversized impact that Xanadu has on Titan's dune fields, which in turn play a critical role in regulating Titan's sedimentary and carbon cycles."

We examine Arctic climate responses to insolation intensity as well as remnant ice sheets through atmosphere‐ocean‐vegetation feedback quantitatively. During periods when Northern Hemisphere ice sheets remain, Arctic sea ice maintains a large extent in summer, and annual mean surface air temperatures are low enough to outweigh the warming expected from summer insolation intensity and greenhouse gases alone. This indicates that glacial ice sheets, due to their high albedo and their role as a heat sink, suppress the accumulation of heat in the Arctic Ocean in summer and the associated warming feedback. The results suggest a need to consider the history of remnant ice sheets and the duration of ice‐free periods to explain different Arctic climate responses within and between interglacials."

Hence, this study examines changes in North Atlantic tropical cyclone outer size and structure using a large, multidecadal sample of cases from reanalysis data. These results suggest that tropical cyclone outer size and structure typically remain unchanged until after extratropical transition end. In those minority of cases with strong expansion during extratropical transition, increases in tropical cyclone outer winds begin first in the lower troposphere during extratropical transition and build upwards over time. This broadening of the azimuthal‐mean outer winds is also associated with an increasingly asymmetric outer wind field with the strongest winds concentrated downstream of the tropical cyclone. These storms that expand most strongly during transition are typically smaller at transition start and eventually become embedded in more strongly baroclinic environments by extratropical transition end."

These turbulent motions, in turn, energize and kick‐up sand particles, influencing sediment transport and ultimately the formation and migration of dunes—with knock‐on consequences for dust emission. While feedback between flow and form have been studied at the scale of dunes, research has not examined how the development of an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) over the entire dune field influences sediment‐transporting turbulence. Here, we deploy a large‐eddy simulation of an ABL encountering a natural roughness transition: the sand dunes at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. We analyze turbulence producing motions and how they change as the IBL grows over the dune field. Frequency spectrum and Reynolds shear stress profiles show that IBL thickness determines the largest scales of turbulence. Moreover, the developing IBL enhances the frequency, magnitude and duration of sweep and ejection events—turbulence producing motions whose peaks systematically migrate away from the wall as the IBL thickens. Because sweep and ejection events are known to drive sediment transport, our findings provide a mechanism for coupling the co‐evolution of the landscape and the ABL flow over it. More broadly, our results have implications for how roughness transitions influence the transport of pollutants, particulates, heat, and moisture."

Blanchard,Global and Regional Marine Ecosystem Models Reveal Key Uncertainties in Climate Change Projections,"Climate change is affecting ocean temperature, acidity, currents, and primary production, causing shifts in species distributions, marine ecosystems, and ultimately fisheries. Earth system models simulate climate change impacts on physical and biogeochemical properties of future oceans under varying emissions scenarios. Coupling these simulations with an ensemble of global marine ecosystem models has indicated broad decreases of fish biomass with warming. However, regional details of these impacts remain much more uncertain. Here, we employ CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate change impact projections using two Earth system models coupled with four regional and nine global marine ecosystem models in 10 ocean regions to evaluate model agreement at regional scales. We find that models developed at different scales can lead to stark differences in biomass projections. On average, global models projected greater biomass declines by the end of the 21st century than regional models. For both global and regional models, greater biomass declines were projected using CMIP6 than CMIP5 simulations. Global models projected biomass declines in 86% of CMIP5 simulations for ocean regions compared to 50% for regional models in the same ocean regions. In CMIP6 simulations, all global model simulations projected biomass declines in ocean regions by 2100, while regional models projected biomass declines in 67% of the ocean region simulations. Our analysis suggests that improved understanding of the causes of differences between global and regional marine ecosystem model climate change projections is needed, alongside observational evaluation of modeled responses."

 Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics1–6. Experimental efforts so far have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials—typically amorphous metals—and semiconducting quantum Hall7–11 or quantum anomalous Hall12,13 systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes14–17. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials in which the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling ν = −1 as well as a superconducting state at ν ≈ −3.5 at zero magnetic field. Gate voltage can also be used to actuate non-volatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state18, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at ν = 2/3 (ref. 19)—also stable at zero magnetic field—enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers20–22, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket20–24, while leaving the topology of the ν = −1 quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low disorder limit.

 Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally1,2. Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours3. There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). TXA2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis."

 The electroluminescence performance of heavy-metal-free blue quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) is much lower than that of state-of-the-art cadmium-based counterparts. Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs.

 Mergers of binary neutron stars emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology3, nuclear physics4–6 and gravity7. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.

TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors1–3. Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity4, auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming. cAMP produced by the TIR1/AFB receptors of the main endogenous developmental plant hormone auxin acts as a true second messenger, revising the established paradigm of transcriptional auxin signalling."

 Recent evidence indicates that the emergence of stone tool technology occurred before the appearance of the genus Homo1 and may potentially be traced back deep into the primate evolutionary line2. Conversely, osseous technologies are apparently exclusive of later hominins from approximately 2 million years ago (Ma)3,4, whereas the earliest systematic production of bone tools is currently restricted to European Acheulean sites 400–250 thousand years ago5,6. Here we document an assemblage of bone tools shaped by knapping found within a single stratigraphic horizon at Olduvai Gorge dated to 1.5 Ma. Large mammal limb bone fragments, mostly from hippopotamus and elephant, were shaped to produce various tools, including massive elongated implements. Before our discovery, bone artefact production in pre-Middle Stone Age African contexts was widely considered as episodic, expedient and unrepresentative of early Homo toolkits. However, our results demonstrate that at the transition between the Oldowan and the early Acheulean, East African hominins developed an original cultural innovation that entailed a transfer and adaptation of knapping skills from stone to bone. By producing technologically and morphologically standardized bone tools, early Acheulean toolmakers unravelled technological repertoires that were previously thought to have appeared routinely more than 1 million years later. Bone tools shaped by knapping found within Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania precede any other evidence of systematic bone tool production by more than 1 million years."

 Mesenchymal plasticity has been extensively described in advanced epithelial cancers; however, its functional role in malignant progression is controversial1–5. The function of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Here we clarify the contribution of EMT to malignant progression in pancreatic cancer. We used somatic mosaic genome engineering technologies to trace and ablate malignant mesenchymal lineages along the EMT continuum. The experimental evidence clarifies the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution. Spatial genomic analysis, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of EMT clarifies its contribution to the emergence of genomic instability, including events of chromothripsis. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross-species analysis of pancreatic and other human solid tumours. Mechanistically, we identified that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Thus, EMT favours the emergence of genomic-unstable, highly fit tumour cells, which strongly supports the concept of cell-state-restricted patterns of evolution, whereby cancer cell speciation is propagated to progeny within restricted functional compartments. Restraining the evolutionary routes through ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity, and extinction of the derived lineages, halts the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.

 Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified1–6. These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.

 Peptide hormones, a class of pharmacologically active molecules, have a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight.

 Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1–5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6–14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity.

Such peptides might provide a source of natural antibiotics that could lead to biotechnology applications and therapeutic interventions. 
 For decades, antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I for T cell-mediated immunity has been considered the primary function of proteasome-derived peptides1,2. However, whether the products of proteasomal degradation play additional parts in mounting immune responses remains unknown. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of defence against invading pathogens before the adaptive immune system responds. Although the protective function of antimicrobial peptides across numerous tissues is well established, the cellular mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Here we uncover a role for proteasomes in the constitutive and bacterial-induced generation of defence peptides that impede bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo by disrupting bacterial membranes. In silico prediction of proteome-wide proteasomal cleavage identified hundreds of thousands of potential proteasome-derived defence peptides with cationic properties that may be generated en route to degradation to act as a first line of defence. Furthermore, bacterial infection induces changes in proteasome composition and function, including PSME3 recruitment and increased tryptic-like cleavage, enhancing antimicrobial activity. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into the role of proteasomes in cell-autonomous innate immunity, our study suggests that proteasome-cleaved peptides may have previously overlooked functions downstream of degradation. From a translational standpoint, identifying proteasome-derived defence peptides could provide an untapped source of natural antibiotics for biotechnological applications and therapeutic interventions in infectious diseases and immunocompromised conditions. Proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins generate defence peptides constitutively and in response to bacterial infection. Such peptides might provide a source of natural antibiotics that could lead to biotechnology applications and therapeutic interventions."

 Artificial intelligence (AI) edge devices1–12 demand high-precision energy-efficient computations, large on-chip model storage, rapid wakeup-to-response time and cost-effective foundry-ready solutions. Floating point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13–15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16–22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (<0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs).

 Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, yet their resilience to rising temperatures remains poorly understood1,2. This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased3, compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features. A 4 °C global temperature increase would push 7.5% of amphibian species beyond their physiological limits."

 To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions1–5. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2+) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Behavioural experiments in mice demonstrate that GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic and serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus have distinct and complementary functions in regulating decision-making resulting in flexible behavioural strategies."

 The current opioid overdose epidemic highlights the urgent need to develop safer and more effective treatments for chronic pain1. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is a promising non-opioid target for pain relief, but its clinical use has been limited by centrally mediated psychoactivity and tolerance. We overcame both issues by designing peripherally restricted CB1 agonists that minimize arrestin recruitment. We achieved these goals by computationally designing positively charged derivatives of the potent CB1 agonist MDMB-Fubinaca2. We designed these ligands to occupy a cryptic pocket identified through molecular dynamics simulations—an extended binding pocket that opens rarely and leads to the conserved signalling residue D2.50 (ref. 3). We used structure determination, pharmacological assays and molecular dynamics simulations to verify the binding modes of these ligands and to determine the molecular mechanism by which they achieve this dampening of arrestin recruitment. Our lead ligand, VIP36, is highly peripherally restricted and demonstrates notable efficacy in three mouse pain models, with 100-fold dose separation between analgesic efficacy and centrally mediated side effects. VIP36 exerts analgesic efficacy through peripheral CB1 receptors and shows limited analgesic tolerance. These results show how targeting a cryptic pocket in a G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to enhanced peripheral selectivity, biased signalling, desired in vivo pharmacology and reduced adverse effects. This has substantial implications for chronic pain treatment but could also revolutionize the design of drugs targeting other G-protein-coupled receptors.

 Pathogen genomics can provide insights into underlying infectious disease transmission patterns1,2, but new methods are needed to handle modern large-scale pathogen genome datasets and realize this full potential3–5. In particular, genetically proximal viruses should be highly informative about transmission events as genetic proximity indicates epidemiological linkage.

Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postcodes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities. We find that transmission patterns between age groups vary across spatial scales. Finally, we use the timing of sequence collection to understand the age groups driving transmission. Overall, this study improves our ability to use large pathogen genome datasets to understand the determinants of infectious disease spread. The analysis of pairs of identical SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences enables characterization of transmission patterns between geographies and age groups."

Ziegler;Bojie Fu;Zhenzhong Zeng,Impact of Amazonian deforestation on precipitation reverses between seasons,"Reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation show that deforestation leads to precipitation increases in the wet season and decreases in the dry season. 
 Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets1. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region. Reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation show that deforestation leads to precipitation increases in the wet season and decreases in the dry season."

 Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1–4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5–7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation.

 Haematopoietic stem cells maintain blood production throughout life1. Although extensively characterized using the laboratory mouse, little is known about clonal selection and population dynamics of the haematopoietic stem cell pool during murine ageing. We isolated stem cells and progenitors from young and old mice, identifying 221,890 somatic mutations genome-wide in 1,845 single-cell-derived colonies. Mouse stem cells and progenitors accrue approximately 45 somatic mutations per year, a rate only approximately threefold greater than human progenitors despite the vastly different organismal sizes and lifespans. Phylogenetic patterns show that stem and multipotent progenitor cell pools are established during embryogenesis, after which they independently self-renew in parallel over life, evenly contributing to differentiated progenitors and peripheral blood. The stem cell pool grows steadily over the mouse lifespan to about 70,000 cells, self-renewing about every 6 weeks. Aged mice did not display the profound loss of clonal diversity characteristic of human haematopoietic ageing. However, targeted sequencing showed small, expanded clones in the context of murine ageing, which were larger and more numerous following haematological perturbations, exhibiting a selection landscape similar to humans. Our data illustrate both conserved features of population dynamics of blood and distinct patterns of age-associated somatic evolution in the short-lived mouse. Isolating and studying haematopoietic stem cells in young and aged mice demonstrates evolutionary processes related to blood production and provides a framework for interpreting future work using laboratory mice to study stem cell ageing."

 Tropical forest canopies are the biosphere’s most concentrated atmospheric interface for carbon, water and energy1,2. However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties3. This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically4. Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space. Data from a variety of sources—including satellite, climate and soil data, as well as field-collected information on plant traits—are pooled and analysed to map the functional diversity of tropical forest canopies globally."

 More than ten ergot alkaloids comprising both natural and semi-synthetic products are used to treat various diseases1,2. The central C ring forms the core pharmacophore for ergot alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2 disproportionation5,6, EasC and its homologues represent a broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique homodimeric architecture that is, to our knowledge, previously unobserved. The substrate prechanoclavine unprecedentedly binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms, EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used transient haem iron–oxygen complexes (such as compounds I, II and III)8,9, to mediate substrate transformation through superoxide-mediated cooperative catalysis of the two distant pockets. We propose that this reactive oxygen species mechanism could be widespread in metalloenzyme-catalysed reactions. The unique structure and mechanism of chanoclavine synthase (EasC), a haem catalase that uses superoxide for substrate transformation in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, are revealed in this study, challenging established catalase mechanisms."

 A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter in which its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organization. The existence of the supersolid phase of matter was speculated more than 50 years ago1–4. However, only recently has there been convincing experimental evidence, mainly using ultracold atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to electromagnetic fields. There, various guises of the supersolid were created using atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities5,6, with large magnetic dipole moments7–13, and spin–orbit-coupled, two-component systems showing stripe phases14–16. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context based on exciton–polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound state in the continuum (BiC) with exceptionally low losses, realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a precision of several parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to also measure the local coherence of the supersolid. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum.

 The preference for a particular thermal range is a key determinant of the distribution of animal species. However, we know little on how temperature preference behaviour evolves during the colonization of new environments. Here we show that at least two distinct neurobiological mechanisms drive the evolution of temperature preference in flies of the genus Drosophila. Fly species from mild climates (D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) avoid both innocuous and noxious heat, and we show that the thermal activation threshold of the molecular heat receptor Gr28b.d precisely matches species-specific thresholds of behavioural heat avoidance. We find that desert-dwelling D. mojavensis are instead actively attracted to innocuous heat. Notably, heat attraction is also mediated by Gr28b.d (and by the antennal neurons that express it) and matches its threshold of heat activation. Rather, the switch in valence from heat aversion to attraction correlates with specific changes in thermosensory input to the lateral horn, the main target of central thermosensory pathways and a region of the fly brain implicated in the processing of innate valence1–5. Together, our results demonstrate that, in Drosophila, the adaptation to different thermal niches involves changes in thermal preference behaviour, and that this can be accomplished using distinct neurobiological solutions, ranging from shifts in the activation threshold of peripheral thermosensory receptor proteins to a substantial change in the way temperature valence is processed in the brain. A study using flies of the genus Drosophila adapted to life in diverse thermal environments shows how evolution has shaped temperature preference by acting on both molecular heat receptors and thermosensory circuits in the flies."

 Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops1,2. A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area)3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops6,7. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 (CLV3)10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species. Gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability."

Here, the authors report halting HER at the Volmer step on a CuO@Cu heterostructure, significantly promoting the selective ARR. 
 The electrochemical reduction of acetonitrile (AN) to ethylamine (EA) is an attractive yet challenging process, primarily due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This study demonstrates the ability to halt the HER at Volmer step, where protons migrate to the unsaturated bond of AN on a self-supported CuO@Cu heterostructure. The CuO@Cu catalyst exhibits nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) over the entire range of potentials tested from −0.1 to −0.4 V vs. RHE, demonstrating remarkable stability over 1000 h at a constant current density of 0.2 A cm−2. CuO is identified as the active component driving the reaction, while the metallic Cu facilitates efficient electron transfer. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidences indicate that a synergistic hydrogenation process contributes to the AN reduction reaction (ARR), which involves both surface hydrogen migration and proton addition from solution. This study provides an insight into understanding of ARR process, and suggests an efficient strategy to enhance the electrochemical hydrogenation of organic molecules by regulating the Volmer step.

 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection depletes CD4 T-cells, and long-term persistence of latent virus prevents full clearance of HIV even in the presence of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), Here we present the HIV-1-induced lineage tracing (HILT) system, a model that irreversibly marks infected cells within a humanized mouse model, which detects rare latently infected cells. Immunodeficient mice transplanted with genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells develop a human immune system, in which CD4 T-cells contain a genetic switch that permanently labels cells infected by HIV-1 expressing cre-recombinase. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of HILT-marked cells during acute infection and post-ART treatment, we identify distinct CD4+ T-cell transcriptional lineages enriched in either active or latent infections. Comparative gene expression analysis highlights common pathways modulated in both states, including EIF2, Sirtuin, and protein ubiquitination. Critical regulators of these pathways, including JUN, BCL2, and MDM2, change to opposite directions in the two states, highlighting gene expression programs that may support HIV persistence across T-cell lineages and states.

 Noninvasive visualization of the distribution and persistence of mRNA vaccine antigen expression in mammalian systems has implications for the development and evaluation of future mRNA vaccines. Here, we genetically fuse E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) to the delta furin diproline modified SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S2P∆f) mRNA vaccine and image its expression in female mice and male non-human primates using [18F]fluoropropyl-trimethoprim ([18F]FP-TMP). Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed transient expression of the vaccine antigen in the injection site and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Fusion of eDHFR did not impact S2P immunogenicity and no humoral or cellular immune response was detected against eDHFR in either species. In this work, we show that eDHFR can be used as an mRNA-encoded PET reporter gene to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA vaccine antigen expression in vivo. This technique could be applied in clinical translation of future mRNA vaccines or therapeutics. mRNA vaccines have been successfully developed, but a better understanding of in vivo distribution of the encoded antigen may aid further improvements.

Here, the authors characterise the dissemination of the virus in Chile and find evidence of sustained transmission between mammals. 
 Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) belonging to lineage 2.3.4.4b emerged in Chile in December 2022, leading to mass mortality events in wild birds, poultry, and marine mammals and one human case. We detected HPAIV in 7,33% (714/9745) of cases between December 2022–April 2023 and sequenced 177 H5N1 virus genomes from poultry, marine mammals, a human, and wild birds spanning >3800 km of Chilean coastline. Chilean viruses were closely related to Peru’s H5N1 outbreak, consistent with north-to-south spread down the Pacific coastline. One human virus and nine marine mammal viruses in Chile had the rare PB2 D701N mammalian-adaptation mutation and clustered phylogenetically despite being sampled 5 weeks and hundreds of kilometers apart. These viruses shared additional genetic signatures, including another mammalian PB2 adaptation (Q591K, n = 6), synonymous mutations, and minor variants. Several mutations were detected months later in sealions in the Atlantic coast, indicating that the pinniped outbreaks on the west and east coasts of South America are genetically linked. These data support sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAIV in marine mammals over thousands of kilometers of Chile’s Pacific coastline, which subsequently continued through the Atlantic coastline.

 Virtual library docking can reveal unexpected chemotypes that complement the structures of biological targets. Seeking agonists for the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R), we dock 74 million tangible molecules and prioritize 46 high ranking ones for de novo synthesis and testing. Nine are active by radioligand competition, a 20% hit-rate. Structure-based optimization of one of the most potent of these (Ki = 0.7 µM) leads to ‘1350, a 0.95 nM ligand and a full CB1R agonist of Gi/o signaling. A cryo-EM structure of ‘1350 in complex with CB1R-Gi1 confirms its predicted docked pose. The lead agonist is strongly analgesic in male mice, with a 2-20-fold therapeutic window over hypolocomotion, sedation, and catalepsy and no observable conditioned place preference. These findings suggest that unique cannabinoid chemotypes may disentangle characteristic cannabinoid side-effects from analgesia, supporting the further development of cannabinoids as pain therapeutics.

Here, authors introduce a fast approach using protein energy profiles for efficient comparison, revealing insights into protein relationships and enabling fast predictions with reduced computational cost. 
 In structural bioinformatics, the efficiency of predicting protein similarity, function, and evolutionary relationships is crucial. Our approach proposed herein leverages protein energy profiles derived from a knowledge-based potential, deviating from traditional methods relying on structural alignment or atomic distances. This method assigns unique energy profiles to individual proteins, facilitating rapid comparative analysis for both structural similarities and evolutionary relationships across various hierarchical levels. Our study demonstrates that energy profiles contain substantial information about protein structure at class, fold, superfamily, and family levels. Notably, these profiles accurately distinguish proteins across species, illustrated by the classification of coronavirus spike glycoproteins and bacteriocin proteins. Introducing a separation measure based on energy profile similarity, our method shows significant correlation with a network-based approach, emphasizing the potential of energy profiles as efficient predictors for drug combinations with faster computational requirements. Our key insight is that the sequence-based energy profile strongly correlates with structure-derived energy, enabling rapid and efficient protein comparisons based solely on sequences.

 The histone H3K36-specific methyltransferase ASH1L plays a critical role in development and is frequently dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer. Here, we report on the biological functions of the C-terminal region of ASH1L encompassing a bromodomain (ASH1LBD), a plant homeodomain (ASH1LPHD) finger, and a bromo-adjacent homology (ASH1LBAH) domain, structurally characterize these domains, describe their mechanisms of action, and explore functional crosstalk between them. We find that ASH1LPHD recognizes H3K4me2/3, whereas the neighboring ASH1LBD and ASH1LBAH have DNA binding activities. The DNA binding function of ASH1LBAH is a driving force for the association of ASH1L with the linker DNA in the nucleosome, and the large interface with ASH1LPHD stabilizes the ASH1LBAH fold, merging two domains into a single module. We show that ASH1L is involved in embryonic stem cell differentiation and co-localizes with H3K4me3 but not with H3K36me2 at transcription start sites of target genes and genome wide, and that the interaction of ASH1LPHD with H3K4me3 is inhibitory to the H3K36me2-specific catalytic activity of ASH1L. Our findings shed light on the mechanistic details by which the C-terminal domains of ASH1L associate with chromatin and regulate the enzymatic function of ASH1L. Mutations of the histone H3K36-specific methyltransferase ASH1L have been linked to several human diseases. Here, the authors report the mechanism by which three C-terminal domains in ASH1L regulate its enzymatic activity and interact with chromatin."

 Classical plume models offer insights into intraplate volcanism and seamount chain formation by assuming a cylindrical upwelling of hot materials from the core-mantle boundary. The interaction of mantle plumes with ridges or subducting slabs disrupts typical plate tectonics, leading to distinctive tectonic phenomena such as ridge jumps or slab stagnation. However, thermal plume models sometimes fall short in explaining perplexing tectonic features, necessitating consideration of compositional heterogeneities within mantle plumes. Here, using multimode waveform tomography, we identify a large, vertically divergent low-velocity anomaly in the upper mantle beneath the Coral Sea in the southwestern Pacific, which circumvents the remnants of subducting slabs toward northeastern Australia with intraplate volcanism, and the Woodlark rift, the most rapidly extending continental rift. Our findings furnish seismic evidence for the widespread propagation of a thermochemical mantle plume spanning over 10° at depths of 270–410 km, facilitating its simultaneous contacts with slabs and rifts.

 Fractured rock petrophysical studies rarely use temporal constraints, thus hindering fracture-related permeability and connectivity estimation during past geofluid migration. Here we present a conceptual approach, using a stochastic method incorporating absolute ages to reconstruct fracture arrays back in geological time. Generating ‘grown’ discrete fracture network models, we simulate the hydraulic behaviour of fractured rock volumes from the late-Cretaceous/Palaeocene to the Devonian, via progressive fracture back-stripping. We reveal that for the examined rock mass, maximum principal permeability increased through time from 9.47e-14 m2 to 4.44e-13 m2 (~3 orders of magnitude) along with the maximum horizontal permeability orientation shifting from NE-SW to NW-SE. Similarly, the connectivity metric increased with fracture saturation, peaking in the mid-Cretaceous. For comparison, dated offshore hydrocarbon secondary migration potentially coincides with our results. Back-stripping of time-constrained fracture sets is therefore a powerful method to investigate and quantify the dynamic evolution of petrophysical properties through geological time.

 Deep tectonic tremor occurs repeatedly at the base of a forearc mantle wedge corner, where a highly fluid-pressurized serpentinite shear zone is thought to develop. However, the deformation mechanisms that accommodate these tremors within the shear zone remain unclear. Here, we present observations of deformation experiments on water-saturated serpentinite conducted at pressure–temperature conditions relevant to the tremor zone. We find that increasing pore fluid pressure gradually decreases sample strength and leads to a transition in the deformation mechanism from frictional sliding on several fault surfaces to distributed extensional and extensional–shear fracturing. Combined with field observations of a shallow mantle-wedge-derived serpentinite shear zone, our experimental results suggest that numerous brittle failures developing simultaneously throughout the shear zone generate bursts of tectonic tremor. Furthermore, the recurrence interval of the tremors is likely controlled by the time required for the fractures to be hydrothermally sealed through serpentine precipitation.

 Close-range remote sensing technologies show great potential to support national forest inventories (NFIs). Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has performed especially well in recent studies, as it is capable of fast data acquisition while still delivering accurate information on NFI-relevant variables (e.g. tree position, diameter at breast height [DBH]). However, the performance of MLS acquisition under challenging conditions (e.g. steep terrain, dense understorey vegetation) has rarely been addressed. Here, on 29 NFI plots distributed over the entire country of Switzerland and representing various terrain and forest conditions, we evaluated the use and performance of handheld MLS acquisition, using a GeoSLAM ZebHorizon laser scanner, to deliver analysis-ready (with minimal occlusion) point clouds and to estimate primary tree variables such as tree position and DBH. Data acquisition was successful for all tested Swiss NFI plots. The average time needed for point cloud acquisition of a 50 × 50 m sample plot was 13.13 min. Over all tested NFI plots, we achieved a tree detection rate of 82.6%, with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.25%, a mean absolute error of 2.0 cm and a systematic prediction error (SPE) of 1.0 cm for DBH estimation. The terrain gradient had an especially strong influence on the accuracy of DBH estimation. Occlusion, as a metric for point cloud capacity to hold forest structural information for the entire canopy volume, was minimal when the suggested acquisition pattern was followed, at 9% on average for the entire canopy volume. However, the level of occlusion increased in the upper part of the canopy (> 10 m above ground), to 15% on average.Overall, handheld MLS effectively produced analysis-ready point clouds within the 15-minute acquisition time limitation for a 50 x 50 m area, even under challenging conditions, showing promise for future use in the Swiss NFI. However, the current accuracy of MLS-estimated forest variables like DBH and tree detection is insufficient to replace conventional measurements within an established NFI. Despite this, estimating NFI-relevant variables, even with lower accuracy, and expanding the area of measured tree variables could improve information on forest functions and services (e.g., protection and biodiversity), currently not possible to derive from NFI data due to the limited plot size. In the future, MLS-acquired point clouds could (1) shift from expert-assessed to more quantitative and reproducible variable estimation, and (2) enhance NFI with variables difficult to measure conventionally. This could open new pathways for assessing and monitoring forest structural diversity nationally and provide valuable calibration and validation data for large-scale forest assessments from airborne or space-borne acquisitions."

 Terrestrial sediment transport through large rivers exerts a significant impact on coastal morphology, marine ecosystems, and human livelihoods. Accurately measuring these sediment discharges has long been a challenge. Traditional in-situ methods fall short of providing comprehensive and continuous assessments of sediment dynamics due to spatiotemporal and economic constraints. While remote sensing techniques using satellite imagery have offered valuable insights into sediment transportation and deposition, their scope is primarily restricted to observing suspended sediment loads rather than total loads. Sediment accumulation at river margins will cause gravity increases observable by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GFO) missions. Previous efforts to observe sediment signals lacked proper corrections for various GRACE/GFO issues, including leakage of signals from surrounding land, variations in nearby ocean mass, and noise levels that typically exceed sediment signal magnitudes. In this study, we develop a new approach to obtain a satellite gravity estimate of sediment accumulation along the Amazon coast where the largest amount of sediment deposition is expected. We address limitations in previous studies using three steps: Forward modeling to suppress leakage of signal from land to oceans; adjusting ocean mass change via the sea level equation; and filtering using empirical orthogonal functions. The estimated accumulation rate of sediment on the Amazon continental shelf is approximately 1301 Mtons per year for the period June 2002 to May 2023. This estimate is slightly higher than the results from field-based studies, which fall in the range 550 to 1030 Mtons per year."

 Flood disasters are characterized by frequent and sudden occurrences and obvious chain effects, posing a major threat to agricultural production. Government disaster relief and agricultural insurance are increasingly urgent in assessing losses to flood-damaged farmland. There are many challenges in assessing flood-damaged farmland. On the one hand, the historical data needed for the farmland loss assessment model is missing. On the other hand, the farmland loss assessment conducted within the flood inundation area only focuses on the completely submerged farmland, which is not accurate enough. Semi-supervised deep learning can effectively alleviate the above problems. This study specifically designed a fine-grained change detection model for flood-damaged farmland using medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images to achieve multi-scenario change detection of flood-damaged farmland. In order to assist in the automatic sample generation of large-scale unlabeled sample RS images of flood status, a semi-supervised sample generation framework for flood-damaged farmland using medium-resolution RS images is proposed. Based on this framework, FloodedCropland datasets is created. The experimental results show that the proposed change detection model has an F1-score of 0.9047 on flood-damaged farmland. After the semi-supervised sample generation framework optimized the model, the change detection F1-score was improved to 0.9241. Experiments have verified that the automatic generation of labels for flood-damaged farmland in medium-resolution RS images using a semi-supervised sample generation framework performs better than the scarce manual labeling model and can save a lot of manual labeling time. The consistent performance in different geographic regions and under different RS satellites imaging conditions demonstrate the practical application potential of this method for cross-regional and cross-RS satellites intelligent information extraction in natural disaster scenes with a lack of labeled samples."

 The spatiotemporal characteristics of remote sensing data are often time-varying, leading to significant fluctuation and instability in tree species classification results across different years, especially in regions referred to as high-variance areas. To improve the stability and accuracy of the classification results, this study proposes a lightweight spatiotemporal classification framework, with the core algorithm being the Spatiotemporal Entropy-based Change Resistance Filter (STECR-F) algorithm. The STECR-F algorithm integrates the concept of Spatiotemporal Entropy (STE) and, by applying weighted spatiotemporal neighborhood information, suppresses uncertainty in the classification process. It effectively enhances the spatiotemporal consistency of the classification results, particularly in high-variance regions, and reduces classification instability caused by spatiotemporal fluctuations. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of STECR-F from three dimensions: STE, transfer change, and classification accuracy, and compares it with other methods. The results show that STECR-F significantly reduces the STE value, with an average decrease of 0.3876, effectively mitigating the fluctuation of the classification results. In high-variance regions, the effect of STECR-F is particularly pronounced, with an average decrease in STE value of up to 0.6847. Moreover, STECR-F significantly suppresses random transitions between classes, reducing category transitions by an average of 22.47%, with the maximum reduction reaching 46%. In terms of classification accuracy, STECR-F achieved an overall accuracy of 91.35%, representing an improvement of 8.02% compared to the results without using STECR-F. Additionally, compared to the DMSPN method using only neighborhood information and pattern filtering, STECR-F’s performance improved by 5.86% and 6.42%, respectively. Overall, the STECR-F algorithm effectively addresses the interannual dynamics and uncertainty in tree species classification results. By integrating weighted spatiotemporal neighborhood information, it significantly enhances classification stability and reduces random variability, making it particularly suitable for areas with high spatiotemporal variability and classification uncertainty."

This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), as enhancing cytosolic NAD+regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner.

However, current AWW projections from state-of-the-art climate models carry uncertainties. Using observational datasets and CMIP6 model simulations, we demonstrate that the observed historical global warming trend and the climatological mean pattern of Arctic sea ice can serve as effective constraints on AWW projections. Under SSP2-4.5, the constrained warming by the end of the century is reduced from 5.5° to 4.6°C. Similarly, the projected wetting decreases from 6.8 to 5.7 millimeter per month. The inter-model spread in warming and wetting is reduced by 25 and 15%, respectively. The reduction is the largest in the Barents-Kara seas, reducing warming by 1.2°C, lessening wetting by 1.7 millimeter per month, and decreasing the inter-model spread by one-third. Our findings suggest that unconstrained CMIP6 projections overestimate future AWW, particularly in the Barents-Kara seas, due to an overestimation of historical global warming and excessive sea ice in the models."

However, how individual subunits within tetramers control channel functionality remains unresolved. Here, we investigate (i) whether opening of KCNQ2 channels requires a concerted step or can result from independent subunit activation and (ii) how individual subunits regulate gate opening and conductance. The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement. Channel opening is allosteric and requires activation of only a single subunit, which can accentuate the influence of clinically relevant heterozygous mutations at threshold voltages."

On mitochondria, voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) interacts with BAK and BAX through a common interface to inhibit BAK or to facilitate BAX apoptotic activity. We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism. Loss of BAX drives resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in some leukemias. WEHI-3773 overcomes this resistance by promoting BAK-mediated killing. This work highlights the coordination of BAX and BAK apoptotic activity through interaction with VDAC2 that may be targeted therapeutically."

Here, RNA-seq displayed that the expression of GPR132 was reduced in activated NK cells, and the proportion of mature NK cells in GPR132−/−mice was substantially increased compared to WT mice, with stronger anti-melanoma capabilities. Further investigation indicates that GPR132-deficient NK92 cells expressed more GzmB and IFN-γ and exhibited stronger cytotoxicity. Mechanically, GPR132 regulates NK cell function through the CSK/ZAP70/NF-κB signaling axis. Down-regulation of GPR132 weakens the inhibition of NK cell function by lactate, thereby enhancing the functional execution of CAR-NK cells against colorectal cancer.

We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in literacy and numeracy skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Our empirical approach separates age from cohort effects and corrects for measurement error from reversion to the mean. Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy."

Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD.

However, the controlled synthesis of 2D OLHs with in-plane tunable emission remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in the sequential integration of multiple components. Here, a cascaded strategy is demonstrated for the hierarchical assembly of OLHs with in-plane multicolor emission, from red-blue and red-green to lateral red-green-blue (RGB), with a lateral size of ~15 micrometers. The tunable regions of 2D OLHs are realized by synergistic effects of the molecular doping method and the photo-induced oxidation route during the epitaxial growth process. The obtained OLHs can actively achieve full-spectrum light transport from 420 to 720 nanometers depending on different excitation positions and thus function as multimode RGB signal converters.

Facultative diapause occurs under conditions of maternal metabolic stress such as nursing. While molecular mechanisms of diapause have been studied, a natural inducing factor has yet to be identified. Here, we show that oxytocin induces embryonic diapause in mice. We show that gestational delays were triggered during nursing or optogenetic stimulation of oxytocin neurons simulating nursing patterns. Mouse blastocysts express oxytocin receptors, and oxytocin induced delayed implantation-like dispersion in cultured embryos. Last, oxytocin receptor–knockout embryos transferred into wild-type surrogates had low survival rates during diapause. Our results indicate that oxytocin coordinates timing of embryonic development with uterine progression through pregnancy, providing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for ensuring successful reproduction."

Here, we investigated the impact of HLA diversity on the control of posttransplant BKPyV replication. High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses."

However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream.

Aging preferentially changed gene expression on the X’s relative to autosomes. Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory. Expression of the Xi escapeePlp1, a myelin component, was increased in the aging hippocampus of female mice and parahippocampus of women.

While the transition to motherhood has recently been recognized as one of the most neuroplastic periods in adulthood, no study has yet explored whether the hippocampus and amygdala change during the peripartum in relation to childbirth experience and perinatal depression symptoms. In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala. A more challenging birth experience was associated with bilateral increases in hippocampal volume.

This also allows  annual residential emissions to be projected before official publications. 
 The combustion of fossil and biofuels in the residential sector can cause high background levels of air pollutants in winter but also pollution peaks during cold periods. Its emissions are dominated by space heating and show strong daily variations linked to changes in outside temperatures. The heating degree day (HDD) approach allows daily variations in space heating emissions to be represented. The method depends on a temperature threshold (“Tb”) below which building heating is activated and a fraction (“f”) considering the relative contribution of space heating to total residential combustion emissions. These parameters are fixed in the literature. However, they are likely to vary according to the country and pollutant. Using statistics on household energy consumption, we provide country- and species-dependent Tb and f parameters to derive daily temporal factors distributing PM and NOx emissions from the residential sector in the EU 27. Tested in the CHIMERE model, the simulations show better performance scores (temporal correlation and threshold exceedance detection) in winter, especially for PM, when compared to the simulation with a monthly temporal factor, or based on HDDs but using fixed parameters from the literature. Finally, the HDDs with fitted parameters are used as a method to project official annual residential combustion emissions in subsequent years, as these are typically reported with a 2-year time lag. Results show that this method performs better regarding the persistence method and remains within emission uncertainties for both PM and NOx emissions, indicating the importance of considering HDDs for air quality forecasting."

We found that 23.4 % of global cropland is irrigated, with the most extensive areas in India, China, the United States, and Pakistan. We identified the distribution of central pivot systems commonly used in the United States and Saudi Arabia. This new map can better support water management and food security globally. 
 Irrigation accounts for the major form of human water consumption and plays a pivotal role in enhancing crop yields and mitigating the effects of drought. Accurate mapping of irrigation distribution is essential for effective water resource management and the assessment of food security. However, the resolution of the global irrigated cropland map is coarse, typically approximately 10 km, and it lacks regular updates. In our study, we present a robust methodology that leverages irrigation performance during drought stress as an indicator of crop productivity and water consumption to identify global irrigated cropland. Within each irrigation mapping zone (IMZ), we identified the dry months of the growing season from 2017 to 2019 or the driest months from 2010 to 2019. To delineate irrigated cropland, we utilized the collected samples to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds for the dry months of 2017 to 2019 and the NDVI deviation from the 10-year average for the driest month. By integrating the most accurate results from these two methods, we generated the Global Maximum Irrigation Extent dataset at 100 m resolution (GMIE-100), achieving an overall accuracy of 83.6 % ± 0.6 %. The GMIE-100 reveals that the maximum extent of irrigated cropland encompasses 403.17 ± 9.82 Mha, accounting for 23.4 % ± 0.6 % of the global cropland. Concentrated in fertile plains and regions adjacent to major rivers, the largest irrigated cropland areas are found in India, China, the United States, and Pakistan, which rank first to fourth, respectively. Importantly, the spatial resolution of GMIE-100 surpasses that of the dominant irrigation map, offering more detailed information essential to support estimates of agricultural water use and regional food security assessments. Furthermore, with the help of the deep learning (DL) method, the global central pivot irrigation system (CPIS) was identified using Pivot-Net, a novel convolutional neural network built on the U-net architecture. We found that there is 11.5 ± 0.01 Mha of CPIS, accounting for approximately 2.90 % ± 0.03 % of the total irrigated cropland. In Namibia, the United States, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Canada, and Zambia, the CPIS proportion was greater than 10 %. To our knowledge, this is the inaugural study to undertake a global identification of specific irrigation methods, with a focus on the CPIS.

Our models show what a commercial-scale CO2 injection would look like in a marine environment. We discuss what would need to be considered when designing a subsea CO2 injection. 
 Safe and secure carbon dioxide (CO2) storage is likely to be critical for mitigating some of the most dangerous effects of climate change. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in activity associated with reservoir characterization and site selection for large-scale CO2 storage projects across the globe. These prospective storage sites tend to be selected for their optimal structural, petrophysical, and geochemical trapping potential. However, it has also been suggested that storing CO2 in reservoirs within the CO2 hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), characterized by high pressures and low temperatures (e.g., Arctic or marine environments), could provide a natural thermodynamic barrier to gas leakage.  Evaluating the prospect of commercial-scale, long-term storage of CO2 in the GHSZ requires reservoir-scale modeling capabilities designed to account for the unique physics and thermodynamics associated with these systems. We have developed the HYDRATE flow mode and the accompanying fully implicit parallel well model in the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model CO2 injection into the marine GHSZ. We have applied these capabilities to a set of CO2 injection scenarios designed to reveal the challenges and opportunities for commercial-scale CO2 storage in the GHSZ."

Our analysis shows that hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H2DRI) provides a cost-effective decarbonization strategy only under a relatively narrow set of conditions. Using today’s best estimates of the capital and variable costs of alternative decarbonized iron and steelmaking technologies in a U.S. economy-wide simulation framework, we find that carbon capture technologies can achieve comparable decarbonization levels by 2050 and greater cumulative emissions reductions from iron and steel production at a lower cost. Simulations suggest hydrogen contributes to economy-wide decarbonization, but H2DRI is not the preferred use case for hydrogen in most scenarios. The average abatement cost for U.S. iron and steel production could be as low as $70/tonne CO2 with existing technologies plus carbon capture, while the cost with H2DRI rises to over $500/tonne CO2. We also find that IRA tax credits are insufficient to spur hydrogen use in steelmaking in our model and that a green steel production tax credit would need to be as high as $300/tonne steel to lead to sustained H2DRI use."

Here, we promote the bond activation of oxygen in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and carbon in graphite electrodes, achieving rapid gasification and thermal decomposition of active crystals at lower temperatures in the absence of other activating agents. The activation of C and O bond leads to the storage of internal energy and the transition of the crystalline phase (single crystal to polycrystal) of the active crystals. Density functional theory modeling confirms that the CO adsorption energy is significantly higher with Ca–Oa (−3.35 eV, C and O activation) than with no activation (−1.66 eV). The differential charge results show that the bond activation model has the highest charge accumulation and consumption, improving the electron transfer. The Bader charge transfer between Ca–Oa and CO is also the largest, with a value of 0.433 |e|. Therefore, synchronous activation of C and O bonds can reduce the decomposition temperature of active crystals by 200 °C and allows a low-temperature pyrolysis recycling of retired LIB cathode materials.

The selectivity of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation and its contribution to eARGs degradation were both >98%. This targeting strategy of oxidizing guanines with low ionization potentials by 1O2 allowed 7 log eARGs degradation within 10 min and eliminated their transformation within 2 min, outperforming most reported advanced oxidation processes.

However, the efficiency of the conventional bulk-phase UV/H2O2 system is limited by the low yield and utilization of •OH, in turn necessitating high UV energy input and long purification period. In this study, we present an innovative UV/H2O2 microdroplet system for enhanced pollutant degradation. The degradation of pollutants in sprayed microdroplets was accelerated by 8.5–63.3-fold compared to those in bulk water, demonstrating universal effectiveness across a range of pollutant types and diverse aqueous matrices. This enhancement stems from elevated •OH production at the air–water interface due to the enhanced UV absorbance of H2O2. The production of •OH in the microdroplet system was 45-fold higher than that in bulk water, facilitating rapid •OH-mediated pollutant degradation. Moreover, pollutants accumulate at the air–water interface, where •OH is concentrated, leading to higher utilization of •OH for mediating pollutant degradation before quenching. Our findings provide a solution to overcome the bottlenecks in •OH production and utilization, offering insights for improving the efficiency of UV/H2O2 water treatment systems."

With OM being the major binding surface across most soils, the affinity parameters (log Ki) were most influential.

Yet, how wildfires alter the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) as a critical parameter determining the C efflux from burned landscapes remains unknown. We conducted a field survey and two confirmatory experiments in two fire-prone regions of China at <1, 3, 6, and 12 months after wildfires (n = 160 soil samples). We found that wildfire generally reduced the Q10 for soil organic and mineral horizons within the first year after wildfire mainly due to substrate depletion, which was confirmed by a uniform inoculation experiment. Mineral protection of organic matter in the mineral horizon rich in iron/aluminum (hydr)oxides and a near-neutral pH in organic horizons of postfire soils further suppressed the Q10. Decreased Q10 persisted in organic horizons even after removing substrate limitation, reflecting the dominance of a thermally adapted, r-strategist microbial community in postfire soils. Moreover, fire-induced low C quality increased Q10, which supported the C quality-temperature hypothesis, but a C-limited condition restricted this stimulatory effect. This study illustrates that a thermal compensatory response of Rh will help maintain C stocks in forest ecosystems after wildfires in a warming world."

All samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry and a bioassay for estrogen receptor agonism. Target compounds included disinfection byproducts, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), trace elements, and compounds selected for their possible relation to breast cancer. Over 7500 GC and LC nontargeted molecular features passed all quality control filters in each sampling season and were prioritized for identification if they were related to measured estrogen receptor agonism or were present at higher levels in areas with high breast cancer incidence (n = 1036). Benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid, acetyl tributyl citrate, and diphenyl sulfone were among the prioritized and confirmed nontarget compounds. Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and two ketone derivatives displayed significant negative correlations with estrogen receptor agonism.

This study found low concentrations (ca. 10s–100s particles kilogram–1 sediment or 20–200 × 104 items meter–3 wet sediment) and negligible correlations between analyzed deposit constituents (R2 for grain size = −0.14 to 0.12, organic content = 0.08, water depth = −0.11, distance to shore = −0.14). The highly dynamic role of wind-driven mixing and openness to the Gulf of Mexico leads to the high flushing rate of sediment and microplastics out of the bays. Larger microplastic particles (fragments: 178 ± 93 μm, fibers: 0.5 to 2.0 mm) were consistently deposited with finer sediments, indicating high transportability.

Plant operators rely heavily on observations of filtration performance from noisy sensor data to assess membrane fouling conditions and lab-based protocols for plant maintenance, often leading to inaccurate estimations of future performance and delayed membrane cleaning. This challenge is further compounded by the difficulty in integrating existing complex mechanistic models with the Internet of Things (IoT) systems of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). By harnessing data obtained from WWTPs, along with innovative data denoising and model training strategies, we developed a machine learning application (MBR-Net) that is capable of forecasting membrane fouling, as indicated by permeability, for a full-scale submerged MBR plant in real time. We show that the trained model can effectively predict one-day-ahead changes in irreversible fouling under different desired fluxes, cleaning conditions and feedwater conditions (with MAPE < 6.45%, MAE < 3.71 LMH bar–1, and R2 > 0.87 on two independent testing sets).

This study investigated the initial phase of PFAS contamination in concrete, focusing on factors influencing PFAS retention and penetration. Laboratory experiments assessed the uptake kinetics of PFAS into concrete over one year, revealing that PFAS penetrated beyond surface layers, as confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry and desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging. PFAS mass loss into the concrete was limited, with 0.99% to 18.5% (mean 6.6%) of initial spiked PFAS being retained. Uptake behaviors were influenced by PFAS chain length and chemistry, concrete surface characteristics, as well as wetting/drying cycles, which accelerated PFAS penetration through the wick effect. Damaged concrete surfaces also showed faster PFAS penetration due to the exposed interfacial transition zones. Field-impacted concrete samples from Canada revealed some similar migration trends with lab-exposed concrete, with shorter-chain PFAS exhibiting greater mobility in the concrete matrix, though notable differences were observed between field and lab samples. These findings highlight the complex dynamics of PFAS contamination in concrete and provide insights into factors affecting PFAS penetration and retention."

Thus, the traditional EDC in vitro screening processes often require a battery of bioassays to cover multiple target pathways. Here we developed an endocrine-enhanced reduced human transcriptome (ERHT) focused on hormone receptor signaling induced by the EDCs regulating specific genes. ERHT was developed based on 1200 prioritized genes covering 110 endocrine-related biological pathways across eight potential adverse outcomes. The ability of this approach to identify EDCs was derived from machine learning of 1068 dose-dependent transcriptome profiles and enhanced by quantifying chemical-induced critical pathway responses, and thus, it demonstrated excellent classification performance (AUC = 0.84 ± 0.03) in internal cross-validation. We ultimately applied this approach to known EDCs and inactive substances to validate the reliability of this approach. Through external validation on 210 chemicals, the extrapolation accuracy exceeded 80%, demonstrating the outstanding practical performance of this approach. Meanwhile, the pathway responses induced by the same chemical were consistent with the experimental results reported by multiple sequencing platforms, highlighting the robustness of this approach.

The probability of PhAC detection (above limits of quantification) in larvae was relatively constant throughout the exposure time, while in adults, it was lower at the beginning with a subsequent increase. The total concentration of detected PhACs was highest in larvae of Limnephilus spp. and lowest in larvae of S. aestivalis, decreasing similarly in the adults of all three species. Significant differences in the composition of PhACs with different levels of changes after emergence were detected between species. Only telmisartan was detected in all species and life stages. Sertraline and its active metabolite norsertraline exhibited significantly higher relative concentrations in caddisfly adults compared to larvae. Apart from the bioconcentration factor, increasing biodegradation half-life was the second-best predictor of increased PhAC concentration in adults compared to larvae.

Reasons for differences in fire patterns can be difficult to determine due to variable vegetation types, land use patterns, fuel conditions, and human influences on fire ignition and suppression. This study compares burned areas to climate and fuel conditions in three temperate regions: the desert, shrub, and forest ecoregions of western North America, west‐central Europe, and southwestern South America. In each region the mean annual aridity index (AI, precipitation over potential evapotranspiration) spans arid to humid climates. We examined how the fraction of area burned from 2001 to 2021 varied with mean annual AI, mean aboveground biomass, and land cover type distributions. All three regions had low fractions of area burned for the driest climate zones (AI < 0.5), a sign of fuel limitation to burned area. Fraction of area burned increased with mean aboveground biomass for these dry zones. Fraction of area burned peaked at intermediate AI (0.7–1.5) for all regions and declined again in the wettest climate zones (AI > 1.5), a sign of climate limitation to burned area. Of the three regions, western North America had the highest burned area, fraction of area burned, and fire sizes.

This cycle is well reproduced by a barotropic model, forced with the tidal potential and the atmosphere only. This suggests a minor role of the stratification.

We simulated five‐member ensembles of historical hindcasts and experiments representing the storms in the future using the pseudo‐global warming method.

 Recent evidence shows elevated circulating long-chain ceramide levels predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases."

 The generation and dynamics of plasmon-induced hot carriers in gold nanoparticles offer crucial insights into nonequilibrium states for energy applications, yet the underlying mechanisms remain experimentally elusive. Here, we leverage ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to directly capture hot carrier dynamics with sub-50 fs temporal resolution, providing clear evidence of plasmon decay mechanisms. We observe the sequential processes of Landau damping (~25 fs) and hot carrier thermalization (~1.5 ps), identifying hot carrier formation as a significant decay pathway. Energy distribution measurements reveal carriers in non-Fermi-Dirac states persisting beyond 500 fs and observe electron populations exceeding single-photon excitation energy, indicating the role of an Auger heating mechanism alongside traditional impact excitation. These findings deepen the understanding of hot carrier behavior under localized surface plasmon resonance, offering valuable implications for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and phototherapy. This work establishes a methodological framework for studying hot carrier dynamics, opening avenues for optimizing energy transfer processes in nanoscale plasmonic systems.

Here, authors enhance MicroED data quality using energy filtering, achieving sub-atomic resolution protein data and uncovering diffuse scattering, offering detailed insights into protein structure and function. 
 High-resolution information is important for accurate structure modeling but is challenging to attain in macromolecular crystallography due to the rapid fading of diffracted intensities at increasing resolution. While direct electron detection essentially eliminates the read-out noise during MicroED data collection, other sources of noise remain and limit the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections. Inelastic scattering significantly contributes to noise, raising background levels and broadening diffraction peaks. We demonstrate a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio by using energy filtering to remove inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy results in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling the visualization of detailed structural features. Interestingly, reducing the noise further reveals diffuse scattering that may hold additional structural information. Our findings suggest that combining energy filtering and direct detection provides more accurate measurements at higher resolution, facilitating precise model refinement and improved insights into protein structure and function.

 The role of meteorite impacts in the origin, modification, and destruction of crust during the first two billion years of Earth history (4.5–2.5 billion years ago; Ga) is disputed. Whereas some argue for a relatively minor contribution overall, others have proposed that individual giant impactors (>10–50 km diameter) can initiate subduction zones and deep mantle plumes, arguably triggering a chain of events that formed cratons, the ancient nuclei of the continents. The uncertainty is compounded by the seeming absence of impact structures older than 2.23 Ga, such that the evidence for the terrestrial impact flux in the Hadean and Archaean eons is circumstantial. Here, we report the discovery of shatter cones in a complex, dominantly metasedimentary layer, the Antarctic Creek Member (ACM), in the centre of the East Pilbara Terrane, Western Australia, which provide unequivocal evidence for a hypervelocity meteorite impact. The shocked rocks of the crater floor are overlain by (unshocked) carbonate breccias and pillow lavas, stratigraphically constraining the age of the impact to 3.47 Ga and confirming discovery of the only Archaean crater known thus far.

 Frequency transfer is a key challenge in machine learning as it allows researchers to go beyond in-range analyses of spectrum properties towards out-of-the-range predictions. Traditionally, to predict properties at a specific frequency, targeted spectrum is included in training data for a deep neural network (DNN). However, due to limitations of measurement or computation source, training data at some frequencies are hardly accessible, especially for multi-physics problems. In this work, we propose a multi-physics deep learning framework (MDLF) consisting of a multi-fidelity DeepONet, a Euler latent dynamic network, and a data-analytical inversion network. Without the knowledge about multi-physics response, MDLF is successfully generalized to unseen frequency bands for both parametric and free-form metasurface by dynamically utilizing a Euler latent space and single-physics information. Moreover, an inversion method is introduced to incorporate hybrid a priori in inverse design of metasurface. Under EM-thermal coupling, we verify the proposed MDLF numerically and experimentally.

 Water-ice prospecting is a crucial step in unlocking the Moon’s potential for supporting human habitat and furthering exploration. Lunar Temperatures not only dictate water-ice, but also drive other aspects of science and exploration.

The surface peak temperature of 355 K from ChaSTE is higher than expected(330 K) owing to its deployment on a sunward illuminated local slope region of 6°. This demonstrates that local topography at metre scales can alter temperature at high latitudes, unlike equatorial regions. Numerical model calculations using ChaSTE measurements, suggest that larger poleward facing slopes(>14°) at high latitudes can harbour water-ice, making them promising and technically less challenging sites for future lunar exploration and habitation.

 Satellite-based precipitation products have significantly advanced applications in hydrology, climate science, and related fields. Despite the significant role of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission in monitoring global precipitation dynamics over the past decade, its performance on sub-daily time scales remains insufficiently explored on a global scale. This study provides a continental assessment of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) V07B Final Run using extensive hourly ground observations across contiguous United States (CONUS), West Europe, and East Asia. The results demonstrate that IMERG captures precipitation amounts with reasonable accuracy, yielding a median Kling–Gupta efficiency of 0.31 and a median relative bias of 7 %. This bias is primarily attributed to overestimated precipitation frequency and underestimated intensity. However, its performance varies significantly with seasons, land surface attributes, and precipitation types, with better performance generally observed in spring and fall, as well as in temperate and humid climates, and low-altitude regions. While IMERG performs well in detecting moderate precipitation, it struggles with drizzle and moderate-to-extreme events, particularly those exceeding 5 mm/h. Additionally, diurnal performance variability is evident, with the highest accuracy observed in the morning (0600–0900) and the lowest in the afternoon (1400–1700). These findings underscore the variable performance of IMERG and highlight the need for further improvements, especially in capturing extreme precipitation in regions with complex geo-topographic conditions."

 Fire severity is closely linked to ecosystem responses. As climate change increases the frequency of severe fires, large-scale fire severity monitoring has become increasingly important. The traditional bitemporal approach, which compares single pre- and post-fire images to map fire severity, is effective at local scales but less efficient for larger-scale assessments. Recent advances in compositing multiple images have improved large-scale mapping; however, the effects of compositing parameters on mapping accuracy remain poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of compositing parameters on composite-based fire severity maps derived from Landsat images across summer fires at multiple scales. At the large scale, we analysed fires in the Iberian Peninsula (2000−2023); at the medium scale, fires in a Mediterranean region of Spain (1985–2015), validated with national statistics; and at the local scale, two fires with field-based severity data. Various compositing parameters were tested, including the period for selecting pre- and post-fire images: lag timing (initial vs. extended assessment), seasonal timing (summer-summer, spring-summer, and summer-autumn), and the criteria for determining pre- and post-fire pixel values (mean-mean, max-min, and mean-min). Accuracy was assessed using the optimality index, correlation with the bitemporal approach, and alignment with field-based severity data, depending on the scale. Both the compositing period and criteria significantly influenced the accuracy of severity maps. In Mediterranean landscapes, the highest accuracy was achieved using post-fire imagery from the same year as the fire, whereas in alpine areas, it was achieved using post-fire imagery from the year after the fire. Seasonally consistent pre- and post-fire images acquired during summer also improved accuracy. The optimal compositing criteria varied depending on the lag timing: mean-min and max-min were most effective for assessing fire severity shortly after the fire, whereas mean-mean performed better for assessments conducted one year later. This study highlights the importance of carefully selecting compositing parameters based on the ecological characteristics of the study area. Additionally, it presents a scalable, automated methodology for large-scale fire severity mapping using Google Earth Engine, which can be applied to larger regions with appropriate adjustments to the compositing parameters."

 Spatiotemporal fusion of multisource remote sensing data offers a viable way for precise and dynamic Earth monitoring. However, existing methods struggle with reliable spatiotemporal fusion in two commonly occurring yet complex scenarios: drastic surface changes, such as those caused by natural disasters and human activities, and poor image quality, which caused by thick cloud cover, cloud shadows, haze and noise. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Reliable deep learning-based spatiotemporal Fusion framework (RealFusion), designed to blend Landsat and MODIS imagery to generate daily seamless Landsat-like imagery. ReadFusion enhances fusion reliability through several advancements: (1) integrating diverse input data with complementary information, (2) implementing task decoupled architectures, (3) developing advanced restoration and fusion networks, (4) adopting adaptive training strategy, (5) and establishing a comprehensive accuracy assessment framework. Extensive experiments, comprising 25 trials in three distinct areas, demonstrate that RealFusion outperforms four methods proposed in recent years (Object-Level Hybrid SpatioTemporal Fusion Method, OL-HSTFM; Enhanced Deep Convolutional Spatiotemporal Fusion Network, EDCSTFN; Generative Adversarial Network-based SpatioTemporal Fusion Model, GAN-STFM; and Multilevel Feature Fusion with Generative Adversarial Network, MLFF-GAN).

 Soil texture is an essential attribute of soil structure, which plays an important role in evaluating soil fertility and carrying out agricultural production. This study developed a novel soil texture estimation model using ZiYuan-1-02D (ZY1-02D) satellite Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI), based on the mechanism of soil spectral mixing, that enables simultaneous estimation of the three soil texture attributes (clay, silt, and sand). Study area is located in the north-eastern region of China covering 1683.31 km2. To reduce data redundancy, we used correlation analysis and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) algorithms to select sensitive spectral features of soil texture, and excluded spectral bands that are strongly influenced by other soil physicochemical properties. Finally, the spatial distribution map and classification map of soil texture have been generated for the study area. We also used AHSI/GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite images to further validate the generalizability of the model. The results suggest that the model can be used in the estimation of soil texture, and the developed novel model can effectively reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of surface soil texture attributes. The R2 values of all outcomes for inverting three texture attributes were larger than 0.5, with silt exhibiting the best estimation effect (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 6.46 %, RPD = 2.19).

 The p-Median Problem (PMP) is a classical discrete facility location problem with significant implications for optimizing the placement of urban public service facilities. Improved heuristics, a well-established method for solving the PMP, aim to iteratively enhance solution quality through efficient neighborhood exploration. In this study, we model the neighborhood exploration process as a Markov decision process and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach to solving the PMP, achieving higher problem-solving efficiency and quality. The proposed method introduces an encoder-decoder structure, consisting of an Interactive Attention Encoder (IAE), a Node Removal Decoder (NRD), and a Node Insertion Decoder (NID), aimed at learning an optimal strategy for node selection. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms genetic algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. While the solution time is slightly longer than that of the Attention Model (AM), our method achieves a reduced gap to the optimal solution. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the proposed adaptive interactive encoder and the two decoders significantly enhance the model performance. Finally, we applied the Adaptive Interactive Attention Model (AIAM) to a real-world scenario, demonstrating its practical utility in guiding medical facility location decisions."

 Deep learning methods for classification have achieved significant advancements in processing 3D point clouds. A fundamental aspect of deep learning networks is how to best aggregate features into a global representation of the point cloud. While many existing networks rely on the traditional max-pooling for feature aggregation due to its efficiency and permutation-invariance, max-pooling has some limitations. It is a fixed operation, lacking learnability and adaptability, which restricts the network’s ability to capture the most informative global feature representation. This limitation motivates for developing a new feature aggregation method that generates a richer and more diverse feature representation. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel pooling operation, the Weighted Activation Pooling (WAP) module. WAP adds adaptability to the pooling operation by using learnable weights to dynamically adjust the importance of the pooled features. Features are further transformed through different activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and relations in the data. The WAP module is a plug-and-play module that can replace the traditional pooling operation in existing networks, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, this paper introduces the AdaptNet classification network, where the proposed WAP module is used to obtain global features. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate AdaptNet using both real-world data and the ModelNet40 dataset. Results show that AdaptNet outperforms other networks, achieving higher overall accuracy on both datasets. Moreover, WAP is integrated into existing classification networks, and experiments using real-world data show an increased performance of all tested networks compared to using their original pooling strategy."

 Airborne hyperspectral systems can provide high-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) covering large scenes, enabling fine-grained land-cover classification. However, the most popular patch-based methods are limited by low computational efficiency and broken classification results, which hinders the full utilization of this powerful technology in Earth observation applications. Therefore, in this paper, considering the efficiency requirements for large-scale land-cover classification, a novel patch-free approach based on a Transformer-CNN hybrid (PatchOut) framework is proposed. The proposed PatchOut framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, enabling rapid semantic segmentation for HSI classification. For the encoder module, we introduce a computationally efficient reduced Transformer module integrated with convolutional neural network (CNN), to leverage their complementary strengths for long-range and local feature extraction, respectively. A multi-scale spatial-spectral feature fusion (MSSSFF) module is also proposed to amalgamate the characteristics of different levels from the encoder, which enhances the overall feature representation. Then, to address the loss of semantic detail and resolution inherent in multi-level feature extraction, a novel feature reconstruction module (FRM) is applied to recover high-quality semantic features. Finally, a large-scale benchmark dataset, Qingpu-HSI, is presented, comprising airborne HSIs covering 33.91 km2 with 20 land-cover classes. Experiments on the Qingpu-HSI and another public dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of our proposed PatchOut framework, outperforming several well-known patch-free and patch-based methods. The Qingpu HSI dataset, along with the PatchOut framework code will be released at https://github.com/busbyjrj/PatchOut."

 Accurate and fine-grained precipitation nowcasting holds paramount importance for weather-dependent decision-making and is facing escalating expectations and challenges. While researchers have notably advanced precipitation nowcasting using deep learning (DL) models with larger sizes and more complicated structures, there is scarce research exploring the potential improvement from employing radar data with higher spatial resolutions—a hundred-meter scale rather than a kilometer scale. To evaluate the improvement of higher-resolution data, two U-Net architecture-based models, one larger and another smaller, were designed and trained with radar data at different spatial resolutions—1000 m, 500 m, and 100 m. Their effectiveness was examined by comparison to two baseline models. The models trained with diverse resolutions of data underwent comparative evaluation through two specific precipitation cases. The results unveil a positive correlation between the precipitation nowcasting performance and the spatial resolution of radar data. Models trained with higher-resolution data demonstrate superior forecasting accuracy, reduced bias, and enhanced spatial alignment between predictions and observations. Higher-resolution data empowers DL models to capture boundaries and local-scale patterns of convective systems more accurately, thereby improving the performance in precipitation nowcasting. More importantly, the comparison indicates that to further promote the performance of DL-based precipitation nowcasting, improving data resolution is more efficient than expanding model size. The use of high-resolution data diminishes computational and development costs by concurrently reducing the size of DL models, underscoring pragmatic benefits for related services. Given limited resources, employing higher-resolution data is recommended for priority consideration over larger-size models."

 In the boreal winter of 2023/2024, the 10-hPa stratosphere experienced unprecedented planetary wave activity. This led to two major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events occurring on January 16 and March 4. The onset processes of both SSWs demonstrated clear stratosphere-troposphere coupling. On one hand, notable precursor signals were detected in the troposphere before each SSW. Approximately 15 days prior to the first SSW, a markedly intensified 500-hPa high pressure emerged over the high-latitude Atlantic, resulting in the strongest wave 3 in the troposphere since 1979. Additionally, an anomalous high over eastern Europe served as a precursor signal for the second SSW, contributing to a rapid increase in waves 1 and 2 approximately 20 days before its occurrence. On the other hand, these two SSWs exhibited distinct impacts on subsequent surface air temperature (SAT) over China. Specifically, the first SSW was characterized as a reflecting event. Following its onset, strong planetary wave reflections were observed in the troposphere over the Siberian and North Pacific regions, leading to local high-pressure ridge development. The two ridges, along with troughs between them, created an “inverted Ω-shaped” circulation pattern and caused a cold wave across China during January 18–22. In contrast, the second SSW was identified as an absorbing event; its impact aligned with typical effects of SSWs on SAT over Eurasia. After its onset, a negative phase of Northern Annular Mode emerged in the stratosphere and propagated downward into the troposphere over time, resulting in warming conditions over China during the following month."

 Human-induced nitrogen (N) emissions have enhanced atmospheric N deposition in many polluted regions. However, the spatiotemporal relations between N emissions and deposition remain poorly characterized, which hampers N emission management and effect evaluation in polluted regions. This study investigated dry and wet inorganic N (IN) deposition at representative urban and suburban sites from June 2018 to May 2019 and analyzed historical N emission and deposition data in a N-polluted region of southern China. Dry, wet, and total IN deposition were 14.1 and 6.3, 36.4 and 29.0, and 50.5 and 35.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1 at the urban and suburban sites, respectively. Gaseous N accounted for 79–87 % of dry IN deposition and dry deposition accounted for 18–28 % of total IN deposition. The inter-annual variation of wet IN deposition exhibits an inverted “V” shape: the turning point for ammonium (NH4+) was in 1991 due to the decline in the ratio of ammonia to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and ammonia emissions; nitrate (NO3−) peaked in 2010, reflecting the benefits of national controls on nitrogen oxide emissions. Consequently, a shift to approximately equal NH4+ and NO3− deposition occurred in 2010–2020. Spatially, annual IN deposition increased with human-induced land use and N emissions, and about 30 % of the area exceeded the critical load for N deposition. Current emission controls are reducing N emissions and deposition but further mitigation measures are needed, especially broader regional strategies."

To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression."

To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation.

However, many dryland afforestation projects lead to short forests with significantly lower canopy height than their typical height. Meanwhile, the potentially increasing probability of drought threatens short forests and their tall counterparts. Yet, it remains largely unclear whether these short forests respond differently to drought compared to tall forests. Here, we used the K-means clustering method to classify global dryland forests into short and tall forests. We found significant differences in drought resistance and resilience between short and tall forests, with tall forests demonstrating higher resistance and short forests having higher resilience. Furthermore, our study indicated that in severe and extreme drought conditions, resistance and resilience of short forests were more likely influenced by climatic factors than tall forests, which were more likely affected by soil factors. These findings suggest that climatic monitoring should be intensified for short forests, and post-drought management should be strengthened for tall forests to enhance their persistence under climate change."

We conducted a systematic review to answer the question: What is the effect of social disadvantage on exposure to subjective and objective heat stress and related adaptive capacity to prevent or reduce exposure to heat stress in the general population? We systematically searched for peer-reviewed journal articles that assessed differences in heat stress exposure and related adaptive capacity by social factors that were published between 2005 and 2024. One author screened all records and extracted data; a second author screened and extracted 10% for validation. Synthesis included the identification and description of specific social groups unequally exposed to heat stress and with lower adaptive capacity. We assessed European studies for the potential risk of bias in their assessment. We identified 123 relevant publications. Subjective heat stress appeared in 18.7% of articles, objective heat stress in 54.5%, and adaptive capacity in 54.5%. Nearly half came from North America (47.2%), 22.8% from Asia, and 17.1% from Europe. Publishing increased from zero articles in 2005 to 21 in 2023. Most studies considered socioeconomic status (SES) (78.8%), and many considered age (50.4%), race/ethnicity (42.3%), and sex/gender (30.1%). The identified studies show that lower-SES populations, young people, immigrants, unemployed people, those working in outdoor and manual occupations, and racial/ethnic minorities are generally more exposed to heat stress and have lower adaptive capacity. Most studies of objective heat stress use inadequate measures which are not representative of experienced temperatures. European studies generally have a low or moderate risk of bias in their assessments. Social inequalities in heat stress exposure and related adaptive capacity have been documented globally. In general, socially disadvantaged populations are more exposed to heat stress and have lower adaptive capacity. These social inequalities are context-dependent, dynamic, multi-dimensional, and intersectional. It is essential to consider social inequalities during heat-health action planning and when developing and implementing climate change adaptation policies and interventions."

Evaluating predictability and ability to estimate impacts across Europe,"Identifying drought indices that effectively predict future drought impacts remains a critical challenge in seasonal forecasting, as these indices provide the necessary actionable information that enables stakeholders to better anticipate and respond to drought-related challenges. This study evaluates how drought indices balance forecast skill and relevance for estimating impacts across Europe. Using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts SEAS5 seasonal predictions and ERA5 reanalysis as benchmarks, we assessed the predictability skill of drought indices over various accumulation periods and their relevance in estimating drought impacts across Europe, with the aim of enhancing impact-based forecasting. To evaluate these relationships, we built upon the findings from a study that utilized drought impact data from the European Drought Impact Report Inventory and employed random forest models to evaluate the significance of various drought indices in predicting sector-specific impacts. Our findings reveal higher predictability in Northern and Southern Europe, particularly during winter and summer, with some regions showing extended predictability up to six months, depending on the season. Focusing on case studies in the UK and Germany, our results highlight regions and seasons where accurate impact predictions are possible. In both countries, high impact predictability was found up to six months ahead, with sectors such as Agriculture, Water Supply, and Tourism in the UK, and Agriculture and Water Transportation in Germany, depending on the region and season. This analysis represents a significant step forward in identifying the most suitable drought indices for predicting impacts across Europe. Our approach not only introduces a new method for evaluating the relationship between drought indices and impacts, but also addresses the challenge of selecting indices for estimating impacts. This framework advances the development of operational impact-based drought forecasting systems for Europe."

Most Tw research has focussed on magnitudes and averages, but rates of thermal change have been drastically understudied. Rapid Tw increases (‘surges’) or decreases (‘plummets’) have been observed across individual catchments and short-term periods, but remain poorly characterized across broader space-time domains. To address this, we collated high-resolution Tw data spanning the conterminous United States (US) between 2008–2023. We demonstrated the national-scale prevalence of surges (n = 6507) and plummets (n = 4787) that were recorded at 88 of the 102 monitoring stations. Both event types spanned freezing (snowmelt-fed systems) to extremely hot (>40 °C—geothermal influences) conditions. Most surges and plummets exhibited constrained durations (<1 h), amplitudes (≈1 °C) and rates of change (≈Δ1 °C/15 min), but some reached 24 h, 18.8 °C, and Δ11.3 °C/15 min, respectively. Successive transitions between rapid Tw warming and cooling occurred predominantly in regulated systems, indicating dam-induced Tw volatility. Surge and plummet characteristics differed between US climate regions. Such events were less widespread and frequent in the Northwest and West, with surges here most often occurring during regional droughts and heatwaves. Plummets recurred most consistently in the Southwest during summer months, and were also most common during notable hot and dry periods. Surges were most prevalent in space and time across the Southeast, and again were most common in summer. Surge and plummet counts were less variable year-to-year in the Northeast US, but significantly decreased across the study period. This research provides a critical step in characterizing rapid Tw changes across broad spatial and temporal scales, thus opening prospects for future research exploring how varying catchment properties and hydroclimatic gradients govern surge and plummet dynamics. Such insights are critical for informing evidence-based management solutions targeting extreme Tw variations and volatility."

However, there is currently a lack of quantitative assessments of the potential consequences of afforestation and deforestation on GPP at a global scale. In this study, we used a 30 m high-resolution forest raster map and a satellite-driven GPP product to assess GPP differences under various afforestation/deforestation scenarios, using spatial rather than temporal comparisons. Our results showed that (1) the simultaneous occurrence of high-intensity afforestation and deforestation was extremely low globally (4.64%). Under this hypothetical scenario, the potential GPP of afforestation could reach 734.13 g C m−2 yr−1, significantly higher than that in the other scenarios. While the percentage of concurrent medium- to low-intensity afforestation and deforestation was up to 41.37%, the potential value of afforestation to promote GPP increase was only 219.56 g C m−2 yr−1. (2) The potential of afforestation to boost GPP varied significantly across space and time. Proximity to equatorial forests, such as evergreen broad-leaved forests, generally facilitate GPP accumulation. However, as latitudinal zonality increased, the fixed GPP potential of high-latitude coniferous forests decreased significantly. Summer (particularly June) showed the highest potential for afforestation to enhance GPP, more than twice as much as in the other seasons, and this pattern was consistent globally. (3) Afforestation costs vary substantially depending on forest type and cover. Afforestation in rainforest areas with a better water-heat balance often requires a higher GPP to achieve the desired effect. Low-density forests dominated by temperate or cold zones yield significantly lower GPP benefits than afforestation in tropical rainforests. This study quantifies the potential impact of afforestation on GPP for the first time and provides guidelines for future afforestation planning across various regions."

However, PV system performance is heavily influenced by the incident solar radiation on panel surfaces, with suboptimal tilt angles leading to significant power losses. Despite the critical importance of tilt angle optimization, many existing PV installations worldwide operate suboptimally due to simplified estimation methods or lack of site-specific optimization. This study presents a novel hybrid approach combining empirical and computational methods to determine optimal annual and monthly PV panel tilt angles using long-term hourly ERA5 reanalysis radiation data. Our results validate the effectiveness of ERA5 data for global tilt angle optimization, demonstrating a strong correlation with established cubic relations. Analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of optimized tilt angles reveals the influence of latitude, local atmospheric conditions, and seasonal variations on optimal PV panel inclination. A comprehensive assessment of the global PV inventory in 2018 shows that 44.6% of installed capacity is located in regions with solar power losses exceeding 1%, resulting in a total loss of 6154 GWh yr−1—equivalent to Luxembourg’s annual electricity consumption. Comparison between optimized tilt angles and those estimated using empirical cubic schemes reveals significant discrepancies in some regions, with annual power losses surpassing 3% when using empirical methods. These findings underscore the importance of accurate, location-specific tilt angle optimization to minimize solar power losses and maximize global PV inventory performance. Our research highlights the potential for substantial energy yield improvements through widespread adoption of optimized tilt angles in PV system design and retrofitting, contributing to enhanced renewable energy production and accelerated progress towards global sustainability goals."

Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code kinetic simulations disclosed that sulfamic acid markedly enhances the assembly of a methanesulfonic acid–methylamine-based cluster. At the air–water interface, the NH2SO3− and H3O+ ion formation mechanism and the proton exchange mechanism were observed. 
 Sulfamic acid (SFA) significantly impacts atmospheric pollution and poses potential risks to human health. Although traditional sources of SFA and their role in sulfuric acid–dimethylamine new particle formation (NPF) have received increasing attention, the formation mechanism of SFA from HNSO2 hydrolysis with methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and its enhancing effect on MSA-methylamine (MA) NPF have not been studied, which will limit understanding on the source and loss of SFA in agriculture-developed and coastal industrial areas. Here, the gaseous and interfacial formation of SFA from HNSO2 hydrolysis with MSA was investigated using quantum chemical calculations and Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations. Furthermore, the role of SFA in the MSA-MA system was assessed using the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code (ACDC) kinetic model. Our simulation results indicate that the gaseous SFA formation from the hydrolysis of HNSO2 with MSA can be competitive with that catalyzed by H2O within an altitude of 5–15 km. At the air–water interface, two types of reactions, the ion-forming mechanism and the proton exchange mechanism to form the SFA− … H3O+ ion pair, were observed on the timescale of picoseconds. Considering the overall environment of sulfuric acid emission reduction, the present findings suggest that SFA may play a significant role in NPF and the growth of aerosol particles, as (i) SFA can directly participate in the formation of MSA-MA-based clusters and enhance the rate of NPF from these clusters by approximately 103 times at 278.15 K and (ii) the SFA− species at the air–water interface can attract gaseous molecules to the aqueous surface and thus promote particle growth."

We developed a new method to correct these errors, improving the accuracy of the radar's data. Our method was tested during an intense cyclone on Réunion Island, demonstrating significant improvements in data accuracy. This research is crucial for enhancing weather predictions and understanding, particularly in challenging terrains. 
 In recent years, the application of compact and cost-effective deployable X-band polarimetric radars has gained in popularity, particularly in regions with complex terrain. The deployable radars generally use a radome constructed by joining multiple panels using metallic threads to facilitate easy transportation. As a part of the ESPOIRS project, Laboratoire de l'Atmosphère et des Cyclones has acquired an X-band meteorological radar with a four-panel radome configuration. In this study, we investigated the effect of the radome on the measured polarimetric variables, particularly differential reflectivity and differential phase. Our observations reveal that the metallic threads connecting the radome panels introduce power loss at vertical polarization, leading to a positive bias in the differential reflectivity values. To address the spatial variability bias observed in differential reflectivity and differential phase, we have developed a novel algorithm based on the discrete Fourier transform. The algorithm's performance was tested during an intense heavy-rainfall event caused by Cyclone Batsirai on Réunion Island. The comparative and joint histogram analysis demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in correcting the spatial bias in the polarimetric variables."

The LILAC–ESMF framework maintains the integrity of the ELM's source code structure and facilitates the transfer of future ELM model developments to WRF-ELM. 
 The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) is a state-of-the-art land surface model that simulates the intricate interactions between the terrestrial land surface and other components of the Earth system. Originating from the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5, ELM has been under active development, with added new features and functionality, including plant hydraulics, radiation–topography interaction, subsurface multiphase flow, and more explicit land use and management practices. This study integrates ELM v2.1 with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; WRF-ELM) model through a modified Lightweight Infrastructure for Land Atmosphere Coupling (LILAC) framework, enabling affordable high-resolution regional modeling by leveraging ELM's innovative features alongside WRF's diverse atmospheric parameterization options. This framework includes a top-level driver for variable communication between WRF and ELM and Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) caps for the WRF atmospheric component and ELM workflow control, encompassing initialization, execution, and finalization. Importantly, this LILAC–ESMF framework demonstrates a more modular approach compared to previous coupling efforts between WRF and land surface models. It maintains the integrity of ELM's source code structure and facilitates the transfer of future developments in ELM to WRF-ELM.To test the ability of the coupled model to capture land–atmosphere interactions over regions with a variety of land uses and land covers, we conducted high-resolution (4 km) WRF-ELM ensemble simulations over the Great Lakes region (GLR) in the summer of 2018 and systematically compared the results against observations, reanalysis data, and WRF-CTSM (WRF coupled with the Community Terrestrial Systems Model). In general, the coupled WRF-ELM model has reasonably captured the spatial distribution of surface state variables and fluxes across the GLR, particularly over the natural vegetation areas. The evaluation results provide a baseline reference for further improvements in ELM in the regional application of high-resolution weather and climate predictions. Our work serves as an example to the model development community for expanding an advanced land surface model's capability to represent fully-coupled land–atmosphere interactions at fine spatial scales. The development and release of WRF-ELM marks a significant advancement for the ELM user community, providing opportunities for fine-scale regional representation, parameter calibration in coupled mode, and examination of new schemes with atmospheric feedback."

One of the main challenges in NTS is the prioritization of relevant LC-HRMS features. A novel prioritization strategy based on structural alerts to select NTS features that correspond to potentially hazardous chemicals is presented here. This strategy leverages raw tandem mass spectra (MS2) and machine learning models to predict the probability that NTS features correspond to chemicals with structural alerts. The models were trained on fragments and neutral losses from the experimental MS2 data. The feasibility of this approach is evaluated for two groups: aromatic amines and organophosphorus structural alerts. The neural network classification model for organophosphorus structural alerts achieved an Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC-ROC) of 0.97 and a true positive rate of 0.65 on the test set. The random forest model for the classification of aromatic amines achieved an AUC-ROC value of 0.82 and a true positive rate of 0.58 on the test set. The models were successfully applied to prioritize LC-HRMS features in surface water samples, showcasing the high potential to develop and implement this approach further."

Herein, we fabricated a sulfonated RO membrane (SLRO) using sodium lignosulfonate as a comonomer, achieving an enhanced charge density and reduced coordination capacity. SLRO exhibited superior antisilica scaling performance, reducing scaling rates by ∼145, ∼166, and ∼157% under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions compared to the control. Reduced density gradient analysis confirmed that sulfonic acid groups (−SO3H) on the SLRO surface increased the repulsion of silicic acid. Moreover, the SLRO demonstrated reductions of ∼112, ∼137, and ∼133% in cation-mediated silica scaling rates under the same conditions, attributed to the weaker coordination between −SO3H and cations, which diminished the cation-bridging effect. Furthermore, SLRO membranes exhibited high pure water permeance (3.3 L m–2 h–1 bar–1) and NaCl rejection (99.2%), with a water/NaCl selectivity (7.8 bar–1) three times greater than that of the control (2.6 bar–1), primarily attributed to increased surface roughness and reduced apparent thickness of the PA layer.

In situ characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the SO42– groups not only inhibit the adsorption of SO2 molecules through steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion but also act as the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) to promote C–Cl cleavage of chlorobenzene (CB) and accelerate the desorption of Cl radicals as inorganic chlorine (HCl and Cl2). Additionally, the Ce–O–Mn structure accelerates electron transfer between active sites, enhances the strength of Lewis acid sites (LAS), and weakens the lattice oxygen stability to generate oxygen vacancies (Ov). These features collectively result in the excellent chlorine and sulfur resistance of the Ce–Mn@ZrO2–SO42– catalyst. Compared to CeO2 and Ce–Mn@ZrO2, chlorinated and sulfated byproducts respectively decrease by 7.9 and 2.7 times in the presence of 100 ppm SO2.

This study evaluated Se(VI) removal using iron electrocoagulation (EC) in a flow-through reactor under various water chemistry and operating conditions. Effective Se(VI) removal (>98% from 1000 μg/L Se) was achieved under anoxic conditions with an iron dose as low as 30 mg/L and an EC reactor residence time as short as 11 s that was followed by a 1-h settling period. The removal remained stable over an extended operating time (24 h) and involved the generation of reactive Fe(II)/Fe(III) solids (green rust and magnetite). Oxic conditions were less effective for Se removal because of limited Se adsorption at the elevated pH of the effluent. The immobilized Se in the solids was in a reduced form (-II or 0), but about 70% of Se was oxidized after air exposure. Despite the reduced forms of Se being oxidized, very little Se was released from the solids and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure indicated that EC-generated solids can be classified as nonhazardous. This study highlights the potential of flow-through iron EC to produce iron-containing adsorbents and reductants that can be tailored for Se(VI) and other oxyanion removal.

In a warmer climate, the frequency of weak precipitation systems decreases, whereas the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation systems increase. This shift is primarily due to the higher wet bulb temperature in the warm sector. Additionally, the lower low‐level relative humidity, fewer low‐level liquid hydrometeors, and increased maximum convective inhibition (MCIN) in a warmer environment suppress the occurrence of weak precipitation systems. Meanwhile, more frequent large values of maximum convective available potential energy and MCIN contribute to more upper‐level solid hydrometeors and deeper warm cloud layer, leading to the increased frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation systems in the future warmer climate."

These four clusters, shown in multiple variables, evolve very differently and have differing links to the Arctic and tropical Pacific regions.

To ensure statistical rigor, the LSMPs analyzed here (with the modified acronym) include local tests of both significance and consistency, which are not always featured in the literature on large‐scale meteorological patterns."

Hall,"Nutrient Loading From a Sustainably Certified Aquaculture Operation Dwarfs Annual Nutrient Inputs From a Large Multi‐Use Watershed, Lake Yojoa, Honduras","Net‐pen aquaculture is a popular and increasingly prevalent method for producing large quantities of low‐fat protein in freshwater ecosystems across the tropics. While there are numerable social and economic advantages associated with aquaculture, there are also challenges related to the environmental sustainability of aquaculture operations which supply pens with externally produced feed. For example, excessive nutrient loading, which can drive rapid eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems, is a major risk. In this study, we compare the estimated annual nutrient loads from the six principal tributaries that contribute to Lake Yojoa to the estimated nutrient load of a large net‐pen Tilapia operation located in the central region of the lake. The Tilapia farm was responsible for ∼86% of the nitrogen (N) and ∼95% of the phosphorus (P) contributions to Lake Yojoa for the year of our study. This excessive nutrient loading of both N and P suggests that this single aquaculture operation, more so than changes in nutrient inputs from the watershed, was responsible for the previously documented deterioration of Lake Yojoa. This study shows the potential for net‐pen aquaculture to have significant negative impacts on freshwater ecosystems, even when operations meet the current sustainability certifications standards. We suggest shifts in metrics that could improve the impact of the certification process so that best practices can reduce the impact of net‐pen aquaculture on freshwater ecosystems and arrive at the intended goal of long‐term environmental sustainability.

In the case of place‐based research, studies can avoid misalignment when grounded in the realities of specific locations and conducted in collaboration with knowledgeable local partners. But literature on best practices for such research is underdeveloped on how to identify appropriate locations and partners. In practice, these research‐design choices are sometimes made based on convenience or prior experience—a strategy labeled opportunism. Here we examine a deliberative and exploratory approach in contrast to default opportunism. We introduce a general framework for scoping place‐based opportunities for research and engagement. We apply the framework to identify climate‐adaptation planning decisions, rooted in specific communities, around which to organize research and engagement in a large project addressing coastal climate risks in the Northeast US. The framework asks project personnel to negotiate explicit project goals, identify corresponding evaluation criteria, and assess opportunities against criteria within an iterative cycle of listening to needs, assessing options, prioritizing actions, and refining goals. In the application, we elicit a broad range of objectives from project personnel. We find that a structured process offers opportunities to collaboratively operationalize notions of equity and justice. We find some objectives in tension—including equity objectives—indicating trade‐offs that other projects may also need to navigate. We reflect on challenges encountered in the application and on near‐term costs and benefits of the exploratory process."

However, limited research has focused on its plant‐level CCUS investment decisions, especially considering geographic heterogeneity based on the national source‐sink matching optimization. This study develops an integrated framework that combines source‐sink matching with a real option model to investigate CCUS investment decisions under various incentive policies. The findings show that the critical carbon price varies significantly across regions in China, ranging from 55 to 950 CNY/t, with 297 (46% of retrofittable cement plants) falling between 600 and 800 CNY/t. Northeast China, benefiting from favorable storage conditions and enhanced oil recovery, exhibits a lower average critical carbon price of 104 CNY/t. In contrast, Central China, despite its substantial CO2 storage amount (18% of the national total), encounters a higher average critical carbon price of 564 CNY/t CO2 due to significant source‐sink matching distances. Notably, the offshore saline aquifer storage in the Southeastern coast could account for 17% of the national total, corresponding to an average critical carbon price of 660 CNY/t. Furthermore, implementing different policy incentives can enhance the immediate adoption of CCUS from 93 to 294 (13% to 46% of retrofittable cement plants)."

 Sharing concepts and knowledge between medical and agricultural fields can promote the development of improved nano-enabled technologies. A central idea behind drug delivery systems is that the active substances are encapsulated in nanoparticles (nano-medicines) to protect the drugs from premature degradation and allow them to be transported to the target site within the body. After three decades of development, nano-medicines are now used in many practical applications, including clinical oncology, infectious disease, cosmetics, and vaccines. Nano-agrochemicals are increasingly considered to tackle challenges associated with food production, sustainability and food security.

 Rooftop photovoltaic (RPV) is often understood as a niche contribution to climate change mitigation. However, the global potential of RPVs to mitigate global warming is unknown. Here we map the global rooftop area at 1-km resolution, quantifying 286,393 km2 of rooftops worldwide through geospatial data mining and artificial intelligence techniques. Using nine advanced Earth system models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6, we reveal that RPVs could substantially contribute to reducing global temperatures by 0.05–0.13 °C before 2050. Region-specific analysis underscores the variability in RPV potential and the necessity of tailored approaches to optimize RPV deployment, considering local solar resources, existing infrastructure and grid carbon intensity. Our findings reveal that leveraging RPV systems offers a viable and impactful strategy for reducing carbon footprints and combating climate change globally, while advocating targeted interventions to enhance the benefits of RPVs, particularly in areas with high solar radiation or rapid urbanization.

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are explored for initial condition sensitivity studies to analyze the physicality of the relationships learned. Gradients (or sensitivities) of the target metric of interest are computed with respect to the variable fields at initial time by means of the backpropagation algorithm, which does not assume linear perturbation growth. Here, sensitivities from an AI model at 36-h lead time were compared to those produced by an adjoint of a dynamical model for an extreme weather event, cyclone Xynthia, presenting very similar structures and with the evolved perturbations leading to similar impacts. This demonstrates the ability of the AI weather model to learn physically meaningful spatio-temporal links between atmospheric processes.

 El Niño is responsible for the largest part of the seasonal-to-interannual climate variability, so forecasting El Niño events correctly is important. However, forecasting El Niño events during boreal spring remains challenging. The dynamical seasonal forecast models of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble are over-confident for high confidence (>75% ensemble member agreement) El Niño forecasts. In general, confident El Niño forecasts have a warming tendency in equatorial SSTs in the month prior to the forecast initialization and positive equatorial heat content anomalies during the first month of the forecast. However, confident forecasts often fail when negative SST anomalies were present in the subtropical north eastern Pacific. We find that the models’ equatorial SST anomalies persist too long and that the precipitation response along the warm pool edge to these anomalies is too deterministic. Therefore, the forecast models are too reliant on coupled equatorial processes resulting in excessively deterministic forecasts."

This study updates the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Model (LPJ) with plant functional types native to alpine regions and assimilates the daily LAI remote sensing datasets. And, the influence of climate factors and CO2 concentration on Alpine Vegetation carbon fluxes was simulated. Validation against field data shows the model accurately simulates daily GPP with R2 of 0.8332 and 0.8608, RMSE of 1.96 and 1.485 for 2013–2014, respectively. For NEP, the RMSE are 1.15 and 1.19 for the same years. The research reveals the pronounced spatiotemporal variations of carbon fluxes were highly responsive to temperature changes. Precipitation shows a more consistent interannual variation relationship with carbon fluxes than temperature does. Notably, NPP/GPP increase only with concurrent rises in CO2 and precipitation, highlighting the superimposed implications of climate-induced carbon flux changes in Alpine vegetation."

 Active conservation of an ice sheet seeks to reduce ice sheet mass loss and sea level rise. Here we explore the response of Sermeq Kujalleq in Greenland to limiting warm water inflow to the fjord it terminates by raising the sill by an artificial barrier at its mouth. We asynchronously couple an ice sheet model with a fjord model, and simulate glacier evolution with varying climate scenarios from the year 2020 to 2100. The tallest barrier cools the fjord water and reduces melt at the ice front. But this has minor impacts on glacier retreat under SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5. Cooling the atmospheric forcing to 1990s levels reduces glacier retreat, but even reducing water temperatures with a barrier cannot stabilize the glacier. The glacier seems to be in an unstoppable phase of marine ice sheet instability on a rapidly deepening retrograde sloping bed and in water much deeper than in 2000s.

 A massive inversion of the Hapke model is carried out over the Asal-Ghoubbet rift (Republic of Djibouti) using high-resolution multiangular Pleiades images. This is the first time that such an inversion is performed on Earth over an entire image, previous studies having focused on planetary surfaces. This work addresses challenges such as atmospheric and geometrical corrections of these images to produce parameter maps. The use of fast Bayesian inversion significantly reduces computation times thanks to efficient exploration of the parameter space and leads to improved prediction. The parameters of the Hapke model are also interpreted in terms of surface physical properties, thanks to field measurements. Single scattering albedo is the parameter extracted with the greatest reliability, although its validation is still difficult due to the absence of a simple formula linking it to surface reflectance. Our study reveals a close relationship between photometric roughness and single scattering albedo, indicating that accurate extraction of the former is highly dependent on values of the latter, which must be below 0.8 for reliable estimation. Finally, the correlation between phase function parameters and grain properties depends on surface type and material properties."

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a crucial biochemical parameter for monitoring the plant's nutritional status and photosynthetic capacity. However, retrieving LCC from canopy reflectance is challenging due to the coupling influence of LCC and canopy structure, particularly leaf area index (LAI). The isolation of leaf-scale information from canopy signals is therefore essential to improve the LCC estimation. This study proposed an approach for deriving the leaf-scale chlorophyll index (CIleaf) from the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) based on the spectral invariant theory (p-theory). Six widely used canopy-scale chlorophyll indices (CIcanopy) were selected to derive the corresponding CIleaf. The CIleaf is expressed as the product of its original CIcanopy and a scale conversion factor (SCF) (CIleaf = CIcanopy × SCF). The SCF is determined by two spectral invariants of p-theory (recollision probability p and directional area scattering factor DASF), as well as canopy BRFs at specific wavelengths, and it corrects for the contribution of canopy multiple scattering to CIcanopy. The analysis through radiative transfer model simulations showed that CIleaf exhibited more unified relationships with LCC across LAI conditions than the original CIcanopy and substantially eliminated the influence of LAI on the CI-based model. Validation results demonstrated that CIleaf improved the accuracy of LCC estimation compared to CIcanopy. The leaf-scale MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCIleaf) exhibited the most prominent improvements, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 6.68 μg/cm2 for ground spectra and 2.33–4.21 μg/cm2 for Sentinel-2 images with multi-ecosystem datasets. Additionally, the influence of vegetation types on the CI-based model was mitigated by CIleaf. MTCIleaf reduced the RMSE values by 3.8 %–34.0 % for different plant functional types, giving more consistent accuracies across species than MTCIcanopy. Our results show that the proposed CIleaf combines the robustness of the physically-based method with the simplicity of the CI-based method, thus providing a practical approach for large-scale high-resolution LCC mapping. Moreover, the method holds promise for designing leaf-scale vegetation indices sensitive to various leaf biochemical parameters beyond LCC, extending its utility to broader leaf-scale remote sensing retrieval (e.g., leaf carotenoid content and leaf dry mass)."

 Existing scene classification methods allocate the same computational resources, i.e., all model parameters in the neural network, to each remote sensing image whenever from any geographic scene. However, this might be redundant for images of certain scenes that are easy to discriminate, e.g., homogeneous scenes. This observation motivates us to propose an efficient method for on-orbit scene classification, namely, the Scale Boosting Model (SBM). Specifically, during the training process, the SBM is built as a set of different scale learners in a scale-increasing manner, each of which is used to learn and classify image features at a specific scale. During inference, the scale learners in the SBM will be selectively run in a scale-increasing manner and automatically decide when to exit early or expand the computation according to the scene complexity. In addition, by replacing the backbone of the scale learner, the SBM could provide a deployment possibility for computationally limited models for on-orbit processing, thereby reducing their computational requirements. Extensive experiments on UC Merced Land Use, NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets show that the SBM achieved a more effective classification performance more efficiently."

 With the persistent rise in intensity and magnitude of hydrological extremes globally, timely information from operational early flood warning systems provide lead times that translate into actionable strategies to monitor and mitigate flood risk. However, the situation is often different for flood-prone regions of the global south with sparse to no ground flood monitoring systems, where flood management practices are inadequate or lacking, and floods are further exacerbated due to cross-border water infrastructure management practices. With the unprecedented volume of data from Earth Observation Satellites (EOS), such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and passive microwave radiometry (PMR) river discharges, insights are being provided into different catchment hydrologic variables required for early flood detection and risk management. This work presents a geospatial and satellite-based heuristic that will be of use for operational flood risk management, which ties together PMR river discharges, the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET), and MODIS-based inundation detection. Case studies of the 2012, 2018, 2020, and 2022 floods in the Lower Niger River Basin in Nigeria are presented, with emphasis placed on the devastating 2012 and 2022 floods. Furthermore, using the time-series from the PMR river discharges, a flood frequency analysis was performed. The analysis was found to capture peak discharges corresponding to the flood events. The result of the flood frequency analysis shows that the return periods of all the flood events combined are approximately equal to or below 30-year, with the 2012 and 2022 catastrophic floods approximately 14- and 20-year floods at satellite gauging reach (SGR) 1438, while 14- and 30-year floods at SGR 1441. From the perspective of a 100-year flood regulatory magnitude, these return periods are an indication of possible river flooding in its natural floodplain. The predicted flow magnitude of a 100-year flood at SGR 1438 was 44% and 38% greater than the 2012 and 2022 flood magnitudes, respectively; 18% and 12% greater at SGR 1441. The results show that operational flood monitoring and risk management or assessment are possible in sparse to ungauged river basins using these products, especially with appropriate predictive algorithms to enable incorporation in an early flood warning system. Since satellite-based measurements have no regard for political boundaries, possible effects of cross-border water infrastructure management practices within the basin could also be assessed."

 At present, there are more than 30 satellite remote sensing Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from kilometers to hectometers resolutions. The accuracy of these products is the key issue for further application. The validation of LST products is mainly achieved through ground observations on homogeneous surfaces, but the accuracy of satellite products on heterogeneous surfaces is also an important factor in the performance of satellite products. We proposed an integrated airborne-ground observation scheme to validate the accuracy of hectometers Landsat LST product. Firstly, in this scheme, the optimal deployment of ground observations is constructed by the prior knowledge, which is the brightness temperature from an unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV). Secondly, UAV flight which synchronization with satellite transit to obtain brightness temperature. Thirdly, the atmospheric effect between the UAV and the ground observations is corrected by the radiative transfer equation. Finally, the LST over the heterogenous land surface is validated by upscaled UAV LST. The results showed that the error between the UAV LST and the ground observations could be reduced from 3.2 K to about 0.5 K by calibrating the near-surface atmospheric effect. Besides, the validation of the LST satellite product by upscaling the UAV LST as “true values”, the results showed that the accuracy was about 1.17 K of Landsat product in heterogeneous surface, the bias was more observably with more big heterogeneity of surface which might cause by adjacent effect in Landsat products.

 Accurate building height information is essential for urban management and planning. However, most existing methods rely on general segmentation networks for building height estimation, often ignoring the structural characteristics of buildings. This paper proposes a novel structure-aware building height estimation (SBHE) model to address this limitation. The model is designed as a dual-branch architecture: one branch extracts building footprints from Sentinel-2 imagery, while the other estimates building heights from Sentinel-1 imagery. A structure-aware decoder and a gating mechanism are developed to integrate into SBHE to capture and account for the structural characteristics of buildings. Validation conducted in the Yangtze River Delta region of China demonstrates that SBHE achieved a more accurate building height map (RMSE = 4.62 m) than four existing methods (RMSE = 5.071 m, 7.148 m, RMSE = 10.16 m, and 13.41 m). Meanwhile, SBHE generated clearer building contours and better structural completeness. Thus, the proposed SBHE offers a robust tool for building height mapping.

 Vehicle evaporative emission is an essential source of air pollution in urban areas, and semi- and intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/IVOC) in the emission are important precursors of SOA. Incorporating S/IVOC inventories can significantly enhance the accuracy of SOA simulations in air quality models. In this paper, we established an inventory of evaporative S/IVOC emissions from light-duty vehicles covering mainland China with a resolution of 50 km × 50 km, based on the emission factors and distribution patterns of each evaporative emission process. We further updated the weights of bins in the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) following the measured proportion of the evaporative S/IVOC component, and simulated its contribution to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generation using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System (CMAQ). Results indicate that the total evaporative VOC and S/IVOC emissions from light-duty vehicles in China in 2022 were 269.71 Gg/yr and 70.73 Gg/yr, respectively. Higher emissions were found in the North China Plain, with particularly elevated emissions in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where the maximum S/IVOC emission intensity reached 336.5 kg/km2/yr. We also found that the unit S/IVOC emissions contributed 11.9 times more to SOA formation than unit VOC. The evaporative S/IVOC emission resulted in a maximum increase in SOA concentrations of 0.178 μg/m3, which occurred in summer in western Liaoning province. Spring exhibited the highest SOA formation, with an average rise in national concentration of 0.013 μg/m3. The meteorological conditions in winter were more conducive to S/IVOC-contributed SOA formation, showing a relatively high concentration increase (0.011 μg/m3 on average) and the largest radiant range (reaching Hexi Corridor and Xinjiang Province) with the least emission of four seasons. The average contribution of the evaporative S/IVOC emission to total anthropogenic SOA was 0.5%, with up to 0.8% contribution in the North China Plain and Eastern China, including Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces.

 This study evaluates the effectiveness of silver iodide (AgI) cloud seeding in Romania by comparing radar-derived parameters of 20 seeded and 20 unseeded severe hailstorms observed between 2017 and 2022. Radar data from S and C-band systems were analyzed using six key parameters, including maximum reflectivity (Zmax), vertically integrated liquid (VIL), Volume of the cloud with reflectivity more than 35 dBZ (dV35) and height of the 45dBZ echo above the environmental melting level (dH45). Statistical comparisons were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test to identify significant differences between the two storm groups. The results reveal statistically significant differences in radar metrics between seeded and unseeded storms, with seeded storms generally exhibiting lower parameter values. For instance, median Zmax was 58 dBZ for seeded storms compared to 60 dBZ for unseeded storms, while VIL medians were 19 kg/m2 and 27 kg/m2, respectively. Similarly, dV35 was reduced by approximately 22 % in seeded storms. These differences indicate that seeding modifies storm microphysical processes and dynamics, potentially suppressing hail formation. However, variability across storm environments and radar categories highlights some uncertainties. Natural fluctuations in convective processes and challenges in tracking seeding agent dispersion complicate the interpretation of results. Nonetheless, the statistical significance of observed differences supports the hypothesis that AgI seeding influences storm characteristics. This study provides quantitative and statistical evidence of seeding effect and underscores the need for further research using advanced radar technologies and larger datasets to refine hail suppression methodologies."

However, the role of isocyanic acid in inflammatory response remains elusive. Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis byLACC1/Lacc1knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore,Lacc1−/−mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo. Hence, our findings identify isocyanic acid as an endogenous immunoregulatory metabolite that limits NLRP3-driven inflammation and provide valuable insights into the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, governed by metabolites."

To address this, we generated cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients with ALS-FTLD harboring theC9ORF72hexanucleotide repeat expansion alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic and healthy controls. Here, we show a higher mtDNA single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) burden in astroglia derived fromC9ORF72-mutant organoids, with some de novo mtSNVs likely due to theC9ORF72repeat and others evading selection to reach higher heteroplasmy levels.

Myeloid cell “trained immunity” describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages trained previously with β-glucan or heme exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone, which was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase–mediated tissue factor decryption. Furthermore, splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan–trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Moreover, hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid from β-glucan–trained mice had enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice.

Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient. Here, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of aging mice, revealing citrulline as a consistently down-regulated metabolite associated with aging. Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging.

We hypothesized that PDAC cell subpopulations could be identified by aberrant glycan signatures in both tumor tissue and blood samples. We used multiplexed glycan immunofluorescence to distinguish between PDAC and noncancer cell subpopulations within tumor tissue, and we developed hybrid glycan sandwich assays to determine whether the aberrant glycan signatures could be detected in blood samples. We found that PDAC cells were identified by signatures of glycans detected by four glycan-binding proteins (VVL, CA19-9, sTRA, and GM2) and that there are three types of glycan-defined PDAC tumors: sTRA type, CA19-9 type, and intermixed. In patient-matched tumor and blood samples, the PDAC tumor type could be determined by the aberrant glycans in the blood. As a result, the combined assays of aberrant glycan signatures were more sensitive and specific than any individual assay. Our results demonstrate a methodology to detect and stratify PDAC."

Caspase-11 also detects eukaryotic (i.e., self) lipids. This observation raises the question of whether common or distinct mechanisms govern caspase interactions with self- and nonself-lipids. In this study, using biochemical, computational, and cell-based assays, we report that the caspase-11 CARD functions as a bipartite lipid-binding module. Distinct regions within the CARD bind to phosphate groups and long acyl chains of self- and nonself-lipids. Self-lipid binding capability is conserved across numerous caspase-11 homologs and orthologs. The symmetry in self- and nonself-lipid detection mechanisms enabled us to engineer an LPS-binding domain de novo, using an ancestral CARD-like domain present in the fishAmphilophus citrinellus. These findings offer insights into the molecular basis of LPS recognition by caspase-11 and highlight the fundamental and likely inseparable relationship between self and nonself discrimination."

We clarify how drawing-induced elongational force affects ordering, chain extension, interchain contacts, and molecular mobility through mesoscale simulations of silk-based fibers. We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers. Property enhancements attributed to the progression of anisotropic extension are verified by mechanical tests of drawn silk fibers and justified by theory. These findings elucidate how drawing enhances properties of protein-based fibers and shed light on how to incorporate this effect into predictive models."

 Earth and other terrestrial and icy planetary bodies deform viscoelastically under various forces. Numerical modeling plays a critical role in understanding the nature of various dynamic deformation processes. This article introduces a newly developed open-source package, CitcomSVE-3.0, which efficiently solves the viscoelastic deformation of planetary bodies. Based on its predecessor, CitcomSVE-2.1, CitcomSVE-3.0 is updated to account for three-dimensional elastic compressibility and depth-dependent density, which are particularly important in modeling horizontal displacement for viscoelastic deformation. We benchmark CitcomSVE-3.0 against a semi-analytical code for two types of loading problems: (1) single harmonic loads on the surface or as a tidal force and (2) the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) problem with a realistic ice sheet loading history (ICE-6G_D) and an updated version of sea level equations. The benchmark results presented here demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this package. CitcomSVE-3.0 shows second-order accuracy in terms of spatial resolution. For typical GIA modeling with a 122 kyr glaciation–deglaciation history, a surface horizontal resolution of ∼50 km, and a time increment of 125 years, this takes ∼3 h on 384 CPU cores to complete, with displacement rate errors of less than 5 %."

We explored the transport of chemotactic bacteria to NAPL ganglia at varying pore water velocities in a dual-permeability microfluidic device and using computer-simulated solutions of transport equations. In our experiments, bacteria exhibited a chemotactic response toward NAPL ganglia at the junctures of low- and high-permeability regions (i.e., micropockets), and the extent of retention initially increased with velocity and then decreased at the highest velocity. A dimensional analysis revealed that maximum accumulations occurred at moderate values of the Péclet number Pec=vmdpχo ∼10 in our system. We also found that accumulation dynamics in micropockets can be represented by a logistic equation incorporating convection and chemotaxis time scales τf=Livf and τche=la2χo, respectively. By analyzing seven literature studies on chemotaxis, we identified an exposure time scale to chemicals τexp=dpvf that was useful for evaluating the chemotaxis efficiency. Our study provided unique insights into the effect of fluid flow on chemotaxis in porous media by demonstrating that increasing the fluid velocity to some extent can promote chemotaxis.

A systematic approach is used from the field of prospective life-cycle assessment, which is based on systems thinking, to develop scenarios for the Austrian building stock that consider life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The influential parameters of the model are identified; their interactions are classified; quantitative future assumptions are adopted; and five scenario narratives are created. A maximum emission reduction of 90% from 2023 to 2050 is revealed. In comparison, leaving current policies in place would lead to a trajectory that reduces emissions by only 66%.

Recent federal regulations mandate the closure or retrofitting of most coal ash impoundments, presenting significant challenges for waste management. These regulatory pressures also present opportunities to reuse coal ash. However, the quality and quantity of discarded coal ash across the U.S. are not well known, even though this information is crucial for spurring its reuse for conventional and new material applications. This study describes a predictive model for the major element composition of coal ash in reserve at disposal sites of major U.S. coal-fired power plants. This model was constructed from coal purchase records of 705 power stations from 1973 to 2022 and was trained on coal ash composition data, showing that coal ash elemental composition is strongly associated with the source of feedstock coal. The model showed regional shifts in the major element contents of ash produced by power plants in the last 50 years, particularly for calcium and iron (expressed as %CaO and %Fe2O3), as power stations changed their source of coal over this time frame. Our approach enables an estimation of chemical composition for ash stored in waste impoundments at individual power stations. Such information can help to delineate the regional market resource potential of supplementary cements for concrete and other material innovations that would utilize coal ash harvested from disposal sites across the U.S."

Their foraging behaviors are essential to colony sustainability. Sublethal exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids can significantly disrupt these behaviors, in particular pollen foraging. We investigated the effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honeybee foraging, at both individual and colony levels, by integrating field experiments with artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring technology and mechanistic simulations using the BEEHAVE model. Our results replicated previous findings, which showed that imidacloprid selectively reduces pollen foraging at the colony level, with minimal impact on nectar foraging. Individually marked exposed honeybees exhibited prolonged pollen foraging trips, reduced pollen foraging frequency, and instances of drifting pollen foraging trips, likely due to impaired cognitive functions and altered metabolism. These behavioral changes at the individual level corroborated the previous model predictions derived from BEEHAVE, which highlights the value of combining experimental and simulation approaches to disentangle underlying mechanisms through which sublethal effects on individual foragers scale up to impact colony dynamics. Our findings have implications for future pesticide risk assessment, as we provide a robust feeding study design for evaluating pesticide effects on honeybee colonies and foraging in real landscapes, which could improve the realism of higher-tier ecological risk assessment."

A key aspect of this process is the accurate measurement of critical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, current spectroscopic methods struggle with accurately and consistently measuring COD in large-scale, complex water environments due to an insufficient understanding of water spectra and limited generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce the physicochemical-informed spectral Transformer (PIST) model, combined with ultraviolet–visible-shortwave-near-infrared (UV–vis-SWNIR) spectroscopy for water quality sensing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to combine Transformer with spectroscopy for water quality sensing. PIST integrates a physicochemical-informed block to incorporate existing physical and chemical information into the spectral encoding for domain adaptation, along with a feature embedding block for comprehensive spectral features extraction. We validated PIST using an actual surface water spectral data set with extensive geographic coverage including the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. PIST demonstrated notable performance in COD sensing within complex water environments, achieving an impressive R2 value of 0.9008 and reducing root mean squared error (RMSE) by 45.20% and 29.38% compared to benchmark models such as support vector regression (SVR) and convolutional neural network (CNN).

To overcome this limitation, we employed Slepian functions, orthogonal within a bounded domain, to represent Saturn's localized high‐degree gravity field. Focusing on latitudes from 32°S to 32°N, we estimated Slepian coefficients that represent short‐scale latitudinal gravity variations. The reconstructed wind profile that explains low‐degree harmonics can also reproduce these high‐degree variations, assuming Saturn's atmosphere is, to first order, in thermal wind balance.

Such widespread land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) do not only alter the global climate through biomass carbon uptake or release but also through biogeophysical (BGP) processes related to changes in surface roughness, evaporation, transpiration, and albedo. These BGP effects act as local forcing to land‐atmosphere interactions and lead to in situ climate responses. Caused by advection and spatio‐temporal land‐atmosphere‐ocean interaction, they also generate non‐local climate responses that occur remotely from the LULCC. How the non‐local partition of climate response signals emerges at different spatial scales than its forcing is still object of ongoing research. Here, we present a spectral perspective on climate responses to LULCC forcing that aids in achieving systematic understanding. We introduce spectral decomposition of forcing and response fields into a sum of signals with different wavelengths based on spherical harmonics to compare the two fields across spatial scales. Building on this approach, we develop a novel tool called SCISSOR, a Spectral ClImate Signal SeparatOR to define the cross‐scale response signal from the difference of response and forcing spectra. The cross‐scale signal of BGP‐driven temperature response to deforestation strongly resembles the non‐local signal as estimated by the established moving window regression and checkerboard interpolation.

Clarifying the representativeness scale of meteorological stations promotes further research on global warming. The study improved the method used to obtain representativeness scale through spatial heterogeneity. The root mean square error instead of standard deviation was used to derive spatial heterogeneity, which represents the degree of dispersion of all pixels within the region to station point observations. The new method provided a more logical representativeness scale with a temporal series to investigate its variability and trend. The satellite land surface temperature retrievals at 1‐km resolution was used to calculate spatial heterogeneity in the commonly used grid scale (∼1°), and thus, representativeness scale can be calculated with a certain threshold (0.5°C and 1.0°C). This study focuses on nighttime for the similarity between surface temperature and air temperature because both are controlled by surface longwave radiative cooling during the nighttime. The national mean representativeness scale is ∼7 km (0.5°C threshold) and ∼16 km (1°C threshold). Meteorological stations in the western China showed higher spatial heterogeneity than eastern China. From 2001 to 2021, the representativeness scale of meteorological stations in China showed decreasing trends. The inhomogeneous warming caused by urbanization around station increased spatial heterogeneity and decreased representativeness. The conclusions derived here is only suitable for nighttime and the representativeness scale of air temperature was expected much higher during daytime due to turbulent exchange."

However, ground observation stations are sparsely and unevenly distributed in Antarctica, and reanalysis and satellite data often exhibit errors, making it challenging to accurately monitor surface albedo. This study integrates nine automatic weather station data along PANDA transect, ERA5‐Land reanalysis, and MCD43C3 product, utilizing a dual‐layer stacking ensemble approach that incorporates various machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The results indicate that stacking model achieves the best accuracy along the 1,200 km PANDA transect from Zhongshan Station to Dome A, demonstrating high correlation (Corr = 0.939) and low error metrics (MSE = 0.004, MAE = 0.047, RMSE = 0.064). Additionally, optimal models were developed individually for each station, which provided accurate daily albedo predictions from 2004 through 2023 for nine stations in East Antarctica. Compared to albedo products such as ERA5‐Land (Bias = 0.1217) and MCD43C3 (Bias = 0.0591), the data set constructed demonstrates higher accuracy with a Bias of 0.0041, underscoring the superior generalization of the machine learning models. Based on these high resolution data sets at the nine sites, it is found that the surface albedo from coast to Dome A exhibits a declining trend during 2004–2023, indicating an ongoing darkening process. This phenomenon reflects the important response and feedback of surface snow to global climate change, and the high‐quality long‐term data set may provide deep insights in the future application."

The western region (WNC) serves as a positive precipitation anomaly center, contrasting with the eastern region (ENC) as a negative anomaly center. This precipitation disparity is largely due to contrasting dynamic and moisture conditions between these regions, influenced by a quasi‐barotropic anomalous cyclonic circulation over Central Asia and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Mongolia. Further analysis reveals that land and oceanic processes are pivotal in modulating this precipitation pattern. Specifically, soil moisture anomalies over Eurasia and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific are critical. In August, Eurasian soil moisture anomalies influence the local thermal processes, leading to eastward‐propagating Rossby wave circulations. Simultaneously, SST anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific initiate an anomalous meridional Pacific‐Japan (PJ) wave train. These circulation anomalies induce opposing conditions that promote precipitation in WNC and suppress it in ENC, thus establishing the observed out‐of‐phase precipitation pattern. In our study, Eurasian soil moisture and Pacific SST anomalies contribute approximately 44.9% and 21.2%, respectively, to the linear variance of precipitation pattern, collectively accounting for around 54.8% of the observed variation. Further investigation is required to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon."

Here, the authors report a synthesis of (hetero)aryl sulfoximines via copper-catalysed coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides and sulfenamides. 
 The (hetero)aryl sulfoximines are important structures for developing bioactive molecules, whose synthesis relies on oxidation of (hetero)aryl sulfilimines. However, asymmetric approaches for assembling (hetero)aryl sulfilimines are still rare. Here we show that combination of CuI and NOBIN-derived amide ligands offers an effective catalytic system for enantioselective coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with sulfenamides. A large number of functional groups and heterocycles are tolerated under the coupling conditions, providing a powerful approach for diverse synthesis of enantioenriched (hetero)aryl sulfilimines. The efficiency of the coupling reaction is highly dependent on the electronic nature of (hetero)aryl iodides and sulfenamides. Both (hetero)aryl- and some bulky alkyl-substituted sulfenamides give excellent enantioselectivities, while sulfenamides with smaller alkyl substituents lead to the formation of the (hetero)aryl sulfilimines with moderate enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that proper steric repulsions in the transition states of the intramolecular SNAr reaction are crucial for achieving desirable enantioselectivity.

 Harnessing the power of immune system to treat cancer has become a core clinical approach. However, rewiring of intrinsic circuitry by genomic alterations enables tumor cells to escape immune surveillance, leading to therapeutic failure. Uncovering the molecular basis of how tumor mutations induce therapeutic resistance may guide the development of intervention approaches to advance precision immunotherapy. Here we report the identification of the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1)-Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP)- Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) dynamic complex as a molecular determinant for immune response of LKB1-mut lung cancer cells. LKB1 alteration exposes a critical dependency of lung cancer cells on IAP for their immune resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of IAP re-establishes JAK1-regulated Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) expression and DNA sensing signaling, enhances cytotoxic immune cell infiltration, and augmentes immune-dependent anti-tumor activity in an LKB1-mutant immune-competent mouse model. Thus, IAP-JAK1-targeted strategies, like IAP inhibitors, may offer a promising therapeutic approach to restore the responsiveness of immunologically-cold LKB1-mutant tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors or STING-directed therapies.

 Countries are urged to advance the energy transition in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, yet the appropriate pathway remains unclear. Using a provincial-level, hourly-dispatched power system model of China that incorporates intertemporal decisions on early retirement and carbon capture retrofitting, our study reveals that for coal-rich but gas-poor economies, repositioning coal power from a baseload resource to a flexibility provider can accelerate net-zero transition of the power system in three aspects. First, when achieving the same emissions reduction target, it mitigates stranded assets by decreasing the average lifespan loss of coal power by 7.9-9.6 years and enhancing the long-term competitiveness of retrofitted coal power. Second, it enables the integration of an additional 194-245 gigawatts of variable renewables by 2030 under the same carbon emissions reduction trajectory. Third, it reduces China’s power system transition costs by approximately 176 billion U.S. Dollars, particularly in the face of costly gas power and energy storage technologies. These robust findings underscore the need for appropriate policies to incentivize the flexible dispatch, orderly retirement, and carbon capture retrofitting of coal power, thereby accelerating the decarbonization of China’s power system.

 Here are described the dilution-driven gel-sol-gel-sol transitions in aromatic hydrotrope/zwitterionic surfactant bi-component aqueous mixtures. Long and entangled wormlike micelles (WLMs) of concentrated erucyl dimethyl amidopropyl betaine (EAPB) solutions sequentially transform into hexagonal liquid crystal phase (H1), highly concentrated spherical micelles (HCSMs), and finally hexagonal close packed micellar phase (HCP) upon gradual introducing an aromatic hydrotrope, sodium salicylate (NaSal). The HCP then successively converts into HCSMs, WLMs, and spherical micelles (SMs) upon further dilution with water, corresponding to a gel-sol-gel-sol transition. This dilution-induced HCSMs to WLMs transition results in an interesting thickening process, which is caused by a slow kinetic process, from the agglomeration and recombination of SMs to long and rigid WLMs via the intermediately formed rodlike micelles. In this work, the sustained adjustment of the competitive self-sorting and co-assembly between hydrotropes and surfactants by dilution was identified, benefitting the creation and application of WLMs fluids with switchable viscosity.

 High-quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra can be rapidly acquired by combining non-uniform sampling techniques (NUS) with reconstruction algorithms. However, current deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods focus only on single-domain reconstruction (time or frequency domain), leading to drawbacks like peak loss and artifact peaks and ultimately failing to achieve optimal performance. Moreover, the lack of fully sampled spectra makes it difficult, even impossible, to determine the quality of reconstructed spectra, presenting challenges in the practical applications of NUS. In this study, a joint time-frequency domain deep learning network, referred to as JTF-Net, is proposed. It effectively combines time domain and frequency domain features, exhibiting better reconstruction performance on protein spectra across various dimensions compared to traditional algorithms and single-domain DL methods. In addition, the reference-free quality assessment metric, denoted as REconstruction QUalIty assuRancE Ratio (REQUIRER), is proposed base on an established quality space in the field of NMR spectral reconstruction. The metric is capable of evaluating the quality of reconstructed NMR spectra without the fully sampled spectra, making it more suitable for practical applications.

Multivariable analysis and the second online survey for patients with heightened regret confirm that postoperative lower thyroid cancer-specific quality of life (QoL) (scar and psychology) (75.5%) is the most common factor for heightened regret of thyroidectomy, followed by preoperative understanding of disease [not at all] (15.0%), presentation of complications (3.8%) and other factors (5.7%).

 The pursuit of advanced battery chemistries with enhanced energy density necessitates the exploration of new materials, a process intricately tied to synthesis science. Despite the promise of O3-type sodium oxygen anionic redox cathodes as high-capacity materials, their development has been severely hindered by a lack of understanding regarding synthetic mechanisms. Here, we elucidate the pivotal role of atmospheric conditions, particularly oxygen content, in the synthesis of such materials by synchronizing multiple operando characterization techniques to monitor changes in both solid and gaseous components. Utilizing the O3-Na[Li1/3Mn2/3]O2 system as a model, we demonstrate that a low oxygen environment is essential and the reaction is highly complex as evidenced by multiple oxygen uptake and release processes, resulting in numerous intermediates. This behavior contrasts sharply with Na-Mn-O and Li-Mn-O ternary systems which show less significant oxygen dynamics, underscoring the unique reaction mechanism within the Na-Li-Mn-O system. We further adopt a dynamic controlled atmosphere approach to modulate oxygen concentration and demonstrate successful synthesis of Ti-substituted NaLi1/3Mn2/3-xTixO2 materials, all exhibiting capacities surpassing 190 mAh g-1.

 Polar skyrmions are topologically nontrivial polarization textures that demonstrate exotic physical phenomena and novel memory applications. Thus far, these textures have primarily been reported in oxide-ferroelectric-based epitaxial heterostructures because their stabilization requires an elastic energy penalty from the epitaxial strains. Here, without the epitaxial-strain engineering, we discover polar skyrmion bubbles in stand-alone van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 crystal through the combination of piezoelectric force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and phase-field simulations. In a thick CuInP2S6 flake of over −100 nm, skyrmion bubbles feature an elliptical hedgehog-like state with center-divergent or center-convergent configurations. Progressively thinning the flake thickness to −8 nm allows a topological transition from elliptical to circular skyrmionic patterns. Interestingly, the skyrmions can be switched with the change in helicity by probe-applied electrical and mechanical stimuli, which is distinct from the creation and annihilation of other reported skyrmions. Both theoretical and experimental data proves that the formation and thickness-dependence of skyrmion textures primarily stem from charge-related energy penalty. This work opens up a new material system (i.e., two-dimensional layered ferroionic materials) for exploring uncharted polar-topology physics and prospective neuromorphic devices.

 Detecting strike-slip tectonics using thermochronology is challenging because the complex relative motion between fault blocks often does not substantially displace the vertical stratigraphy provided by thermochronological ages. Here we investigate the strike-slip tectonics in the Yangtze Block, South China, based on an original conceptual model and the zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) analysis of 17 sandstone samples. We exploit as a marker the northwestward trend of progressively decreasing ZHe ages generated by Mesozoic northwestward shortening. The ZHe age trend is broken by evident steps, which are also found in other published thermochronological datasets. We interpret these age steps as marking a previously undetected Late Cretaceous left-lateral strike-slip fault which intersects with prior deformation-propagation direction. Our approach to detect strike-slip faults confirms a major change in the subduction direction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath Eurasia during the Late Cretaceous, and can find applications to other regions where thermochronological ages define suitable dipping markers.

Prior to thermal stress, resilient corals have a more diverse microbiome and abundant proteins essential for carbon acquisition, symbiont retention, and pathogen resistance. Protein signatures of susceptible corals showed early symbiont rejection and utilized urea for carbon and nitrogen. Our results reveal molecular factors for surviving bleaching events and identify diagnostic protein biomarkers for reef management and restoration. Corals that are resilient to thermal bleaching have abundant proteins for nutrient uptake, antiviral defence, and symbiont retention, offering molecular insights for reef restoration, according to microbial analysis of experimentally bleached corals."

 Peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) represent one of the world’s largest reservoirs of soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but their future stability is uncertain. This study utilizes high-resolution multi-core records of C and N contents, stable isotopes, and infrared spectroscopy to reconstruct water table depths and their impacts on C and N accumulation and decomposition over the past 2.7 kyr in a slope peatland from the central QTP. Our paleo records reveal that increased decomposition in the surface oxic layer has led to decreased C and N accumulation rates over the last millennium, primarily due to water-table drawdown driven by climate warming and drying. Supporting evidence from nearby records suggests that this trend of surface drying may be widespread across QTP peatlands. Despite this, QTP peatlands retain some of the highest 1-m C and N densities globally, with values of 54.1 ± 18.9 kg C m-2 and 3.2 ± 1.5 kg N m-2. These findings highlight the vulnerability of substantial C and N reservoirs and sequestration capabilities in QTP peatlands to continued water table declines in a warming and drying climate.

 Snow cover can significantly alter the energy fluxes that take part on the surface energy balance (SEB), which subsequently affects surface air temperature. However, studies of the influence of snow cover on the SEB are scarce due to limited observational data and usually constrained to high altitudes or mountainous areas. In this study, the SEB is analysed under two differentiated land surface conditions: with and without snow cover, for a non-mountainous region in the midlatitudes. This is done in order to analyse the physical processes leading to one of the most extreme and disruptive cold waves of the present century in Spain. The cold wave took place in January 2021 after historical snowstorm Filomena left widespread snowfall amounts of 30–50 cm in the interior of Spain. By means of analysis of in-situ observational data from a micrometeorological tower and synoptic fields, we determine the contribution of synoptic and microscale processes to the extremely cold surface air temperatures recorded. The SEB analysis reveals the decisive role of snow cover in the cold wave. Surface albedo increased from 20 % to 80 %, leading to a 60 % decrease in the surface net radiative flux. Together with weak turbulence conditions due to weak synoptic forcing, this allowed extraordinarily low surface air temperatures. Thus, this event stands out from the typical pattern leading to cold waves in this region, characterised by cold air advection. This study highlights the importance of having observational data of micrometeorological variables, which have proven very insightful into the physical mechanisms contributing to the cold wave."

 Based on multiple datasets, the spring rainy season onset (RSO) date over southern China is objectively determined and validated, and the relationship between RSO and tropical Pacific SST is then explored. The RSO date is defined as the time when the cumulative precipitation departure over southern China reaches its minimum value, with a climatological onset date of March 14 and a standard deviation of 22 days. The RSO is closely linked to the sudden changes in atmospheric circulations and abrupt emergence of rainfall and convection, displaying strong interannual variability. An early RSO is characterized by an increase in rainfall during February and March, and is associated with a zonal sea surface temperature (SST) dipole in the tropical Pacific. This is because the concurrent cooler SST in the tropical Western Pacific triggers lower-tropospheric southwesterly wind anomalies over the western North Pacific through Matsuno-Gill-type Rossby wave response. These wind anomalies then enhance water vapor transport and warm advection towards southern China, which, in turn, fosters anomalous upward motion combined with vorticity advection. Such anomalous ascending motion is favorable for the increased precipitation and the advanced RSO over southern China."

Several ASD mouse models (Scn2a+/−,Fmr1−/−,Cdkl5−/−) exhibit impaired spatial learning, with these deficits often attributed to hippocampal dysfunction. However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wideScn2areduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen inScn2a+/−mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediatedScn2areduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits inScn2a+/−mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments inFmr1andCdkl5knockout mice. Thus, in several genetic models of ASD, PRC abnormalities may disrupt hippocampal function to impair learning and memory."

In this study, a photomechanical degradation process was employed to convert the primary sunscreen-derived microplastics (SDMPs) into secondary SDMPs. While mechanical degradation caused physical fragmentation, photodegradation induced both physical and chemical alterations, introducing surface oxidation, chemical bond scission, and cross-linking to the secondary SDMPs. Employing a combination of alkaline digestion and pyrolysis GC-MS techniques, it was observed that both physical fragmentation and photooxidation led to heightened intracellular sequestration of MPs. Although the bioaccumulated SDMPs could be indicated by the enlarged lysosomes and fragmented mitochondria, toxicity of secondary SDMPs at the cellular level was primarily driven by chemical transformations post-photodegradation. A nontargeted analysis employing high-resolution mass spectrometry identified 46 plastic-associated compounds in the leachate, with photodegradation-induced chemical transformations playing a crucial role in the dissociation of hydrophobic additives and oxidative conversion of leached compounds. The toxicity of the leachate was exacerbated by photodegradation, with mitochondrial fragmentation serving as the primary subcellular biomarker, indicative of leachate toxicity. This study elucidates the pivotal role of photodegradation in augmenting the cytotoxicity of secondary SDMPs, shedding light on the intricate interplay between physicochemical transformations and environmental risks."

In this study, the occurrence and transport of both traditional and emerging PFASs in the surface seawater of the Southeast Indian Ocean and Antarctic marginal seas are comprehensively discussed by integrating hydrological data. Long-chain PFASs were restricted to the north of the thermohaline front in the Southeast Indian Ocean, suggesting a transport barrier effect and the input of terrestrial contamination from low-latitude regions. Conversely, unexpectedly high levels of short-chain perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were limited to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, preventing further northward transport. PFBA showed significant positive correlations with two emerging PFECAs, perfluoro-2-methoxyacetic acid (PFMOAA) and fluoro(heptafluoropropoxy)acetic acid (3:2 H-PFECA), which were also widely detected in Antarctic marginal seas for the first time.

 Deep learning models are widely used to extract features and insights from remotely sensed imagery. However, these models typically perform optimally when applied to the same sensor, resolution and imagery processing level as used during their training, and are rarely used or evaluated on out-of-domain data. This limitation results in duplication of efforts in collecting similar training datasets from different satellites to train sensor-specific models. Here, we introduce a range of techniques to train deep learning models that generalise across various sensors, resolutions, and processing levels. We applied this approach to train OmniCloudMask (OCM), a sensor-agnostic deep learning model that segments clouds and cloud shadow. OCM demonstrates robust state-of-the-art performance across various satellite platforms when classifying clear, cloud, and shadow classes, with balanced overall accuracy values across: Landsat (91.5 % clear, 91.5 % cloud, and 75.2 % shadow); Sentinel-2 (92.2 % clear, 91.2 % cloud, and 80.5 % shadow); and PlanetScope (96.9 % clear, 98.8 % cloud, and 97.4 % shadow). OCM achieves this accuracy while only being trained on a single Sentinel-2 dataset, employing spectral normalisation and mixed resolution training to address the spectral and spatial differences between satellite platforms. This approach allows the model to effectively handle imagery from different sensors within the 10 m to 50 m resolution range, as well as higher resolution imagery that has been resampled to 10 m.

The seasonal solar heating, river run-off, and resulting salinity stratification, and bathymetry determine the dominant (∼80%) temperature variance in the bay. The warming trend of the annual mean SST is 0.057 ± 0.024 °C yr−1 for Narragansett Bay and 0.015 ± 0.018 °C yr−1 for Mt. Hope Bay. We classified each Landsat image by tidal phase using tide gauge measurements in order to produce composite SST anomaly maps corresponding to each tidal phase, but non-tidal noise made the signal trustworthy in only a few regions. High-frequency measurements reveal that tidal temperature changes are detectable and consistent at buoy sites but secondary to the temperature changes by season in the bay. The shallower, fresher upper bay shows greater SST variability than the lower bay, whose temperature approaches the more oceanic, less seasonal temperatures at the mouth. Importantly, our study represents the synergistic advantages of utilizing Landsat and in-situ buoy data to offer new and deeper insights into the changing conditions of global estuaries."

 Information regarding the spatial arrangement and extent of past habitats is important for understanding present biodiversity, restoration potential, and fighting extinction-debt effects. European landscapes have changed profoundly over recent decades, with the trend accelerating following World War 2. We develop a proof of concept for mapping historic habitat distribution for Switzerland from black and white aerial imagery compatible with the present-day habitat map. Recently available orthorectified 1946 aerial imagery (1 m resolution) was segmented based on spectral and shape characteristics for training areas (320–508 km2) representing the main biogeographical regions of Switzerland. Initial training data was derived by manual aerial orthoimage interpretation differentiating 15 habitat classes. A random forest model was trained to classify the segments using variables describing spectral information, image texture, segment shape, topography, climate, and anthropogenic influence. Classification accuracy was improved with additional training samples derived in a stepwise approach, applying three different sampling techniques. Highest class accuracies (producer’s and user’s accuracies ≥ 0.75) were achieved for the habitats ‘Standing water’, ‘Flowing water’, ‘Glaciers, permanent ice and snow’, and ‘Forests and other wooded land’. Particularly low user’s accuracies were found for ‘Wetlands’, ‘Hedges and tree rows’ and ‘Buildings’. The comparison to independent data further revealed minor differences in overall accuracy for the three different sampling strategies. Yet, map predictions sometimes varied substantially, indicating that the sampling strategies address different classification issues. Hence, we conclude that combining different sampling strategies for training data collection has the potential to improve the mapping, particularly in the case of multi-class classifications."

 The study of the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) oxidative potential (OP), a general indicator of human health risks associated with PM exposure, has become a focal point in research. In Italy, the number of studies concerning OP is limited, especially for the fine fraction of PM. This study aims to compare the impact of different natural and anthropogenic sources on fine PM (PM2.5) and its OP on three areas of Southern Italy. A study of PM2.5 sources sampled at a rural site was carried out. The PM2.5 sources were identified and characterized with the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF5.0) model, while the contribution of each source to the OP estimated with the multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis. Results were compared with those obtained from two similar studies, related to different typology sites in south Italy. The PMF5.0 identified similar sources for the three sites, with different contributions to PM2.5 and OP. The MLR analysis highlights that combustion sources are the main contributors to the OP activity of PM2.5. The relative contributions to OP and PM2.5 are not comparable for all sources.

 Inappropriate reduction strategies can exacerbate ozone pollution. While previous research has primarily focused on developing emission reduction strategies for large areas, this study aimed to create a method for quickly planning emission reductions in subareas within a larger area. Using Taiwan (large area) as an example, this study illustrates how to determine the emission reductions required in each county (subarea) to achieve a 50% reduction in the number of DM8O3 (daily maximum 8-h average ozone) pollution station-days across the entire region (the preset goal). The methodology began with observational data to calculate the expected DM8O3 concentration improvements needed to meet the preset goal. CMAQ-DDM simulations were then conducted to evaluate cross-county O3 transport, revealing the reciprocal impact of emissions between counties on air quality. The results indicated that NOX emission reductions caused O3 deterioration, leading to a focus exclusively on NMHC reductions. A system of simultaneous linear equations was constructed to link emission reductions, the cross-county O3 transport, and the expected improvements. Linear programming was applied to calculate the required NMHC reductions for each county. The findings showed that most counties needed to reduce NMHC emissions by 30%–40%, while some required only 20%. CMAQ simulations of the improvements resulting from these emission reductions (referred to as validated improvements) confirmed that they met the expected improvements in most counties and across Taiwan as a whole. Finally, a nonlinear correction factor, defined as the ratio of validated to linear improvements, was introduced to refine the system of linear equations. This refinement effectively addressed the biases associated with using a system of linear equations to represent the nonlinear processes of ozone formation and ensured that all counties achieved their expected improvements."

 Subway stations are dynamic underground environments where air quality changes rapidly, primarily due to passenger occupancy patterns and the frequent arrival and departure of trains. However, traditional microbial monitoring methods are constrained by their temporal resolutions. To address this, we employed a real-time light-induced fluorescence-based bioaerosol monitoring instrument to detect the dynamics of particulate matters (PM) and classify them into fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAPs) or non-FBAPs based on the intrinsic fluorescent feature of bioaerosols. We deployed this sensor on the platform, in the station hall, and outdoors at a typical subway station for 18 days in Tianjin, China. The results showed that FBAP and non-FBAP concentrations on the platform were roughly 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than those in the station hall, and approximately 3 and 4 times higher than outdoor levels. Notably, the bacteria-like particle levels on the platform were 20 times higher than those outdoor values during most periods. The concentrations of PM, dominated by non-FBAP, peaked during the morning rush hours both on the platform and in the station hall, while the bacteria-like particles reached their lowest levels in the morning, presumably caused by the elevated metal particle levels when trains started operating that inhibit bacterial survival. Train operations strongly influenced non-FBAP concentrations on the platform, as evidenced by the 7-min periodic cycle in the particle autocorrelations corresponding to train schedules. By contrast, the particle levels in the station hall did not show train-related patterns in autocorrelations but showed stronger correlations with the environmental parameters. The revealed dynamic patterns of non-biological and biological airborne particles in the subway station provide insights for mitigating particle exposure in the future."

 This study investigates premonsoon (April) thundercloud properties over Northeastern (Kohima, 25.6°N, 94.1°E) and Eastern (Rampurhat, 24.2°N, 87.8°E) India. Thunderclouds were detected using Electric Field Mills (EFM-100) and Lightning Detectors (LD-350), while the WRF model was employed to simulate thundercloud properties. Simulations were performed across all 30 days in each region, regardless of actual thundercloud occurrence, to assess the model's accuracy in differentiating thundercloud and non-thundercloud days. The regional variability of cloud-to-ground (CG) flash density was well represented by the model, with higher flash densities in Rampurhat (mean: 39 × 10−4 km−2 h−1) compared to Kohima (mean: 31 × 10−4 km−2 h−1), consistent with observations. However, the model exhibited a slight overestimation in Kohima and an underestimation in Rampurhat, with spatiotemporal deviations from observations in both regions. Despite this, the simulations effectively captured regional differences in dynamical parameters (vertical velocity, wind shear) and microphysical properties (mixing ratios: qice, qgraupel, qcloud), with Rampurhat showing higher values overall. Six stability indices were evaluated to determine the most reliable indicator for distinguishing thundercloud/non-thundercloud days. In Kohima, the TT index (≥ 38 °C) was most effective, while in Rampurhat, CAPE (≥ 1680 J kg−1) proved more suitable, suggesting that distinct physical mechanisms drive thundercloud development in these regions. The dichotomous detection results for all 30 days in Kohima (Rampurhat) yielded 14 (21) successful detections, 5 (1) misses, 3 (1) false alarms, and 8 (7) correct rejections. We introduced the Correct Rejection Rate (CRR) to assess the model's performance in detecting non-thundercloud days, which showed better accuracy over Rampurhat than Kohima. The study underscores the heightened complexity of predicting thunderclouds over the hilly terrain of Northeastern India compared to the flatter terrain of Eastern India and offers valuable insights for improving strategies to mitigate lightning hazards."

The hydrological processes from evapotranspiration to precipitation reshape the distribution of surface water resources, and a thorough understanding of these processes can contribute to water resources management. China has experienced vegetation greening in recent years. How China’s evapotranspiration, particularly vegetation-related evapotranspiration (transpiration and interception loss), regulates its own water resources effectiveness and the precipitation in surrounding countries remains unclear. Using a high-quality global atmospheric moisture connectivity, evapotranspiration, and precipitation dataset, we find that the regulatory effect of evapotranspiration on precipitation is most pronounced in summer. Annually in China, 57% of the moisture generated by evapotranspiration stays within China, accounting for 39.54% of precipitation sources. The remaining moisture is transported abroad, providing an important source of precipitation for the neighboring countries, especially North Korea and Mongolia. Although grasslands and bare areas contribute much less moisture than croplands and forests, they serve as critical moisture sources for the arid interior of China and Mongolia. Vegetation in China has a negative net hydrological effect domestically, which tends to increase across most parts of the country from 2000 to 2020. This research highlights the critical role of vegetation in the transboundary distribution of water resources through moisture transport and provides new insights for sustainable development of water resources."

Although the instruments had no range overlap, turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rates were estimated through various methods in convective boundary layers. Hourly averaged estimates showed good agreement, within a factor of approximately 2, suggesting that both instruments and methods provide consistent dissipation rate values. 
 From 21 August to 15 September 2022, a WindCube v2 infrared coherent Doppler lidar (DL) supplied by EKO Instruments Co. (Japan) was deployed at the Shigaraki MU Observatory (Japan) near the LQ7 UHF (1.357 GHz) wind profiler in routine operation. Horizontal and vertical velocity measurements from the DL were reliably obtained in the [40–300] m height range with vertical and temporal resolutions of 20 m and 4 s, respectively. The LQ7 wind measurements are collected with range and temporal resolutions of 100 m and 59 s, respectively, and 10 min average profiles are calculated after data quality control. Reliable LQ7 Doppler data are collected from a height of 400 m. Despite the lack of overlap in the height range, we compared the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate ε in the daytime planetary boundary layer estimated by the two instruments. A method based on the calculation of the one-dimensional transverse line spectrum of the vertical velocity W from mean W time series (TS method) was applied to DL (εDL). The same method was also applied to 1 min LQ7 data (εLQ7TS) to assess its performance with respect to DL despite the poorer time resolution. A more standard method based on the Doppler spectral width (DS) was also applied to LQ7 (εLQ7DS) from the 10 min average profiles. We tested recently proposed models of the form ε=σ3/L, where σ is half the spectral width corrected for non-turbulent effects, and L is assumed to be a constant or a fraction of the depth D of the convective boundary layer (CBL). The main results are the following: (1) For the deepest CBLs (max(D)>∼1.0 km) that develop under high atmospheric pressure, the time–height cross-sections of εLQ7DS and εDL show very consistent patterns and do not show any substantial gaps in the transition region of 300–400 m when εLQ7DS is evaluated with L∼70 m, which is found to be about one-tenth of the average of the CBL depth (L∼0.1D). (2) Hourly mean εDL averaged over the [100–300] m height range is on average about twice the hourly mean εLQ7TS averaged over the [400–500] m height range when D>∼1.0 km. (3) Hourly mean εDL averaged over the [100–300] m height range and hourly mean εLQ7DS averaged over the [400–500] m height range with L∼0.1D are identical on average. Consistent with the fact that ε is expected to decrease slightly with height in the mixed layer, results (2) and (3) imply an uncertainty as to the exact value of the L/D ratio: ∼0.1D<L<∼0.2D. We have also studied in detail the case of a shallow (D<∼0.6 km) convective boundary layer that developed under low atmospheric pressure and cloudy conditions. Despite the fact that hourly mean εDL averaged over the [100–300] m height range and hourly mean εLQ7TS averaged over the [400–500] m height range show more significant discrepancies, maybe due to the different properties of the shallow convection, the time–height cross-sections of εDL and εLQ7DS show more consistent patterns and levels."

 Phosphorus (P) surplus in soils significantly contributes to the eutrophication and degradation of water quality in surface waters worldwide. Despite extensive European regulations, elevated P levels persist in many water bodies across the continent. Long-term annual data on soil P surplus (the difference between P inputs and outputs) are essential to understand these levels and guide future management strategies.

The dataset includes 48 P surplus estimates that account for uncertainties arising from different methodological choices and coefficients in major components of the P surplus. Our results indicate substantial changes in P surplus magnitude over the past 100 years, underscoring the importance of understanding a long-term P surplus.

The map’s low detail and oversimplified approach caused it to overestimate fire risk in areas with less flammable vegetation, limiting its usefulness for wildfire research and planning. 
 Classifying and mapping vegetation as fuel is essential for various fire research and management applications. Aragoneses et al. (2023) proposed a hierarchical fuel classification system for Europe and allocated standard fuel models to the resulting fuel types, producing a continental fuel map. We examine the methods involved and their outcomes. The reasoning behind their system is misguided, as the proposed set of fuel types does not reflect fuel-complex characteristics and the inherent fire behaviour. In their categorization of shrublands and grasslands, fuel depth is a key variable; however, the bioclimatic modelling approach used to map it is unreliable, as it is based on local empirical relationships. The adopted 1-km mapping resolution is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the needs of spatially-explicit fire behaviour simulation, and implied up-scaling procedures adding uncertainty due to loss of thematic detail. Finally, a simplistic aridity-based rule was applied to assign fuel models to fuel types, limiting the options available. This, in combination with fuel-depth overestimation and untenable fuel model choices, contributed to a substantial fire-hazard overestimation across the large portion of Europe occupied by low-flammability cover types."

Data quality is significantly improved through integration. The integrated dataset is now publicly available for easy access and use by the academic community and the public. These datasets are of great significance for optimizing historical geomagnetic field models, investigating changing magnetic fields, the main geomagnetic field. 
 Decades to centuries of continuous geomagnetic observation data have extensive scientific research and practical application value, especially in revealing the long-term variation rules of the geomagnetic field, which is irreplaceable. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), China established geomagnetic observatories in Beijing, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Urumqi, forming the initial structure of China's geomagnetic observation network together with the Shanghai Observatory. These observatories have continuously observed despite facing many challenges since their establishment, accumulating a large amount of valuable observational data, making significant contributions to the progress of geomagnetic scientific research and development. However, the scattered storage state of these historical data and the potential risk of damage pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of the data. This study conducted a rescue integration of the historical observational data from eight pioneering geomagnetic observatories in China, significantly improving data quality and facilitating long-term preservation and use of the data. This article introduces the basic conditions of eight observatories, including their locations, changes in location, observation environments, magnetic rooms, the magnetism of building materials, the layout of building facilities, measuring instruments, etc. These are the main prerequisites and foundations for ensuring the quality of observation data. Then, it introduces the integration and processing of historical data, including data collection, digitization, unification of formats, anomaly detection, and processing. Subsequently, the processed data were validated, including assessments of daily variations accuracy and long-term stability. The results show that the quality of the integrated historical data has been significantly improved. These datasets are of great value for improving historical geomagnetic field models, studying variable fields, main geomagnetic fields, and their long-term variations. Finally, we applied the data to the analysis and research of Sq and geomagnetic jerks, exploring the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of Sq and jerk in the China. Sq is mainly a daytime phenomenon, and its variation pattern in the middle and low latitude regions is mainly characterized by its dependence on latitude and local time. The geomagnetic jerk phenomenon exhibits significant regional differences and asynchronous occurrence times of jerks. Jerk events in 1969, 1979, 1991, 2003, and 2019 were observed at all observatories and had distinct jerk variation characteristics. Other jerks were only observed at some observatories or individual observatories. The maximum time difference for the occurrence of the same jerk event at different observatories was 2 years. This study aims to provide these precious datasets to the scientific community and the public so that these data can be integrated with data from other sources, thereby further exploring the spatiotemporal evolution and physical mechanisms of the geomagnetic field.

This method can contribute to the estimation of near–surface analysis uncertainty in both nowcasting applications and ensemble nowcasting development. 
 This study proposes a method to quantify uncertainty represented by errors in very-high-resolution near-surface analysis, specifically for weather nowcasting applications. Gaussian distributed perturbations are used to perturb the first guess and observation with a variance equal to that of the first-guess error. This error reflects the spatial characteristics of the difference between the first guess and observations and dominates the primary sources of analysis uncertainty. However, mapping perturbations to analyse the grid mesh through interpolation results in underdispersion, particularly in areas without stations. To address this issue, Gaussian perturbations are inflated with an inflation factor to amplify the dispersion. This method was applied to high-resolution analysis and nowcasting for hourly temperature, humidity, and wind components in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region to assess its effectiveness in representing uncertainty. The generated ensemble analysis exhibits reasonable spread and high reliability, indicating accurate quantification of analysis uncertainty. Ensemble nowcasting is extrapolated from ensemble analysis to evaluate the transmission of perturbation during extrapolation. Verification results of ensemble nowcasting reflect the fact that the spread increases effectively during extrapolation up to a lead time of 6 h. However, the increase in the spread is highly dependent on the persistence of numerical weather prediction. The results demonstrate that generating appropriate perturbations based on analysis errors effectively represents the analysis uncertainty and contributes to estimating uncertainty in nowcasting."

Callaghan;Andrew D. Wickert;Richard Barnes;Jacqueline Austermann,The Water Table Model (WTM) (v2.0.1): coupled groundwater  and dynamic lake modelling,"We present the Water Table Model (WTM), a new model for simulating groundwater and lake levels at continental scales over millennia. The WTM enables long-term evaluations of water-table changes. As a proof of concept, we simulate the North American water table for the present and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), showing that North America held more groundwater and lake water during the LGM than it does today – enough to lower sea levels by 14.98 cm. The open-source code is available on GitHub. 
 Ice-free land comprises 26 % of the Earth's surface and holds liquid water that delineates ecosystems, affects global geochemical cycling, and modulates sea levels. However, we currently lack the capacity to simulate and predict these terrestrial water changes across the full range of relevant spatial (watershed to global) and temporal (monthly to millennial) scales. To address this knowledge gap, we present the Water Table Model (WTM), which integrates coupled components to compute dynamic lake and groundwater levels. The groundwater component solves the 2D horizontal groundwater flow equation using non-linear equation solvers from the C++ PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) library. The dynamic lake component makes use of the Fill–Spill–Merge (FSM) algorithm to move surface water into lakes, where it may evaporate or affect groundwater flow. In a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrate the continental-scale capabilities of the WTM by simulating the steady-state climate-driven water table for the present day and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 calendar years before present) across the North American continent. During the LGM, North America stored an additional 14.98 cm of sea-level equivalent (SLE) in lakes and groundwater compared to the climate-driven present-day scenario. We compare the present-day result to other simulations and real-world data. Open-source code for the WTM is available on GitHub and Zenodo."

Accurate modeling of tropospheric delays is critical to achieving high-precision GNSS solutions, and using external delays can improve real-time GNSS convergence times. Current empirical delay models only provide delay but not uncertainty. We propose a global empirical delay model with uncertainty and demonstrate its benefits in accelerating GNSS positioning convergence. 
 Accurate modeling of tropospheric delay is important for high-precision data analysis of space geodetic techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Empirical tropospheric delay models provide zenith delays with an accuracy of 3 to 4 cm globally and do not rely on external meteorological input. They are thus important for providing a priori delays and serving as constraint information to improve the convergence of real-time GNSS positioning, and in the latter case proper weighting is critical. Currently, empirical tropospheric delay models only provide delay values but not the uncertainty of delays. For the first time, we present a global empirical tropospheric delay model, which provides both the zenith delay and the corresponding uncertainty, based on 10 years of tropospheric delays from numerical weather models (NWMs). The model is based on a global grid and, at each grid point, a set of parameters that describes the delay and uncertainty in the constant, annual, and semiannual terms. The empirically modeled zenith delay has agreements of 36 and 38 mm compared to 3-year delay values from the NWM and 4-year estimates from GNSS stations, which is comparable to previous models such as Global Pressure and Temperature 3 (GPT3). The modeled zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) uncertainty shows a correlation of 96 % with the accuracy of the empirical ZTD model over 380 GNSS stations over the 4 years. For GNSS stations where the uncertainty annual amplitude is larger than 20 mm, the temporal correlation between the formal error and smoothed accuracy reaches 85 %. Using GPS observations from ∼ 200 globally distributed IGS stations processed in kinematic precise point positioning (PPP) mode over 4 months in 2020, we demonstrate that using proper constraints can improve the convergence speed. The formal error modeling is based on a similar dataset to that of the GPT series, and thus it is also applicable for these empirical models."

Here, we incorporate the formation of isoprene epoxydiol secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX-SOA) in individual droplets within a one-dimensional explicit mixing parcel model (EMPM-Chem). We apply EMPM-Chem to simulate turbulence and droplet-resolved IEPOX-SOA formation using a laboratory cloud chamber configuration. We find that the dissolution of IEPOX gases is weighted more toward larger cloud droplets due to their large liquid water content (compared to smaller droplets), while the conversion of dissolved IEPOX to IEPOX-SOA is much greater within smaller deliquesced haze particles due to their higher acidity and ionic strengths compared to cloud droplets. We also apply the EMPM-Chem model to simulate how IEPOX-SOA formation evolves in individual cloud droplets within rising cloudy parcels in the atmosphere. We find that as subsaturated air is entrained into and turbulently mixed with the cloud parcel, evaporation causes a reduction in droplet sizes, which leads to corresponding increases in per droplet ionic strength and acidity. Increased droplet acidity, in turn, greatly accelerates the kinetics of IEPOX-SOA formation. Our results provide key insights into single cloud-droplet chemistry, suggesting that entrainment mixing may be an important process that increases SOA formation in the real atmosphere."

Here, through systematic characterization of emissions from a typical apartment in a Chinese megacity (Shenzhen), we show that indoor environments contribute significantly to the levels of ambient (i.e., outdoor) VOCs. In particular, we observe that the majority of indoor VOCs originate from unoccupied spaces, demonstrating temperature-dependent release from indoor surface reservoirs. The total indoor-to-outdoor VOC emission rates varied from 53 to 2300 mg day–1 (median 230 mg day–1) during unoccupied periods, influenced by both the air exchange rate and indoor temperature. Reanalysis of literature data from various building studies worldwide corroborates our findings and reveals that indoor-to-outdoor emissions scale with room volume, with an average emission rate of 0.33 ± 0.03 mg h–1 m–3. Our study implies that indoor-to-outdoor emissions significantly contribute to urban VOC levels, rivaling traditional urban sources, e.g., power generation and biomass burning. This is particularly true for oxygenated VOCs, such as methanol, amounting to ∼60% of transportation emissions. The findings change our understanding of the role of indoor VOC contributions to outdoor air quality, whose importance will increase as controls on industrial and transportation emissions intensify."

However, no human studies have examined the effects of perinatal exposure to emerging bisphenol alternatives [bisphenol G, bisphenol M, and bisphenol BP (BPBP)] on small for gestational age (SGA) and how placental function may mediate the relationship. Here, 13 urinary bisphenol analogues were detected in 1054 contemporary pregnant women, and BPA was still the most dominant congener. Logistic regressions identified BPA and its traditional alternatives [bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol Z, and bisphenol AP (BPAP)] as being associated with an elevated risk of SGA (all ORs > 1.80, P < 0.05). In contrast, the emerging substitutes, despite high occurrences, all showed much attenuated risk. Mixture effect models Bayesian kernel machine regression and quantile-based g-computation demonstrated that coexposure to bisphenols was strongly correlated with SGA risk (OR = 2.70, P < 0.001), with BPA and the conventional substitutes (BPB, BPE, and BPAP) as primary effect drivers, outweighing the effect from emerging substitutes. Finally, mediation analysis revealed that the placental function index estriol mediated the relationship between exposure and SGA, dominated by BPBP (25.4%). Our findings provide new epidemiological evidence that early BPA alternatives may pose a higher risk for offspring development than those emerging alternatives, potentially via mediation by compromised placental function.

These non-commodity plastics suffer from inconsistent definitions, complex classifications, and data gaps, which hinder accurate assessment of their production, use, and end-of-life management. This study develops dynamic material flow analysis to investigate 12 key “non-commodity” plastics in China─including PET, PU, seven engineering plastics, and three thermosetting plastics─and addresses these knowledge gaps. Our results show that in 2022, China produces approximately 85 million tonnes of these polymers, a volume comparable to commodity plastics, with 35% used in plastic products and the remainder in non-plastic applications (e.g., fibers, rubber). PET is predominantly employed in short-lifespan packaging, whereas PU, engineering plastics, and thermosetting plastics find use in longer-lifespan applications, underscoring the need for targeted recycling strategies─particularly chemical recycling for PU and thermoset products. Revisiting the scope of “plastics” using scientific criteria can help mitigate definitional ambiguities and guide more effective policymaking. By improving data availability and tracking this underexplored non-commodity category, our study lays the groundwork for more accurate assessments and interventions to reduce plastic pollution."

 Thermokarst lakes, serving as significant sources of methane (CH4), play a crucial role in affecting the feedback of permafrost carbon cycle to global warming. However, accurately assessing CH4 emissions from these lakes remains challenging due to limited observations during lake ice melting periods. In this study, by integrating field surveys with machine learning modeling, we offer a comprehensive assessment of present and future CH4 emissions from thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal that the previously underestimated CH4 release from lake ice bubble and water storage during ice melting periods is 11.2 ± 1.6 Gg C of CH4, accounting for 17 ± 4% of the annual total release from lakes. Despite thermokarst lakes cover only 0.2% of the permafrost area, they annually emit 65.5 ± 10.0 Gg C of CH4, which offsets 6.4% of the net carbon sink in alpine grasslands on the plateau. Considering the loss of lake ice, the expansion of thermokarst lakes is projected to lead to 1.1–1.2 folds increase in CH4 emissions by 2100.

 The microenvironment regulation of Fe-N4 single atom catalysts (SACs) critically governs peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Although conventional heteroatom substitution in primary coordination enhances activity, it disrupts Fe-N4 symmetry and compromises stability. Herein, we propose oxygen doping in the secondary coordination shell to construct Fe-N4-C6O2 SAC, which amplifies the localized electric field while preserving the pristine coordination symmetry, thus trading off its activity and stability. This approach suppresses Fe-N bond structural deformation (bond amplitude reduced from 0.875–3.175 Å to 0.925–2.975 Å) during PMS activation by lowering Fe center electron density to strengthen Fe-N bond, achieving extended catalytic durability (>240 h). Simultaneously, the weakened coordination field lowers the Fe=O σ* orbital energy, promoting electrophilic σ-attack of high-valent iron-oxo towards bisphenol A, and increasing its degradation rate by 41.6-fold. This work demonstrates secondary coordination engineering as a viable strategy to resolve the activity-stability trade-off in SAC design, offering promising perspectives for developing environmental catalysts.

 An exciton–polariton condensate is a state of matter with collective coherence leading to many fascinating macroscopic quantum effects. Recently, optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been demonstrated as peculiar topological states capable of imparting novel characteristics onto the polariton condensates. Organic semiconductors featuring robust Frenkel excitons and high physicochemical tunability potentially offer a promising platform to explore topologically engineering of BIC polariton condensates at room temperature. However, a universal physical mechanism for engineering organic BIC systems has remained elusive, hindering the demonstration of BIC polariton condensates with topologically tunable macroscopic quantum effects. Here we report topologically reconfigurable room-temperature polariton condensates by systematically engineering the BICs in organic semiconductor metasurfaces. Two-dimensional organic metasurfaces are designed to support two polariton BICs with different topological charges. The organic Frenkel excitons with large binding energies allow for non-equilibrium polariton condensation at BICs at room-temperature. By virtue of the excellent physicochemical tunability of organic materials, we further explore the dynamic topological engineering of polariton lasers by manipulating the BICs in situ.

 Mid-latitude weather systems play a significant role in causing floods, wind damage, and related societal impacts. Advances in numerical modeling and observational methods have led to the development of numerous conceptual models in mid-latitude synoptic and dynamical research. As these models proliferate, integrating new insights into a cohesive understanding can be challenging. This paper uses a kinematic perspective to interpret mid-latitude research in a way that synthesises various concepts and create a schematic diagram of an atmospheric river lifecycle. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite varying methods, definitions, and terminology used to describe extratropical cyclones, warm conveyor belt airflows, and atmospheric rivers, the underlying mechanisms driving their formation and development are consistent. Thus, while studying these features independently is valuable, it is important to recognise that they are all part of a larger atmospheric flow pattern. We hope this kinematic approach will serve as a bridge to link research on these phenomena."

 The Archean Earth was characterized by a persistent reducing atmosphere, while the occurrence of transient atmospheric oxygenation events—whiff of oxygen—has been suggested, the precise nature and causes of which remain elusive. Here we used a biogeochemical model, corroborating the eruption of large igneous provinces as a plausible mechanistic explanation for these transient oxygenation events. Our results show that biogeochemical dynamics induced by eruptions of large igneous provinces could have caused transient increases in atmospheric oxygen levels lasting for more than several million years. Notably, we show that continental growth would have mitigated conditions for transient oxygenation. This may imply that the whiffs during the late Archean infer that the Earth system was approaching a tipping point for the permanent oxidation of the atmosphere. Our results highlight the mechanistic link between planetary volcanic activities and the dynamic evolution of the atmosphere at the dawn of the Great Oxidation Event.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an indispensable factor for comprehending of surface equilibrium state on the Earth. In particular, satellites can continuously provide LST data and support the large-scale monitoring of LST with a high temporal resolution; however, satellite data may be easily contaminated by clouds. Previous satellite-based all-sky LST reconstruction approaches have inherent limitations, such as low temporal resolution and insufficient consideration of cloud effects. Therefore, this study aims to propose a novel methodology for all-sky 2-km hourly LST reconstruction from GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) using machine learning and timely weighted accumulated radiation to reflect the temporal variation of cloud effects. The light gradient boosting machine approach used the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Land variables (i.e., LST, 2 m air temperature, evaporation, and wind), GK2A products (i.e., short and longwave radiation, and binary cloud cover), and auxiliary variables including geographic variables as independent variables. The GK2A LST and in situ measurements were used as dependent variables. The proposed model showed robust spatial agreement with GK2A LST under clear-sky conditions when conducting five-fold spatial cross-validation, with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.97–0.99. In the leave one station-out cross-validation using 36 in situ data under all-sky conditions, the proposed model showed high performance with R2 values of 0.86–0.97, root mean square error values of 1.42–2.60 °C, and bias values of −0.49–0.23 °C. In a comparison of the proposed model with two scenarios and previous research investigating the effect of accumulated radiation, we demonstrated that the use of accumulated radiation was effective in reconstructing cloudy-sky LST, particularly during the daytime, as evident from the variable analysis conducted through Shapley additive explanations. Using the proposed model, we successfully reconstructed a spatiotemporally seamless LST, which can serve as a fundamental dataset for hourly heat-related research, such as hourly heat flow estimation and urban heat island analysis."

In this study, we assess the contribution of human-induced climate change to fire weather conditions over the summer of 2022 using simulations from the HadGEM3-A model with and without anthropogenic emissions and apply the Canadian Fire Weather Index. Our analysis reveals at least a 6-fold increase in the probability of very high fire weather in the UK due to human influence, most of which is driven by high fire conditions across England.

Several assumptions were made when framing conventions that remain in practice, however recent advances offer potentially more consistent and inclusive accounting of greenhouse gases. We apply these advances, namely: consistent gross accounting of CO2 sources; linking land use emissions with sectors; using emissions-based effective radiative forcing (ERF) rather than global warming potentials to compare emissions; including both warming and cooling emissions, and including loss of additional sink capacity. We compare these results with conventional accounting and find that this approach boosts perceived carbon emissions from deforestation, and finds agriculture, the most extensive land user, to be the leading emissions sector and to have caused 60% (32%–87%) of ERF change since 1750. We also find that fossil fuels are responsible for 18% of ERF, a reduced contribution due to masking from cooling co-emissions. We test the validity of this accounting and find it useful for determining sector responsibility for present-day warming and for framing policy responses, while recognising the dangers of assigning value to cooling emissions, due to health impacts and future warming."

While it is clear that sweeping deforestation by miners has resulted in substantial loss of above-ground carbon stocks and increased greenhouse emissions, the region also harbors a sizable below-ground carbon stock in the form of peatlands, and how these have fared against decades of mining expansion is uncertain. Here, we use Landsat’s continuous archival record spanning over 35 years to monitor the expansion of gold mining in a major Amazonian peat complex along the alluvial plain of the Madre de Dios River. We detect over 550 ha of peatland surface area that has been lost to gold mining, potentially accounting for between 0.2 and 0.7 Tg of emitted below-ground carbon. Alarmingly, the majority of this loss (55%) has occurred within the past two years. Mining inside peatlands currently accounts for 9% of total mining, but projections suggest a 25% share by 2027 as mining within peatland is accelerating considerably faster than mining in the alluvial plain as a whole. The startling surge of peatland degradation is synchronous with the arrival of an aggressive mining front into the most distal reaches of the alluvial plain where peatlands are most abundant. Already, 63 of 219 peatlands in the alluvial plain show evidence of mining within their borders, putting over 10 000 ha of peatland area and between 3.5 and 14.5 TgC at imminent risk.

While the area under subsistence agriculture had a marginal expansion, local communities perceived that the changes in LULC resulted in a decline in households’ food availability, water availability and soil fertility. The study concludes that changes in LULC are associated with significant losses in natural assets and ecosystems. These loses in natural assets have significant effects on the livelihoods of community members. Therefore, there is a need for instituting a participatory land use planning approach in the affected communities to mitigate the effects of the LULC changes. This will also help in fostering sustainable natural resource management within the affected communities."

However, Earth system models offer conflicting projections of future drought and vegetation activity in North America, and in-depth analyses of the long-term changes in greenness and its relationship with underlying climate drivers, considering both spatial and temporal variations at the ecosystem scale, are lacking. This study analyzes 20 year (2001–2020) MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) observations to assess greenness trends in CONUS drylands and their relationship with climate drivers at 1 km spatial resolution. Results indicate a large scale and systematic greening trend, particularly in the northern Great Plains (NGP) region. Using an empirical linear attribution approach and empirical orthogonal function analysis, we uncover varied relationships between greenness trends and climate drivers, particularly highlighting the dominant role of increased precipitation in driving the observed greening. Trend analysis reveals that while rain use efficiency (RUE) remains stable in most areas, increases in the NGP region suggest potential CO2 fertilization effects, while decreases in southern states correlate with rising temperatures. We also develop an efficiency-based model featuring RUE which successfully reproduces historical NDVI, re-confirming the dominant influence of precipitation in local greenness interannual variability. However, CMIP6 projections for 2021–2040 under the ‘Regional Rivalry’ scenario (SSP370) paint a worrying picture, with projected browning in the NGP region and states near the 42°N latitude, contrasting recent greening trends. This potential reversal underscores the vulnerability of these ecosystems to future climate change, highlighting the need to consider both historical trends and future climate projections when assessing the resilience of drylands ecosystems. Overall, our work re-emphasizes the significance of water availability to drylands vegetation growth and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of carbon-water cycling in arid and semi-arid regions."

However, to date, knowledge of the trade-offs and synergies between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) reduction, carbon sequestration, and food provisioning under different agricultural practices remains limited, with most studies focusing on global and national scales. The present study implements the generalized representation of agro-food system model coupled with the soil organic carbon (SOC) AMG model in the Tuojiang River Basin, China, to assess the effects of 24 agricultural scenarios on SOC stock, the GHG budget, nitrogen (N) surplus, and export capacity at the county level in 2035. We considered viable options by modifying four levers: (i) synthetic fertilizer inputs, (ii) livestock population size and the fraction of animal proteins in the human diet, (iii) the share of legumes in crop rotation, and (iv) the proportion of straw used for bioenergy production. We found that the potential of biofuels to substitute fossil fuel emissions remains low across all scenarios, reducing by 2.9%–5.3% of current emissions. Our results also reveal synergies in reducing GHG emissions and N pollution, with reductions of 39%–43% and 26%–52%, respectively, under agro-ecological scenarios with zero N fertilizer application and halving of the livestock population. In contrast, trade-offs were identified between SOC sequestration and export capacity, both of which were lower in agro-ecological scenarios than in the others."

Supercooled liquid water and conical graupel are likely present, while chain-like ice crystals may occur at cloud top. Ice crystals are vertically aligned seconds before lightning and resume their usual horizontal alignment afterwards in some cases. Updrafts and downdrafts are found near cloud core and edges respectively. Turbulence is strong. Radar measurement modes that are more suited for investigating thunderstorms are recommended. 
 Lightning is a natural phenomenon that can be dangerous to humans. It is therefore challenging to study thunderstorm clouds using direct observations since it can be dangerous to fly into them. In this study, a cloud radar at 35 GHz with 45° elevation is used to study the properties and dynamics of thunderstorm clouds. It is based on a thunderstorm case on 18 June 2021 from 16:10 to 17:45 UTC near Cabauw, the Netherlands. The observed thunderstorm was associated with severe weather conditions over The Netherlands, attributed to the remnants of storm “Bill”. The time and location of individual lightning strikes are determined using the BLIDS system, operated by Siemens, which is based on the time-of-arrival principle. Concurrently, spectral polarimetry in the millimetre band – an innovative technique not previously applied in thunderstorm cloud studies – is employed to elucidate the behaviour of various particle types within a radar resolution volume. Spectral polarimetric radar variables are also used to look for vertical alignment of ice crystals that is expected due to electric torque. Due to challenges posed by non-Rayleigh scattering, scattering simulations are carried out to aid the interpretation of spectral polarimetric variables. It is shown that the start of the Mie regime in the Doppler spectrum can be clearly identified by the use of the spectral differential phase. Furthermore, variations in the location of the first Mie minimum across different spectral polarimetric variables may be attributed to different sensitivities of these variables to particle shape and ice fraction. From the results, there is a high chance that supercooled liquid water and conical graupel are present in the investigated thunderstorm clouds. There is also a possibility of ice crystals arranged in chains at the cloud top. Ice crystals become vertically aligned a few seconds before lightning and return to their usual horizontal alignment afterwards. However, this phenomenon has been witnessed in only a few cases of cloud-to-cloud lightning, specifically when the lightning strike is in close proximity to the radar's line of sight or when the lightning is strong. Doppler analyses show that updrafts are found near the core of the thunderstorm cloud, while downdrafts are observed at the edges. Strong turbulence is also observed as shown by the large Doppler spectrum width."

The geospatial data presented in the article correspond to the contextual indicators of the monitoring and evaluation framework of the Common Agricultural Policy. Our exploratory analysis reveals several interesting patterns which contribute to the broader debate on the future of European agriculture. 
 International organizations have voiced the need to integrate geographical information from agricultural holdings into official statistics to gain a better understanding of the spatial dynamics of the European agricultural sector. This paper presents a set of thematic maps based on the European 2020 agricultural census to explore the major structural differences between regions and countries. To comply with the confidentiality requirements associated with the census data, we applied a multi-resolution gridded approach by varying the resolution of the grid cells as a function of the density, dominance, and quality of individual observations. The data sets contain a mixture of grid resolutions ranging from 1 km to 40 km, preserving a hierarchical structure where higher resolution grids are aggregated into lower levels until the statistical disclosure requirements are met. The variables presented here correspond to the Contextual Indicators of the Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and are divided into three broad categories: structural components (i.e., agricultural holdings, land use, livestock patterns, and labor input); the demographics of farmers (i.e., age, gender, and skills); and agricultural production methods (i.e., irrigation and organic farming). Our exploratory analysis indicates that high farm density occurs in plains and lowlands, as well as fertile soil areas in valleys, high shares of organic farming tend to be concentrated in certain areas with high proportions of grassland, and agricultural holdings managed by young farmers are located in a belt stretching from France through to Switzerland, Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland. These novel data sets are highly versatile, allowing not only policies to evaluate funding schemes at more local levels, but they also offer researchers new opportunities to draw causal spatial inference from the multi-resolution gridded data. The IFSGRID dataset is the first attempt to create an unprecedented harmonized view of European agriculture with high spatial resolution, and it is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14852709 (Eurostat, 2025)."

 We developed an emulator for integrated assessment models (emIAM) based on a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve approach.

We tested the performance of emIAM by coupling it with the simple climate model ACC2 (ACC2–emIAM). Our analysis showed that the optimizing climate–economy model ACC2–emIAM adequately reproduced a majority of the original IAM emission outcomes under similar conditions. This can facilitate systematic exploration of IAMs with small computational resources. emIAM holds the potential to enhance the capabilities of simple climate models as a tool for calculating cost-effective pathways directly aligned with temperature targets."

In this paper, we are addressing the question of (radio)cobalt speciation upon bioaccumulation in the sentinel organism Mytilus galloprovincialis after in vivo contamination in a pseudo-natural system. For this study, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gamma spectroscopy were used to quantify the cobalt distribution in the various organs: hepatopancreas, gills, visceral mass, mantle, foot, and byssus, as well as in subcellular compartments. Two X-ray spectroscopic techniques were used to decipher cobalt speciation and localization, bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS with EXAFS and XANES regimes), and micro X-ray fluorescence imaging (μ-XRF). Lastly, secondary ion mass spectrometry images provided information on cobalt distribution at a subcellular scale. The accumulation of cobalt exhibits significant differences depending on the origin of the individuals, with higher concentration factor values for mussels from the Toulon Naval Base (considered as polluted) compared to Villefranche sur Mer, France (considered as unpolluted). However, concentration in organs always follows the same order: byssus ≫ hepatopancreas ≫ other organs. In terms of spatial distribution, cobalt has been visualized in the hepatopancreas, revealing the presence of preferred zones within some digestive cells and this could be linked to detoxification mechanisms. Finally, the determination of speciation data using XAS suggested the presence of a Co(II)-metallothionein complex in the hepatopancreas and a potential Co(II)-mfp-1 complex in the byssus. While they can be challenging, accumulation and speciation studies in radioecology are essential steps for a comprehensive approach to the impact of trace metallic radionuclides on the marine biota."

Brittle tremor patches embedded in the ductile matrix deforming aseismically is the most common concept for the fault structure, but whether tremors and their patches impact the SSE initiation is under debate. This study focuses on 13 initiations of major Cascadia ETS. Limited observational constraints exist on the details of ETS initiation because spatiotemporal SSE inversions usually over‐smooth their temporal evolution. Scrutinizing tremors and SSE at the beginning of major ETS events gives us insights into their mechanical relationship. We directly retrieve the temporal evolution of the SSE moment by stacking sub‐daily Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at multiple sites, without slip inversions. Comparison of the GPS stack with tremor count demonstrates that SSE moment release accelerates drastically ∼ ${\sim} $1 day after the onset of vigorous tremor activity. On the other hand, once the SSE moment release accelerates, the tremor area expands more rapidly, suggesting that the growth of the ETS occurs through a feedback mechanism between slip and tremor once the SSE is well developed. By combining these and previous observations, we propose a conceptual model of ETS initiation: heterogeneous interface strength limits the growth of SSE with unruptured tremor patches acting as relatively high‐strength pins contributing to this heterogeneity. In other words, major ETS emerges probably only when collective tremor patches are critically stressed."

Advanced event‐based detection methods offer novel insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of heatwaves. However, robust assessments of heatwave trends remain challenging due to the sensitivity of results to parameter selection, including connected structure, area threshold, and overlap ratio. Here, we employed 3‐dimensional connected detection algorithm (3DCDA) to explore the dependency of heatwave identifications on various parameter combinations. The results indicate that heatwave metrics are sensitive to 3DCDA parameters, with the appropriate combination for large‐scale heatwaves being overlap ratio of 40%–50%, area threshold of 106 km2, and 10‐connected structure. Based on this configuration, we discovered significant increasing trends in heatwave frequency, projection area and total magnitude, while observed a decrease in maximum intensity and area mean intensity both annually and during summer.

Synergistic interactions (i.e., increased UHI intensities under HWs) are observed over the eastern and western U.S. However, negative interactions are found in the Central U.S. due to the stronger inhibition of rural evapotranspiration by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) stresses. The interactions between UHIs and HWs in the Central U.S. will be further reduced along with the elevated VPD stresses in a hotter future.

 The interaction between glacier fronts and ocean waters is one of the key uncertainties for projecting future ice mass loss. Direct observations at glacier fronts are sparse, but studies indicate that the magnitude and timing of freshwater fluxes are crucial in determining fjord circulation, ice frontal melt and ecosystem habitability. In particular, wintertime dynamics are severely understudied due to inaccessible conditions, leading to a bias towards summer observations. Here we present in situ observations of temperature and salinity acquired in late winter in Greenland at the front of a marine-terminating glacier and in surrounding fjords. Our observations indicate the existence of an anomalously fresh pool of water by the glacier front, suggesting that meltwater generated at the bed of the glacier discharges during winter. The results suggest that warm Atlantic water and nutrients are entrained at the glacier front, leading to enhanced frontal melt and increased nutrient levels.

Here, the authors show how airway epithelial structure impacts clearance by mapping cilia distribution, comparing human and rat airways, and developing quantitative models to assess function. 
 Mucociliary clearance is a vital defense mechanism of the human airways, protecting against harmful particles and infections. When this process fails, it contributes to respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. While advances in single-cell transcriptomics have revealed the complexity of airway composition, much of what we know about how airway structure impacts clearance relies on animal studies. This limits our ability to create accurate human-based models of airway diseases. Here we show that the airways in female rats and in humans exhibit species-specific differences in the distribution of ciliated and secretory cells as well as in ciliary beat, resulting in significantly higher clearance effectiveness in humans. We further reveal that standard lab-grown cultures exhibit lower clearance effectiveness compared to human airways, and we identify the underlying structural differences. By combining diverse experiments and physics-based modeling, we establish universal benchmarks to assess human airway function, interpret preclinical models, and better understand disease-specific impairments in mucociliary clearance.

 Atomic imaging of molecules and intermolecular interactions are of great significance for a deeper understanding of the basic physics and chemistry in various applications, but it is still challenging in electron microscopy due to their thermal mobility and beam sensitivity. Confinement effect and low-dose imaging method may efficiently help us achieve stable high-resolution resolving of molecules and their interactions. Here, we propose a general strategy to image the confined molecules and evaluate the strengths of host-guest interactions in three material systems by low-dose electron microscopy. Then, we change the guest molecules to analyze how each kind of interaction strength influences the imaging quality of these molecules by using a same parameter, the aspect ratios of imaged molecular projections. In the material systems of perovskites (ionic) and zeolites with adsorbed molecules (van der Waals), we can obtain a clear image of molecular configurations by enhancing host-guest interactions. Even in metal organic framework (coordination) system, the atomic structures and bonds of aromatics can be achieved. These results provide a general description on the relation between molecular images and interactions, making it possible to study more molecular behaviors in wide applications by real-space imaging.

PPIL BCPs, consisting of a cationic polypeptide (PTPLG) with bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (TFSI) counterion and varying lengths connected to a length-fixed neutral poly-(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) block, exhibit stable helical conformations with minimal glass transition (Tg) variation.

 Proteins with chemically regulatable phase separation are of great interest in the fields of biomolecular condensates and synthetic biology. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are the dominating building blocks of biomolecular condensates which often lack orthogonality and small-molecule regulation desired to create synthetic biomolecular condensates or membraneless organelles (MLOs).

These HDPE-like materials have the desirable bulk properties of HDPE. They can be degraded into a well-defined and easily separable macromonomer, specifically AB-like telechelic PE. The molecular weight of the macromonomer can be precisely tailored as required and depends solely on the feed ratio of [COE]/[Ester-16]. The recycled macromonomer can be easily repolymerized into a high-molecular-weight HDPE-like material. This macromonomer–polymer–macromonomer lifecycle rather than monomer–polymer–monomer lifecycle can be repeated with quantitative yields using a facile isolation process. Overall, this work opens opportunities to improve the sustainability of plastics. Developing recyclable circular plastics is a viable approach to reshape the currently unsustainable plastics consumption pattern. Here the authors show a design to obtain recyclable polyolefin plastics with a tailored macromonomer–polymer–tailored macromonomer circular lifecycle."

 The Kakhovka Dam explosion is an example of the far-reaching environmental consequences of warfare. The resulting dam collapse released some 14.4 billion cubic meters of water, flooding downstream environments and flushing unknown quantities of debris, pollutants and sediments into the north-western Black Sea. With a combined satellite and hydrological modelling approach, supported with in situ data, we assessed the short-term impact on the north-western Black Sea. The dam breach impacted more than 50% of the area of the north-western Black Sea, experiencing over 50 times the ambient Chlorophyll-a and suspended sediment concentrations. Significant increases of nitrate and phosphate were also observed in the Odesa coastal environment. This environmental shock triggered severe algal blooms within one week, that persisted for a further 20 days. This event may have impacted the biodiversity of the north-western Black Sea and its ecosystem response. Continued monitoring is required to assess the longer-term impacts.

 Disruptions in global food and energy trade can trigger cascading socio-economic losses. Financial markets can amplify such losses and generate systemic cross-sectoral effects, e.g. food insecurity. Our methodology links the real economy and financial markets to quantify cascading impacts across sectors and regions and to capture amplification effects by financial markets. Although applicable to any shock on global key commodity trade, we test its effectiveness with the Russia-Ukraine war, which reveals pronounced, regionally and sectorally diverse impacts. Comparing with real data confirms that our approach captures several key impacts of the crisis: the energy price increase in Europe, the strong reaction of European commodity future markets with large benefits for fossil companies (equity values up to +54%) and losses for companies most exposed to the belligerents (up to−6%), and the worsening of food affordability especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America (additionally 10 million people at risk of hunger). Our analysis shows the importance of accounting for cascading risks and amplification effects to strengthen economic, financial, and food system resilience.

 The impacts of terrain and urban surfaces on regional hourly extreme precipitation events (RHEPE) in Henan Province of China under specific synoptic conditions remain unclear. In this study, we first identify the dominant synoptic patterns associated with the summer RHEPEs in Henan and surrounding areas by employing spectral clustering methods, revealing that 86 % of RHEPEs are induced by the low vortexes and 14 % by the tropical cyclones, with the latter contributing to the most extreme RHEPEs. Then, based on numerical experiments and moisture budget decomposition, we quantify the effects of terrain and urban surfaces on RHEPE under the most extreme synoptic pattern featured by tropical cyclones. Results suggest that the terrains cause remarkable increases in precipitation primarily along the windward slopes of the Funiu Mountains and Taihang Mountains by 34 % and 26 %, respectively, this can be explained by the enhanced dynamical component of moisture convergence due to the blocking effect of terrains. Compared to the terrain, the impacts of urban surfaces are much smaller (only 1 %) and spatially limited. The much larger surface roughness in the urban areas reduces the horizontal wind speed and causes weakened wind convergence, leading to decreased precipitation over the urban areas. Meanwhile, when traversing the urban areas, the horizontal winds bifurcating and rejoining in the downwind areas increase the low-level convergence and precipitation there. Findings of this study may deepen our understanding of the influences of terrain and urban surfaces on the RHEPE and associated mechanisms under the extreme synoptic pattern."

SSWs are caused by the breaking of atmospheric waves that propagate from the troposphere via the stratosphere to the mesosphere. SSWs impact the tropospheric circulation and the climate and can lead to a dramatic decrease in temperature. During SSW events, the filtration of gravity waves has a major impact on mesospheric cooling. 
 The propagation of gravity waves (GWs) and their role in the coupling of the troposphere–stratosphere–mesosphere atmospheric layers during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) are studied. A standard set of hydrodynamic (HD) equations is used to derive the analytical dispersion equations and the GW reflection coefficient. These equations are applied to the troposphere–stratosphere and stratosphere–mesosphere discontinuities to analyse which part of the GW spectra has the greatest chance of crossing them and affecting the dynamics of the upper atmosphere. We found that the GW reflection coefficient at the troposphere–stratosphere discontinuity increases significantly during SSW. This is not the case for the reflection coefficient at the stratosphere–mesosphere discontinuity when the reflection coefficient decreases compared to its value in the no-SSW case. The generation of GWs in the stratosphere during the SSW is responsible for the reduction in the reflection coefficient. However, these additional GW fluxes are not sufficient to compensate for the reduction in GW fluxes from the troposphere to the mesosphere. As a result, mesospheric cooling accompanied by SSW events occurs."

 Accurate and detailed cropland maps are essential for agricultural planning, resource management, and food security, particularly in countries like China, where agricultural productivity is high but resources are limited. Despite the availability of several medium-to-high-resolution satellite-based cropland maps, significant discrepancies in area estimates and spatial distribution persist, limiting their utility. This study proposes a data-driven framework for cropland mapping that leverages 2 m High Resolution (HR) imagery from Mapbox and Google. The framework consists of three main stages: First, national imagery is partitioned into 0.05°×0.05° blocks for efficient parallel computation. An Image Quality Assessment (IQA) using ResNet models is performed on both sources to address the challenge of missing image acquisition metadata. Second, a robust cropland identification model integrates Mask2Former for precise segmentation and XGBoost for error evaluation, facilitating iterative improvements through active learning. Finally, a novel integration strategy combines four feature groups—Geography, IQA, Region Property, and Consistency—using XGBoost to merge the datasets into a unified cropland layer, named Croplayer. The Croplayer dataset achieves an overall mapping accuracy of 88.73 %, with 30 out of 32 provincial units reporting area estimates within ±10 % of official statistics. In contrast, only 1 to 9 provinces from seven other existing datasets meet the same accuracy standard.

Prior research relied on case studies, making it hard to compare methods & track progress. We introduce CY-Bench, a global dataset for forecasting maize and wheat yields across diverse farming systems in over 25 countries. It includes standardized weather, soil, and satellite data, curated by a diverse set of experts. CY-Bench supports the development of better forecasting tools to help decision-makers plan for global food security. 
 In-season, pre-harvest crop yield forecasts are essential for enhancing transparency in commodity markets and improving food security. They play a key role in increasing resilience to climate change and extreme events and thus contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 2 of zero hunger. Pre-harvest crop yield forecasting is a complex task, as several interacting factors contribute to yield formation, including in-season weather variability, extreme events, long-term climate change, soil, pests, diseases and farm management decisions. Several modeling approaches have been employed to capture complex interactions among such predictors and crop yields. Prior research for in-season, pre-harvest crop yield forecasting has primarily been case-study based, which makes it difficult to compare modeling approaches and measure progress systematically. To address this gap, we introduce CY-Bench (Crop Yield Benchmark), a comprehensive dataset and benchmark to forecast maize and wheat yields at a global scale. CY-Bench was conceptualized and developed within the Machine Learning team of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgML) in collaboration with agronomists, climate scientists, and machine learning researchers. It features publicly available sub-national yield statistics and relevant predictors—such as weather data, soil characteristics, and remote sensing indicators—that have been pre-processed, standardized, and harmonized across spatio-temporal scales. With CY-Bench, we aim to: (i) establish a standardized framework for developing and evaluating data-driven models across diverse farming systems in more than 25 countries across six continents; (ii) enable robust and reproducible model comparisons that address real-world operational challenges; (iii) provide an openly accessible dataset to the earth system science and machine learning communities, facilitating research on time series forecasting, domain adaptation, and online learning.

 Long-term monitoring of phytoplankton communities is essential for understanding the functioning and evolution of marine systems. This paper presents a decadal dataset on phytoplankton observations conducted along a coastal-offshore transect by the Strait of Dover, at fine spatial resolution, using an automated in vivo approach. Nine stations (∼ 1 km apart) were sampled off the Slack estuary, representing the northern limit of the Marine Protected Area of “Picard Estuaries and Opal Seas” (EPMO). Since 2012, phytoplankton functional groups were characterized in vivo in sub-surface waters using multi-spectral fluorometry (Fluoroprobe, bbe Moldaenke, Gmbh) and single-cell optical analysis with a pulse shape-recording flow cytometer (CytoSense and CytoSub, Cytobuoy b.v., Netherlands). Total phytoplankton biomass was estimated via chlorophyll a extraction and in vivo fluorescence. Spectral and functional groups were quantified in terms of abundance, size, and estimated chlorophyll a in surface waters. Weekly sampling resolution allowed to address the community composition in order to disentangle short-term, fine spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variability. Additionally, biogeochemical and hydrological variables—temperature, salinity, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), and nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate) were systematically measured. Over 11 years, the survey generated 1,835 samples from 268 dates, averaging 167 samples per year across 24 cruises.

Here, we use an ice sheet model output and other data to predict the erosion of debris and trace its transport to where it is deposited on the ocean floor. This allows the results of ice sheet modelling to be directly and quantitively compared to real-world data, helping to reduce uncertainty regarding Antarctic sea level contribution. 
 Ice sheet models should be able to accurately simulate palaeo ice sheets to have confidence in their projections of future polar ice sheet mass loss and resulting global sea level rise. This requires accurate reconstructions of the extent and flow patterns of palaeo ice sheets using real-world data. Such reconstructions can be achieved by tracing the detrital components of offshore sedimentary records back to their source areas on land. For Antarctica, however, sediment provenance data and ice sheet model results have not been directly linked, despite the complementary information each can provide on the other. Here, we present a computational framework (Tracing Antarctic Sediment Provenance, TASP) that predicts marine geochemical sediment provenance data using the output of numerical ice sheet modelling. The ice sheet model is used to estimate the spatial pattern of erosion potential and to trace ice flow pathways. Beyond the ice sheet margin, approximations of modern detrital particle transport mechanisms using ocean reanalysis data produce a good agreement between our predictions for the modern ice sheet–ocean system and seabed surface sediments. These results show that the algorithm could be used to predict the provenance signature of past ice sheet configurations. TASP currently predicts neodymium isotope compositions using the PSUICE3D ice sheet model, but thanks to its design it could be adapted to predict other provenance indicators or use the outputs of other ice sheet models."

This parameterization captures the effect of finite-amplitude, mixed-layer eddies as an overturning streamfunction and has the primary function of restratification. Herein, we outline the changes to the mean climate state of E3SM that were introduced by the addition of this parameterization. Overall, the presence of the submesoscale parameterization improves the fidelity of the v2.1 simulation by reducing the ocean surface biases in the North Atlantic present in v2, as illustrated by changes in the climatological sea surface temperature and salinity and the Arctic sea-ice extent. Other impacts include a slight shoaling of the mixed-layer depths in the North Atlantic and a small improvement in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We note that the expected shoaling due to the parameterization is regionally dependent in our coupled configuration. In addition, we investigate why the parameterization and its impacts on mixed-layer depth have little impact on the simulated AMOC: despite increased dense-water formation in the Norwegian Sea, only a small fraction of the water formed makes its way south into the North Atlantic basin. Version 2.1 also exhibits small improvements in the atmospheric climatology, with smaller biases in many notable quantities and modes of variability."

The estimated abundance of ARGs in the suspended sludge generated by the AnMBR per treated volume is, on average, 5–55 times lower than that of sludge generated by the AeMBR. Additionally, the ratio of potential HGT in the two independent runs was lower in the anaerobic sludge (0.6 and 0.9) compared with that in the aerobic sludge (2.4 and 1.6).

Conversely, the AeMBR sludge displayed higher diversity and more transfer events, encompassing genes that confer resistance to quinolones, rifamycin, multidrug, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline. A significant portion of these ARGs were transferred to Burkholderia sp.

This study elucidates the relationship between solute–membrane electrostatic interactions and solute permeability in RO membranes. The transport of salt and neutral molecules through charged polyamide (PA) and uncharged cellulose triacetate (CTA) RO membranes was examined. Results show that salt rejection and salt permeability in the PA membrane are highly dependent on the solution pH due to the variations of membrane charge density and the Donnan potential at the membrane–solution interface. Specifically, a higher salt rejection (and hence lower salt permeability) of the PA membrane is observed under alkaline conditions compared to acidic conditions. This observation is attributed to the enhanced Donnan potential at higher solution pH, which hinders co-ion partitioning into the membrane. In contrast, for salt transport through the CTA membrane and neutral solute transport through both membranes, solute permeability is independent of the solution pH and solute concentration due to the negligible Donnan effect. Overall, our results demonstrate the important role of solute-membrane electrostatic interactions, combined with steric exclusion, in regulating solute permeability in RO membranes."

It involves the transfer of electrons between Fe2+aq and Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides, rapid atomic exchange of Fe between the two states, and recrystallization of the Fe-oxides into more stable Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides. The potential occurrence of these reactions in natural soils and sediments can have an important impact on biogeochemical cycling of iron, carbon, and phosphorus. We investigated the possible isotopic exchange between Fe2+aq and sedimentary Fe(III) in Fe–Si–C-rich lake sediments. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy was used to evaluate Fe mineral speciation in unaltered lake sediments. Unaltered and oxidized sediment laboratory incubations were coupled with a classical kinetic approach that allows a quantitative description of the reactivity of assemblages of Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides found in sediments. Specifically, unaltered and oxidized sediment samples were separately incubated with an 55Fe2+aq-enriched solution and exchange was observed between 55Fe2+aq and sedimentary Fe(III), highest in the top of the sediment and decreasing with depth with the 55Fe2+aq tracer distributed within the bulk of the sedimentary Fe(III) phase.

However, the mechanisms by which they alter the carbon stability within soil aggregates remain unclear . Herein, a one-year field experiment was conducted in an arid agricultural region employing stable isotope techniques to evaluate the soil organic carbon flow in the presence of both persistent (PE, PVC) and biodegradable (PLA, PHA) MPs. PE and PVC reduced the stability of soil aggregates, while PLA and PHA maintained it. Additionally, organic carbon content increased in microaggregates but decreased in small macroaggregates for PE and PVC treatments. By contrast, treatment with PLA and PHA enhanced organic carbon content across aggregates. The δ13C values of PE- and PVC-treated aggregates ranged from −25.34 to −20.85‰, while those of PLA and PHA ranged from −16.29 to −9.26‰. Notably, MPs altered the direction of carbon flow between aggregates, reduced carbon flux, and accelerated carbon emissions. RFP and PLS–PM analyses revealed that persistent MPs affected carbon flow primarily via abiotic factors, whereas biodegradable MPs influenced it via biotic factors. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which MPs impact aggregate-associated carbon, highlighting their effects on soil ecosystem services."

We used high spatial-temporal resolution data sets of urban land cover and population grid in combination with an urban climate model, machine learning, and land use simulation model to assess the impact of UGS on population exposure to extreme (high-heat exposure, HHE) and its potential spatial optimization strategies. Results showed that the UGS and HHE have a strong spatiotemporal dynamic coupling in 21st century Chinese cities. Moreover, UGS shrinkage increased the HHE by 0.58–1.15 °C, while UGS expansion mitigated it by 0.72–1.26 °C, both stronger in the SSP3–7.0 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios. Different from common impressions, spatial relationships, rather than quantities of UGS, are more influential (1.3–1.8 times) on HHE. Our solutions suggest that simply enhancing the spatial dynamic connectivity between patches can mitigate HHE by 9.1–21.1%, especially for the eastern and central cities.

Electrochemical reduction (ER) is an efficient technology for dehalogenation, but it still suffers from limited efficiencies in breaking C–F bonds. Herein, we present a strategy to enhance C–F cleavage and promote detoxification by loading benchmark palladium cathodes onto boron-doped carbon. This improves the florfenicol (FLO) degradation rate constant and defluorination efficiency by 1.24 and 1.05 times, respectively, and improves the defluorination of various fluorinated compounds. The cathode with optimal B content shows superior mass activity for FLO degradation (1.11 mmol g–1 Pd min–1), which is 5.9 times that of commercial Pd/C and is among the best-reported cathodes. Notably, the exclusive formation of the direct defluorination product (i.e., FLO-F) on Pd/B–C implies a higher intrinsic C–F cleavage ability endowed by B doping. As revealed by experiments and theoretical calculations, boron modification enhances palladium binding and induces stronger strain effects and higher electron density for surface palladium atoms, which boosts H* generation and reduces the energy barrier for C–F cleavage. This study provides an effective cathode design strategy to enhance C–F activation, which may broadly benefit the destruction and detoxification of fluorinated organics that are limited by sluggish C–F cleavage kinetics."

A prevalent strategy to enhance the monovalent and multivalent ion selective separation performance involves modifying the membrane surface charge properties to influence the Donnan exclusion. However, the counterion adsorption and shielding effects are aggravated with increasing ionic strength, which severely weaken the Donnan exclusion. This study revealed that the contribution of Donnan exclusion was fairly moderate to SO42– rejection in high salinity solutions, while it was dielectric exclusion that exerted the most important influence on Cl–/SO42– selective separation with a pore radius at 0.35–0.44 nm (molecular weight cutoff at 180–300 Da). Consequently, we proposed that tailored design of nanofiltration membranes with a precise pore radius to fully utilize the steric and dielectric exclusion instead of increasing membrane charge density is more crucial for monovalent/multivalent ion selective separation in high salinity solutions. Overall, our study reveals the importance of dielectric exclusion and provides new insights into nanofiltration membrane customization and application for ion selective separation in high salinity solutions."

Here we aimed to investigate the effects of three typical BFRs (BDE-47, BDE-209, and DBDPE) on the development of atherosclerosis and explored the underlying mechanisms using an in vitro cell model and ApoE–/– mice. Our data showed that BFRs significantly inhibited the viability of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and induced the generation of ROS. BFRs significantly enhanced the content of Ox-LDL in THP-1 macrophages, which promoted the formation of foam cells. In an in vivo study, BFRs exposure significantly increased the plaque area and lipid content in the aortic root of mice. BFRs significantly increased the ROS level in plaques and promoted the expression level of adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which enhanced the recruitment of macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in signaling pathways related to oxidative stress and lipid metabolism.

Groundwater δ18O might help provide clarity as they are a widely distributed record of annual weighted mean precipitated δ18O. Here, groundwater δ18O during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and late Holocene (LH) are first illustrated throughout China based on 158 archived δ18O and 14C measurements. Between LGM and LH, the magnitude of changes in groundwater δ18O is higher in North China (NC > 2‰) than South China (SC < 0.5‰). This spatial inconsistency is similar to the seasonal precipitation δ18O variations in China caused by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Likewise, the difference of groundwater δ18O between LGM and LH in NC and SC is attributed to changes in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM): during the LGM, the EASM was weaker in significantly affecting NC, whereas during the LH, the EASM was stronger and moved northward into NC. This illustrates that although the monsoon strengthens, the higher δ18O values in groundwater in NC are still found during the LH than that during the LGM. Furthermore, this spatial difference between NC and SC highlights the importance of moisture sources in affecting precipitation δ18O values, implying that the explanation for paleoclimate reconstruction based on stable isotope effects might need careful examination."

Nitrogen oxides (NOx), emitted by ocean‐going vessels, react with sea salt chloride to generate reactive chlorine species. However, the exact mechanisms and chemical budget of chlorine remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore chlorine activation through field observations in Hong Kong, complemented by box modeling. Over the 2‐week measurement period, the summer monsoon introduced abundant NOx, producing molecular chlorine (Cl2, 0.64 ± 0.69 ppt) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl, 8.9 ± 5.1 ppt). Daytime Cl2 production was attributable to nitrate (NO3−) photolysis and the uptake on hydroxyl radicals (OH·) on chloride‐containing aerosols. A budget analysis using the box model revealed that the production rate of HOCl, primarily driven by chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) hydrolysis, was substantially lower than its loss rate. This discrepancy indicates either uncertainties in known HOCl sources or a missing source of chlorine atoms (Cl·). We examined the potential precursors of Cl· by incorporating emerging reactive chlorine species, such as, trichloramine (NCl3) and iodine chloride (ICl), into the model. However, the inclusion of NCl3 caused an overestimation of ambient Cl2 levels, while adding ICl led to excessive ozone (O3) depletion. Incorporating an unknown Cl· source (equivalent to ∼46 ppt Cl2) remarkably enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity, increasing daytime OH· levels by 12.8% and net ozone production by 35.7% while decreasing the mercury (Hg) lifetime by a factor of 3.

Assisted natural regeneration (ANR) emerges as a promising approach to achieving global forest restoration targets, yet its potential and benefits for climate and biodiversity in China remain underexplored. Here, we assessed ANR potential across China and modeled spatial prioritization strategies targeting climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and cost savings, individually and in combination, as well as strategies considering spatial constraints from current forest restoration projects and fragmentation mitigation.

Spatial prioritization revealed limited overlap among the three single‐objective ANR strategies, while a multi‐objective optimization strategy emerged as the most effective solution to achieve synergies among goals. The top 30% of prioritized areas under the multi‐objective strategy could sequester 46.54 gigatons of CO2, reduce extinction risks of forest‐dependent species by 40.64%, and lower implementation costs by 31.55% compared to monoculture tree plantations.

We perform a non‐stationary probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (nPTHA) in the Southern California bays of San Pedro and San Diego, with consideration of tsunamis generated by earthquakes in the Alaska‐Aleutians (ASZ) and Cascadia subduction zones (CSZ). We evaluate the changes of the maximum considered tsunami (MCT) design parameter, defined as a tsunami intensity that is exceeded with a 2% probability in 50 years. MCT elevation maps in the bays are calculated incorporating tides and SLR by means of a surrogate model. MCT elevations at assessed sites in San Pedro Bay and San Diego yield 2 m. The nPTHA shows that tsunamis generated in the ASZ zone are more hazardous in Southern California than those from the CSZ when evaluating MCT intensities. A comparison of scenarios with and without SLR also shows an increase of the MCT elevations of more than a foot in San Pedro Bay and San Diego, demonstrating that SLR causes a relevant impact, comparable to the influence of tides. The effect of SLR increasing MCT values is also comparable to the sensitivity of nPTHA results to some common earthquake epistemic uncertainties, such as the slip marginal distribution.

Here we showed that satellite‐derived GUD averaged over China forests and grasslands advanced by −1.3 ± 0.4 (mean ± SD) days decade−1 during 1982–2022, but with contrasting trends between forests (−5.0 ± 0.6 days decade−1) and grasslands (2.8 ± 0.6 days decade−1), despite similarly increasing temperature and precipitation. Such contrasting trends were caused by different responses to higher preseason mean temperature and more total precipitation. Moreover, sensitivities of GUD to temperature and precipitation showed different patterns with respect to spatial gradient of background climate conditions between forests and grasslands. Our study elucidates different mechanisms behind forests and grasslands responding to climate change, which could help optimize land‐management strategies and anticipate vegetation distribution under climate change."

 State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2–4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10.

 Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery1,2. A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene—an important trigger for antigen switching—the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.

 Crop production faces persistent threats from insect-vector-borne viral diseases1,2. Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens3–8. However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1–IBR–RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus–host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding.

 In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection results from increased serum levels of TGFβ, which impairs the reactivation of virus-specific T cells."

 The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using only classical communication1–3. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications4–6 and functionalities7–12 on quantum processors have been performed in ad hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here we report on the design and implementation of an architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the capability of the architecture to execute applications in high-level software by implementing it as a quantum network operating system—QNodeOS—and executing test programs, including a delegated computation from a client to a server13 on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond14,15. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in quantum network programming and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.

 The eukaryote Tree of Life (eToL) depicts the relationships among all eukaryotic organisms; its root represents the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) from which all extant complex lifeforms are descended1. Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling and limited phylogenetic signal1. Here we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution on the basis of a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins that includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses of a 100 taxon × 93 protein dataset with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models and an extensive evaluation of alternative hypotheses show that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ‘Opimoda+’ and ‘Diphoda+’. This position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ‘typical excavates’ are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ‘excavate’ cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study sheds light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and provides a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.

 Two-dimensional (2D) metals are appealing for many emergent phenomena and have recently attracted research interests1–9. Unlike the widely studied 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, 2D metals are extremely challenging to achieve, because they are thermodynamically unstable1,10. Here we develop a vdW squeezing method to realize diverse 2D metals (including Bi, Ga, In, Sn and Pb) at the ångström thickness limit. The achieved 2D metals are stabilized from a complete encapsulation between two MoS2 monolayers and present non-bonded interfaces, enabling access to their intrinsic properties. Transport and Raman measurements on monolayer Bi show excellent physical properties, for example, new phonon mode, enhanced electrical conductivity, notable field effect and large nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our work establishes an effective route for implementing 2D metals, alloys and other 2D non-vdW materials, potentially outlining a bright vision for a broad portfolio of emerging quantum, electronic and photonic devices.

 Habitat fragmentation generally reduces biodiversity at the patch scale (α diversity)1. However, there is ongoing debate about whether such negative effects can be alleviated at the landscape scale (γ diversity) if among-patch diversity (β diversity) increases as a result of fragmentation2–6. This controversial view has not been rigorously tested. Here we use a dataset of 4,006 taxa across 37 studies from 6 continents to test the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity across scales by explicitly comparing continuous and fragmented landscapes. We find that fragmented landscapes consistently have both lower α diversity and lower γ diversity. Although fragmented landscapes did tend to have higher β diversity, this did not translate into higher γ diversity. Our findings refute claims that habitat fragmentation can increase biodiversity at landscape scales, and emphasize the need to restore habitat and increase connectivity to minimize biodiversity loss at ever-increasing scales. An analysis of habitat fragmentation using a dataset of more than 4,000 species worldwide shows that fragmentation reduces biodiversity at all scales, and that increases in β diversity do not compensate for the loss of α diversity."

 Who the first inhabitants of Western Europe were, what their physical characteristics were, and when and where they lived are some of the pending questions in the study of the settlement of Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene epoch. The available palaeoanthropological information from Western Europe is limited and confined to the Iberian Peninsula1,2. Here we present most of the midface of a hominin found at the TE7 level of the Sima del Elefante site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago. This fossil (ATE7-1) represents the earliest human face of Western Europe identified thus far. Most of the morphological features of the midface of this hominin are primitive for the Homo clade and they do not display the modern-like aspect exhibited by Homo antecessor found at the neighbouring Gran Dolina site, also in the Sierra de Atapuerca, and dated to between 900,000 and 800,000 years ago3. Furthermore, ATE7-1 is more derived in the nasoalveolar region than the Dmanisi and other roughly contemporaneous hominins. On the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to assign the new human remains from TE7 level to Homo aff. erectus. From the archaeological, palaeontological and palaeoanthropological information obtained in the lower levels of the Sima del Elefante and Gran Dolina sites4–8, we suggest a turnover in the human population in Europe at the end of the Early Pleistocene.

When interacting with an external environment, these active solids spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, which naturally lead to locomotion such as rolling and crawling. The robustness of the locomotion is rooted in an emergent feedback loop between the active solid and the environment, which is mediated by elastic deformations and stresses. As a result, our active solids are able to accelerate, adjust their gaits and locomote through a variety of terrains with a similar performance to more complex control strategies implemented by neural networks. Our work establishes active solids as a bridge between materials and robots and suggests decentralized strategies to control the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems8,18–22, soft materials5,6,9,11,12,23–25 and driven nanomechanical devices7,26–30. The development of active solids based on centimetre-scale building blocks incorporating odd elasticity shows that they can spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, leading to adaptive locomotion such as rolling and crawling."

 Global ocean surface temperatures were at record levels for more than a year from April 2023 onwards, exceeding the previous record in 2015–2016 by 0.25 °C on average between April 2023 and March 20241. The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures2. Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend.

 Intratumour heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity drive tumour progression and therapy resistance1,2. Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell-state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity3, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors. Our work provides a detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC. In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, extrachromosomal DNAs are shown to be a source of high-level focal amplification driving MYC heterogeneity and phenotypic adaptation."

 Many natural motor skills, such as speaking or locomotion, are acquired through a process of trial-and-error learning over the course of development. It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors1, decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches—in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback—showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance2. However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions—consistent with dopamine’s hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor–critic reinforcement-learning model4,5. Reinforcement-learning algorithms6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence7. Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning. Studies in zebra finches show that dopamine has a key role as a reinforcement signal in the trial-and-error process of learning that underlies complex natural behaviours."

 Mechanical metamaterials with high recoverable elastic energy density, which we refer to as high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials, can offer many enhanced properties, including efficient mechanical energy storage1,2, load-bearing capability, impact resistance and motion agility. These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3–8. However, achieving high enthalpy is challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9–11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest.

 Nanoribbons, nanometre-wide strips of a two-dimensional material, are a unique system in condensed matter. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times1,2, quantum confinement3 and topologically protected states4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors6. Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.

 Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood1–5. Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.

 Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’1–6. This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)7–9. However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains10–12. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.

 Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the principal energy currency of all living cells1,2. Metabolically impaired obligate intracellular parasites, such as the human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii, can acquire ATP from their host cells through a unique ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) translocator, which mediates the import of ATP into and the export of ADP and phosphate out of the parasite cells, thus allowing the exploitation of the energy reserves of host cells (also known as energy parasitism). This type of ATP/ADP translocator also exists in the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of protists and the plastids of plants and algae and has been implicated to play an important role in endosymbiosis3–31. The plastid/parasite type of ATP/ADP translocator is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator, and its structure and transport mechanism are still unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of two plastid/parasite types of ATP/ADP translocators in the apo and substrate-bound states. The ATP/ADP-binding pocket is located at the interface between the N and C domains of the translocator, and a conserved asparagine residue within the pocket is critical for substrate specificity. The translocator operates through a rocker-switch alternating access mechanism involving the relative rotation of the two domains as rigid bodies. Our results provide critical insights for understanding ATP translocation across membranes in energy parasitism and endosymbiosis and offer a structural basis for developing drugs against obligate intracellular parasites.

 Given the high recurrence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post-resection1–3, improved early identification of patients at high risk for post-resection recurrence would help to improve patient outcomes and prioritize healthcare resources4–6. Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front.

 Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers. Long-term increases in heavy daily and hourly precipitation in Austria from different climatic mechanisms emphasize the need for flood management adaptation, especially in smaller catchments affected by the increased hourly rainfall."

 Magnonic systems provide a fertile playground for bosonic topology1, for example, Dirac2–6 and Weyl7,8 magnons, leading to a variety of exotic phenomena such as charge-free topologically protected boundary modes6,7, the magnon thermal Hall effect9 and the magnon spin Nernst effect10. However, their understanding has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic geometries and spin Hamiltonians primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups11,12, thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group13–17 theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1,421 collinear spin space groups into 4 types, constructing their band representations and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines and charge-4 octuple points. On the basis of the MAGNDATA database18, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which more than 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the spin–orbit-coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80 per cent are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that the spin space group serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets.

The earliest individuals cluster with pre-Neolithic people of the western Maghreb (around 15,000–7,600 years before present (bp)), showing that this ‘Maghrebi’ ancestry profile had a substantial geographic and temporal extent. At least one individual from Djebba (Tunisia), dating to around 8,000 years bp, harboured ancestry from European hunter–gatherers, probably reflecting movement in the Early Holocene across the Strait of Sicily. Later Neolithic people from the eastern Maghreb retained largely local forager ancestry, together with smaller contributions from European farmers (by around 7,000 years bp) and Levantine groups (by around 6,800 years bp), and were thus far less impacted by external gene flow than were populations in other parts of the Neolithic Mediterranean.

 Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs)1,2. Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs)3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres3,5–8 or bulk waveguides9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth11,12. We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics. An optical parametric amplifier based on integrated photonic circuits fabricated using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide demonstrates improved bandwidth and gain performance over state-of-the-art erbium-doped fibre amplifiers while maintaining a low noise figure."

Here, the authors report an inorganic–organic hybrid spinel oxide that enhances both catalytic activity and structural stability through a coordination method. 
 Fully triggering the deep-seated potential of traditional nanomaterials, such as the classic spinel family, is of paramount importance in the field of materials science, which is yet believed to heavily depend on advanced conceptual designs and synthetic strategies. Herein, a type of inorganic–organic hybrid spinel oxide is designed using a π-conjugated azobenzene single-tooth coordination method to overcome their stubborn problems of moderate activity and phase instability in electrocatalytic reactions. Taking spinel Co3O4 nanocubes as a pre-catalyst, after subtle etching of the cube surfaces, some oxygen atoms in the tetrahedral Co–O coordination field are replaced and selectively linked to weakly polar azo-extended π-conjugated units (π*–N=N–π*) via electrophilic carboxyl groups. The π-conjugation structure in Co3O4 suppresses the covalency competition between the tetrahedral and octahedral Co–O coordination fields, successfully preventing the phase transition during the electrocatalytic process and improving the electrocatalytic activity and durability. This study not only expands the spinel family but also provides useful guidelines for developing advanced functional materials. Unlocking the potential of traditional nanomaterials like spinel oxides is crucial for improving the catalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

 Increasing attention has been paid to silacyclobutanes because of their wide application in ring opening and ring extension reactions. However, the synthesis of functionalized silacyclobutanes remains an unmet challenge because of the limited functional group tolerance of the reactions with organometallic reagents and chlorosilacyclobutanes. Herein, we report a conceptually different solution to this end through a visible-light-induced metal-free hydrosilylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilacyclobutanes. A wide range of unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups including the base-sensitive acid, alcohol and ketones participated in this reaction smoothly. In particular, the first hydrosilylation reaction of alkenes with dihydrosilacyclobutane provides a facile access to various functionalized alkyl monohydrosilacyclobutanes. Unsymmetrical dialkyl silacyclobutanes have also been synthesized through consecutive hydrosilylation with dihydrosilacyclobutane in one pot. The mechanism study reveals that the Lewis basic solvent could promote the generation of strained silyl radicals by direct light irradiation without a redox-active photocatalyst and the thiol catalyst plays an important role in accelerating the reaction.

Here, the authors show that BaH2 does not merely serve as static platform for reactions during ammonia synthesis, but rather it is a dynamic entity that evolves under reaction conditions. 
 The modern view of industrial heterogeneous catalysis is evolving from the traditional static paradigm where the catalyst merely provides active sites, to that of a functional material in which dynamics plays a crucial role. Using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm this picture for the ammonia synthesis catalysed by BaH2. Recent experiments show that this system acts as a highly efficient catalyst, but only when exposed first to N2 and then to H2 in a chemical looping process. Our simulations reveal that when first exposed to N2, BaH2 undergoes a profound change, transforming into a superionic mixed compound, BaH2−2x(NH)x, characterized by a high mobility of both hydrides and imides. This transformation is not limited to the surface but involves the entire catalyst. When this compound is exposed to H2 in the second step of the looping process, ammonia is readily formed and released, a process greatly facilitated by the high ionic mobility. Once all the nitrogen hydrides are hydrogenated, the system reverts to its initial state, ready for the next looping cycle. Our microscopic analysis underlines the dynamic nature of this heterogeneous catalyst, which does not merely serve as static platform for reactions, rather it is a dynamic entity that evolves under reaction conditions. The traditional view of industrial heterogeneous catalysis is shifting from a static to a dynamic paradigm.

Here the authors constrain projections to show that the magnitude of the NAO increases under high emissions, leading to more severe winters. 
 The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) dominates winters in Western Europe and eastern North America. Future climate model projections of the NAO are highly uncertain due to both modelled irreducible internal variability and different model responses. Here we show that some of the model spread in multi-decadal NAO simulations is caused by climatological water vapour errors, and develop an emergent constraint that reveals a substantial response of the NAO to volcanic eruptions and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Taking account of the signal-to-noise paradox apparent in these simulations suggests that under the high-emissions scenario the multi-decadal NAO will increase to unprecedented levels that will likely cause severe impacts, including increased flooding and storm damage. This can be avoided through mitigation to reduce GHG emissions. Our results suggest that taking model projections at face value and seeking consensus could leave society unprepared for impending extremes.

Using eight sensitivity experiments, we disentangle the individual impacts of these three components and their interactions on the forecast skill for the contiguous United States. The CESM2-S2S experiment, in which land states are initialized while atmosphere and ocean remain in their climatological states, contributes 91 ± 3% of the total sub-seasonal forecast skill across varying soil moisture conditions during summer and winter. Most SM predictability stems from the soil moisture memory effect. Additionally, land-atmosphere coupling contributes 50% of the land-driven soil moisture predictability.

 The Global Warming Potential-star (GWP*) approach is a way to convert the emissions of short-lived climate forcers to CO2-equivalent emissions while maintaining consistency with temperature outcomes. Here we evaluate the performance of GWP* when it is used to account for non-CO2 gases within the carbon budget framework. We convert methane (CH4) emissions to CO2-equivalent emissions via GWP* and calculate the temperature through simple climate models. We show that GWP* can accurately convert CH4 emissions to reproduce the temperature until 2100 under a variety of scenarios, including overshoot scenarios, except those with a rapid decline in CH4 emissions. Beyond 2100, however, the use of GWP* can lead to temperature overestimation since it extends beyond its calibration range. Furthermore, we find that under scenarios designed to achieve identical temperature targets but with varying overshoot profiles, cumulative CO2-eq budgets (GWP*-basis) generally increase with overshoot length and magnitude. This is driven by the internal dynamics of our model, as characterized by its negative zero-emission commitment. While the use of GWP* enhances such effects with increasing overshoot length, it exerts opposite effects with increasing overshoot magnitude."

 An unprecedented marine heatwave (MHW) struck the extratropical Northeastern Pacific during the summer of 2020. This study reveals that this event is characterized by a persistent atmospheric high-pressure anomaly in the MHW region, which leads to a decreased cloud cover, an increased surface shortwave radiation (SWR), a decreased mixed-layer depth, and an increased sea surface temperature (SST). The local net surface heat flux anomaly associated with the increased SWR primarily drives the increased SST, while the oceanic processes likely play a minor role. Both observations and simulations further demonstrate that the SST and high-pressure anomaly are closely associated with a large-scale wave train over the extratropical sector from Asia to the North Pacific which can be forced by the Tibetan Plateau heating change. According to our findings, the projection of a persistent warming Tibetan Plateau heightens the risk of escalating MHW events in the Northeastern Pacific under future scenarios."

 In 2012, soybean crops failed in the three largest producing regions due to spatially compounded hot and dry weather across North and South America. Here, we present different impact storylines of the 2012 event, calculated by combining a statistical crop model with climate model simulations of 2012 conditions under pre-industrial, present-day (+1 °C), and future (+2 °C) conditions. These simulations use the ECHAM6 climate model and maintain the same observed seasonally evolving atmospheric circulation. Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic warming strongly amplifies the impacts of such a large-scale circulation pattern on global soybean production. Although the drought intensity is similar under different warming levels, larger crop losses are driven not only by warmer temperatures but also by stronger heat-moisture interactions. We estimate that one-third of the global soybean production deficit in 2012 is attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Future warming (+2 °C above pre-industrial) would further exacerbate production deficits by one-half compared to present-day 2012 conditions. This highlights the increasing intensity of global soybean production shocks with warming, requiring urgent adaptation strategies.

 Humid high-elevation tropical ecosystems (HETEs), known as páramos, jalca, or moorlands, are essential for biodiversity conservation and water supply. Yet, a key question remains of how future climate change will affect their hydroclimatic spaces: the multidimensional hydroclimatic conditions in which they currently thrive. We use CMIP6-downscaled climate data to assess the potential breaching of these hydroclimatic spaces concerning the long-term means, extremes, and seasonality of temperature and precipitation. Our results show that HETEs in Northern South America will experience the largest increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, leading to the breaching of their current hydroclimatic space by up to 100%.

 Non-target areas in agricultural landscapes serve as invaluable refuges for organisms and safeguard biodiversity. This research aimed to examine the landscape-scale distribution of Current Use Pesticides (CUPs) in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany, a region characterised by intensive agriculture in the valley and bordered by forested lower mountain regions. We sampled vegetation, topsoil, and surface water at 78 non-target, off-field sites during the pesticide application season in 2022. The sites were located in six 30 km long transects to cover both the valley and mountain regions. Samples were analysed for 93 CUPs. In total, 63 different CUPs (29 fungicides, 19 herbicides and 15 insecticides) were detected in all samples (n = 186). CUPs were recorded in 97% of all vegetation and 97% of all topsoil samples (76 of 78 samples each). In total, 140 unique mixtures with ≥2 components were recorded. A prediction map using additional site parameters suggests a widespread presence of CUPs extending multiple hundred meters beyond CUP application areas. Landscape-scale mixture contamination is not addressed in environmental risk assessment for the regulation of pesticides.

 Environmental migration occurs across spatial and temporal scales and is influenced by the dynamics of individual and collective human behavior, as well as environmental stresses. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has demonstrated potential for studying such complex processes, especially where individual decision-making is important. We developed an ABM to simulate environmental shocks, labor markets, and household livelihoods and used it to study environmental migration in rural Bangladesh. Using a pattern-oriented modeling approach, we found that an economic model of migration decisions can robustly reproduce observed patterns so long as economic inequality is properly represented. The results were sensitive to both the functional form and the parameters characterizing the distribution of land-ownership within a community.

 Previous studies have suggested that Arctic sea-ice loss can have a profound influence on atmospheric circulation far away from the Arctic. However, there is little scientific consensus on the features of these remote responses, with the opposite impacts reported. Here we present a multi-model analysis of the decadal climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss using state-of-the-art energy conserving methodologies to isolate the impacts of sea-ice decline. We observe weakening of the Aleutian Low and development of a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific, associated with drier winter conditions over the southwest United States. Over the Atlantic, a negative NAO-like response drives wetter winter conditions across the western Mediterranean. These decadal-scale impacts substantially differ from reported centennial-scale responses to Arctic sea-ice loss simulated using non-energy conserving methodologies. Factors such as the timescale of the response and methodologies used to isolate the impacts of disappearing sea-ice cover should be carefully considered when consolidating scientific understanding on the future impacts of changing Arctic.

 Low wind chill temperatures can have negative impacts on human health and the capability of performing outdoor activities. An open question is how climate change is projected to impact this hazard in high latitude land regions. Here we focus on changes in the magnitude and timing of extreme wind chill days (i.e., days with wind chill temperatures below −34.4 °C) in response to future changes in large-scale mean-state climate conditions in Alaska. We find a future reduction in extreme wind chill days, especially in northern Alaska and at lower elevations where most of the population resides. Moreover, the extreme wind chill days’ mean date shifts by up to two weeks later in the future, with a narrower seasonal distribution compared to the historical period. These changes are primarily attributed to increased temperatures rather than changes in wind speed.

 Arctic communities urgently need regional to local-scale information on the rapid coastal changes, caused by thawing permafrost, melting glaciers, and declining sea ice. We introduce a procedure for mapping coastal land cover change from satellite images in the challenging Arctic conditions (and beyond). Our approach utilizes data fusion and cloud computing in Google Earth Engine to process the full Landsat collections for the entire Arctic. It merges information from multiple Landsat sensors and utilizes complementary spatial data and two algorithms to enhance classification accuracy and processing efficiency. This mitigates issues with local illumination conditions and the low availability and quality of satellite data in the Arctic before 2010s. Calculating post-classification composites of coastal land cover over five-year time-steps effectively reduces the impacts of clouds, suspended sediment, and the tide. The procedure was iteratively developed in calibration sites with contrasting physical characteristics. Validation of the final product indicates an overall classification accuracy of more than 98 % (against manually labelled data) and a median shoreline error distance of c. 20 and 10 m in mesotidal and microtidal coasts, respectively.

 In urban areas of low-and middle-income countries, short-term anthropogenic activities, such as festive fireworks, escalate air pollution. Diwali, one of the major Indian festivals, leads to severe air quality conditions due to massive emissions from fireworks. While the mass concentrations in ambient fixed locations are well explored, the chemical characterization and the redox-active components during such events, as well as potential exposures in residential outdoor locations, are poorly studied. This study focuses on examining the diurnal variation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its chemical and toxicological properties in residential areas during festive fireworks. A 5-day continuous diurnal monitoring was conducted across different residential sites in Mumbai, India, using real-time PM sensors collocated with the gravimetric measurements. The collected particles were subjected to multiple optical (babs,370 and babs,880), chemical (ionic, water-soluble organic carbon, elemental), and oxidative potential (OPDTT and OPAA) analyses. The study shows that the average increase in residential outdoor PM2.5 concentration on Diwali night was ∼2.6 times higher than on non-Diwali night (206 ± 167 μg/m3). Similarly, optical parameters (babs,370 and babs,880) are elevated by 1.5 times, ions such as K+, NH4+, NO3−, and SO42− by 5 times while Zn, Pb, Mn, and Cu spiked by ∼ 3 times during Diwali night. Toxicity of the particles as estimated by OPDTTv and OPAAv, increased by ∼1.5-fold during Diwali night, and was significantly correlated with NO3−, SO42−, Mn, Ni, and As (p < 0.05). Chemical speciation data reveal that toxic pollutants from Diwali fireworks increase particle toxicity. This study highlights the need for strict regulation of fireworks and policies addressing acute emission events.

 The significance of terpenoid emissions from traffic-related and biogenic sources in urban areas of the developing world is largely unknown, mainly due to the lack of measurements. This study is based on well time-resolved continuous measurements of ambient monoterpene concentration at an urban site in western India during January–May 2020, coinciding with the winter-to-summer and COVID-19 pre-lockdown to lockdown transitions. Despite large day-to-day variations of α-pinene (7–76 ppt) and β-pinene (6–55 ppt) their levels in winter were slightly higher than in summer. The trends in monoterpenes concentrations do not directly reflect the impact of enhanced biogenic contributions in summer due to counterbalancing effects of increased rates of oxidation and dilution. However, the increase of ∑α+β-pinene/∑BTEX ratios from 5 to 13 in winter to 61–87 ppt ppb−1 in summer highlights the impact of increased biogenic contributions at higher temperatures. The very high ∑α+β-pinene/∑BTEX ratios during the strict COVID-19 lockdown phases than the pre-lockdown period could be additionally attributed to the reductions of anthropogenic emissions. The estimated relative daytime biogenic contributions to α-pinene increased from 66 ± 10% in January to 88 ± 13% in May, while that of β-pinene from 56 ± 8% to 70 ± 19%. Overall, depending on the season, the complex interplay between the variability in anthropogenic activities, biogenic emissions, and photochemical/meteorological factors controls the ambient air variability of monoterpenes. The study provides insights into seasonal changes in anthropogenic and biogenic contributions of atmospheric monoterpenes. The knowledge of monoterpene sources is critical to assess secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, contributing to regional climate change."

 In recent years, vehicle emissions have emerged as one of the most significant sources of air pollutants and CO2 in Chinese cities. Promoting electric vehicles (EVs) has become a critical strategy for mitigating vehicle-related pollution. While replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) with EVs reduces on-road emissions, the associated increase in electricity consumption and power plant emissions may introduce negative environmental impacts. Overlooking emissions from the upstream fuel production stage can lead to overestimating the benefits of vehicle electrification policies. Therefore, it is essential to comprehensively quantify the environmental effects of electric vehicle promotion policies during the whole fuel cycle. Given that generation emissions are closely tied to the electricity mix, Chengdu (a city with over 85% hydropower) was selected as a pilot city for this study. The research follows a structured approach of ‘emission inventory establishment - air quality simulation - environmental benefit assessment - policy scenario analysis'. We systematically account for fleet emissions in Chengdu over the fuel cycle, simulate pollutant concentrations using the SMOKE-WRF-CMAQ model, estimate premature deaths through the GEMM model with Chinese population distribution data, and evaluate energy-saving and carbon-reduction potentials under various scenarios. The findings reveal that the Electricity Vehicles (EV) scenario reduces annual GHG-100 emissions by nearly 80% compared to the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, while the Electricity Vehicles with Low-Carbon power grid (EVLC) scenario brings an additional 2.3% reduction. The EV policy significantly reduces PM2.5, NOX, and SO2 concentrations in Chengdu's central urban area but leads to a notable increase in O3 levels. These differences are further amplified when considering population-weighted concentrations, reflecting fluctuations in population prevalence. Finally, we monetise the impacts of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions using the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) and Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), estimating that the promotion of EVs avoids approximately 3913 million yuan in economic losses. These results provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the scientific promotion of vehicle electrification policies and the formulation of low-carbon green development strategies for urban transport in Chengdu."

However, most experimental systems either ignore gradients or fail to capture gradients in mechanically relevant contexts. Here, we use microfluidic experiments and biophysical simulations to explore how host-relevant shear flow affects antimicrobial gradients across communities of the highly resistant pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosa. We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistantP. aeruginosacells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials."

Here, we investigate how thermosensory learning shapes our subjective experience of temperature and the misperception of pain in response to harmless thermal stimuli. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that the brain uses a probabilistic predictive coding scheme to update beliefs about temperature changes based on their uncertainty. We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem.

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair.

ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that theDrosophilaABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus,Eatodeficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additionalEatoloss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescueEatoloss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins.

We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population.

To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases.

We found that UTY modulates the osteoblast-like cell phenotype in response to nanoscale cues uniquely in male VICs. Overall, we reveal a previously unidentified role of UTY in the regulation of calcification processes in males during AVS progression."

The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible."

We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2.

We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS."

Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in <90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic.

This article presents a new database containing information on extreme storm events that generated impacts and flooding along European coastlines between 2010 and 2020. The storm events, associated with specific locations, are used to define test cases that are subsequently employed to retrieve information from different extreme coastal storms that hit the same area. The database collects items organized in worksheets and constitutes an inventory of resources with different types of information that is employed to characterize a storm event (i.e. hydrodynamics and weather information) and its consequences (impacts, flood extent, etc.). The guidelines and polygons (in GeoJSON format) that define the domain of the sites are also provided along with the database. The database contains 11 coastal storm events, 26 sites, 28 test cases, and 232 resources, and it has been designed to allow the addition of new events and resources. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to define the types and topics addressed by the resources and the distribution of the resource types per country. Lastly, an example of the application of the database to European-scale flood modelling is provided.

To enhance our understanding of hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics of the NP, a multi-year field observation campaign was designed and conducted from 2015 to 2018. This campaign improves the temporal and spatial coverage compared to previous observations, enabling more detailed investigations of this important channel system. 
 A comprehensive multi-year field campaign, the North Passage Channel Measurements (NP-ChaM), was designed and executed to enhance our understanding of the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in the North Passage, the primary navigation channel of the Changjiang Estuary, China. The NP-ChaM campaign comprised eight observational sites and spanned 50 d, distributed over 4 years, including two dry seasons and two wet seasons. A series of tripod systems, equipped with multiple instruments, were deployed on the seabed to monitor near-bed physical processes reliably.The resulting dataset comprises the following: (i) fluid motions, encompassing pressure, flow velocity and direction (at the bottom and throughout the entire water column), and wave patterns; (ii) near-bed environmental conditions, including temperature, salinity, and turbidity (at the bottom and across a near-bed 1-meter range); (iii) supplementary meteorological data sourced from credible providers; and (iv) preliminary results from post-processing, showcasing the practical application of the data, such as lateral flows and turbulent kinetic energy characterizations.This dataset is especially valuable due to its extensive temporal and spatial coverage, as well as the high concentrations characterizing many of the observations (from several grams per liter to tens of grams per liter). Conducted annually from 2015 to 2018, the NP-ChaM campaign facilitated detailed observations of seasonal variations in environmental conditions and associated physical processes. The eight observational sites, positioned on either side of the deep channel, enable quantifications of channel–shoal exchanges, along-channel flow dynamics, and saltwater intrusion. This dataset is suitable for advancing our understanding of along-channel and cross-channel dynamics in a channel–shoal system and for calibrating numerical models. The dataset has undergone rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and accuracy.

 Landslide inventories play a vital role in assessing susceptibility, hazards, and risks and are essential for developing resilience strategies in mountainous areas. This importance is amplified in the context of climate change as existing inventories might not adequately reflect changing stability conditions. In May 2023, the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy was hit by two major rainfall events, leading to widespread flooding and the triggering of thousands of landslides. Predominantly, these were shallow debris slides and debris flows, occurring on slopes previously deemed to be stable based on historical data, with no prior landslides recorded. Our team supported the Civil Protection Agency through field surveys and mapping efforts to pinpoint and record these landslides, prioritizing areas critical to immediate public safety and focusing on thorough mapping for future recovery planning. The outcome is a detailed map of all landslides induced by these events, manually identified using high-resolution aerial photography (0.2 m pixel resolution; four bands – RGB and near-infrared (NIR)) and categorized with the help of a 3D viewer.

To understand the EAC regime and the inner shelf dynamics, we implement a variational approach to produce the first multiyear coastal radar dataset (2012–2023) in this region. The validated data allow for a comprehensive investigation of the EAC dynamics. This dataset will be useful for understanding the complex EAC regime and its far-reaching impacts on the shelf environment. 
 The East Australian Current (EAC) exhibits significant variability across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from mesoscale eddies and meanders to seasonal, interannual, and long-term fluctuations in its intensity, pathway, and influence on the continental shelf circulation. Understanding and monitoring this variability is crucial, as the EAC plays an important role in controlling shelf dynamics, regional circulation, coastal weather, and global climate patterns. As such, two high-frequency (HF) coastal radar systems have been deployed on the eastern coast of Australia to measure surface currents upstream and downstream of the East Australian Current (EAC) separation point. The multiyear radar dataset (spanning 4–8 years) is presented here, and its use is demonstrated to assess the spatial and temporal variability in the EAC and the adjacent continental shelf circulation, ranging from seasonal to interannual scales. The dataset is gap-filled using a 2dVar approach (after rigorous comparison with the traditional unweighted least-squares (LS) fit method). Additionally, we explore the representation of the depth variability in the observations by comparing the data with surface Lagrangian drifter velocities (with and without depth drogues). The multiyear radar-derived surface current dataset, which was validated using short-term drifter and long-term current meter observations, revealed that the local upstream circulation is strongly dominated by the EAC's annual cycle, peaking in the austral summer. The analysis using 8 years of upstream data revealed the period of the EAC intensification at around 3–5 years. The interannual variability in the poleward transport downstream was driven by the intrinsic variability in the jet. This dataset which continues to be collected, complemented by numerical simulations and in situ measurements, will provide a comprehensive view of the EAC's variability and its impact on the broader regional circulation dynamics that can be used for a range of dynamical investigations.

Vernon,Long-term hydro-economic analysis tool for evaluating global groundwater cost and supply: Superwell v1.1,"Superwell is a physics-based hydro-economic model that estimates the production costs and availability of groundwater worldwide. It calculates how much groundwater can be extracted and at what cost, using detailed maps and data of the Earth's properties. Through these estimates, and by using them with other models, Superwell facilitates exploration of coupled human–environmental system challenges, such as future water supply sustainability or multi-sectoral energy–water–land feedbacks. 
 Groundwater plays a key role in meeting water demands, supplying over 40 % of irrigation water globally, with this role likely to grow as water demands and surface water variability increase. A better understanding of the future role of groundwater in meeting sectoral demands requires an integrated hydro-economic evaluation of its cost and availability. Yet substantial gaps remain in our knowledge and modeling capabilities related to groundwater availability, recharge, feasible locations for extraction, extractable volumes, and associated extraction costs, which are essential for large-scale analyses of integrated human–water system scenarios, particularly at the global scale. To address these needs, we developed Superwell, a physics-based groundwater extraction and cost accounting model that operates at sub-annual temporal and at the coarsest 0.5° (≈50 km × 50 km) gridded spatial resolution with global coverage. The model produces location-specific groundwater supply–cost curves that provide the levelized cost to access different quantities of available groundwater. The inputs to Superwell include recent high-resolution hydrogeologic datasets of permeability, porosity, aquifer thickness, depth to water table, recharge, and hydrogeological complexity zones. It also accounts for well capital and maintenance costs, as well as the energy costs required to lift water to the surface. The model employs a Theis-based scheme coupled with an amortization-based cost accounting formulation to simulate groundwater extraction and quantify the cost of groundwater pumping. The result is a spatiotemporally flexible, physically realistic, economics-based model that produces groundwater supply–cost curves. We show examples of these supply–cost curves and the insights that can be derived from them across a set of scenarios designed to explore model outcomes. The supply–cost curves produced by the model show that most (90 %) nonrenewable groundwater in storage globally is extractable at costs lower than USD 0.57 m−3, while half of the volume remains extractable at under USD 0.108 m−3. The global unit cost is estimated to range from a minimum of USD 0.004 m−3 to a maximum of USD 3.971 m−3. We also demonstrate and discuss examples of how these cost curves could be used by linking Superwell's outputs with other models to explore coupled human–environmental system challenges, such as water resources planning and management, or broader analyses of multisectoral feedbacks."

Using 112 sensitivity experiments with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and focusing on 28 wind events, it is found that wind direction was less sensitive to the PBL schemes. The quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE) scheme captured temporal variations best, while the Mellor–Yamada–Janjić (MYJ) scheme had the least error in wind speed. 
 The topography of the Sichuan Basin is complex, and high-resolution wind field simulations over this region are of great significance for meteorology, air quality, and wind energy utilization. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to investigate the performance of different planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes in simulating near-surface wind fields over the Sichuan Basin at a spatial resolution of 0.33 km. The experiment is based on multiple case studies of a selection of 28 near-surface wind events from 2021 to 2022, and a total of 112 sensitivity simulations were carried out and compared to observations by employing four commonly used PBL schemes: the Yonsei University (YSU) scheme, the Mellor–Yamada–Janjić (MYJ) scheme, the Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino level 2 (MYNN2) scheme, and the quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE) scheme. The results demonstrate that the wind direction can be reasonably reproduced, and its sensitivity to the PBL scheme appears to be less pronounced compared to the near-surface wind speed, though some variability is still observed. As for wind speed, the QNSE scheme had the best performance in reproducing the temporal variation out of the four schemes, while the MYJ scheme had the smallest model bias. Further cluster analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of the PBL schemes is affected by diurnal variation and different circulation geneses. For instance, when the near-surface wind event, caused by the southward movement of strong cold air, occurred between 06:00 and 08:00 UTC, the variation and speed were well reproduced by all four PBL schemes, and the differences between them were small. However, the simulation results for strong winds occurring during midnight to the early hours of the morning exhibit poor root mean square errors but high correlation coefficients, whereas for strong wind processes happening in the early to late evening hours and for southwesterly wind processes, the opposite pattern occurs. Overall, the four schemes are better for near-surface wind simulations in daytime than at night. The results show the role of PBL schemes in wind field simulations under unstable weather conditions and provide a valuable reference for further research in the study area and surrounding areas."

This work found the synergistic effect of light and sulfite on destroying rCOPR stability, causing the significant release of Cr(VI), which was 4∼7 times higher than that under single factor action. In CrxFe1–x(OH)3/sulfite/light system, Cr(VI) release rate could reach 11.11 × 10–7 M min–1 g–1, because of the rapid formation of ·OH, O2·–, SO4·–, and quadrivalent iron [Fe(IV)]. In addition, this study found that the oxidized chromium residue could continuously release Cr(III) after being transferred to the dark environment. This should be attributed to the obvious change in the iron coordination structure of rCOPR caused by the catalytic reaction of sulfite with light, which greatly weakened the ability of the Fe–O structure to encase chromium elements in a solid.

In this system, more than 80% of CB was efficiently oxidized at a high w8 hly space velocity of 600,000 gcat–1 h–1, which was a 6.5-fold increase compared to conventional UV–PCO, and no catalytic deactivation over 1300 min of reaction. Notably, the COx selectivity consistently reached 100%. These outstanding performances were attributed to the synergy of direct VUV photolysis and gas–solid interface photocatalysis. Importantly, the C–Cl bond of CB was efficiently cleaved by VUV photolysis, generating •Cl as the oxidant. Ozone (O3) generated from VUV photolysis was efficiently adsorbed on oxygen vacancies and Mn (Ov + Mn) adjacent sites on FTMG. These adsorbed O3 rapidly captured the photogenerated electrons, thereby effectively preventing Cl reduction and avoiding catalyst deactivation.

We demonstrate that such distinctive core–shell magnetite NPs are indicative of a coal-burning source. Hence, magnetite NPs deposited in the human kidneys in this study area most likely derived from air pollution emissions from coal-fired power plants and were transported via blood circulation to the kidney.

Here, laboratory-based combustion experiments were conducted to characterize EPFRs for different pellets burned in cooking and heating stoves and compared with those for the corresponding uncompressed biofuels. Emission factors (EFs) of EPFRs for biomass pellets ranged from 2.97 × 1017 to 2.33 × 1019 spins/kg, following a log-normal distribution, with a geometric mean of 4.21 × 1018 spins/kg. These EPFRs were carbon-centered free radicals adjacent to oxygen atoms. Emissions varied largely across different fuel–stove combinations, with the combustion efficiency and combustion temperature as key influencing factors explaining 49% of the variations in EFPR EFs. Compared to raw fuels, pelletized fuels showed 50–80% lower EPFR EFs and 40–70% lower EPFRs per PM but more different EPFR types, and there was no significant change in the degree of oxidation of the EPFRs.

We incorporate cooking volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in a chemical transport model and evaluate it against observations in order to improve the model representation of the present-day ozone chemical regime in LA. Using this updated model, we investigate the impact of adopting zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) on ozone pollution with increased confidence. We show that mitigating on-road gasoline emissions through ZEV adoption would benefit both air quality and climate by substantially reducing anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in LA by 28 and 41% during the summertime, respectively. This would result in a moderate reduction of O3 pollution, decreasing the average number of population-weighted O3 exceedance days in August from 9 to 6 days, and would shift the majority of LA, except for the coastline, into a NOx-limited regime. Our results also show that adopting ZEVs for on-road diesel and off-road vehicles would further reduce the number of O3 exceedance days in August to an average of 1 day."

In this study, correlation analysis revealed the complex impact of rainfall on wastewater effluent composition, identifying clusters of CECs introduced through rain runoff and discharges from retention basins. Rain events affected the removal efficiency of easily degradable CECs, with variations between WWTPs. Persistent compounds such as PFAS demonstrated strong intragroup correlations, reflecting their common sources and environmental stability. These findings provide valuable insights into the diverse profiles of CECs in wastewater and demonstrate the potential of correlation-based approaches to optimize treatment strategies to the specific challenges of individual WWTPs."

However, the roles of photogenerated carriers in PFR formation remain underexplored. We compared and analyzed the PFR formation on hematite-SiO2 loaded catechol, combining experimental and theoretical investigations. Significant PFRs were observed only under ultraviolet light irradiation. The PFR concentration on hematite nanoplates (HP, 1.29 × 1017 spins/mg) was higher than those on hematite nanocubes (HC, 9.19 × 1016 spins/mg) and nanorods (HR, 7.02 × 1016 spins/mg). A stronger stability of PFRs on HR (183 h of t1/e) was observed compared with HP (95.4 h of t1/e) and HC (37.7 h of t1/e). Photoelectrochemical analysis and quenching experiments indicated that photogenerated holes, rather than electrons, controlled the PFR formation. Photogenerated holes manipulate the asymmetric distribution of up-spin and down-spin electrons in the p orbital of catechol to regulate PFR formation. Hole quantity and exposed facets caused significant differences in the concentration and stability of PFRs. The high concentration of PFRs on HP is due to abundant holes, while the weak stability of PFRs on HC is due to the exposed {012} facet. This study introduces a novel mechanism for PFR formation regulated by photogenerated holes, contributing to a better understanding of their environmental function and associated risks."

Psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. However, the associations among floods, psychiatric disorders, and dementia are still unclear. Using a population cohort from the UK Biobank, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric disorders on the associations between floods and dementia. In this study, cumulative exposure to floods over an eight-year period preceding the study baseline was assessed for each participant at residential addresses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the associations of flooding exposure with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether psychiatric disorders mediate the relationship between floods and dementia. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years (interquartile range: 11.6–13.0), 0.9% (2,028) of participants developed dementia and 9.5% (21,629) were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The flooding exposure was associated with an 8.0% increased risk of incident dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.080, 95% CI: 1.023–1.141). The flood–dementia association was observed to be partially mediated by several subtypes of psychiatric disorders (overall proportion of mediation: 75.7%), with psychotic disorder accounting for 49.7% (indirect effect HR: 1.039, 95% confidence interval: 1.015–1.064) of flood-related dementia, followed by stress-related disorder (proportion of mediation: 18.1%), and depression (proportion of mediation: 3.9%). This study provides evidence of an increased risk of dementia associated with exposure to floods, with psychiatric disorders playing a crucial mediating role in the flood-related dementia pathway. These findings suggest that flooding exposure is a critical risk factor for dementia, and targeted interventions addressing postdisaster mental health may be crucial for dementia prevention in affected populations."

Using land surface models and water budget simulations, we examined the extent to which increased flow was driven by natural climate variability, anthropogenic climate trends, land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC), and ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2. Natural climate variability (arising largely from coupled ocean‐atmosphere circulation systems in both the Pacific and North Atlantic) accounted for ∼765 m3 s−1 of the ∼900 m3 s−1 increase in flow since mid‐century, while anthropogenic climate trends negatively forced flow by increasing evapotranspiration more than precipitation. LULCC and elevated CO2 further increased simulated mean streamflow by ∼550 and ∼70 m3 s−1, respectively, relative to pre‐Industrial conditions and ∼100 and ∼65 m3 s−1 relative to mid‐20th century conditions. The LULCC effect was especially large in wet years, implying that current land cover is ill‐suited for buffering against extreme precipitation, likely in large part due to replacement of forest by cropland in the lower basin. Because increases in Missouri River flow over the past century were driven mostly by a recent (and likely transient) pluvial, our results suggest that flow in the basin could revert to a drier mean state when that pluvial ends, likely made worse by increased evaporative demand from anthropogenic warming."

In 2022, Hurricane Ian generated extensive river plumes laden with nutrients, followed by a large K. brevis bloom that lasted for six months. Analysis using a coupled hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical model showed that Hurricane Ian drove the bloom in two ways. First, northerly winds on the western half of Ian generated coastal upwelling and onshore bottom currents that transported subsurface K. brevis cells toward the coast. Second, a substantial amount of the riverine nutrients remained after the initial diatom bloom and were dispersed widely, creating a favorable condition for the slow‐growing K. brevis."

We find that a near‐surface dry region forms prior to the passage of a strong front. The near‐surface dry air originates in the upper atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean, before circulating around an anticyclone, descending as a dry slot onto a deep mixed layer, and finally rapidly reaching the surface through convective rolls. A second dry region forms after the front passes. Again, much of the dry air originates in the upper atmosphere near Antarctica, before descending to the top of the boundary layer and forming a postfrontal dry slot. The dry air then mixes rapidly to the surface. These findings have potential applications for fire weather forecasting and fire management."

A New Analysis Based on Long‐Term Measurements in Antarctica,"It has long been noted that the seasonal behavior of the global electric circuit (GEC) is difficult to reliably determine from measurements of atmospheric electrical parameters, largely owing to prominent annual cycles of aerosols affecting the conductivity in most continental locations. Here we discuss earlier studies in this direction and present further analysis of this problem using the results of potential gradient (PG) measurements at the Vostok station in Antarctica during 2006–2020. Collected at the high and remote Antarctic Plateau, Vostok PG values form a unique continuous data set indicating the variation of atmospheric electricity on different timescales; on the annual timescale the uniformity and consistency of the data turn out to be especially important (in particular, seasonal behavior of GEC parameters at specific UTC hours may be substantially different from the respective diurnal mean variation). PG measurements at Vostok indicate the highest and lowest values of the diurnal mean GEC intensity during the Northern Hemisphere summer and winter, respectively; this variation generally agrees with the available results of air—Earth current measurements. The seasonal variation of the GEC has been previously linked to the annual cycle of insolation; our findings further support this relationship, as it can provide a physical explanation not only for the summer PG maximum observed at Vostok but also for a small local minimum inside this maximum. The dominance of the Northern Hemisphere in the resulting variation is apparently related to the latitudinally asymmetrical distribution of land over the Earth's surface."

Improved understanding of atmosphere‐ice interactions is required to improve models, requiring year‐round observations to address seasonally dependent biases. This work uses novel observations from the MOSAiC expedition to quantify the responses of surface fluxes to radiative forcing over sea ice throughout a complete annual cycle. We identify two primary regimes of flux response: an ice growth regime in winter and an ice melt regime in summer. In the growth regime, changes in radiative forcing impact upwelling longwave, sensible heat, and subsurface heat fluxes, whereas in the melt regime changes in radiative forcing primarily alter the amount of melt and subsurface transmission because the surface temperature is fixed. These observed responses of surface fluxes to radiative forcing are used to evaluate seven weather forecast models during the ice growth regime. In most models, the responses of surface fluxes to radiative forcing do not match observations. Many models also have biased downwelling longwave. One model (the Coupled Arctic Forecast System; CAFS) adequately captures both the mean radiative forcing and the flux responses in winter. CAFS is further evaluated against observations spanning the full MOSAiC year, demonstrating sufficient agreement to provide a more generalized understanding of these SEB process relationships across the Arctic."

Based on the multivariate empirical orthogonal function (MV‐EOF) method, this study identifies two dominant modes of summer NWP MHWs. The first mode, characterized by widespread warming across the low‐latitude NWP, occurs during the summer following an El Niño event. This mode is strongly associated with the Pacific–Japan teleconnection pattern and sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly gradient between the North Indian Ocean and tropical western Pacific. The second mode exhibits a northeast‐to‐southwest tripole structure, representing the summer phase during El Niño development. This tripole pattern is possibly influenced by the North Pacific Oscillation, highlighting an extratropical–tropical teleconnection that propagates the effects of positive SST anomalies. Using physics‐based empirical prediction models validated by the leave‐one‐out cross‐validation approach, a notable degree of predictability is found for these MHW modes. The temporal correlation coefficient scores and Root Mean Square Errors between observed and predicted principal components (PC1 and PC2) reach 0.65 and 0.77 for PC1 and 0.55 and 0.84 for PC2, respectively, over the period 1982–2022.

Additional research is needed to ensure that climate intervention strategies will be safe, effective, and environmentally acceptable. The importance of the Arctic in influencing global climate has led investigators to propose various climate intervention strategies specific to the Arctic (Strawa et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.08.010). One approach, proposed by Field et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF000820), is to distribute reflective hollow glass microspheres (HGM) on strategic areas of Arctic sea ice at strategic times to reduce ice melt, thereby slowing the Arctic ice‐albedo feedback and interrupting further acceleration of ice melt. While research into this technique is still in its early stages, results show this approach can effectively slow melt of Arctic sea ice (Field et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF000820; Johnson et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022ef002883).

 Frictional interfaces are found in systems ranging from biological joints to earthquake faults. When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1–20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21–28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27–29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34.

 Although learning in response to extrinsic reinforcement is theorized to be driven by dopamine signals that encode the difference between expected and experienced rewards1,2, skills that enable verbal or musical expression can be learned without extrinsic reinforcement. Instead, spontaneous execution of these skills is thought to be intrinsically reinforcing3,4. Whether dopamine signals similarly guide learning of these intrinsically reinforced behaviours is unknown. In juvenile zebra finches learning from an adult tutor, dopamine signalling in a song-specialized basal ganglia region is required for successful song copying, a spontaneous, intrinsically reinforced process5. Here we show that dopamine dynamics in the song basal ganglia faithfully track the learned quality of juvenile song performance on a rendition-by-rendition basis. Furthermore, dopamine release in the basal ganglia is driven not only by inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons classically associated with reinforcement learning but also by song premotor inputs, which act by means of local cholinergic signalling to elevate dopamine during singing. Although both cholinergic and dopaminergic signalling are necessary for juvenile song learning, only dopamine tracks the learned quality of song performance. Therefore, dopamine dynamics in the basal ganglia encode performance quality during self-directed, long-term learning of natural behaviours.

 The stability and function of biomolecules are directly influenced by their myriad interactions with water1–16. In this study, we investigated water through cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on a highly solvated molecule, the Tetrahymena ribozyme, determined at 2.2 and 2.3 Å resolutions. By employing segmentation-guided water and ion modeling (SWIM)17,18, an approach combining resolvability and chemical parameters, we automatically modeled and cross-validated water molecules and Mg2+ ions in the ribozyme core, revealing the extensive involvement of water in mediating RNA non-canonical interactions. Unexpectedly, in regions where SWIM does not model ordered water, we observed highly similar densities in both cryo-EM maps. In many of these regions, the cryo-EM densities superimpose with complex water networks predicted by molecular dynamics (MD), supporting their assignment as water and suggesting a biophysical explanation for their elusiveness to conventional atomic coordinate modeling. Our study demonstrates an approach to unveil both rigid and flexible waters that surround biomolecules through cryo-EM map densities, statistical and chemical metrics, and MD simulations."

 Wearable thermoelectric devices, capable of converting body heat into electrical energy, provide the potential driving power for the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and soft robotics. However, critical parameters have long been overlooked for these practical applications. Here, we report a three-dimensional flexible thermoelectric device with a structure featuring an inner rigid and outer flexible woven design. Such a structure includes numerous small static air pockets that create a stable out-of-plane temperature difference, enabling precise temperature signal detection (accuracy up to 0.02 K). Particularly, this structure exhibits excellent multi-signal decoupling capability, excellent elasticity (>10,000 compression cycles), ultra-fast compression response (20 ms), stable output signal under 50% compressive strain, high breathability (1300 mm s−1), and washability. All these metrics achieve the highest values currently reported, fully meeting the requirements for body heat and moisture exchange, as demonstrated in our designed integrated smart mask and smart glove systems based on vector machine learning technology.

 China is facing a severe groundwater quality crisis amid economic development and climate change, yet the extent and trajectory of this crisis remain largely unknown. Here we developed a machine-learning model, incorporating natural and social-economic factors, to construct annual probabilistic maps of poor groundwater quality (PGQ, i.e., Class V based on the Chinese groundwater quality standard) across China from 1980 to 2100. Alarmingly, our findings indicate a concerning escalation in PGQ area ratio, rising from 17.3% in 1980 to 30.1% in 2000, and surging to 40.8% by 2020, adversely affecting 6.8%, 17.5%, and 36.0% of the Chinese population, respectively. The predominant drivers of this degradation were identified as agricultural discharge (contributing to 10.7% growth in PGQ area ratio), followed by groundwater exploitation (5.6%), industrial discharge (5.3%), domestic discharge (1.7%), climate change (0.5%), and land use change (-0.3%). By 2050, the PGQ area ratio could range from 37.9% to 48.3% under different socio-economic and climate scenarios.

Here the authors present chiral europium halides leading to red circularly polarized luminescence with large dissymmetry factor and strong magneto-chiroptical properties. 
 Chiral organic-inorganic hybrid metal halides as promising circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitter candidates hold great potential for high-definition displays and future spin-optoelectronics. The recent challenge lies primarily in developing high-performance red CPL emitters. Here, coupling the f-f transition characteristics of trivalent europium ions (Eu3+) with chirality, we construct the chiral Eu-based halides, (R/S-3BrMBA)3EuCl6, which exhibit strong and predictable red emission with large photoluminescence quantum yield (59.8%), narrow bandwidth (≈2 nm), long lifetime (≈2 ms), together with large dissymmetry factor |glum| of 1.84 × 10−2. Compared with the previously reported chiral metal halides, these chiral Eu-based halides show the highest red CPL brightness. Furthermore, the degree of photoluminescence polarization in (R/S-3BrMBA)3EuCl6 can be manipulated by the external magnetic field. Particularly, benefiting from the field-generated Zeeman splitting and spin mixing at exciton states, an anomalously positive magneto-photoluminescence was observed at room temperature. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing both high-performance and pure-red CPL emitters. It also opens the door for chiral rare-earth halides toward chiral optoelectronic and spintronic applications.

 Programmable metasurface holds big promise in wireless communications by virtue of its powerful capability in controlling electromagnetic waves. However, challenges exist for the programmable metasurface in achieving self-sufficient renewable energy supply and flexible and reliable multi-domain information transmissions. Here, we report a solar-powered light-modulated microwave programmable metasurface (SLMPM) by integrating a photovoltaic module to acquire information from modulated light and energy from sunlight simultaneously.

Its low power consumption and on-board energy harvesting capability allows for 24 hours of light-to-microwave information transmission with 8 hours of sole sunlight energy input. A hybrid wireless communication system for real-time image transmission is demonstrated to show the outstanding features of SLMPM.

This study shows how a government-supported strategy of overfishing this sea urchin could help conservation and fisheries outcomes. 
 Climate change is driving species to colonize new ranges, sometimes causing uncontrollable damage. Here we present a remarkable scenario in which government-supported incentives have driven the establishment of a commercial fishery targeting a destructive urchin, intentionally encouraging overfishing to protect kelp ecosystems. This ecosystem management strategy is paradoxical in the objective to overfish sustainably. Due to consistent and increasing larval influx, the eradication of urchins in their extended range is implausible. Management, therefore, focuses on maintaining urchin density below a critical threshold while ensuring a viable commercial fishery for long-term species control. Our model dissects the fishery’s impact, offering practical strategies for controlling a destructive range extender given economic and spatial dynamics. Beyond the implications of subsidizing a commercial fishery to counteract the impacts of climate change, our study explores the conflict between exploitation and conservation, challenging traditional views and presenting practical pathways to sustainability.

Frequent eruptions of a regional volcanic arc system increased cyanobacterial populations and organic carbon sinking fluxes, as recorded by extreme total organic carbon content (>30 wt.%) and positive organic carbon and negative nitrogen isotopic excursions. In turn, high levels of primary productivity induced intense water-column anoxia, facilitating preservation of organic matter.

 Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is increasingly recognized as a non-destructive probe for tracking terrestrial photosynthesis. Emerging developments in spectral invariants theory provide an innovative and efficient approach for representing SIF radiative transfer processes at the canopy scale. However, modeling leaf-scale fluorescence based on the spectral invariants properties (SIP) remains underexplored. In this study, the spectral invariants theory is employed for the first time to model the leaf-scale total, backward and forward fluorescence (leaf-SIP SIF). The leaf-SIP SIF model separates the leaf-scale radiative transfer process into two distinct components: the wavelength-dependent one associated with leaf biochemical properties, and the wavelength-independent component linked to leaf structural characteristics. The leaf structure-related effects are characterized by two spectrally invariant parameters: the photon recollision probability (p) and the scattering asymmetry parameter (q), which are parameterized using the directly measurable leaf dry matter. Evaluation against field measurements shows that the proposed leaf-SIP SIF model has a good performance, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89, 0.89, 0.90 and root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 1.28, 0.69, 0.74 Wm−2μm−1sr−1, respectively for the total, backward, and forward fluorescence (660–800 nm). The leaf-SIP SIF model with a more concise formulation demonstrates comparable performance with the widely used Fluspect model. The leaf-SIP SIF model provides a simple and efficient approach for simulating leaf-scale fluorescence, with the potential to be integrated into a unified SIP-based model framework for simulating the radiative transfer processes across the soil-leaf-canopy-atmosphere continuum."

 Topography alters both the incident radiation and radiative transfer (RT) processes within the canopy, leading to changes in the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Most traditional semi-physical terrain correction (TC) methods for vegetation canopy BRFs rely on simplifying physically-based analytical RT models. However, these analytical RT models are not comprehensively parameterized for all RT computations, leading to the neglect of crucial processes, such as multiple scattering processes during the derivation of semi-physical TC methods. The spectral invariants theory (p-theory) offers an efficient approach to model canopy BRFs by simplifying RT computations. We extended p-theory to sloping terrain, considering the variation of the terrain-induced incident radiation and RT processes, and developed a canopy BRF TC model, termed the p-C method. The p-C method applies not only to spectral bands with lower multiple scattering within the canopy (e.g., visible bands) but also to near-infrared (NIR) bands, where multiple scattering effects may be more pronounced than in the visible bands within the canopy. We used the three-dimensional RT model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) to simulate BRFs of homogeneous, realistic canopies of the RAMI (RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison) experiment, and BRF images with real DEM (Digital Elevation Model) to evaluate the p-C method and to compare it with traditional empirical and semi-physical TC methods (CC, SCS, SCS+C, DS, PLC-S, and SE). The p-C method reduced the RMSE (root mean square error) by 67 %, 64 %, 64 %, 85 %, 83 %, and 54 % respectively over these methods. Furthermore, when applied to Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing BRF images, the p-C method effectively eliminated terrain texture, as confirmed by visual interpretation and the linear regression between the corrected BRF images and the local solar incidence angle. Currently, the p-C method only considers illuminated slopes, and corrections for shaded slopes need to be studied in the future."

 Accurate measurement of high-resolution snow depth (SD) is crucial for regional ecohydrology and climate studies. Passive microwave remote sensing is an effective technique for SD retrieval on global or regional scales. However, its low spatial resolution limits its application in various fields. Additionally, the complex effects of multiple factors in the microwave radiation process pose a significant challenge for accurate SD retrieval as SD increases. In this study, a high-resolution SD retrieval algorithm for passive microwave data was developed based on the linear unmixing method and machine learning (ML) stacking technique. Firstly, the 0.25° AMSR2 brightness temperature data were downscaled to 0.01° through linear unmixing. Then, combining the temporal and spatial features of the snowpack, the high-resolution SD was retrieved based on the ML stacking technique. This method combined the advantages of multiple base models for retrieving different depths of snow, which effectively improved the overall estimation performance of the algorithm. Compared with in situ observed SD at meteorological stations and field observation SD, the algorithm achieved an overall RMSE of 5.25 cm, which was lower than that of other coarse-resolution SD datasets and products, including the long-term series of daily SD dataset in China (7.40 cm), the ERA5-Land (9.71 cm), and JAXA AMSR2 Level 2 SD products (12.59 cm).

An ensemble model was trained to predict landscape-scale fuels – such as the ’Scott and Burgan 40’ – using the as-received Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field survey plot data obtained from the USDA Forest Service. However, this basic approach yielded relatively poor results due to the inadequate amount of training data. Pseudo-labeled and fully synthetic datasets were developed using generative AI approaches to address the limitations of ground truth data availability. These synthetic datasets were used for augmenting the FIA data from California to enhance the robustness and coverage of model training. The use of an ensemble of methods – including deep learning neural networks, decision trees, and gradient boosting – offered a fuel mapping accuracy of nearly 80%. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated for regions of the 2021 Dixie and Caldor fires.

We aimed to assess the impact of PM2.5 and PMcoarse on CVD risk and its specific types, including overall CVD, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke.We recruited 471,706 patients aged 65 years and older who were newly diagnosed with CVD between 2015 and 2021, using data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in South Korea. PM concentrations, specifically those with diameters smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10), were obtained from the National Ambient Air Monitoring System. The concentration of PMcoarse was calculated by subtracting PM2.5 from PM10. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD using conditional logistic regression.Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5, the highest quartile of lag0 (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.05) and lag0-1 (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) had higher CVD risk. Similarly, the 4th quartile of lag0 (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) and lag0-1 (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03) had higher odds for CVD compared to the 1st quartile of PMcoarse. The highest quartile of lag0-1 for PM2.5 (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06) and PMcoarse (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.04) showed increased odds of coronary heart disease. For stroke, however, a significant increase in CVD risk was observed only for ischemic stroke, not hemorrhagic stroke.We found a significant dose-response relationship indicating that higher levels of short-term PM exposure were associated with an increased risk of CVD among older adults. Systematic management of short-term exposure to PM in older adults may reduce the risk of future CVD occurrence."

In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible.

By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameterR(V) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find thatR(V) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions.

Radiators (Borneo) generate and distribute diversity, incubators (Indochina, New Guinea, and Sulawesi) produce diversity in isolation, corridors (Java, Maluku, Sumatra, and the Thai-Malay Peninsula) connect neighboring regions, and accumulators (Australia, India, Palawan, and the Philippines) acquire diversity generated elsewhere.

Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes."

Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%–2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research."

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has shown potential to ameliorate these effects by reducing surface temperatures. Due to the potential for an asymmetric hemispheric response in precipitation, Arctic-only SAI is not recommended. Given the challenges associated with an Antarctic SAI program, including the lack of nearby large airports, however, we designed and simulated an Arctic-only logistically constrained SAI scenario, considering limitations imposed by factors affecting the planning, execution, and management of operations. Our scenario is constrained by aircraft development and delivery timelines. SAI deployment begins in 2032 and increases to a maximum annual injection of 6.7 TgSO2 by 2053 through 2070. The scenario is simulated in a modified version of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model. Results indicate that Arctic-only SAI can reduce Northern Hemisphere temperatures and slow sea ice loss, though the early years of deployment may show limited cooling due to low ramp-in injection magnitudes. The Arctic-only SAI introduces minimal impact on Southern Hemisphere (SH) temperatures but significant shifts in the hydrologic cycle, particularly around the equator. SH changes are low within the first two decades, suggesting that asymmetries in Arctic-only SAI deployment could be sustained without severe adverse climate impacts for the first couple of decades. These asymmetries matter given the challenges associated with an Antarctic SAI program. Our findings underscore the necessity of incorporating logistical constraints on deployment and the need for multi-model assessments in the evaluation of polar SAI scenarios. This approach would ensure a strong scientific understanding of polar SAI and facilitates policy and decision-maker understanding of the risks and benefits of SAI."

The period from 1910 to 2012 can be divided into four phases, including two rapid warming (1910–1945 and 1975–1998) and two warming slowdown (1940–1975 and 1998–2012) periods. This study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics of the interdecadal trends in global SAT under the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on a multi-basin scale. Here, we have accumulated the numerical simulated SAT anomalies under the forcing of historical SST in the selected ocean basins. The results indicate that multi-basin SSTs collectively govern the spatiotemporal variations and interdecadal trends of SATs during rapid warming periods. SSTs in the Indian Ocean, North Atlantic, and western Pacific can affect the spatiotemporal interdecadal trends of SAT during 1940–1975. SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific and North Pacific can modify the SAT spatiotemporal trends during 1998–2012. Considering the nonlinear interactions between different oceanic regions, the SAT forced by the collective SSTs in the six ocean basins shows high consistency with observation. This indicates that the combined effects of SSTs in the six ocean basins are key reasons for global SAT interdecadal change in 1910–2012."

We describe the data assemblage and associated quality control and discuss some potential uses of this dataset. The dataset is provided in a single format and includes the quality flag for each sample. 
 Total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) in the oceans are important properties to understand the ocean carbon cycle and its link with global change (ocean carbon sinks and sources, ocean acidification) and ultimately to find carbon-based solutions or mitigation procedures (marine carbon removal). We present an extended database (SNAPO-CO2; Metzl et al., 2024c) with 24 700 new additional data for the period 2002 to 2023. The full database now includes more than 67 000 AT and CT observations along with basic ancillary data (time and space location, depth, temperature, and salinity) in various oceanic regions obtained since 1993 mainly in the framework of French research projects. This includes both surface and water columns data acquired in open oceans, coastal zones, rivers, the Mediterranean Sea, and either from time series stations or punctual cruises. Most AT and CT data in this synthesis were measured from discrete samples using the same closed-cell potentiometric titration calibrated with certified reference material, with an overall accuracy of ±4 µmol kg−1 for both AT and CT. The same technique was used on board for underway measurements during cruises conducted in the southern Indian and Southern oceans. The AT and CT data from these cruises are also added to this synthesis. The data are provided in one dataset for the global ocean (https://doi.org/10.17882/102337, Metzl et al., 2024c) that offers a direct use for regional or global purposes, e.g., AT–salinity relationships, long-term CT estimates, constraint and validation of diagnostics CT and AT reconstructed fields, ocean carbon and coupled climate–carbon models simulations, and data derived from Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats. These data can also be used to calculate pH, fugacity of CO2 (fCO2), and other carbon system properties to derive ocean acidification rates or air–sea CO2 fluxes."

Varney;Douglas McNeall,A rapid-application emissions-to-impacts tool for  scenario assessment: Probabilistic Regional Impacts  from Model patterns and Emissions (PRIME),"We present PRIME (Probabilistic Regional Impacts from Model patterns and Emissions), which is designed to take new emissions scenarios and rapidly provide regional impact information. PRIME allows large ensembles to be run on multi-centennial timescales, including the analysis of many important variables for impact assessments. Our evaluation shows that PRIME reproduces the climate response for known scenarios, providing confidence in using PRIME for novel scenarios. 
 Climate policies evolve quickly, and new scenarios designed around these policies are used to illustrate how they impact global mean temperatures using simple climate models (or climate emulators). Simple climate models are extremely efficient, although some can only provide global estimates of climate metrics such as mean surface temperature, CO2 concentration and effective radiative forcing. Within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework, understanding of the regional impacts of scenarios that include the most recent science is needed to allow targeted policy decisions to be made quickly. To address this, we present PRIME (Probabilistic Regional Impacts from Model patterns and Emissions), a new flexible probabilistic framework which aims to provide an efficient mechanism to run new scenarios without the significant overheads of larger, more complex Earth system models (ESMs). PRIME provides the capability to include features of the most recent ESM projections, science and scenarios to run ensemble simulations on multi-centennial timescales and include analyses of many key variables that are relevant and important for impact assessments. We use a simple climate model to provide the global temperature response to emissions scenarios. These estimated temperatures are used to scale monthly mean patterns from a large number of CMIP6 ESMs. These patterns provide the inputs to a “weather generator” algorithm and a land surface model. The PRIME system thus generates an end-to-end estimate of the land surface impacts from the emissions scenarios. We test PRIME using known scenarios in the form of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), to demonstrate that our model reproduces the ESM climate responses to these scenarios. We show results for a range of scenarios: the SSP5–8.5 high-emissions scenario was used to define the patterns, and SSP1–2.6, a mitigation scenario with low emissions, and SSP5–3.4-OS, an overshoot scenario, were used as verification data. PRIME correctly represents the climate response (and spread) for these known scenarios, which gives us confidence our simulation framework will be useful for rapidly providing probabilistic spatially resolved information for novel climate scenarios, thereby substantially reducing the time between new scenarios being released and the availability of regional impact information."

Benning,Immobilization of Chromium by Iron Oxides in Nickel–Cobalt Laterite Mine Tailings,"Mine tailings generated from hydrometallurgical processing of nickel–cobalt laterite deposits contain high levels of chromium (Cr), with the hexavalent species being a toxic pollutant and carcinogen. However, the partitioning, speciation, and local bonding environment of Cr in the mine tailings remain largely unknown, hindering our ability to predict its toxicity and long-term behavior. Coupling detailed mineralogical, spectroscopic, and geochemical characterization with sequential extraction of tailings from active and rehabilitated dams, we show that Cr is present in its least toxic form, Cr(III), and largely immobilized by recalcitrant minerals. This immobilization also regulates dissolved Cr concentrations in the interacting waters to levels up to five times lower than the global regulatory limit (50 μg L–1). Solid-phase Cr concentrations were ≤1.5 wt % with 39–61% of Cr incorporated into hematite, and to a lesser extent, alunite, both of which formed early in the hydrometallurgical extraction process of mined laterite ores. The remaining Cr was present as recalcitrant chromite residues from the primary source laterites. We highlight that, although hydrometallurgical extractions liberate Cr from laterite ores during processing, they also provide ideal chemical pathways for the formation of highly stable, crystalline hematite that successfully sequesters Cr, while restricting its environmental mobility."

Recently, various hydrated electron-based techniques have been developed to destroy these compounds. However, the molecular mechanisms controlled by different hydrated electron photosensitizers are still unclear. Herein, we investigated the PFAS transformation processes in different hydrated electron-based systems, i.e., UV/Na2SO3, UV/indole, and UV/3-indoleacetic acid (IAA), using different perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCA) as model compounds. By monitoring the production and decay of hydrated electrons, molecular interactions, and the generated intermediates, we systematically revealed the structure-property-performance mechanism of different systems. In the UV/Na2SO3 system, the disordered attack of hydrated electrons induced rapid destruction for either long or short-chain PFCA. However, the lower hydrated electron efficiency limited the final defluorination ratio. In the UV/indole system, the interaction between indole and PFCA promoted the directed transfer of hydrated electrons, resulting in a significantly higher destruction efficiency for long-chain PFCA than for short-chain PFCA. However, the self-quenching of hydrated electrons in the UV/IAA system led to the ineffective decomposition for all PFCA. This study provides mechanistic insights into the hydrated electron-induced PFAS decomposition processes, which would expand the designing strategies for improving PFAS destruction efficiency."

CWD is caused by infectious prions, which can enter the environment through bodily fluids or the carcasses of infected animals. Prions can be stored, remain infectious in both soil and water for many years, and transported hydrologically, possibly expanding the geographic range of CWD transmission. In order to better predict hydrological prion transport, we investigated how CWD prion protein (PrPCWD) partitions and persists in environmental waters. We performed PrPCWD spike experiments with water samples containing fine sediments from two locations within a CWD-contaminated site, at which contamination sources were removed one year prior. Samples were filtered after spiking, and filtrates and sediments were tested separately for PrPCWD using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Unspiked filtrates tested negative for PrPCWD, while unspiked sediments were positive, indicating PrPCWD persistence in environmental sediments for at least one year. Spiked sediments were positive immediately after spiking and throughout 28 days of incubation. Spiked filtrates were largely negative immediately after spiking and remained negative for 28 days, with some inconsistent positives from one sampling location. Our results indicate that PrPCWD readily partitions to the sediment fraction of environmental waters, suggesting that hydrological prion transport is sediment-facilitated."

MCCP exposure induced chromatin condensation in the nucleus and mitochondria vacuolization of ovarian granulosa cells in rats and significantly increased the levels of serum gonadotropins and sex hormones, while reducing gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels. Transcriptomics analysis of ovaries revealed a predominant effect of MCCPs on the cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and DNA damage repair pathways. Moreover, dual-omics integrative analysis indicated significant disturbance of steroid hormone biosynthesis caused by MCCPs, as well as amino acid metabolism related to TCA cycle. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that MCCP exposure disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and generates reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to DNA damage.

Metabolomic analysis of maternal plasma revealed disruptions in steroid hormone, purine, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism, which aligned with the enriched pathways in amniotic fluid (AF). FL analysis indicated increased purine metabolism and disrupted glucose and amino acid metabolism.

The reconnection rate, when normalized by ion parameters (Ri ${R}_{i}$), may appear anomalously high, whereas that normalized by electron parameters (Re ${R}_{e}$) remains ∼0.1. We propose that the essence of high Ri ${R}_{i}$ is insufficient field line bending outside the electron diffusion region, indicating an incomplete development of the ion diffusion region. It may result from bursty reconnection in thin current sheets, or small system sizes. The ion outflow diminishes at high βi ${\beta }_{i}$ when the gyroradius (ρi ${\rho }_{i}$) exceeds the system size. Low‐velocity ions still experience notable acceleration from Hall fields.

Notably, the temperature changes in both the Antarctic and the Arctic show significant seasonal differences, with the largest polar response during the cold seasons. Around the Antarctic, both the ACC and overturning circulation exhibit stronger acceleration in winter than in summer, causing more pronounced cooling in winter.

We studied the seismic signals emitted near rivers in two tributaries characterized by large boulders. Data show an unusually high dominant seismic frequency, reaching >2 times the frequency observed in nearby smoother channels. Consistent high‐frequency content during periods without bedload transport prompts the hypothesis that turbulence is a key contributor to generating higher frequencies. Assuming that dominant turbulent eddies decrease in size due to boulder‐constrained flow, we formulate a frequency scaling relationship that aligns well with field data.

The solar wind density dropped to 0.3 amu/cc while the IMF strength was about 25 nT. As a result, the solar wind flow transitions to a sub‐Alfvénic state with an Alfvén Mach number of 0.4. We carry out global magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the responses of Earth's magnetosphere to the ICME ejecta. The results show the formation of Alfvén wings as the solar wind becomes sub‐Alfvénic. Furthermore, the sub‐Alfvénic period was characterized by the dominance of the IMF By ${B}_{y}$ component, causing the Alfvén wings to extend toward the dawn and dusk flanks. We investigate the global magnetospheric convection of this sub‐ Alfvénic case and find that the overall convection is mediated by the Alfvén wings, while the magnetic field convection in inner magnetosphere is similar to the super‐Alfvénic case."

We observed the formation of wrinkles, a common geological feature, due to the accumulation of sand grains on the biofilms.

Both case studies, and a statistical analysis, reveal a direct correspondence between the magnitude of density gradients and wave obliquity, with θk ${\theta }_{k}$ increasing near stronger density gradients. Wave propagation is also investigated as a function of local plasma density, revealing that chorus is more often oblique when observed in lower density mediums, and more field‐aligned in higher density regions. This result highlights the importance of retaining the intrinsic physical coupling between wave propagation properties and the cold plasma density, since both parameters strongly influence the calculation of the diffusion coefficients used to quantify wave‐particle interactions in the inner‐magnetosphere."

We investigated the changes in atmospheric actual water vapor (AVP) at seasonal and spatial scales from 1979 to 2018 and their sensitivity to air temperature (Savp). Comparing two different periods, 1979–1998 and 1999–2018, large differences in Savp were found over land during summer. The west coasts of low‐latitude regions gained enhanced water vapor for each 1°C increase in temperature, while the east coasts showed a deceleration in additional water vapor for each 1°C increase in temperature in the latter period compared to the former one. Although there is spatial heterogeneity in changes in Savp after the 1990s compared to before the 1990s, overall summer Savp has decreased by 33% over land and 27% in the monsoon region. These shifts were well reproduced by the Community Earth System Model and are closely related to a shift in low‐latitude ocean evaporation (Eocean) from an upward trend before the late 1990s to a downward trend after the late 1990s (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the significant decrease (p < 0.05) in Savp over land in summer was due to (a) weaker increase in actual atmospheric water vapor and (b) reduced zonal winds from oceans to the land, rather than through the direct effects of global warming on the atmospheric water demand. These results highlight the urgent need for Eocean monitoring and forecasting to accurately assess land Savp. Significance statements understanding how water vapor responds to changes in temperature is crucial for understanding global climate dynamics and the movement of water, energy, and carbon throughout the Earth system. We investigated the variations in water vapor temperature sensitivity across different seasons and regions from 1979 to 2018. By comparing two time periods, we found great differences in water vapor temperature sensitivity over land during summer. Overall, there was a weakening of water vapor temperature sensitivity over land and in monsoon regions. These changes were predicted by a climate model and correlated closely with changes in ocean evaporation patterns. This highlights the importance of closely monitoring ocean evaporation to predict the response of water vapor to warming over land."

Blue light, sensed by phototropin, dephosphorylates Phototropin-Mediated Signalling Kinase 1 (PMSK1), repressing starch accumulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. 
 In photosynthetic organisms, light acts as an environmental signal to control their development and physiology, as well as energy source to drive the conversion of CO2 into carbohydrates used for growth or storage. The main storage carbohydrate in green algae is starch, which accumulates during the day and is broken down at night to meet cellular energy demands. The signaling role of light quality in the regulation of starch accumulation remains unexplored. Here, we identify PHOTOTROPIN-MEDIATED SIGNALING KINASE 1 (PMSK1) as a key regulator of starch metabolism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In its phosphorylated form (PMSK1-P), it activates GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (GAP1), promoting starch biosynthesis. We show that blue light, perceived by PHOTOTROPIN, induces PMSK1 dephosphorylation that in turn represses GAP1 mRNA levels and reduces starch accumulation. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized blue light-mediated signaling pathway that advances our understanding of photoreceptor-controlled carbon metabolism in microalgae.

 Recurrent gain-of-function mutations in the histone reader protein ENL have been identified in Wilms tumor, the most prevalent pediatric kidney cancer. However, their pathological significance in kidney development and tumorigenesis in vivo remains elusive. Here, we generate mouse models mimicking ENL tumor (ENLT) mutations and show that heterozygous mutant expression in Six2+ nephrogenic or Foxd1+ stromal lineages leads to severe, lineage-specific kidney defects, both resulting in neonatal lethality. Six2-ENLT mutant kidneys display compromised cap mesenchyme, scant nephron tubules, and cystic glomeruli, indicative of premature progenitor commitment and blocked differentiation. Bulk and spatial transcriptomic analyses reveal aberrant activation of Hox and Wnt signaling genes in mutant nephrogenic cells. In contrast, Foxd1-ENLT mutant kidneys exhibit expansion in renal capsule and cap mesenchyme, with dysregulated stromal gene expression affecting stroma-epithelium crosstalk. Our findings uncover distinct pathways through which ENL mutations disrupt nephrogenesis, providing a foundation for further investigations into their role in tumorigenesis.

 The initial setting of telomere length during early life in each individual has a major influence on lifetime risk of aging-associated diseases; however there is limited knowledge of biological signals that regulate inheritance of telomere length, and whether it is modifiable is not known. We now show that when mitochondrial activity is disrupted in mouse zygotes, via exposure to 20% O2 or rotenone, telomere elongation between the 8-cell and blastocyst stage is impaired, with shorter telomeres apparent in the pluripotent Inner Cell Mass (ICM) and persisting after organogenesis. Identical defects of elevated mtROS in zygotes followed by impaired telomere elongation, occurred with maternal obesity or advanced age. We further demonstrate that telomere elongation during ICM formation is controlled by mitochondrial-nuclear communication at fertilization. Using mitochondrially-targeted therapeutics (BGP-15, MitoQ, SS-31, metformin) we demonstrate that it is possible to modulate the preimplantation telomere resetting process and restore deficiencies in neonatal telomere length.

 With ongoing improvements in the detection of complex genomic and epigenomic variations, long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies could serve as a unified platform for clinical genetic testing, particularly in rare disease settings, where nearly half of patients remain undiagnosed using existing technologies. Here, we report a simplified funnel-down filtration strategy aimed at enhancing the identification of small and large deleterious variants as well as abnormal episignature disease profiles from whole-genome LRS data. This approach detected all pathogenic single nucleotide, structural, and methylation variants in a positive control set (N = 76) including an independent sample set with known methylation profiles (N = 57). When applied to patients who previously had negative short-read testing (N = 51), additional diagnoses were uncovered in 10% of cases, including a methylation profile at the spinal muscular atrophy locus utilized for diagnosing this life-threatening, yet treatable, condition.

 Astrocytes are closely linked to depression, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an important brain region involved in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the underlying mechanism by which astrocytes within PFC contribute to MDD remains unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses, we show a significant reduction in astrocytes and attenuated pleiotrophin-protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTN-PTPRZ1) signaling in astrocyte-to-excitatory neuron communication in the PFC of male MDD patients. We find reduced astrocytes and PTN in the dorsomedial PFC of male mice with depression induced by chronic restraint and social defeat stress. Knockdown of astrocytic PTN induces depression-related responses, which is reversed by exogenous PTN supplementation or overexpression of astrocytic PTN. The antidepressant effects exerted by astrocytic PTN require interaction with PTPRZ1 in excitatory neurons, and PTN-PTPRZ1 activates the AKT signaling pathway to regulate depression-related responses. Our findings indicate the PTN-PTPRZ1-AKT pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for MDD.

 The latitudinal distribution of winter extratropical precipitation is often regarded as being determined by the location and intensity of the storm track. Here, we compare the precipitation variability associated with the meridional eddy momentum flux (EMF) with that associated with an Eulerian storm track measure. Observations show that when the midlatitude EMF is anomalously poleward, the occurrence of moderate-to-heavy precipitation (1–33 mm day-1) increases between 45°N and 70°N, while decreasing between 25°N and 45°N. This shift occurs mostly downstream of the climatological storm track maximum, with generally greater precipitation anomalies compared to those associated with storm track changes. The shift is tied to changes in horizontal moisture transport primarily by planetary scale waves. These results suggest that, in addition to the storm track intensity, dynamics of the horizontal wave tilts which affect the EMF intensity need to be considered when projecting future changes in precipitation variability."

 Soil salinization, a critical form of global soil degradation, threatens agricultural productivity and ecosystem functions. Accurate mapping of soil salinity is essential for sustainable land management and informed decision-making. However, conventional optical or radar satellite sensors are often limited in detecting key salinity spectral signatures due to their insufficient thermal infrared (TIR) coverage. TIR remote sensing offers unique advantages for soil salinity assessment, owing to its sensitivity to the emissivity of saline soils within the TIR spectrum, but its application remains underexplored. This study evaluated the suitability and robustness of SDGSAT-1 TIS data for large-scale soil salinity mapping in the Songnen Plain, China, one of the world's three largest soda saline-alkali soil regions. We compared the performance of soil salinity models integrating SDGSAT-1 TIS data with those using optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1 and GF-3) data across several machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrated that incorporating SDGSAT-1 TIS data significantly enhanced soil salinity modeling accuracy, consistently outperforming models based solely on Sentinel-2 optical or Sentinel-1/GF-3 radar data. The combination of SDGSAT-1 TIS and Sentinel-2 data, optimized using the Gaussian Process Regression model, achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.65 dS/m). The resulting salinity maps revealed widespread soil salinization across the region, with the majority of the area exhibiting slight to moderate salinity levels, posing substantial challenges to plant growth and ecosystem resilience.

More importantly, the WfMS complies with the Common Workflow Language (CWL) standard to guarantee interoperability and reproducibility of workflows. It also enables the integration of diverse tools and software, supporting complex analyses that require multiple processing steps.

 Tidal flats and their associated sandbanks are dynamic environments crucial for ecological balance and biodiversity. Monitoring their evolutionary history and topographic changes is important to better understand their dynamic mechanisms and predict their future status. Accurately mapping their evolution, however, remains challenging due to highly dynamic currents, suspended sediment variability, and unclear boundaries between land, tidal flats, and water. Traditional waterline methods struggle under these conditions. In this study, we propose an Object-Based Image Segmentation (OBIS) method, specifically designed for SAR images, to extract waterlines and distinguish tidal flats and shorelines from water bodies. This method integrates SAR polarimetric feature analysis to select high-quality images and employs partition processing to preserve local feature statistics. Using 199 Sentinel-1 GRD, 132 Radarsat-2 SLC, and 157 Landsat images, we analyzed coastal dynamics in the Dutch Wadden Sea from 1986 to 2020. Our DEMs, validated against LiDAR data (2016–2019) and 58 ground anchor measuring stations (2011–2020), achieved an accuracy of 10–30 cm. Results show that coastal tidal flats and sandbanks expanded at rates of 0.107–0.324 km2 yr−1 and 0.010–0.073 km2 yr−1, respectively, with a net intertidal volume increase of approximately 8.6×107m3. The generated DEMs provide valuable insights for sediment budget evaluation and hydrodynamic modeling, supporting scientific research and coastal management. The proposed OBIS-based framework demonstrates its effectiveness for mapping national-scale tidal flats and sandbanks dynamics."

Here, we show that the neuronal SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) complex proteins syntaxin and SNAP25 (synaptosome-associated protein 25), which enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system, inhibit the activity of the NALCN channel complex in both heterologous systems and primary neurons. The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes."

Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells.

The light emission happens without any external voltage applied, and the electrical discharge is sufficiently energetic to excite, dissociate, or ionize surrounding neutral gas molecules. Thus, sprayed water microdroplets cause chemical reactions to occur. Similar findings to the Urey-Miller experiment were observed by spraying room temperature water microdroplets into a gas mixture containing nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, which leads to the synthesis of organic molecules containing carbon-nitrogen (C─N) bonds.

Through benchmarking, we demonstrate the superior performance of PseudoSorter compared to other spike sorting algorithms before applying PseudoSorter on MEA recordings from hippocampal neurons exposed to subneuronal concentrations of monomeric Tau as a model for Alzheimer’s disease. Our results unveil that Tau diminishes the firing rate of a subset of neurons, which complement our findings observed using conventional electrophysiology analysis, and demonstrate that PseudoSorter’s high accuracy and throughput make it a valuable tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms, as well as for therapeutic drug screening."

We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, redefining standards in reflectometry.

Here, combining first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics, we unravel the interplay between perovskite octahedral lattice dynamics and energy barrier associated with ion migration. Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties.

The hydrogen bonds shorter than 2.5 angstrom are expected to accelerate the ion transport. However, short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) can hardly form naturally because of the electron-withdrawing capability of O atom, which impedes its applications in water-mediated ion transport. This work develops an interlayer confinement strategy to construct SHB networks in a two-dimensional (2D) nanocapillary assembled by bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets and boost the ionic conductivity of HEMs. With confined nanochannels and adjustable hydrophilic groups in BiOI-based HEMs, the number of SHBs increases by 12 times, creating a shortcut for the Grotthuss-type anion transport, which in turn affords a high ionic conductivity of 168 millisiemens per centimeter at 90°C, higher than polymeric HEM and 2D-based HEM. This work demonstrates the facile approach to generating SHB networks in 2D capillaries and opens a promising avenue to developing advanced HEMs."

However, the structural origin of the large energy barriers preventing interconversion between these folding pathways is unknown. Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics."

Here, we develop monolithically integrated solid-state vertical OECTs to fully explore polyelectrolyte’s strengths, enabling the OECTs to switch between neuromorphic and logic functions. This transition capability is achieved by mastering the complex transport of large-size polycations within the channel through well-designed drain electrodes. Frame drains positioned atop the organic channel act as ion barriers, regulating the penetration and relaxation of polycations. This regulation allows our multilevel synaptic OECTs to transform from short-term depression (STD) to STD-based long-term memory, and eventually to long-term depression (LTD). Conversely, placing frame drains beneath the channel exposes the polyelectrolyte fully, hence yielding high-density logic OECTs, which have been successfully used to construct unipolar integrated circuits such as NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These achievements represent a substantial advancement in manipulating polyelectrolyte-based ionic-electronic interactions, introducing more possibilities beyond small ion-based OECTs."

However, the question of whether supercritical water is still hydrogen-bonded or how water molecules interact en route to the supercritical regime is a matter of controversial discussions. We present terahertz (THz) spectra, which directly probe the intermolecular interactions of water under these extreme conditions. While we spectroscopically detect the liquid-gas phase transition just below the critical point, THz spectra of the high-temperature gas phase are indistinguishable from those of supercritical water at the same density.

Herein, we propose an oxygen vacancy–rich (BiFe)0.9(BaTi)0.1O3−xnanoreactor as a piezoelectric sonosensitizer by spatiotemporal ultrasound–driven sono- and chemodynamic tandem catalysis to amplify antibacterial efficacy. The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O2and H2O, efficiently generating H2O2. The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H2O2/Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death. Thus, the porous titanium scaffold, engineered with a piezoelectric nanoreactor, demonstrates superior antibacterial efficacy under ultrasound and facilitates osteogenesis via piezoelectric immunomodulation–activated therapy."

In this work, the cause of coloring in the STRAP-recycled polyethylene (PE) resins from postindustrial printed films was identified as decomposed diarylide pigments. Two different approaches are needed to completely remove the dissolved colorants during the STRAP process including (i) adding an activated carbon (AC) adsorbent to the solvent after polymer dissolution and (ii) proper mechanical filtration of the polymer-solvent cake to remove as much solvent from the cake as possible. Colorless recycled PE can be produced by a combination of the proposed approaches (choosing the proper solvent, adding an AC adsorbent, and doing proper mechanical filtration) with minimal accumulation of colorants in the recycled STRAP solvents.

This study examines how polyethylene spherical microplastics (275 μm in diameter) passing through the digestive tracts of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and Australian crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) affect surface properties, particle size, and bacterial colonization. The species were fed diets with or without microplastics. The particles underwent two rounds of passage through the digestive tracts and were then exposed to known bacterial densities. Surface damage, size, and biofilm coverage were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, while alterations in surface chemical composition were assessed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance, and the formation and penetration of nanoplastics in gut tissues and glands were determined using Py-GC/MS. Results show that the passage significantly altered surface properties and reduced microplastic size, without affecting chemical composition or nanoplastic penetration into tissues. These changes promoted bacterial colonization compared to controls. The findings suggest that animal feeding activity may play an important role in the mechanical fragmentation of microplastics in aquatic environments, potentially leading to their faster degradation."

In this study, tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) at the G26 stage were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFBS (0, 1, 3, and 10 μg/L) until the end of metamorphosis. PFBS exposure resulted in reduced thyroid follicular glia; down-regulation of gene transcripts related to thyroid hormone synthesis; decreased blood hormone (corticotropin-releasing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3)) and transthyretin concentrations; and up-regulation of gene transcripts related to thyroid hormone degrading enzymes. Moreover, exposure to PFBS induced apoptosis in single-layer columnar epithelial cells, suppressed the proliferation of intestinal stem cells, and hindered their differentiation into adult epithelial cells during intestinal remodeling. The responses of Notch and Wnt signaling pathways regulated by T3 were downregulated, and key gene transcripts (msi, pcna, and lgr5) involved in intestinal remodeling regulated by these two pathways were also downregulated.

The broadly accepted explanation for the widespread loss of terrestrial lignin biomarkers and apparent disappearance of the <−25‰ stable carbon isotopic signature (δ13C) of TOM is that TOM is almost fully degraded before reaching the open ocean. Oceanic carbon (δ13C value ≥ −22‰) is therefore thought to be derived primarily from algae. However, an alternative explanation for the different molecular and δ13C signatures in terrestrial and marine environments may be that oxidative processing transforms TOM to appear marine-like. To test this hypothesis, we subjected eight TOM samples to a strong oxidation gradient. At carbon losses typical of TOM degradation during transport and sedimentation (above 60%), the differentiators of provenance disappeared, leaving a residue that was marine-like both chemically (aliphatic- and nitrogen-rich) and isotopically (δ13C enrichment of 4 to 9‰). This challenges the validity of conventional two-endmember mixing models, suggesting that a much larger fraction than previously estimated of the organic matter found in the ocean may originate from terrestrial sources, impacting global models of carbon cycling and sequestration."

Groundwater remediation using the O3MNBEO technology required less energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, O3MNBEO had no significant effect on groundwater pH and conductivity, and the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) in groundwater and dissolved oxygen (DO) was substantially increased during the remediation process. The variations in ORP demonstrated a correlation with the contaminant concentration, which could serve as a potential indicator for assessing remediation progress.

This approach allowed us to investigate the uptake coefficient of an isoprene-derived hydroxy–RO2, ISOPOO (HOC5H8OO·), onto deliquesced NaCl particles and the effect of transition metal ions (Fe2+ and Cu2+) on this uptake. We measured the uptake coefficients, γ, of ISOPOO on deliquesced NaCl particles doped with FeCl2 and CuCl2, each added at 5 wt % of NaCl, at 301 K and 84% relative humidity (RH). The results were 0.45 ± 0.01 for FeCl2 and 0.19 ± 0.01 for CuCl2. These values were 5 and 2 times greater than the uptake coefficient for deliquesced undoped NaCl particles, which was 0.09 ± 0.01. Preliminary simulation results for the western Japan domain, using a value of γ = 0.09 from a three-dimensional chemical transport model, indicate that the heterogeneous uptake of ISOPOO onto deliquesced particles contributed, on average, less than 3% of the ISOPOO loss process. This contribution increased to as much as 5% in remote forest and mountain areas during high PM2.5 events."

Although prediction has several proposed applications, the potential benefit has remained largely unevaluated. This study examines whether prediction can improve how particle filter systems such as portable air cleaners are automated by comparing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy with a traditional threshold-based control (TBC) strategy. The MPC controller is designed to optimize the balance between mean reduction in PM2.5 concentration (i.e., keep concentrations as low as possible following health-based guidance) and reductions in system runtime. These two parameters are compared for both control strategies using 104 simulations of week-long continuous PM2.5 measurements in occupied apartments. Our findings suggest that there is no meaningful difference in performance between the two control strategies. Additionally, we find only a marginal improvement in performance for MPC controllers that operate using longer prediction horizons. Given the numerous challenges associated with accurately predicting future PM2.5 concentrations, as well as the additional challenges associated with implementing MPC, controlling particle filter systems may not be an appropriate application for prediction given the lack of benefit over TBC. We would recommend that particle filter systems continue to be controlled using nonpredictive strategies such as TBC, and that prediction tools be used for other applications or adapted to different areas of indoor air quality research and practice."

The research included 29406 births in Shanghai, utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure greenness within a 500 m radius (NDVI-500). The analysis employed a generalized linear model to assess the impacts of residental greenness on GWG, fetal growth and birthweight, and a mediation analysis to explore GWG’s role between greenness and fetal development. Results indicated that significant benefits were observed with increased greenness, where each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.5%–13.2%) in the risk of head circumference undergrowth and 8.5% (95% CI: 4.8%–12.2%) in estimated fetal weight undergrowth.

Additionally, the gastrointestinal tracts of three economically important fishes within the bay [Paralichthys lethostigma (n = 46), Sciaenops ocellatus (n = 47), and Cynoscion nebulosus (n = 85)] were examined for microplastics, while their liver and muscle tissue were analyzed for PAHs. In all  three matrices, the average concentration of ∑16PAHs ranged from 890.2 to 28,574.0 ng·g–1. The average individual PAH concentration in fish species ranged from 75.1 to 145.4 ng·g–1. Fish species in all of the sampling sites were classified between minimally and moderately polluted, with potential PAH bioaccumulation observed only in the southern flounder. About 67% of all of the analyzed sediment samples from Lavaca-Matagorda Bay indicate possible adverse or moderate adverse biological effects.

The size of volcanoes along the Hawai‘i–Emperor chain, and thus the magma flux of the Hawaiian plume, has varied over the past 85 million years. Fifteen and two million years ago, rapid bursts in magmatic production led to the emergence of large islands such as Pūhāhonu, Maui Nui and Hawai‘i, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we use new radiogenic Ce–Sr–Nd–Hf isotope data of Hawaiian shield lavas to quantify the composition and proportion of the different constituents of the Hawaiian plume over time. We find that most of the Hawaiian mantle source is peridotite that has experienced variable degrees of melt depletion before being incorporated into the plume. We show that the most isotopically enriched LOA‐type compositions arise from the aggregation of melts from more depleted, trace element‐starved peridotite, causing the over‐visibility of melts from recycled crust in the mixture. Our results also show that upwelling of chemically more depleted, and thus less dense, more buoyant mantle peridotite occurred synchronously to an observed burst of magma production. Buoyancy variations induced by variably depleted peridotite may not only control the temporal patterns of volcanic productivity in Hawai‘i, but also those of other plumes world‐wide. The excess buoyancy of depleted peridotite may therefore be an underrated driving force for convective mantle flow, trigger and sustain active upwelling of relatively cool plumes, and control the geometry of mantle upwellings from variable depths."

Furthermore, the asymmetry increased significantly over the past two decades across most ecosystems.

Different methods have been proposed to reduce this difference, however, very limited studies are focused on extreme low temperatures (ELT). Here we propose a new method to constrain the projection of ELT changes by establishing their quasi‐linear relationships with mean temperature (Tmean) in Eastern China. The results show that the Tmean weighting coefficients considering model performance and independence can effectively reduce the uncertainty range of future ELT. Before constraint, there are substantial differences in the projected ranges of Tmean and ELT between CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. After constraint, the projected ranges of CMIP6 models are considerably reduced, particularly at the warmer end, thus showing better consistency with CMIP5. Under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario, at the end of the 21st century (2081–2100), the original projected changes in Tmean are constrained from 5.1 (3.5–7.9)°C to 5.0 (3.5–6.5)°C, with the warmer end of the projected range decreased by 1.4°C. For the ELT, the decreases of the warmer ends are 1.9°C and 1.2°C for the annual minima of daily minimum (TNn) and maximum temperature (TXn), respectively. The reliability evaluation shows that the differences between pseudo‐observations represented by two large ensemble models and constrained projections are smaller than those for unconstrained projections, thereby confirming the reliability of the weighted method employed in this study."

Here, we present a novel data set of water‐vapor isotopes (δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O, δ $\delta $D, dxs $dxs$) and meteorological variables taken by fixed‐wing uncrewed aircraft on the northeast Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). During June–July (2022), we collected 104 profiles of water‐vapor isotopes and meteorological variables up to 1,500 m above ground level. Concurrently, surface snow samples were collected at 12‐hr intervals, allowing connection to surface‐snow processes.

Climate model output of mean temperature and specific humidity agrees well with observations, with a mean difference of +0.095°C and −0.043 g/kg (−2.91%), respectively. We find evidence that along an air parcel pathway, the distillation model is not removing enough water prior to onsite arrival. Below the mean temperature inversion (∼ ${\sim} $200 m), water‐isotope observations indicate a kinetic fractionating process, likely the result of mixing sublimated vapor from the ice sheet surface along with an unknown fraction of katabatic wind vapor.

To isolate the environmental signals associated with subseasonal variability of TC activity, we examine events of anomalous accumulated cyclone energy, genesis, and TC days. These events are used to create composites of ERA5 reanalysis fields of environmental conditions related to WNP TC activity, which are used to select predictors for statistical dynamical hybrid models. The ECMWF statistical‐dynamical scheme exhibits an improvement in skill by using a tailored outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) predictor compared with the MJO predictors.

Clothiaux;Jerry Y. Harrington,Ice Crystal Habit Effects on the Resilience of Arctic Mixed‐Phase Stratus Clouds in a One‐Dimensional Model,"Arctic single‐layer mixed‐phase clouds were studied using a one‐dimensional model that incorporated the adaptive habit growth model for ice microphysics. The base case was from the Indirect and Semidirect Aerosol Campaign, and it was perturbed over a range of cloud‐average temperatures, maximum (per model run) ice nuclei (IN) concentrations, and large‐scale subsidence velocities. For each parameter combination, the model was iterated out to 48 hr, and the time, called the glaciation time, to complete disappearance of liquid recorded if this occurred within the 48 hr. Dependence of glaciation times on cloud‐average temperatures from −30°C to −5°C, maximum IN concentrations from 0.10 to 30 L−1, and strong–no subsidence, with both isometric and habit‐dependent ice crystal growth, were investigated. For isometric crystal growth, the relationship between the critical maximum IN concentration (INcrit), the maximum (per model run) IN concentration above which a mixed‐phase cloud glaciated within a fixed model runtime, and cloud‐average temperature was monotonic. INcrit decreased with decreasing cloud‐average temperature. Strengthening of subsidence led to a further decrease in INcrit for every cloud‐average temperature. For habit‐dependent ice crystal growth, the relationship between INcrit and cloud‐average temperature was nonmonotonic. Ice crystals develop dendritic and columnar habits near −15°C and −7°C, respectively, and at these two temperatures, ice crystals grew and depleted supercooled liquid water faster than the case when ice crystals grew isometrically. This led to deep local minima in INcrit around these two temperatures in the model runs. Habit‐dependent ice crystal growth, coupled with changes in cloud‐average temperature, INcrit, and subsidence strength, led to significant changes in Arctic single‐layer mixed‐phase cloud lifetimes."

While the impacts of pandemic‐associated plastic waste on multiple environmental matrices (e.g., water and soil) have been well documented, its effects on MPs in atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the MPs in ambient PM2.5 collected from urban Xi'an before, during, and after the COVID‐19 pandemic in both summer and winter. Mean MP concentrations during and after the pandemic were three times higher than prepandemic levels, irrespective of the season. Transparent and white polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate fibers dominated during and after the pandemic, while prepandemic MPs were more diverse in polymer types and colors. These results indicate a strong impact of pandemic‐associated waste, especially discarded face masks, on the abundance and characteristics of MPs in ambient PM2.5. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between MPs and ambient ozone, suggesting the potential for ozone to degrade plastics and release MPs into the air. Multiple‐path particle dosimetry calculations revealed that MPs primarily deposit in the extrathoracic region of people across all age groups. However, teenagers and younger individuals showed increased susceptibility to deposition in tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions. Based on the estimated daily dose, inhalation of MPs from ambient PM2.5 is proposed to be a significant exposure pathway for humans.

However, the roles of SM and VPD on GPP vary widely in terms of (a) which one dominates the impact (dominance) and (b) the specific threshold values at which they are activated (thresholds). This study adopted the copula method to investigate the dominance and thresholds of SM and VPD on terrestrial vegetation productivity reduction (GPP reduction) across China from 1982 to 2018. The results indicate that SM predominantly drives the GPP reduction across 71% of China's vegetation zones, with the SM thresholds decreasing from the south to the north. Vapor pressure deficit dominated the GPP reduction primarily in the croplands with low VPD thresholds, such as the North China Plain and Northeast Plain. Moreover, the SM and VPD thresholds have significant difference across different ecosystems, with higher SM thresholds (activated under wetter soil conditions) in the forests and lower VPD thresholds (activated under more humid atmospheric conditions) in the croplands. Compared with the non‐irrigated croplands, irrigation can significantly reduce SM thresholds and increase VPD thresholds by relieving water stress from soil and atmospheric dryness. The structural equation modeling further demonstrates the dominant influence of SM and VPD on GPP reduction. This study explicitly identified the spatial distribution of the dominance and thresholds of soil and atmospheric dryness across different ecosystems. It could enhance our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to drought and provide guidance for drought management in different ecosystems."

 Late-stage deuteration of aryl halides with deuterium oxide is a highly desirable but challenging transformation, primarily due to the difficulty of activating inert carbon-halogen bonds and the umpolung of deuterium oxide in the presence of various functional groups. To achieve this transformation, efforts have been made to develop photo-chemical, electro-chemical, or mechano-chemical strategies.

 Gene expression in response to environmental stimuli is dependent on nuclear localization of key signaling components, which can be tightly regulated by phosphorylation. This is exemplified by the phosphate-sensing transcription factor Pho4, which requires phosphorylation for nuclear export by the yeast exportin Msn5. Here, we present a high resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy structure showing the phosphorylated 35-residue nuclear export signal of Pho4, which binds the concave surface of Msn5 through two Pho4 phospho-serines that align with two Msn5 basic patches. These findings characterize a mechanism of phosphate-specific recognition mediated by a non-classical signal distinct from that for Exportin-1. Furthermore, the discovery that unliganded Msn5 is autoinhibited explains the positive cooperativity of Pho4/Ran-binding and proposes a mechanism for Pho4’s release in the cytoplasm. These findings advance our understanding of the diversity of signals that drive nuclear export and how cargo phosphorylation is crucial in regulating nuclear transport and controlling cellular signaling pathways.

It reveals unique resilience patterns and quantifies the effects of renewable integration and energy storage. 
 Climate extremes, such as hurricanes, combined with large-scale integration of environment-sensitive renewables, could exacerbate the risk of widespread power outages. We introduce a coupled climate-energy model for cascading power outages, which comprehensively captures the impacts of climate extremes on renewable generation, and transmission and distribution networks. The model is validated with the 2022 Puerto Rico catastrophic blackout during Hurricane Fiona – a unique system-wide blackout event with complete records of weather-induced outages. The model reveals a resilience pattern that was not captured by the previous models: early failure of certain critical components enhances overall system resilience. Sensitivity analysis on various scenarios of behind-the-meter solar integration demonstrates that lower integration levels (below 45%, including the current level) exhibit minimal impact on system resilience in this event. However, surpassing this critical level without pairing it with energy storage can exacerbate the probability of catastrophic blackouts.

This randomised controlled trial shows that the same intervention, given in addition to standard therapy, did not improve anthropometric or neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with complicated severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan. 
 We have previously shown that high-dose vitamin D3 improved weight gain and neurodevelopmental indices in children receiving standard therapy for uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Here we present results of a randomised placebo-controlled trial in Lahore, Pakistan, to determine whether two oral doses of 200,000 international units (IU) vitamin D3 (the first administered on or before the day of hospital discharge and the second administered 14 days later) would benefit children aged 6-59 months during the convalescent phase of complicated SAM. Eligible participants were individually randomised to intervention vs. control arms with a one-to-one allocation ratio and stratification by hospital of recruitment using computer-generated random sequences. Double-blinding to treatment allocation was maintained by concealing allocation from participants’ parents or guardians, their medical care providers, and all trial staff. The primary outcome was mean weight-for-height or -length z-score (WHZ) at 2-month follow-up. Secondary efficacy outcomes included mean WHZ at 6-month follow-up and mean lean mass index, Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT) scores and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at 2- and 6-month follow-up. The trial has now completed. 259 children were randomised (128 to vitamin D, 131 to placebo), of whom 251 (96.9%) contributed data to analysis of the primary outcome (123 allocated to vitamin D, 128 to placebo). At 2-month follow-up, participants allocated to vitamin D had significantly higher mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations than those allocated to placebo (adjusted mean difference [aMD] 100.0 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.2–127.8 nmol/L). This was not associated with an inter-arm difference in mean WHZ at 2-month follow-up (aMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.23), or in any anthropometric or neurodevelopmental secondary outcome assessed at 2- or 6-month follow-up. The intervention was safe. In conclusion, high-dose vitamin D3 elevated mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in children receiving standard therapy for complicated SAM in Pakistan, but did not influence any anthropometric or neurodevelopmental outcome studied. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT04270643.

Our results show a general coherence between Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and regional precipitation, supporting a positive climate response consistent with conventional monsoon theory. Spectral analysis on studied datasets reveals an approximately 180-year periodicity coinciding with the de Vries cycle of solar activity. Further comparing our record with 35 other speleothem records, we demonstrate the importance of sufficient age control points in capturing solar-related periodicities. Model simulation shows that TSI could enhance monsoonal circulation and regional precipitation. Also highlighted are the implications of chronology control for detecting climate events in proxy records. The new findings underscore the significance of relatively minor radiative forcing in regional climate dynamics over monsoonal Asia on decadal to centennial timescales."

 The warming climate strongly impacts vegetation phenology, altering the terrestrial carbon cycle, biodiversity, and food production. Here, we analyzed satellite observations from 1982 to 2015 and found that approximately one-third of vegetated areas experienced a significant shift in the timing of the start of the growing season (SOS), with 65.5% exhibiting an earlier trend and 34.5% a delay. We revealed that these changes in SOS were significantly associated with temperature variations, with a response depending on the differences between seasonal temperature and optimal growing temperature for vegetation (ΔT). When ΔT < 0 (seasonal temperature below optimal temperature), warming accelerates the photosynthetic process, leading to an earlier SOS. Conversely, when ΔT > 0, vegetation may experience photosynthetic inhibition induced by rising temperature, delaying SOS. Based on these findings, trends of earlier SOS can be expected to gradually decelerate and even potentially transition into delayed shifts with additional warming in the future. The difference between the seasonal temperature and optimal growing temperature for vegetation plays a crucial role in the timing of the start of the growing season, according to a climate dataset analysis between 1982 and 2015 coupled with remote sensing."

 Altered fire regimes are a global challenge, increasingly exacerbated by climate change, which modifies fire weather and prolongs fire seasons. These changing conditions heighten the vulnerability of ecosystems and human populations to the impacts of wildfires on the environment, society, and the economy. The rapid pace of these changes exposes significant gaps in knowledge, tools, technology, and governance structures needed to adopt informed, holistic approaches to fire management that address both current and future challenges.

 High-resolution (≤10 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for obtaining accurate terrain information and are integral to geographic analysis. However, a majority of currently available DEMs datasets possess a relatively coarse spatial resolution (≥30 m), which limits the terrain features and details that can be accurately represented. Furthermore, due to the substantial production costs associated with high-resolution DEMs, these products are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in numerous countries and regions, particularly in less developed areas. Here, we introduced a novel method named the Spatial interpolation knowledge-constrained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (SikCGAN). This method can generate high-resolution DEMs from publicly available data sources, specifically the photons collected by the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) carried by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). SikCGAN takes ICESat-2/ATLAS photons as the single data source and incorporates spatial interpolation knowledge constraints into a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate DEMs at a 10-m spatial resolution. A case study conducted in boreal mountainous regions demonstrates SikCGAN’s remarkable ability to produce high-resolution and highly accurate DEMs, with an MAE of 22.09 m and RMSE of 29.25 m, which reduced error by 37 %–46 % compared to benchmark methods. Additionally, the results reveal that SikCGAN has remarkable resiliece to interference, including variations in spatial distance, terrain slope, and ATL03 photon count, this further elucidates and substantiates the effectiveness of SikCGAN. These findings demonstrate that SikCGAN provides innovative solutions for generating new high-resolution DEMs products and potentially supplementing existing ones to overcome their limitations."

 Among indoor sources linked to combustion processes, relatively less attention has been paid to incense burning over liturgical celebrations in the churches. Therefore, a real-time monitoring campaign was carried out in 2023 from February 2nd to April 10th inside a naturally ventilated Italian church where the size distribution of airborne particles and the concentrations of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), benzene, toluene and carbon dioxide (CO2) were continuously monitored. Moreover, tailored experimental sessions burning four different typologies of incense were carried out inside a large-scale test chamber under controlled micro-environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity and air exchange rate) miming priest actions during the liturgical celebrations. Investigations inside the church highlighted a significant increment of PM10 (max value: 203 μg/m3), PM2.5 (max value: 171 μg/m3), PM1 (max value: 108 μg/m3),TVOCs (max value: 3.9 ppm) and Benzene (maxvalue: 5.86 μg/m3) concentrations during liturgical celebrations and in correspondence of incense use. These peak concentrations were significantly higher than the limit values established by recent WHO air quality guidelines (AQGs) for outdoor. Moreover, the combustion tests highlighted that the qualitative and quantitative differences in pollutants concentrations emitted by incense combustion were linked to the intrinsic variability of combustions performance rather than to the typologies of incense and charcoal used."

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment.

This study demonstrates that onset of El Niño events can occur over a broad range of months from March to September, with its onset timing closely linked to the precondition of oceanic recharged state and the occurrence of westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the preceding spring. A stronger recharged state and increased frequency of WWBs promote earlier onset by efficiently transporting warm water to the equatorial eastern Pacific. Supporting evidence from MIROC6 simulations and a conceptual model underscores the crucial roles of both the recharged state and WWBs in determining the timing of El Niño onset.

The results show that the longitudinal variations of TTL KWs during different seasons are primarily driven by zonal winds rather than static stability. Investigations on the annual variations of TTL KWs reveal that below the tropopause, TTL KWs reach the maxima during June, July, and August (JJA) and the minima during December, January, and February (DJF) over 150°E–240°E (Pacific Ocean (PO)) and 270°E–360°E (Atlantic Ocean; AO), where zonal winds and static stability present similar annual variations, while over 30°E–120°E (Indian Ocean; IO), zonal winds and static stability present different annual variations, resulting in weakened KW annual variation. Above the tropopause, TTL KWs generally reach the maxima during DJF and the minima during JJA, which is mainly modulated by static stability. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the longitudinal distribution of TTL KWs by affecting the zonal winds, leading to that strong TTL KWs present broader longitudinal distribution during El Niño than during La Niña. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation also affects the vertical distribution of TTL KWs by static stability, resulting in weaker (stronger) KWs below the tropopause and stronger (weaker) KWs above the tropopause during La Niña (El Niño) over 90°E–180°E. The opposite process occurs over 180°E–270°E.

This study proposes a novel approach for generating “pseudo soundings” for the atmospheric model's initial conditions. In each “pseudo soundings”, the vertical profiles of heat and moisture are estimated by a random forest algorithm from the evolution and mean state of precursor convective precipitation. Results indicate that the vertical structures of temperature and humidity in “pseudo soundings” estimated in this study could be superior to the reanalysis data set, and could well remedy the insufficient heat and moisture information for model's initial condition over the TP where in situ conventional soundings are absent. Compared to the ERA5 reanalysis data set, the mean relative error of temperature and specific humidity estimated in this study could be reduced by 0.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Verification based on a series of simulations illustrates that assimilating vertical profiles of heat and moisture in “pseudo soundings” would alleviate the spurious and overestimated summer precipitation in simulations over the TP. The mean simulation bias of hourly precipitation could be reduced by 31.8%, compared to assimilating in situ conventional soundings only. Further investigations suggest that assimilating vertical profiles of heat and moisture in “pseudo soundings” would improve the simulation performance of summer precipitation by producing a dryer and more convective stable lower atmosphere over the TP."

However, how the electrical parameters in lightning channels change during reactivation processes and how reactivation affects the development of lightning leaders are still unclear. In this study, we employed the two‐dimensional self‐sustained charge neutrality lightning model to simulate the discharge process of intracloud lightning flashes and conducted an extensive analysis of channel decay and reactivation processes. Our results suggest a close correlation between the length of reactivated channels and the distribution of channel electrical parameters, and the reactivation process has a significant influence on lightning channel development. Specifically, it is found that greater charge accumulation at the reactivation starting point and higher residual conductivity of the decayed channels can lead to longer reactivated channels. And, the reactivation initiated from the positive leader end may both promote the resumption of the extension of the positive leader branch that has stopped extending and accelerate the propagation of an advancing positive leader. Moreover, reactivation may also activate the decayed negative leader channel, facilitating the lateral generation of new branches, which is crucial for the formation of hybrid lightning, needle‐like structures, etc. The simulation results validate the previous speculations from observation studies regarding the potential influence of the reactivation process on lightning channel development and lay the foundation for the subsequent use of this model to explore the differences between the reactivation process initiated from the positive and negative leader end."

A better understanding of the loading pathways, fluxes, and fate of this debris is necessary for more effective mitigation efforts, and to reduce ocean emissions that become marine debris. This study presents a novel framework for quantifying riverine debris using a holistic mass balance modeling approach, applied in the San Diego River, California, a regionally important river with a large, urban watershed. This framework quantifies urban riverine debris sources, sinks and transport dynamics at the watershed scale. The model integrates a community science data set of floodplain debris with a simple stormwater runoff model to account for debris loading and applies probabilistic transport functions to estimate ocean emissions. Our key finding is that most riverine debris in the San Diego River is not washed in through storm drains but is directly deposited in the floodplain (79%–92% of total debris), with homeless encampments the largest contributing factor (62%–75% of total debris). Ongoing cleanup efforts substantially reduce the debris accumulation rate: without these efforts, debris stored on the floodplain increases by up to 48%. However, despite cleanups debris continues to accumulate over time with the potential for increased ocean emissions in subsequent years, especially during years with large flood events. Our approach is transferable to other urban rivers to understand the fate and flux of local debris, and therefore to inform effective mitigation initiatives."

 Overall artificial photosynthesis, as a promising approach for sunlight-driven CO2 recycling, requires photocatalysts with efficient light adsorption and separate active sites for coupling with H2O oxidation. Here we show a In-based metal–organic framework (MOF) heterostructure, i.e., In-porphyrin (In-TCPP) nanosheets enveloping an In-NH2-MIL-68 (M68N) core, via a facile one-pot synthesis that utilises competitive nucleation and growth of two organic linkers with In nodes. The coherent interfaces of the core@shell MOFs assure the structural stability of heterostructure, which will function as heterojunctions to facilitate the efficient transfer of photogenerated charge for overall photosynthesis. The In-TCPP shell in MOFs heterostructure improves CO2 adsorption capabilities and visible light absorption to enhance the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Simultaneously, In-O sites in M68N core efficiently catalyze H2O oxidation, achieving high yields of HCOOH (397.5 μmol g−1 h−1) and H2O2 (321.2 μmol g−1 h−1) under focused sunlight irradiation. The superior performance of this heterostructure in overall photosynthesis, coupled with its straightforward synthesis, shows great potential for mitigating carbon emissions and producing valuable chemicals using solar energy.

 In-situ and operando techniques in heterogeneous electrocatalysis are a powerful tool used to elucidate reaction mechanisms. Ultimately, they are key in determining concrete links between a catalyst’s physical/electronic structure and its activity en route to designing next-generation systems. To this end, the exact execution and interpretation of these lines of experiments is critical as this determines the strength of conclusions that can be drawn and what uncertainties remain. Instead of focusing on how techniques were used to understand systems, as is the case with most reviews on the topic, this work instead initiates a nuanced discussion of 1) how to best carry out each technique and 2) initiate a nuanced analysis of which level of insights can be drawn from the set of in-situ or operando experiments/controls carried out. We focus on several commonly used techniques, including vibrational (IR, Raman) spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical mass spectrometry. In addition to this, we include sections of reactor design and the link with theoretical modelling that are applicable across all techniques. While we focus on heterogeneous electrocatalysis, we make links when appropriate to the areas of photo- and thermo-catalytic systems. We highlight common pitfalls in the field, how to avoid them, and what sets of complementary experiments may be used to strengthen the analysis.

Here, by integrating bacterial genome and metagenome data with machine learning the authors show that genetic incompatibility is a main limiting factor, while co-occurrence of bacteria in the human microbiome and wastewater contributes to gene transfer. 
 The dissemination of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via horizontal gene transfer is a significant threat to public health globally. The flow of ARGs into and between pathogens, however, remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to develop strategies for managing the antibiotic resistance crisis. Therefore, we aim to identify genetic and ecological factors that are fundamental for successful horizontal ARG transfer. We used a phylogenetic method to identify instances of horizontal ARG transfer in ~1 million bacterial genomes. This data was then integrated with >20,000 metagenomes representing animal, human, soil, water, and wastewater microbiomes to develop random forest models that can reliably predict horizontal ARG transfer between bacteria. Our results suggest that genetic incompatibility, measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity, negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of ARGs between evolutionarily divergent bacteria. Conversely, environmental co-occurrence increases the likelihood, especially in humans and wastewater, in which several environment-specific dissemination patterns are observed. This study provides data-driven ways to predict the spread of ARGs and provides insights into the mechanisms governing this evolutionary process.

 The experimental realization of single-crystalline high-κ dielectrics beyond two-dimensional (2D) layered materials is highly desirable for nanoscale field-effect transistors (FETs). However, the scalable synthesis of 2D nonlayered high-κ insulators is currently limited by uncontrolled isotropic three-dimensional growth, hampering the achievement of simultaneous high dielectric constants and low trap densities for small film thicknesses. Herein, we show a 2D edge-seeded heteroepitaxial strategy to synthesize ultrathin nonlayered 2D CaNb2O6 nanosheets by chemical vapor deposition, exhibiting high-crystalline quality, thickness-independent dielectric constant (~ 16) and breakdown field strength up to ~ 12 MV cm−1. The MoS2/CaNb2O6 FETs exhibit an on/off ratio of over ~ 107, a subthreshold swing down to 61 mV/dec and a negligible hysteresis. This work suggests a universal 2D edge-seeded heteroepitaxy and slow kinetic strategy for the scalable growth of 2D nonlayered dielectric and demonstrates 2D CaNb2O6 nanosheets as promising dielectrics for facilitating 2D electronic applications. 2D high-κ dielectric materials remain highly sought-after for the future development of 2D electronics.

This perspective explores different forms of involuntary immobility and how climate policy can address this. 
 Globally, populations are increasingly located in areas at high risk of climate change impacts. Some populations lack the agency to move out of harm’s way, leading to involuntary immobility. The climate risks these populations face are insufficiently addressed in climate policy and disaster planning. While policy and planning should be data-informed, the lack of appropriate data should not limit governments and institutions from taking action to reduce the risk of involuntary immobility. Incorporating involuntary immobility within the broader sustainable development goals of climate action and safe, orderly, and regular migration may substantially reduce the risk of involuntary immobility.

 Temporal prediction is a fundamental function of neural systems. Recent results show that humans anticipate future events by calculating probability density functions, rather than hazard rates. However, direct neural evidence for this hypothesized mechanism is lacking. We recorded neural activity using magnetoencephalography as participants anticipated auditory and visual events distributed in time. We show that temporal anticipation, measured as reaction times, approximates the event probability density function, but not hazard rate. Temporal anticipation manifests as spatiotemporally patterned activity in three anatomically and functionally distinct parieto-temporal and sensorimotor cortical areas. Each of these areas revealed a marked neural signature of anticipation: Prior to sensory cues, activity in a specific frequency range of neural oscillations, spanning alpha and beta ranges, encodes the event probability density function. These neural signals predicted reaction times to imminent sensory cues. These results demonstrate that supra-modal representations of probability density across cortex underlie the anticipation of future events.

 Resolving discrepancies in long-term Holocene temperature trends between climate models and proxy records is essential to improve future climate projections. However, uncertainties in paleoclimate reconstructions limit their ability to constrain models. This study compares ice core-derived oxygen isotope records with isotope-enabled climate simulations to evaluate model performance and investigate Holocene temperature variability. Our results show that simulated and observed oxygen isotope trends in Greenland and West Antarctica are generally consistent, driven by orbital forcing. However, the model underestimates the early Holocene peak and subsequent decline observed in Greenland records. The most striking mismatch appears in tropical mountains, where the model shows a slight increase in isotopic trends, while proxy records indicate a clear decline. The mechanisms controlling this decreasing isotopic trend remain unclear and cannot be fully explained by temperature or hydroclimate changes alone. Addressing this tropical mountain oxygen isotope conundrum requires efforts to improve the model and paleoclimate interpretations.

 Knowledge of anisotropy-induced spatial and temporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial for enhancing the quality of remote sensing products, refining land surface process modeling, and optimizing climate models. However, the limited availability of simultaneous multi-angle LST observations from space has hindered the exploration of this topic. NASA's latest ECOSTRESS sensor deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) generates multi-angle LST measurements at a 70-m spatial resolution for different times of day/night, providing a new avenue for investigating urban thermal anisotropy. In this study, we presented an initial examination of the performance of ECOSTRESS LST observations in unraveling the fine-grained urban thermal anisotropy, by taking the City of Phoenix, Arizona, United States, as the study area. We proposed a method to generate a quasi-simultaneous multi-angle ECOSTRESS LST dataset over the course of the diurnal cycle with the assistance of air temperature data from weather stations and hourly LST observations from a geostationary satellite, GOES-R. We then examined the thermal anisotropic patterns and their diurnal and seasonal variations across different Local Climate Zones (LCZs) at a spatial resolution of 200 m. Based on quasi-simultaneous multi-angle ECOSTRESS observations, Vinnikov and Vinnikov-RL models were employed to generate LCZ-scale anisotropy profiles of the study area to quantify and correct the LST directional effect. The results revealed that ECOSTRESS observations manifest unique angular patterns, featuring substantial variations in sensor viewing azimuth angles (VAA) and limited changes in sensor viewing zenith angles (VZA) within a 30° range. The angular effect led to notable variations in the observed LST, with potential deviations at the city scale of up to 10 K during winter and around 5 K during summer, relative to the nadir LST. Furthermore, the LST anisotropy exhibited distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns across LCZs, characterized by prominent variations in the intensity and width of hot/cold spots. LCZ 6, 9, and D typically displayed higher hotspot intensity and width than other LCZs at varying times of day in both summer and winter. In addition, the Vinnikov-RL model had good performance in simulating diurnal LST anisotropy over LCZs. This study reveals the potential of multi-angle ECOSTRESS LST observations in exploring urban thermal anisotropy, and contributes to better utilization of ECOSTRESS LST products. The integration of ECOSTRESS LST data with other satellite derived LST data have important implications for studying urban climate and improving long-term surface climate record, contributing to global climate studies."

 The integration of Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data with Optical Photogrammetric Satellite Stereo Imagery (OPSSI) for Block Adjustment (BA) has emerged as a novel approach for generating large-area, high-accuracy Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, owing to the discrepancies between these two data platforms and the systematic errors of their sensors, errors arise in the BA fusion outcomes during the matching process of the two datasets. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing the accuracy of the BA process. Initially, the multi-characteristic constraint is used to filter the ICESat-2 ATL08 product to obtain control points and check points. Subsequently, the Terrain Matching Correction is applied to control points, and then integrated with the GF-7 OPSSI for BA to generate DEM. Ultimately, the check points are employed to assess the accuracy of the established DEM. Experiments in a 2,000 km2 test area in the Wuding River Basin show that: (1) The inclusion of ICESat-2 data has remarkably enhanced the accuracy of DEM modeling utilizing GF-7 OPSSI, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been reduced from the range of 5–10 m to 2–6 m. (2) Multi-characteristic constraint filtering is crucial for the identification of high quality ICESat-2 control points in flat and low relief areas. When implementing this filtering method, the established criteria should comprehensively consider both the quantity and the spatial distribution of control points to ensure optimal results. (3) Terrain Matching Correction on ICESat-2 data has effectively elevated the vertical accuracy of DEM modeling, particularly in regions with flat terrain. The RMSE of the vertical accuracy in such areas can be decreased by 1–3 m. In summary, the integration of spaceborne laser altimeter data with OPSSI holds immense significance for the production of large-scale and high-accuracy DEMs, offering a promising solution for terrain modeling and analysis on regional scales."

 Data primarily from the China Lightning Detection Network and dual-polarization radars were analyzed to investigate the cloud-to-ground lightning activity and its relationship with the thunderstorm structure in a supercell in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on May 14, 2021. This storm produced an EF3-scale (Enhanced Fujita Scale) tornado and exhibited complex variations in cloud-to-ground lightning activity. The dominant polarity of cloud-to-ground lightning transitioned from negative to positive and back to negative, with each polarity reversal accompanied by a decrease in cloud-to-ground lightning frequency. During a period when positive cloud-to-ground flashes accounted for 92.7 % of all cloud-to-ground flashes, the mean peak current reached an extraordinary 96.1 kA, significantly higher than during other periods or for negative cloud-to-ground lightning throughout the thunderstorm's lifetime. The tornado occurred near the peak of positive cloud-to-ground lightning activity. Based on an analysis of the relationship between cloud-to-ground lightning activity and the dynamic and microphysical parameters derived from radar data, it is deduced that the storm's charge structure likely evolved through the following sequence: an initial normal tripolar structure with predominant negative cloud-to-ground lightning, transitioning to an inverted tripolar structure during the dominance of positive cloud-to-ground lightning, followed by an inverted dipolar structure with a temporary increase and predominance of negative cloud-to-ground frequency, and finally returning to a normal tripolar structure characterized by high-frequency, predominantly negative cloud-to-ground lightning. The high peak current of positive cloud-to-ground lightning may be attributed to increased charge density from intense convection and a strong environmental electric field, particularly at lower lightning initiation altitudes."

 The elevated concentration of ammonium (NH4+) in PM2.5 is a significant contributor to haze formation. However, the reduction potential and sources of its precursor ammonia (NH3) remain unclear, particularly in the Sichuan Basin, where limited attention has been given to these issues. Here, daily PM2.5 samples were simultaneously collected from the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing between 1 September to 30 November 2017. The concentration of major water-soluble inorganic ions and the δ15N-NH4+ value in PM2.5 were measured. As a result, no significant difference in NH4+ concentration was observed between Chengdu (4.8 ± 3.4 μg m−3) and Chongqing (4.5 ± 2.7 μg m−3). Although clear differences in the major chemical forms of NH4+ in PM2.5 were identified, the rapid increase in ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was a key factor in triggering haze formation in both cities. The reduction of NOx emission proved more effective than NH3 in mitigation aerosol pollution in the short term. However, the decrease in NH4NO3 concentrations was more pronounced, particularly on haze days, when both NH3 and NOx reductions were considered concurrently. The Bayesian Mixing Model (MixSIAR) revealed significant differences in the source-resolved structure of NH4+ between Chengdu and Chongqing. Specifically, combustion and volatile sources accounted for 47.7 % and 52.3 % in Chengdu, while they accounted for 65.1 % and 34.9 % in Chongqing. However, combustion emissions remain a major source of NH4+ in PM2.5 during haze days in both cities, contributing over 65 % of NH4+ concentrations. Based on these results, reducing combustion emissions is an effective strategy for mitigating haze pollution in Chengdu and Chongqing."

Evaluating climate models at the gateway to the Arctic","Representing the exchange of air masses between the Arctic and mid-latitudes and the associated cloud formation is difficult for climate models. We compare climate model output to temperature and humidity measurements from weather balloons to provide suggestions for model improvements. Cold biases mostly occur in air that is exported from the Arctic. Models that compute the number of ice particles in a cloud better represent humidity than models that assume a fixed number of ice particles. 
 The Arctic wintertime energy and moisture budgets are largely controlled by the advection of warm, moist air masses from lower latitudes; the cooling and drying of these air masses inside the Arctic; and the export of cold, dry air masses. Climate models have substantial difficulties in representing key processes in these air-mass transformations, including turbulence under stable stratification and mixed-phase cloud processes. Here, we use radiosonde profiles of temperature and moisture and surface radiation observations from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (1993–2014), to assess the properties of air masses being imported into and exported from the central Arctic in CMIP6 climate models. In the free troposphere, models tend to be cold-biased, especially for the coldest temperatures, and relative humidity in most models is closer to saturation with respect to ice than what is observed. In the analysed models, supersaturation with respect to ice tends to be better represented with two-moment microphysics. The overall distribution of column-integrated precipitable water in models matches well with observations. Cold and dry biases are stronger in air masses being exported from the Arctic than those entering the Arctic. This suggests that the previously reported cold bias in the Arctic in CMIP6 models is probably due to errors in local thermodynamic processes."

The produced dataset has been extensively compared with other available AGB time series and can be used in AGB studies. 
 Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential component of the Earth's carbon cycle. Yet, large uncertainties remain in its spatial distribution and temporal evolution. Satellite remote sensing can help improve the accuracy of AGB estimates. In particular, the L-band (1.41 GHz) vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission is a good AGB proxy. Averaging the SMOS L-VOD over a year and linking it to an existing AGB map constitute a well-established method to derive a spatial relationship between the two quantities. Then, a temporal extrapolation of this spatial relation derives global and harmonized AGB time series from the L-VOD. This study refines this protocol by analyzing the impact of three factors on the AGB–VOD calibration. First, an analysis shows that ascending and descending VOD can be properly merged to estimate the AGB. Second, the use of a single global spatial relationship is preferred over several regional ones. Third, this new AGB dataset is compared with other published AGB datasets to assess the validity of the temporal extrapolation. The produced dataset provides vegetation biomass values up to 300 Mg ha−1 from 2011 onward. It shows more interannual variability than the other available time series and presents globally lower AGB estimates. In general, the resulting AGB is consistent with the AGB maps of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Biomass version 5 (average Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.87) and can be used in AGB studies. The AGB dataset has been produced from the Level 2 SMOS products with one global VOD–AGB relationship, mixing ascending and descending orbits.

 This work presents Mexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB), which is a newly developed gridded, high-resolution climate dataset comprised of daily, monthly and yearly precipitation and temperature (Tmin, Tmax, Tavg). This new database provides the largest temporal coverage of the aforementioned climate variables at the highest spatial resolution (20 arc sec, or 560 m on Mexico's CCL projection) when compared to the other currently available gridded datasets for Mexico and its development has allowed to analyze the country's climate extremes for the 1951–2020 period. By comparing the spatial distribution of precipitation from the MexHiResClimDB with other gridded data (Daymet, L15, CHIRPS and PERSIANN CDR), it was found that the precipitation provided by this new dataset is the only one that adequately represents the spatial variation of extreme precipitation events, in particular for the precipitation that occurred during September 15–16 of 2013, caused by the presence of Tropical storm Manuel in the Pacific Ocean and Hurricane Ingrid (Cat 1) in the Gulf of Mexico. With this new database it was possible to summarize extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico for the 1951–2020 period — a summary that was not available before: the wettest year was 1958, the wettest day 1970-09-26, and September of 2013 the wettest month. It was also found that eight out of the ten days with the highest Tmin occurred in 2020, the two months with the highest Tmin were July and August of 2020 and that the six years with the highest Tmin were 2015–2020. When Tmax was analyzed, it was found that the hottest day was 1998-06-15, while June of 1998 was the hottest month and 2020 the hottest year, and that the four hottest years occurred between 2011–2020. Nationwide (and considering 1961–1990 as the baseline period), Tmin, Tavg and Tmax have increased, with their anomalies drastically increasing in recent years and reaching values above 1.0 oC in 2020. At the same time, precipitation has also decreased in recent years — which combined with the increase in temperature will have severe impacts on water availability that need to be analyzed in detail, for example at the watershed level.

 Modeling sub-daily mass changes, dominated by the atmosphere and the oceans, is not only essential for understanding weather and climate change but also serves as a fundamental requirement for nearly all existing terrestrial or space-borne geodetic observations to perform signal separation. Removing these high-frequency mass changes, through the usage of so-called de-aliasing products, is of particular interest for satellite gravity missions such as GRACE and GRACE-FO to prevent the aliasing of short-term mass changes into seasonal and long-term mass variability. However, establishing a global observation network to monitor high-frequency gravity signals is impractical. Thus, ongoing efforts focus on simulating this high-frequency signal by driving atmospheric/oceanic numerical models with specific climate-forcing fields and assimilating observational data. Its realization relies on a complicated system and the uncertainty of obtained results is non-negligible for its dependency on selected forcing field and ocean model."

Erroneous snow height measurements often occur when snow height is low or changes, for instance during snowfall in summer. We prepare a new benchmark dataset with annotated snow height data and demonstrate how to improve the measurement quality using modern deep-learning approaches. Our approach can be easily implemented in a data pipeline for snow modeling. 
 Snow height measurements are still the backbone of any snow cover monitoring, whether based on modeling or remote sensing. These ground-based measurements are often realized using ultrasonic or laser technologies. In challenging environments, such as high alpine regions, the quality of sensor measurements deteriorates quickly, especially under extreme weather conditions or ephemeral snow conditions. Moreover, the sensors by their nature measure the height of an underlying object and are therefore prone to returning other information, such as the height of vegetation, in snow-free periods. Quality assessment and real-time classification of automated snow height measurements are therefore desirable for providing high-quality data for research and operational applications. To this end, we propose CleanSnow, a machine learning approach to automated classification of snow height measurements into a snow cover class and a class corresponding to everything else, which takes into account both the temporal context and the dependencies between snow height and other sensor measurements. We created a new dataset of manually annotated snow height measurements, which allowed us to train our models in a supervised manner and quantitatively evaluate our results. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies to evaluate feature importance and compare several different models, we validated our design choices and demonstrated the importance of using temporal information together with information from auxiliary sensors. CleanSnow achieves a high accuracy of almost 98 % and represents a new baseline for further research in the field. The presented approach to snow height classification finds its use in various tasks, ranging from snow modeling to climate science."

Indeed, magnetite stoichiometry (R = Fe(II)/Fe(III)) is rarely controlled or monitored in Cr-magnetite interaction studies, although it was shown to affect not only redox transformation but also adsorption mechanisms of several contaminants. This study examined the interaction of 20 μM (∼1 mg L–1) Cr(III) with 10 nm magnetites, whose stoichiometries were carefully defined (0.1 ≤ R ≤ 0.5) and preserved under anaerobic conditions in 10 mM NaCl. X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed the formation of a tridentate trinuclear inner-sphere surface complex, but it occurred only on oxidized magnetite (R0.1) or on stoichiometric magnetite (R0.5) under acidic conditions, where H+-promoted dissolution generated an Fe(II)-depleted surface. When magnetite stoichiometry increased, Cr surface speciation evolved in favor of a [Fe2+Crx3+Fe3+ 1–x]OhFeTd3+O4-like solid solution in which Cr(III) partially substitutes Fe(III) in octahedral sites. This study reveals the joint effects of pH and magnetite stoichiometry on the Cr(III) sorption mechanism, demonstrating that Cr(III)-(hydr)oxide precipitation is not necessarily the driving process of Cr(III) elimination from solutions. These results will help predict the fate and transport of chromium as well as develop magnetite-based chromium remediation processes."

However, differences in ecosystem responses to normal and flash droughts in China remain unclear, particularly in terms of vegetation vulnerability and resilience. Using a three‐dimensional clustering method, we identified disparities between these drought types from 1982 to 2022 and found that flash droughts developed 40% faster than normal droughts, but normal droughts caused more severe vegetation damage. With the transition to flash droughts, vegetation sensitivity to droughts has increased. Using Shapley's additive interpretation method, we assessed the role of each environmental factor in vegetation recovery. The results show that in normal droughts, drought characteristics and vegetation sensitivity drive the resilience of vegetation, whereas in flash droughts, temperature and vapor pressure deficit become more significant. These insights provide a deeper understanding of vegetation resilience and drought tolerance under changing climatic conditions."

 Designing highly active, cost-effective, stable, and coke-resistant catalysts is a hurdle in commercializing bio-oil steam reforming. Single-atom alloys (SAAs) are captivating atomic ensembles crosschecking affordability and activity, yet their stability is held questionable by trial-and-error synthesis practices. Herein, we employ descriptor-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the stability, activity, and regeneration of Ni-based SAA catalysts for acetic acid dehydrogenation. While 12 bimetallic candidates pass the cost/stability screening, they uncover varying dehydrogenation reactivity and selectivity, introduced by favoring different acetic acid adsorption modes on the SAA sites. We find that Pd-Ni catalyst provokes the utmost H2 activity, however, ab-initio molecular simulations at 873 K reveals the ability of Cu-Ni site to effectively desorb hydrogen compared to Pd-Ni and Ni, attributed to the narrowed surface charge depletion region. Notably, this Cu-Ni performance is coupled with enhancing C*-gasification and acetic acid dehydrogenation with respect to Ni. Building upon these findings, DFT-screening of trimetallic M1-M2-Ni co-dopants recognizes 6 novel modulated single-sites with high stability, balanced H*-adsorption, and anti-coking susceptibility. This work provides invaluable data to accelerate the discovery of affordable and efficient bimetallic and trimetallic SAA catalysts for bio-oil upgrading to green hydrogen.

 The mediodorsal (MD) thalamus is a critical partner for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in cognitive control. Accumulating evidence has shown that the MD regulates task uncertainty in decision making and enhance cognitive flexibility. However, the computational mechanism of this cognitive process remains unclear. Here we trained biologically-constrained computational models to delineate the mechanistic role of MD in context-dependent decision making.

Incorporating genetically identified thalamocortical connectivity and interneuron cell types into the model replicates key neurophysiological findings in task-performing animals. Our model reveals computational mechanisms and geometric interpretations of MD in regulating cue uncertainty and context switching to enable cognitive flexibility.

 Aging is the risk factor for chronic pancreatitis and severity determinant for its acute attack, yet the underlying cause is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent β-cells of endocrine pancreas decide the onset and severity of chronic and acute pancreatitis. During physiological aging, senescent β-cells increase the expression of miR-503-322 which is secreted as small extracellular vesicles to enter exocrine acinar cells, driving a causal and reversible role on aging-associated pancreatitis. Mechanistically, miR-503-322 targets MKNK1 to inhibit acinar-cell secretion leading to autodigestion and repress proliferation causing repair damage of exocrine pancreas. In the elderly population, serum miR-503 concentration is negatively correlated with amylase, prone to chronic pancreatitis due to increased miR-503 and decreased MKNK1 in the elderly pancreas. Our findings highlight the miR-503-322–MKNK1 axis mediating the endocrine-exocrine regulatory pathway specifically in aged mice and humans. Modulating this axis may provide potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for aging-associated pancreatitis. Aging is the risk factor for chronic pancreatitis and its acute attack.

For stomatal lineage ground cells, division potential is the product of a cell’s neighbourhood, nuclear size and transcription factor dynamics. 
 During development, many precursor lineages are flexible, producing variable numbers and types of progeny cells. What determines whether precursors differentiate or continue dividing? Here we take a quantitative approach that combines long-term live imaging, statistical modeling and computational simulations to probe the developmental flexibility of stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGC) in Arabidopsis leaves. We discover that cell size is a strong predictor of SLGC behaviour and that cell size is linked to division behaviour at multiple spatial scales. At the neighbourhood scale, cell size correlates with the strength of cell-cell signaling, which affects the rate at which SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a division-promoting transcription factor, is degraded. At the subcellular scale, cell size correlates with nuclear size, which modulates the concentration of SPCH in the nucleus. Our work shows how initial differences in SPCH levels are canalized by nuclear size and cell-cell signaling to inform the behaviour of a flexible cell type.

 Lysine acylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) that plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes, such as transcription, metabolism, protein localization and folding. Thousands of lysine acylation sites have been identified based on advances in antibody enrichment strategies, highly sensitive analysis by mass spectrometry (MS), and bioinformatics. However, only 27 lysine methacrylation (Kmea) sites have been identified exclusively in histone proteins. It is hard to separate, purify and differentiate the Kmea modification from its structural isomer lysine crotonylation (Kcr) using general biochemical approaches. Here, we identify Kmea sites on a non-histone protein, Cyclophillin A (CypA). To investigate the functions of Kmea in CypA, we develop a general genetic code expansion approach to incorporate a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) ε-N-Methacryllysine (MeaK) into target proteins and identify interacting proteins of methacrylated CypA using affinity-purification MS. We find that Kmea at CypA site 125 regulates cellular redox homeostasis, and HDAC1 is the regulator of Kmea on CypA. Moreover, we discover that genetically encode Kmea can be further methylated to ε-N-methyl-ε-N-methacrylation (Kmemea) in live cells. It is challenging to purify and prepare large amount of methacrylated proteins from cells.

 Borderlands are increasingly recognized as critically important for biodiversity conservation owing to their ecological significance and high political profile. However, the species ranges covered by protected areas and their influencing factors in transboundary areas are still largely unknown worldwide. Here, based on the distributional ranges of 19,039 terrestrial vertebrates, we find that three-quarters of species’ ranges in global borders remain uncovered by protected areas, particularly in tropical areas of Southeast Asia and West Africa. The average protected area coverage of species ranges is lower in transboundary areas than non-transboundary areas after accounting for geographical differences in sampling efforts. We also observe that protected area coverage of species ranges increases with governance effectiveness, collaboration abilities, protection levels, sizes and establishment years of protected areas, and topographic complexity, but decreases with human population density, human development index, and cropland expansion. Furthermore, protected areas simultaneously face threats of ongoing global challenges from climate change, land-use modification, and alien species invasion, and the proportions of borderlands threatened by global changes are higher than elsewhere. All these findings demonstrate that cross-border cooperation is urgently needed to achieve the ambitious goal of global biodiversity conservation by 2050.

 Due to the analogous physicochemical properties and weak coordination ability of alkali and alkaline earth metals, accurate separation of radioactive 90Sr from groundwater or seawater still presents a big challenge in environmental radioactivity remediation. Here we mimic the complexation behavior of molecular crown-ether carboxylic acids to construct an elegant negatively charged supramolecular trap in an anionic crown ether-based metal-organic framework (ZJU-X99) for precisely catching Sr2+. Owing to the synergistic effects of electrostatic interactions arising from the In(COO)4- nodes and supramolecular host-guest recognition from the 18-crown-6 rings, ZJU-X99 exhibits rapid adsorption kinetics (1 min), high adsorption capacity (263 mg/g), and exceptional selectivity for Sr2+ even when 1000-fold of Na⁺, K⁺ and Cs⁺ coexist. Relative to alkali metals, Sr2+ ions are intricately ensconced within the supramolecular trap, resulting in lowest binding energy and minimal structural alterations. Dynamic column experiments and radioactive 90Sr decontamination trials further validate its practical application prospects. Our findings offer valuable insights into the design of supramolecular frameworks featuring tailored binding sites for targeted ions.

 Droughts have been occurring frequently worldwide in a warming climate with an adverse impact on water–food–energy–ecology security, which raises substantial challenges for drought predictability. However, little is known about the future changes in dynamic predictability of agricultural drought over the globe and the dominant confounders causing this change. Here we leveraged Bayesian model averaging ensemble vine copula model to reveal changes in agricultural drought predictability globally in warm seasons at three projected global warming levels. We found that the projected dynamic predictability of agricultural drought would significantly decrease over 70% of the global land areas in +2 °C and +3 °C worlds, especially over North America, Amazonia, Europe, eastern and southern Asia and Australia. This was primarily attributed to the weakening soil moisture memory, background aridity and weakening land–atmosphere coupling. Our findings highlight that stakeholders should employ dynamic climate adaptations to cope with the decreasing drought predictability in a warmer climate.

 Processing underutilized bioresidues (for example, straw, manure and wood) into novel food and feed products such as fungi-based proteins, microbial proteins and insects represents ‘waste-to-nutrition’ pathways that are increasingly promoted to reduce the environmental impacts of food systems, including pressures on climate change, land and water resources. However, the actual environmental mitigation potential of this strategy depends on future technological advancements and contextual factors, which remain uncertain. Here we compare five conventional bioresidue valorization pathways with insect farming, microbial conversion and protein extraction by simulating their life-cycle assessment across 8,820 combinations of future process efficiencies, 9 food and energy systems scenarios and 11 representative bioresidues across France. Overall, processing bioresidues into novel ingredients is competitive only in certain conditions. These include access to decarbonized energy, substantial technological advancements and scenarios where novel ingredients replace meat rather than animal feed. The microbial conversion of woody residues, manure and sludge into feed will constitute the more sustainable valorization strategy only in contexts where current demand for animal-based food is maintained. However, the sustainability of this scenario must still be further appraised in terms of scaling these systems to a broader level.

Comparing the results with emissions estimated by regular statistics, we find that emission estimates relying solely on either monthly statistics or annual bulletins have uncertainties. Prioritizing annual bulletins where available and supplementing with monthly statistics for the most recent year can balance accuracy and timeliness, yielding a median error of 1.3% across different update intervals. However, near real-time estimates of relative changes in annual CO2 emissions bear large uncertainties regardless of the approach. For the six years investigated, near real-time estimates usually failed to capture the trends in annual emissions, indicating that those near real-time approaches are unreliable for estimating changes in CO2 emissions due to notable differences between timely-updated and regular statistics."

However, whether the IOD and WPSH modulate interannual variations of δ18Op remains unclear. Here, we reveal the links between the IOD/WPSH and the annual δ18Op in southern East Asia. We found that the IOD strongly influenced annual δ18Op before 1999 by changes in moisture supply from different transport pathways and convection. However, the link became decoupled after 1999, resulting from the transition of the IOD from a symmetric to an asymmetric pattern. In contrast, significantly enhanced WPSH emerges as an important influence on annual δ18Op after 1999. Therefore, the IOD and WPSH alternately influence interannual variation of δ18Op around 1999.

 Global warming increases water evaporation rates from planetary ecosystems. Here, we show that evaporation rates encountered during human breathing in dehydrating atmospheres promote airway inflammation and potentially exacerbate lung diseases. Continuum mathematical analysis predicts that water evaporation thins airway mucus layers and compresses epithelial cells during tidal breathing. Experiments using human tracheal-bronchial cells confirm that exposure to air with progressive degrees of dryness (relative humidities of 95%, 60%, and 30% at 37 °C) causes the mucus layer to progressively thin (by 5%, 35%, and 58%). Associated compression of epithelial cells elevates secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-33, and IL-6). Exposing mice with a muco-inflammatory phenotype to intermittent dry air for 14 days results in histopathological changes and alteration of inflammatory infiltrates. Together with climate model simulations, these findings suggest that most of the United States will be at elevated risk of airway inflammation by the latter half of this century.

 China, despite being a leading producer of potatoes, has a potato yield below the global average, primarily due to inefficient nutrient management practices. Remote sensing provides a non-invasive and large-scale approach to monitor crop nutrient status, offering an efficient alternative to traditional plant tissue analysis. However, the generalization of foliar nutrient models is often constrained by factors such as growth stages and planting cultivars. Transfer learning offers a powerful solution by utilizing knowledge acquired from one task to enhance performance in related one, addressing challenges in model generalizability. Here, we investigated the potential of integrating various transfer learning techniques with partial least squares regression (PLSR) for retrieving three key potato foliar nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) across five growth stages (emergence, tuber initiation, early tuber bulking, mid-tuber bulking and tuber maturation). Three categories of transfer learning techniques were examined: 1) instance-based, including PLSR-KMM (kernel mean matching) and PLSR-TrAdaBoostR2 (transfer adaptive boosting for regression); 2) feature-based, including PLSR-TCA (transfer component analysis); and 3) parameter-based, including PLSR-parameter-based.

 This study provides a comprehensive assessment of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and their carbonaceous fractions-organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), across the Sikkim Himalaya region during the summer and winter of 2022. Sampling was conducted at four strategically selected locations: Gangtok (1151m), Pelling (1962m), Mangan (1353m), and Lachen (2740m). Due to harsh winter condition, Lachen was inaccessible, limiting winter sampling to the remaining three sites. Quartz filter-based low volume air sampling was employed to ensure high precision data collection. Annual average concentrations of PM2.5 exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs) of 40 μg/m3, with the values of 66.48 ± 10.81 μg/m3 (Gangtok), 42.05 ± 17.48 μg/m3 (Pelling), and 61.39 ± 13.24 μg/m3 (Mangan).

Winter exhibited significantly higher OC and EC concentrations, especially in Gangtok, attributed to intensified vehicular emissions and biomass burning. The OC/EC ratio exceeding 2 in winter suggests enhanced secondary organic carbon formation, predominately from biomass and coal combustion. Gangtok exhibits the highest SOC/OC ratio, indicating enhanced secondary organic aerosol formation, likely due to higher anthropogenic emissions or favourable atmospheric conditions. In contrast, lower SOC/OC ratios in Pelling and Mangan suggest weaker atmospheric processing or lower VOC emissions. Correlation analysis indicates primary emissions as the dominant source of OC and EC, with transboundary pollution playing a critical role.

By leveraging collocated radar wind profiler (RWP) and radiosonde observations from 29 stations across China during 2023, a high-resolution dataset of low-level turbulence-related parameters are generated based on spectral width method. This dataset includes squared Brunt–Vaisala frequency (N2), turbulent dissipation rate (ε), and vertical eddy diffusivity (κ), inner scale (l0), and buoyancy length scale (LB), which are provided twice daily at 00 and 12 UTC with a vertical resolution of 120 m, covering altitudes from 0.12 km to 3.0 km above ground level. Spatial analysis reveals significant regional disparities in turbulence-related parameters across China, where ε, κ and LB are higher in northwest and north China compared to south China, while N2 and l0 display an inverse spatial pattern. This contrasting geographical distributions suggest distinct atmospheric instability across China. In terms of seasonality, turbulence-related variables showed maxima during spring and summer. Vertical profiles characteristics show distinct altitudinal dependencies, ε, LB and κ exhibit progressive attenuation with altitude, while N2 and l0 increase with height.

It demonstrates improved accuracy in short- to medium-range weather prediction over the Indian region, with notable success in predicting extreme events. Further, the model will be entrusted to operational forecasting agencies after validation and testing. 
 The prediction of Indian monsoon rainfall variability, affecting a country with a population of billions, remained one of the major challenges of the numerical weather prediction community. While in recent years, there has been a significant improvement in the prediction of the synoptic-scale transients associated with the monsoon circulation, the intricacies of rainfall variability remained a challenge. Here, an attempt is made to develop a global model using a dynamic core of a cubic octahedral grid that provides a higher resolution of 6.5 km over the global tropics. This high-resolution model has been developed to resolve the monsoon convection. Reforecasts with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) High-Resolution Global Forecast Model (HGFM) have been run daily from June through September 2022. HGFM has a wavenumber truncation of 1534 in the cubic octahedral grid. The monsoon events have been predicted with a 10 d lead time. HGFM is compared to the operational Global Forecast System (GFS) T1534. While HGFM provides skills comparable to GFS, it shows better skills for higher precipitation thresholds. This model is currently being run in experimental mode and will be made operational."

We propose a framework to assess model performance. In the framework, convective cells are identified and tracked in the forecasts and observations, and the model skill is then evaluated by comparing differences between forecast and observed cells. We demonstrate the framework with four open-source models. 
 The rapid temporal evolution of convective rainfall poses a challenge for quantitative rainfall nowcasting models that forecast rainfall on timescales ranging from 5 min to 6 h. With the growing potential of machine learning models for precipitation nowcasting to produce realistic-looking nowcasts for long lead times, it is important to investigate whether the nowcasts also produce realistic development for convective rainfall. Common verification metrics traditionally used to validate nowcasting models are often dominated by large-scale stratiform rainfall, and averaging the metrics across entire precipitation fields obscures how accurately the models replicate individual convective cells, which makes it difficult to distinguish the model skill for the growth and decay of convective rainfall. In this study, we present a framework based on the tracking of convective cells to investigate how accurately nowcasting models reproduce the development of convective rainfall. In the framework, a cell identification and tracking algorithm is applied first to the input observation rainfall fields and then separately to the target observation and nowcast rainfall fields where the tracks identified in the input observations are continued. Features describing the cells and cell tracks, such as the cell volume rain rate and area, are then extracted. In addition to the errors in these feature values, the models' skill in reproducing the existence of convective cells is estimated by calculating several contingency table metrics, such as the critical success index. The results allow the analysis of how accurately the models reproduce the growth and decay of convective rainfall and quantify the differences between the models, for example, due to differences in how the models smooth the nowcasts (i.e. blurring). The framework also allows differentiation of the results based on the initial conditions of the cell tracks, demonstrated here by separating the tracks into decaying or growing cell tracks based on the cell status when the nowcast is created. We demonstrate the framework with four open-source nowcasting models: the advection nowcast, the S-PROG (Spectral Prognosis; Seed, 2003) and LINDA (Lagrangian Integro-Difference equation model with Autoregression; Pulkkinen et al., 2021) models from the pysteps library, and the L-CNN (Lagrangian Convolutional Neural Network; Ritvanen et al., 2023) model, with data from the Swiss radar network. The results indicate that the L-CNN model reproduced the existence of convective cells best among the models and had smaller errors in the cell volume rain rate than LINDA and S-PROG. LINDA had the smallest underestimation in the cell mean rain rate, whereas S-PROG significantly overestimated the cell volume rain rate and area because of blurring."

As filter-feeding organisms, marine mussels are particularly vulnerable to microplastics. Moreover, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are known to leach from microplastics under various environmental conditions. Among PAEs, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common endocrine disruptor. We investigated the effects of microplastics and plasticizers on the reproductive function of the female mussel Mytilus coruscus. The results revealed that environmental exposure to DEHP and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) triggered molecular changes by allowing DEHP to act as an antiestrogen by binding with estrogen receptors (ER), thereby constituting the molecular initiating event. Key events were the suppression of ER, cytochrome P450–3 (CYP3), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) gene expressions, which reduced estradiol and progesterone levels in ovarian tissues. Ultimately adverse outcomes occurred: antioxidant capacity in ovarian tissue was impaired, hindering ovarian development and reducing reproductive function. This study introduces a novel adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework focusing on reproductive impairment in shellfish. By integrating experimental findings with the AOP concept, the research provides essential data for understanding the toxicological effects of microplastic pollutants on mussels. This framework offers valuable insights for risk assessment, contributing to a better understanding of how microplastics and plasticizers threaten marine life."

However, this hypothesis remains untested. This study tested the hypothesis through mesocosm experiments, confirming that rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide triggered hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation, elevating soil redox potential, and oxidizing arsenite to less phytoavailable arsenate in soil porewater, thereby reducing As uptake by rice and As accumulation in rice grain. Comparison between two crops of rice cultivation with different fluxes of rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide confirms that seasonal rainfall variation has an impact on accumulation of rice grain-borne arsenic, with paddy soil receiving more rainfall having a lower arsenic concentration in the rice grain compared to that receiving less rainfall. Using China’s major rice-producing region as an example, it is demonstrated that spatial variation in rainfall regime could impact the geographical distribution of rice grain-borne As at a national scale. The findings have implications for the assessment and management of the environmental risk from arsenic-contaminated rice grains."

The determinants of emission variability among individual flights remain inadequately understood, thereby hindering the development of effective mitigation strategies. Here, employing an extensive flight tracking data set (Flightradar24), we assess the interflight variability in CO2 emissions from global aviation with an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal granularity─down to meters and seconds, respectively. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, global aviation emitted 899 [696–1122], 469 [363–581], and 542 [418–672] Tg CO2, respectively. Based on this trajectory-level CO2 emission data set, we develop reduced-form models for over two hundred standard aircraft types that capture this flight-to-flight variability. These models offer a novel tool for understanding why emissions differ across individual flights and routes, providing crucial insights to support targeted emission reduction measures within the aviation sector. Further analysis reveals that optimizing airport flight scheduling and route planning can significantly reduce emissions. Airports with moderate flight volumes exhibit the greatest potential for relative emission reductions (51.6%, 0.12 Tg·year–1), whereas those with the highest flight volumes offer the most substantial absolute reduction potentials (12.9%, 1.39 Tg·year–1).

Herein, we investigated 277 chemical pollutants from 367 sampling points across 10 rounds, totaling 1,016,590 measured data points. An environmental health prioritization index (EHPI) was proposed and applied to integrate multiple criteria: occurrence, migration, persistence, bioaccumulation, acute and chronic toxicity, and health effects to rank the target pollutants for priority control. Thirty pollutants were classified as the top-priority group and 81 as high-priority, with metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and haloalkanes ranking highest, while emerging contaminants of concern ranked lower. The top 6 pollutants were beryllium, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, nickel, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, and arsenic. The EHPI method was compared against five other weighting schemes, including AHP (analytic hierarchy process), entropy, AHP-entropy, AHP-TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution), and entropy-TOPSIS. EHPI effectively captured and integrated the results from more simplistic prioritization schemes. Overall, 38 pollutants are recommended for inclusion in the priority control list, focusing on the top-priority group and high detection and exceedance categories. This framework provides critical guidance for focused monitoring, assessment, and control of the highest-risk groundwater pollutants, supporting more effective environmental and human health protection."

However, earlier reported treatment systems mostly suffer from side reactions against efficient and cost-effective production of 1O2, together with insufficient utilization of 1O2 limited by the extremely short diffusion length. To overcome the drawbacks, we here designed high-performance nanoreactors by modulating the MnO2 phase to nanotube structures (with ∼5 nm diameter, termed “NT5”). With nanoconfinement, our developed NT5 directed efficient and almost 100% utilization of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to produce 1O2 and achieved maximal kinetics on organic pollutant elimination. The mechanism study revealed that the geometric strain of NT5 together with spatial confinement modulated the adsorption properties of PMS molecules and led to their transformation to 1O2. To demonstrate the applicability of NT5, we developed a reactive filter with a particulate catalyst (NT5 grown on an alumina substrate) that can effectively and stably work in a broad range of contaminated scenarios (surface water, groundwater, municipal secondary effluent, and industrial wastewaters), due to the confined treatment together with the fouling-resistance nature.

However, fundamental aspects of this reaction remain poorly understood, limiting our comprehensive understanding of the nitrogen cycle. In this study, we present the first coupled measurements of nitrate and nitrite dual isotopes at natural abundance across the Antarctic summer to uncover the environmental factors influencing enzymatic isotopic exchange. East Antarctic surface waters exhibit the most anomalous nitrate and nitrite isotope signatures and a more pronounced equilibrium isotope effect compared to West Antarctica. This feature may be attributed to the regulation of enzymatic isotopic exchange reaction by temperature, and we infer that there might be a tipping point in the expression of its intensity. Given the warming of Antarctic waters due to global climate change, particularly in West Antarctic, we hypothesize that such reaction could have an amplified impact on nitrogen isotope dynamics. Further analyses incorporating data from beyond the Southern Ocean also suggest that functional differences in the  nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme itself are a critical contributing factor. Overall, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the enzymatic isotopic exchange reaction, with broad implications for models of the modern upper ocean nitrogen cycle and paleoceanographic reconstructions of ancient nitrogen cycle dynamics."

Seasonal southeasterly and northeasterly winds off Sumatra are both strengthened, meanwhile, anomalous westerly winds occur over the western Celebes Sea. This reflects a zonal “tripole” pattern of the changed convection that is weakened over the exposed Sunda and Sahul shelves and strengthened over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and western equatorial Pacific. Model results suggest that lower sea levels and larger ice sheets are responsible for these changes. Coupled with the changed atmospheric circulation, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole‐like mean state forms in the Indian Ocean.

The PT pressure reduces with increasing dislocation density, microstrain, plastic strain, and decreasing crystallite size. Results demonstrate a new strain‐induced PT mechanism compared to a pressure/temperature‐induced one.

This study analyzes 12 years (2012–2023) of radiosonde data from five sites in the tropical western Pacific to examine the characteristics of inertial gravity wave (IGW) parameters and their interaction with the background flow. In the troposphere, IGWs exhibit larger vertical wavelengths and intrinsic frequencies compared to those in the stratosphere. Horizontal phase speeds in the troposphere are primarily between ±10 m/s with over half of IGWs propagating downward. In the stratosphere, horizontal phase speeds extend to ±20 m/s with most IGWs propagating upward. The troposphere shows a distinct annual cycle in mean meridional momentum flux and energy, peaking in winter and reaching a minimum in monsoon. Conversely, in the stratosphere, mean kinetic energy and zonal momentum flux of IGWs follow a quasi‐biennial cycle. This pattern is attributed to the distribution of IGW horizontal phase speeds and the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Additionally, the slopes of temperature and horizontal wind spectra in the troposphere exhibit an annual cycle with minima (saturation) in winter and maxima (unsaturation) in the monsoon. In the stratosphere, temperature spectral slopes continue to show an annual cycle at altitudes between 18 and 24 km. However, at 24–30 km, horizontal wind spectral slopes fluctuate significantly, reflecting a quasi‐biennial cycle.

We begin with a historical evaluation of AR properties from this model ensemble followed by future projections under a high emissions scenario. We demonstrate that by end‐of‐century, the maximum integrated vapor transport associated with ARs will robustly increase by as much as 20% $20\%$ in some regions of the South Pacific, and ARs contribute a larger proportion (up to 20% $20\%$ more) of the annual precipitation climatology in certain regions of New Zealand. The spatial structure and seasonality of these changes indicate the role of a poleward shift and intensification of the westerly jet. This is further quantified through a decomposition into dynamic and thermodynamic components. Although the thermodynamic change dominates the increase in AR frequency, the additional positive dynamical change is notable over the mid‐latitudes and southern New Zealand. Separating events using an AR categorization scale shows that higher category (longer duration, more intense) events more than double in frequency, underscoring the increasing role that ARs will play in extreme weather events in the future for this region."

While the role of satellite remote sensing (RS) is highly anticipated to address data needs and boost transparency, critical thought on what is feasible and how to strategically integrate its insights for ambitious corporate biodiversity and water disclosure is lagging behind. To address this, we propose applying a systems perspective to represent the complex, multi‐scale interactions between biodiversity, water systems, and corporate operations, and to guide how to integrate RS contributions to analyze the full spectrum of impacts and risks—ranging from direct and concurrent to cascading, cumulative, and emergent. We highlight seven guiding (non‐exhaustive) principles for leveraging satellite RS data to assess corporate biodiversity and water impacts and risks. This process requires an effective system boundary (1) set spatially, temporally, and process‐wise. Within which, biodiversity and water's multi‐dimensionality (2) needs to be addressed to monitor the spatio‐temporal dynamics (3) that characterize ecosystem responses. To attribute risk and impact of detected changes, interactions need to be defined by causality (4) and directionality (5), and ultimately consider compound impacts (6) across commodities, supply chains and portfolios, as well as cross‐system interactions (7), for example, between climate change, water and biodiversity.

 Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex essential for uptake of pyruvate into matrix as the primary carbon source for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle1,2. Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC."

 Mitochondrial dynamics are orchestrated by protein assemblies that directly remodel membrane structure, however the influence of specific lipids on these processes remains poorly understood. Here, using an inducible heterodimerization system to selectively modulate the lipid composition of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), we show that local production of diacylglycerol (DAG) directly leads to transient tubulation and rapid fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, which are mediated by isoforms of endophilin B (EndoB) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), respectively. Reconstitution experiments on cardiolipin-containing membrane templates mimicking the planar and constricted OMM topologies reveal that DAG facilitates the membrane binding and remodeling activities of both EndoB and Drp1, thereby independently potentiating membrane tubulation and fission events. EndoB and Drp1 do not directly interact with each other, suggesting that DAG production activates multiple pathways for membrane remodeling in parallel. Together, our data emphasizes the importance of OMM lipid composition in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Using complementary live cell approaches together with a powerful in vitro reconstitution system, this study demonstrates the direct regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by localized changes to the lipid composition of the outer membrane."

 Long-persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have applications from safety signage to bioimaging; however, existing organic LPL (OLPL) systems do not align with human scotopic vision, which is sensitive to blue light. We present a strategy to blueshift the emissions in binary OLPL systems by upconverting the charge-transfer (CT) to a locally excited (LE) singlet state. Through rigorous steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and wavelength-resolved thermoluminescence measurements, we provide the direct experimental evidence for this upconversion in OLPL systems featuring small energy offsets between the lowest-energy CT and LE singlet states. These systems exhibited strong room temperature LPL, particularly when extrinsic electron traps are added. Importantly, the developed OLPL system achieved Class A (ISO 17398) LPL, matching well with human scotopic vision. The findings not only elucidate the role of small energy offsets in modulating LPL but also provide potential avenues for enhancing the efficiency and applicability of OLPL materials.

 Stability and translation of mRNAs, both endogenous and therapeutic, is determined by poly(A) tail. Direct RNA sequencing enables single-molecule measurements of poly(A) lengths, avoiding amplification bias. It also holds potential for observation of non-adenosines within poly(A), known to influence mRNA fate. However, there is no computational method to detect composite tails in Direct Sequencing data. To address this gap, we introduce the Ninetails, a neural network-based tool that accurately identifies and quantifies non-adenosines in poly(A) tails. Examination of different biological contexts revealed widespread non-adenosine decorations, with frequencies influenced by the origin of poly(A) tails differing by mRNA class, cell type, and species. Notably, substrates of cytoplasmic TENT5-polymerases and mitochondrially encoded mRNAs are enriched in composite tails. For mRNA therapeutics, we show that the composition of poly(A) tails in mRNA vaccines is dynamic during its cellular lifetime and that the manufacturing protocol of synthetic mRNAs affects the purity of poly(A) tails.

Here, authors explored the strained defect sites on CNTs for the chlorination process for water purification. The strain field effectively steers the free chlorine activation to achieve deep remediation of the water body. 
 Carbon nanotube (CNT)–based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) used for water purification have been exploited for several decades. Many strategies for modifying CNTs have been utilized to improve their catalytic performance in remediation processes. However, the strain fields of the intrinsic defect sites on CNT steering AOPs (such as chlorination) have not yet been reported. Here, we explored the strained defect sites for steering the chlorination process for water purification. The strained defect sites with the elongated sp2 hybridized C–C bonds boost electronic reactivity with the chlorine molecules via the initial Yeager–type adsorption. As a result, the reactive species in chlorination can be regulated on demand, such as the ratio of high–selectivity ClO• ranging from 38.8% in conventional defect–based systems to 87.5% in our strain–dominated process, which results in the generation of harmless intermediates and even deep mineralization during 2,4–DCP abatement. This work highlights the role that strain fields have on controlling the extent of chlorination reactions. There is an urgent need to develop sustainable water remediation technologies.

Here authors discover that inhibition of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis leads to myeloid differentiation and sensitization to menin inhibitors in leukemia stem cells of MLLr leukemia. 
 Targeting the dependency of MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemias on menin with small molecule inhibitors has opened new therapeutic strategies for these poor-prognosis diseases. However, the rapid development of menin inhibitor resistance calls for combinatory strategies to improve responses and prevent resistance. Here we show that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) of MLLr acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibit enhanced guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, the inhibition of which leads to myeloid differentiation and sensitization to menin inhibitors. Mechanistically, targeting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) reduces guanine nucleotides and rRNA transcription, leading to reduced protein expression of LEDGF and menin. Consequently, the formation and chromatin binding of the MLL-fusion complex is impaired, reducing the expression of MLL target genes. Inhibition of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis or rRNA transcription further suppresses MLLr AML when combined with a menin inhibitor. Our findings underscore the requirement of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis in maintaining the function of the LEDGF/menin/MLL-fusion complex and provide a rationale to target guanine nucleotide biosynthesis to sensitize MLLr leukemias to menin inhibitors.

With soft mechanical properties and enhanced electromechanical performance, wf-UMP can be robustly worn on curved and dynamic tissue surfaces for easy and effective manipulation. In preclinical studies involving mice, wf-UMP demonstrated notable anticancer effects by inducing tumor cell apoptosis, amplifying oxidative stress, and modulating immune cell proliferation. Furthermore, the synergistic immunotherapy induced by wf-UMP and Anti-PD1 further improved anticancer immunity by activating immunogenic cell death and regulating macrophages polarization, inhibiting distant tumor growth and tumor recurrence.

 Advances in spring phenology (SOS) and increases in terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) are well-documented. However, the impact of an earlier SOS on the duration and rate of carbon uptake (GPPrate) during the early growing season (EGS) remains unclear, leaving the overall influence of these factors on EGS GPP uncertain. Using satellite and carbon flux data across the Northern Hemisphere, we found that an earlier SOS extended EGS, but reduced the mean daily GPPrate during this period, primarily due to lower temperatures and soil-water content. While the extended EGS increased total EGS GPP, the reduction in EGS GPPrate lowered these gains by 30% on average, with a more pronounced reduction in arid regions (~ 85%) compared to humid areas (~ 15%). The diminished contribution of an advanced SOS to early-season productivity suggests that the current increase in carbon uptake in northern ecosystems may be offset by future warming and drought conditions.

 Magnetotelluric investigations can reconstruct features within magmatic systems, such as the distribution of melt and fluid and the volcano-tectonic structures. Here, we use this approach to image the subsurface beneath the active Campi Flegrei caldera, providing new details on the crustal structure down to 20 kilometers.

The magma plumbing system primarily manifests as a low resistivity anomaly located at 8–20 kilometers depth and interpreted as a mid-lower crustal mush zone containing ~10% melt. This zone transitions upwards through a channel-like low resistivity structure containing ~8% of melt and a medium resistivity sector where small lenses of heterogeneously distributed magma accumulate and cool.

 Marine heatwaves can amplify the vulnerabilities of regional marine ecosystems and jeopardise local economies and food resources. Here, we show that marine heatwaves in the tropical Atlantic have increased in frequency, intensity, duration, and spatial extent. Marine heatwaves are 5.1 times more frequent and 4.7 times more intense since the records started in 1982, with the 10 most extreme summers/falls in terms of marine heatwave cumulative intensity and spatial extension occurring in the last two decades. The extreme warming during the summer/fall of 2020 led to the largest bleaching event recorded along the Brazilian coast, with 85% of stony corals and 70% of zoanthids areas bleached in Rio do Fogo. The increase in the severity of the marine heatwaves in the western tropical Atlantic is not accompanied by trends in the strength of the local drivers. This suggests that weaker forcing can lead to more devastating marine heatwaves as the global ocean temperature rises due to climate change.

 Grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and livestock farming. However, carbon storage and the environmental effects of grazing in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau grasslands are not well understood. Here, we utilised the advanced Biome-Biogeochemical Cycles with Multi-layer Soil Module model to evaluate carbon storage and responses to grazing in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau grasslands between 1979 and 2018. The average annual vegetation carbon density and soil organic carbon density were found to be 46.07 ± 7.19 gC/m² and 3,789.79 ± 17.08 gC/m², respectively. Grazing resulted in the loss of 21.63 tg of vegetation carbon, while soil organic carbon loss was 108.83 tg in 2018. Grazing was found to have reduced both vegetation carbon density and soil organic carbon density in most grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The study findings highlight the extent of carbon loss caused by unreasonable grazing practices. Increased unreasonable grazing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has decreased both vegetation carbon density and soil organic carbon density across the grasslands, according to a modelling study of grassland carbon dynamics."

 Decadal climate predictions are crucial for communities engaged in scenario planning under Sustainable Development Goals. However, uncertainties in future precipitation extremes hinder climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. Here we present a hybrid statistical climate-driven time-varying model to predict the Areal MEan Storm Erosivity Index, a key indicator of hydrological events, for the Mediterranean region. By integrating historical data (1884-2022) with large-scale (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and small-scale (precipitation variability) climate forcings, our model captures past storm behavior and projects future dynamics. The Hurst exponent (0.63) suggests a long-term positive memory in Areal MEan Storm Erosivity Index, enhancing prediction accuracy. Projections show an Index increase until 2040, then a decline until 2050, and a resurgence. While consistent with other regional models at the interdecadal scale, finer variations are less pronounced at the interannual scale. This approach offers valuable insights into hydroclimate variability, aiding climate resilience planning in the Mediterranean and beyond.

 Öræfajökull, one of Iceland’s most dangerous volcanoes which last erupted in 1727 and 1362 Common Era, began to show signs of significant unrest between 2017 and 2019. This activity led to a change in the aviation color code, the establishment of evacuation routes, and increased monitoring. The unrest was characterized by pronounced seismic activity, ground swelling, and heightened geothermal phenomena, including melting of ice and increased discharge of geothermal waters. This rare event at Öræfajökull has provided an invaluable and novel opportunity to better understand the internal structure of the volcano and processes responsible for the onset of the unrest. Here, we utilize both seismic tomography and geodetic modelling to locate important volcanic-magmatic features beneath Öræfajökull. Our conceptual model posits three distinct structural zones within the volcano: a geothermally active system at shallow depths, the start of a magma domain/melt zone between ~2 and 6 kilometers depth below-sea-level, and a zone of higher-velocity intrusive rocks below ~6 kilometers below-sea-level. This study establishes a critical baseline for future periods of unrest at Öræfajökull, highlighting the potential for intermittent increased activity over decades in complex, dormant volcanoes before a significant eruption ensues.

 Overallocation of Colorado River water and groundwater alongside multidecadal drought underscore the need to understand water-resource dynamics. Here we assess water-storage variations using satellites, regional modeling, and monitoring to inform future management. Total water storage loss from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites was dominated by Lower Basin declines (80% of total), exceeding Lake Mead capacity by 40%. These Lower Basin storage declines were dominated by groundwater depletion (60% of total), with cumulative depletion hotspots ≤11 m (2002–2023) and subsidence ≤1 m (2010–2024). Regional groundwater modeling shows intensive depletion (1940s–1970s) followed by partial recovery since the early 1980s from irrigation reduction, wet climate cycles (early 1980s–1990s), and Colorado River water transfers to Central Arizona. Managed aquifer recharge and incidental recharge from imported surface-water irrigation led to a 3-m average groundwater-level rise in Central Arizona Active Management Areas (2000–2023). Projected declines in Colorado River water transfers to Central Arizona could lead to further depletion and subsidence. Water transfers from agricultural to municipal/industrial sectors would improve future management. Understanding system dynamics related to climate and human drivers is essential for developing future conjunctive surface-water and groundwater management strategies.

 Rapid urbanization and global climate change are intensifying the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in cities worldwide, with consequences for human health and well-being. Urban green spaces (UGSs) mitigate extreme temperatures, but their cooling potential depends on spatial configuration, size, shape, and distribution. This study fills a geographic gap by providing one of the first detailed analyses of UGSs-Land Surface Temperature (LST) dynamics in a North African context. It combines spatial pattern analysis with temporal trend detection to comprehensively evaluate UGSs-LST relationships in Algiers from 2004 to 2022, addressing a common limitation in the literature where these approaches are often treated separately. Using freely available satellite data and open-source tools—including Landsat data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), QGIS, and RStudio—we integrate supervised classification, landscape metrics (LMs) computation via our custom PyQGIS LMs calculator, and Mann-Kendall trend analysis to quantify the static spatial configuration of green spaces and their dynamic thermal impacts over time. Findings reveal a 38% decrease in green spaces and a 10% reduction in agricultural land, accompanied by increased urbanization. Strong negative correlations between some LMs and LST were observed, with PLAND (Percentage of Landscape) explaining 61% of LST variability at an optimal 600-meter scale. This medium-sized scale differs from previous findings in other regions, highlighting the importance of context-specific analysis. LST trend analysis identified specific heat-resistant zones characterized by large, contiguous green patches. Despite greening initiatives, UGSs in Algiers continue to decline, underlining the need to preserve and strategically expand UGSs to combat rising temperatures."

 Currently, studies show that only 10–30% at best of the organic matter dissolved in cloud water is characterized and sugars are among the compounds still unexplored. Numerous studies on the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) demonstrate their ubiquity, and their incorporation into cloud phase is therefore expected in light of their solubility.In this work, a large array of sugars are measured at low concentration levels with an innovative LC-MSMS technique in 28 cloud water samples collected at the puy de Dôme and their environmental variability is analyzed. The total sugar concentration reaches 4.0 μmol L−1, with an average value of 0.98 ± 0.94 μmol L−1, with no clear seasonal trend. This represents on average 1.2% of dissolved organic carbon but reaches up to 3.7% for one sample.

 The profuse winter rainfall over Taiwan's northern coastal mountain area (NCMA) was investigated and quantified, focusing on the associated daily weather types, for ten winters from November 2010 to February 2021. The dominant rainfall-producing system we identified is the boundary-layer-top clouds associated with the northeasterly monsoon (N-type weather), contributing 43 % to the rainfall and 55.6 % to rainy days. Rainfall from the N-type weather correlated highly with the surface winds, total column water (TCW), and the Oceanic Niño Index. While the rainfall depends linearly on TCW, a cubic dependence is found on the northerly wind speed. The N-type rainfall can be drastically enhanced when an overlaying cloud layer emerges in the lower free troposphere. The Oceanic Niño Index represents a large-scale influence on the East Asian winter monsoon, regulating winds and water vapor of the region. Regional-scale composite analysis substantiated such regional influences, with heavier NCMA rainfall associated with stronger Mongolian/Siberian High and enhanced moisture transport at the lower free troposphere over Taiwan. The NCMA winter rainfall shows significant decadal variation, but no apparent long-term trend can be observed from 1940 to 2023."

 The Qilian Mountains (QM) in northwest China is a key source of orographic cloud formation, significantly influencing regional weather, climate, and hydrological balance. However, due to the sparse distribution of ground-based observational stations, the characteristics of orographic clouds and their associated precipitation remain insufficiently understood. Utilizing FengYun-4A black body temperature (TBB) data from 2018 to 2021 in boral summer, this study investigated the spatial and diurnal characteristics of orographic clouds and associated mechanisms over the QM. Results indicate that orographic clouds primarily form over the mountainous terrain, with deep convective clouds concentrated in the central and eastern QM. A distinct diurnal cycle is observed, with peak cloud activity occurring in the afternoon to early evening (15:00–19:00 local solar time), minimal activity late at night, and the weakest development in the morning. These variations are more pronounced in the central and eastern QM, where cloud formation persists for longer durations, compared to the western region. Three dominant diurnal cloud cycles are identified in the southeast, northeast, and eastern fringes of the western, central, and eastern QM, respectively, along with smaller-scale cycles along mountain ridges. Orographic cloud formation is driven by the convergence of low-level westerlies and the Asian monsoon, with moisture contributions from the westerlies, the Tibetan Plateau, and the monsoon system. Additionally, interactions between solar heating and complex terrain shape the spatial and diurnal distribution of these clouds. These findings enhance our understanding of regional water cycles and provide valuable insights for weather and climate research."

Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the seawater can get transported to the atmosphere and impact cloud formation. However, the sources of characteristics of INPs in the marine areas are poorly understood. We investigated the INPs in seawater from Greenlandic fjords and identified a seasonal variability, with highly active INPs originating from terrestrial sources such as glacial and soil runoff. 
 The accelerated warming of the Arctic manifests in sea ice loss and melting glaciers, significantly altering the dynamics of marine biota. This disruption in marine ecosystems can lead to an increased emission of biological ice-nucleating particles (INPs) from the ocean into the atmosphere. Once airborne, these INPs induce cloud droplet freezing, thereby affecting cloud lifetime and radiative properties. Despite the potential atmospheric impacts of marine INPs, their properties and sources remain poorly understood. By analyzing sea bulk water and the sea surface microlayer in two southwest Greenlandic fjords, collected between June and September 2018, and investigating the INPs along with the microbial communities, we could demonstrate a clear seasonal variation in the number of INPs and a notable input from terrestrial runoff. We found the highest INP concentration in June during the late stage of the phytoplankton bloom and active melting processes causing enhanced terrestrial runoff. These highly active INPs were smaller in size and less heat-sensitive than those found later in the summer and those previously identified in Arctic marine systems. A negative correlation between salinity and INP abundance suggests freshwater input as a source of INPs. Stable oxygen isotope analysis, along with the strong correlation between INPs and the presence of terrestrial and freshwater bacteria such as Aquaspirillum arcticum, Rhodoferax, and Glaciimonas, highlighted meteoric water as the primary origin of the freshwater influx, suggesting that the notably active INPs originate from terrestrial sources such as glacial and soil runoff."

To accurately assess these impacts, we developed a machine learning model to downscale daily climate data to hourly Temperature Humidity Index (THI) values. We utilized historical weather data to train our model and applied them to future climate projections, under two climate scenarios. 
 Climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture, with potential impacts on food security, economic stability, and human livelihoods. Dairy cattle, a crucial component of the livestock sector, are particularly vulnerable to heat stress, which can adversely affect milk production, immune function, and feed intake and, in extreme cases, lead to mortality. The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a widely used metric to quantify the combined effects of temperature and humidity on cattle. However, the THI was previously estimated using daily-level data, which do not capture the daily thermal load and cumulative heat stress, especially during nights when cooling is inadequate. To address this limitation, we developed a machine learning approach to temporally downscale daily climate data to hourly THI values. Utilizing historical ERA5 reanalysis data, we trained an XGBoost model and generated hourly THI datasets for 12 NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate models under two emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) extending to the end of the century. These high-resolution THI data provide an accurate quantification of heat stress in dairy cattle, enabling improved predictions and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on this vital agricultural sector.

 Climate reanalyses are essential for studying climate variability, understanding climate processes, and initializing climate predictions. We present CoRea1860+ (Wang and Counillon, 2025, https://doi.org/10.11582/2025.00009), a 30-member coupled reanalysis spanning from 1860 to the present, produced using the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM) and assimilating sea surface temperature (SST) observations. NorCPM combines the Norwegian Earth System Model with the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation method. SST, available throughout the entire period, serves as the primary source of instrumental oceanic measurements prior to the 1950s. CoRea1860+ belongs to the category of sparse-input reanalyses, designed to minimize artifacts arising from changes in the observation network over time. By exclusively assimilating oceanic data, this reanalysis offers valuable insights into the ocean’s role in driving climate system variability, including its influence on the atmosphere and sea ice. This study first describes the numerical model, SST dataset, and assimilation implementation used to produce CoRea1860+. It then provides a comprehensive evaluation of the reanalysis across four key areas: reliability, ocean variability, sea ice variability, and atmospheric variability, benchmarked against more than ten independent reanalyses and observational datasets. Overall, CoRea1860+ demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in observation-rich periods, and provides a reasonable representation of climate variability. It successfully captures key features such as multidecadal variability and long-term trends in ocean heat content, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and sea ice variability in both hemispheres. Furthermore, CoRea1860+ aligns well with the other datasets for surface air temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure, and 500 hPa geopotential height, especially in the tropics where air-sea interactions are most pronounced."

The results demonstrate that both sites can be modeled with similar parameters and robust performance over a wide range of parameters. The study shows that the model is useful for non-experts and applicable for modeling ecosystems with limited data. It holds promise for evolutionary and deep-time climate models. 
 Trait-based models founded on biophysical principles are becoming popular in planktonic ecological modeling, and justifiably so. They allow for slim, efficient models with a significant reduction in parameters that are well-suited to modeling past and future climate changes. In their idealized forms, trait-based models describe the ecosystem in one set of parameters defined by first principles and rooted in physics, chemistry, geometry, and evolution. The result is an emerging ecosystem defined by physical and chemical limitations at the cell level. At present, however, a significant part of these parameters is not fully constrained, which potentially introduces considerable uncertainty into the model results. Here, we investigate how these parameters influence the ecosystem structure of one of the simplest trait-based models, the Nutrient-Unicellular-Multicellular (NUM) model. We describe the unicellular module of the NUM model and, through an extensive parameter sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the model – with a large span in parameters – can capture the general features of the picoplanktonic, nanoplanktonic, and microplanktonic ecosystem in a high-productivity upwelling system. We demonstrate that it is possible to narrow the range of parameters to get a stable and acceptable solution. Finally, the model responds correctly in an oligotrophic downwelling system using parameters fitted to the upwelling system. Our analysis demonstrates that the unicellular module of the NUM model is broadly accessible without detailed knowledge of the parameter settings and that the first-principles approach is well-suited to modeling poorly resolved regions and ecosystem evolution during current and deep-time climate change."

We performed analyses stratified by child’s sex, coadjusting for maternal or paternal PFAS and other confounders and estimating PFAS mixture effects using quantile g-computation. In male children, multiple maternal PFAS, modeled as individual chemicals or a mixture, were associated with externalizing difficulties. Maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with internalizing difficulties in female children. In contrast, paternal exposure to individual PFAS or PFAS mixture was not associated with behavioral difficulties in children of either sex. In summary, maternal prenatal exposure to PFAS, but not paternal PFAS, was associated with mid-childhood behavioral difficulties in a sex-specific manner. Comparing the parent-specific PFAS associations strengthened evidence against confounding shared in the family."

To evaluate the safety upon acute exposure to OP pesticides, the Dietary Comparator Ratio (DCR) approach was used for the first time for this class of chemicals. Six OPs including chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, methyl parathion, profenofos, and chlorfenvinphos were selected as model compounds. Seventy-four reports of human exposures were collected, and a DCR value at each defined exposure level was calculated with in vitro determined AChE inhibition potency and in silico simulated internal exposures. Results indicate that the DCR outcomes are comparable to the actual knowledge on the presence or absence of in vivo AChE inhibition and adverse effects for the respective exposure scenarios. Of all collected scenarios, only four false positives but no false negatives were obtained. No safety concern on acute neurotoxicity appears to be raised for the evaluated environmental exposure scenarios to OPs. To conclude, the described DCR approach provides an adequate evaluation of the OP-induced adverse outcomes for humans, shedding light on its utility for 3Rs-compliant safety assessment of chemicals with different toxicity mechanisms especially for which in vitro bioassays are available."

Temporal trend analyses (2008–2018) revealed stable levels for most PFAS but an increase in perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), suggesting industrial shifts from long-chain PFAS to short-chain homologues in China since the early 2010s.

Many countries are grappling with significant historical Sb-containing waste, leading to soil contamination, which is of international concern. The lack of clarity on Sb sources and migration mechanisms in soil limits the effective prevention and control of soil pollution. This study utilized Sb stable isotope techniques to analyze soil profiles from two pollution scenarios, with the aims of quantifying Sb sources, understanding migration processes, and elucidating isotopic fractionation mechanisms in soil. The results reveal that surface soil Sb originates primarily from atmospheric dry deposition (31.7–56.3%), wet deposition (19.6–32.7%), and rock weathering (<21.0%). In subsurface soils, Sb mainly comes from solutions resulting from desorption in upper soil layers, with adsorption by iron minerals, manganese (hydr-)oxides, and organic matter impeding its downward movement. Deeper soil layers contain Sb derived from parent rock weathering, with migration impacted by secondary mineral adsorption. Groundwater aids in Sb migration and influences isotopic fractionation during water–soil exchange.

Numerous pollutants are known to disrupt animal behavior, alter ecological interactions, and shift evolutionary trajectories. Crucially, both chemical pollutants and individual organisms are nonrandomly distributed throughout the environment. Despite this fact, the current evidence for chemical-induced impacts on wildlife largely stems from tests that restrict organism movement and force homogeneous exposures. While such approaches have provided pivotal ecotoxicological insights, they overlook the dynamic spatiotemporal interactions that shape wildlife–pollution relationships in nature. Indeed, the seemingly simple notion that pollutants and animals move nonrandomly in the environment creates a complex of dynamic interactions, many of which have never been theoretically modeled or experimentally tested. Here, we conceptualize dynamic interactions between spatiotemporal variation in pollutants and organisms and highlight their ecological and evolutionary implications. We propose a three-pronged approach─integrating in silico modeling, laboratory experiments that allow movement, and field-based tracking of free-ranging animals─to bridge the gap between controlled ecotoxicological studies and real-world wildlife exposures. Advances in telemetry, remote sensing, and computational models provide the necessary tools to quantify these interactions, paving the way for a new era of ecotoxicology that accounts for spatiotemporal complexity."

The GMP primarily varies with GMST, however, change in the low‐latitude land fraction is also important. An increase in land fraction can directly reduce GMP by reducing latent heat and increasing sensible heat. Furthermore, the weakened greenhouse gas effect of the drier atmosphere further amplify the direct impact by approximately 44%.

 Many technological breakthroughs in electronics and photonics were made possible by downscaling—the process of making elementary devices smaller in size1–5. The downsizing of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on III–V semiconductors led to micro-LEDs5–12, an ‘ultimate technology’ for displays. However, micro-LEDs are costly to produce and they exhibit severe efficiency losses when the pixel sizes are reduced to about 10 μm or less, hindering their potential in commercial applications. Here we show the downscaling of an emerging class of LEDs based on perovskite semiconductors to below the conventional size limits. Micro- and nano-perovskite LEDs (micro-PeLEDs/nano-PeLEDs) with characteristic pixel lengths from hundreds of micrometres down to about 90 nm are demonstrated, through a localized contact fabrication scheme that prevents non-radiative losses at the pixel boundaries. For our near-infrared (NIR) and green micro-PeLEDs, average external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) are maintained at around 20% across a wide range of pixel lengths (650 to 3.5 μm), exhibiting minimum performance reduction on downsizing. Our nano-PeLEDs with characteristic pixel lengths down to about 90 nm represent the smallest LEDs reported, enabling a record-high pixel density of 127,000 pixels per inch (PPI) among all classes of LED arrays.

 Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wavefunctions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. By contrast, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), magnetism—manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavours1–7—originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system indicates signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution ΔS ≈ 1 kB per charge carrier that begins at the Curie temperature and survives more than one order of magnitude in temperature. First-order phase transitions show an isospin ‘Pomeranchuk effect’ in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favoured over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid8,9. Our results imply that, despite the itinerant nature of the electron wavefunctions, the spin and valley polarization of individual electrons is decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He (ref. 10). Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite-temperature resistance minimum in the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron–phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat-band systems. Itinerant magnetism in rhombohedral multilayer graphene shows a large excess entropy from magnetic fluctuations above its critical temperature—typically only associated with local moments—which implies the decoupling of charge and isospin degrees of freedom, and results in the isospin Pomeranchuk effect."

Ho,Drivers of avian genomic change revealed by evolutionary rate decomposition,"Genomic evolutionary rates are decomposed to identify the dominant lineages and genes driving rate variation across the phylogeny of birds. 
 Modern birds have diversified into a striking array of forms, behaviours and ecological roles. Analyses of molecular evolutionary rates can reveal the links between genomic and phenotypic change1–4, but disentangling the drivers of rate variation at the whole-genome scale has been difficult. Using comprehensive estimates of traits and evolutionary rates across a family-level phylogeny of birds5,6, we find that genome-wide mutation rates across lineages are predominantly explained by clutch size and generation length, whereas rate variation across genes is driven by the content of guanine and cytosine. Here, to find the subsets of genes and lineages that dominate evolutionary rate variation in birds, we estimated the influence of individual lineages on decomposed axes of gene-specific evolutionary rates. We find that most of the rate variation occurs along recent branches of the tree, associated with present-day families of birds. Additional tests on axes of rate variation show rapid changes in microchromosomes immediately after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene transition. These apparent pulses of evolution are consistent with major changes in the genetic machineries for meiosis, heart performance, and RNA splicing, surveillance and translation, and correlate with the ecological diversity reflected in increased tarsus length. Collectively, our analyses paint a nuanced picture of avian evolution, revealing that the ancestors of the most diverse lineages of birds underwent major genomic changes related to mutation, gene usage and niche expansion in the early Palaeogene period. Genomic evolutionary rates are decomposed to identify the dominant lineages and genes driving rate variation across the phylogeny of birds."

Charru,Widespread slow growth of acquisitive tree species,"Under field conditions, acquisitive tree species generally grow slowly, whereas conservative species show generally higher realized growth, owing to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions. 
 Trees are an important carbon sink as they accumulate biomass through photosynthesis1. Identifying tree species that grow fast is therefore commonly considered to be essential for effective climate change mitigation through forest planting. Although species characteristics are key information for plantation design and forest management, field studies often fail to detect clear relationships between species functional traits and tree growth2. Here, by consolidating four independent datasets and classifying the acquisitive and conservative species based on their functional trait values, we show that acquisitive tree species, which are supposedly fast-growing species, generally grow slowly in field conditions. This discrepancy between the current paradigm and field observations is explained by the interactions with environmental conditions that influence growth. Acquisitive species require moist mild climates and fertile soils, conditions that are generally not met in the field. By contrast, conservative species, which are supposedly slow-growing species, show generally higher realized growth due to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions. In general, conservative tree species grow more steadily than acquisitive tree species in non-tropical forests. We recommend planting acquisitive tree species in areas where they can realize their fast-growing potential. In other regions, where environmental stress is higher, conservative tree species have a larger potential to fix carbon in their biomass. Under field conditions, acquisitive tree species generally grow slowly, whereas conservative species show generally higher realized growth, owing to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions."

 The global spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi presents a serious threat to human health, necessitating the discovery of antifungals with unique modes of action1. However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets2. Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.

 Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8+ T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear1,2. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS–STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS–STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8+ T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.

 Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10−3 per base pair per cell division1. As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions2. Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation.

We demonstrate strong narrowband SPDC with an on-chip rate of 0.8 million pairs per second in Si3N4. Si3N4 is the pre-eminent material for photonic integration and also exhibits the lowest waveguide loss (which is essential for integrated quantum circuits). However, being amorphous, silicon nitride lacks an intrinsic χ(2), which limits its role in photonic quantum devices. We enabled SPDC in Si3N4 by combining strong light-field enhancement inside a high optical Q-factor microcavity with an optically induced space-charge field. We present narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness. The quantum nature of the down-converted photon pairs is verified through coincidence measurements.

 Cortical networks for the production of spoken language in humans are organized by phonetic features1,2, such as articulatory parameters3,4 and vocal pitch5,6. Previous research has failed to find an equivalent forebrain representation in other species7–11. To investigate whether this functional organization is unique to humans, here we performed population recordings in the vocal production circuitry of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), a small parrot that can generate flexible vocal output12–15, including mimicked speech sounds16. Using high-density silicon probes17, we measured the song-related activity of a forebrain region, the central nucleus of the anterior arcopallium (AAC), which directly projects to brainstem phonatory motor neurons18–20. We found that AAC neurons form a functional vocal motor map that reflects the spectral properties of ongoing vocalizations. We did not observe this organizing principle in the corresponding forebrain circuitry of the zebra finch, a songbird capable of more limited vocal learning21. We further demonstrated that the AAC represents the production of distinct vocal features (for example, harmonic structure and broadband energy). Furthermore, we discovered an orderly representation of vocal pitch at the population level, with single neurons systematically selective for different frequency values. Taken together, we have uncovered a functional representation in a vertebrate brain that displays unprecedented commonalities with speech-related motor cortices in humans. This work therefore establishes the parrot as an important animal model for investigating speech motor control and for developing therapeutic solutions for addressing a range of communication disorders22,23.

 Rapid learning confers significant advantages on animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues1–4. This slow learning is thought to be supported by gradual changes to cue representation in the sensory cortex2,5. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest6,7, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance)7. Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable once mice achieve ‘expert’ performance. Instead of enhanced cue representations8, two-photon calcium imaging of auditory cortical neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. A reward-prediction signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors early in training, and faded in expert mice. Silencing at the time of this signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting that it serves an associative role. A distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove slower performance improvements. These ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from sensory representations, indicating higher-order functional segregation within auditory cortex. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex. In mice, learning and performance on an auditory task is driven by higher-order signals in the auditory cortex that are no longer required when the mouse has achieved expert-level performance."

 The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nucleocytoplasmic exchange, catalysing a massive flux of protein and nucleic acid material in both directions1. Distinct trafficking pathways for import and export would be an elegant solution to avoid unproductive collisions and opposing movements. However, the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of macromolecules traversing the NPC remains challenging to visualize on the timescale of millisecond-scale transport events. Here we used 3D MINFLUX2 to identify the nuclear pore scaffold and then to simultaneously monitor both nuclear import and nuclear export, thereby establishing that both transport processes occur in overlapping regions of the central pore. Whereas translocation-arrested import complexes bound at the pore periphery, tracks of translocating complexes within the central pore region revealed a preference for an approximately 40- to 50-nm diameter annulus with minimal circumferential movement, indicating activity-dependent confinement within the permeability barrier. Movement within the pore was approximately 1,000-fold slower than in solution and was interspersed with pauses, indicating a highly restricted environment with structural constraints and/or transient binding events during transport. These results demonstrate that high spatiotemporal precision with reduced photobleaching is a major advantage of MINFLUX tracking, and that the NPC permeability barrier is divided into annular rings with distinct functional properties.

 Hexameric helicases are nucleotide-driven molecular machines that unwind DNA to initiate replication across all domains of life. Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved1: the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis2, we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an ‘entropy switch’, removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery.

 Interfacial water exhibits rich and complex behaviour1, playing an important part in chemistry, biology, geology and engineering. However, there is still much debate on the fundamental properties of water at hydrophobic interfaces, such as orientational ordering, the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide, improper hydrogen bonds and the presence of large electric fields2–5. This controversy arises from the challenges in measuring interfacial systems, even with the most advanced experimental techniques and theoretical approaches available. Here we report on an in-solution, interface-selective Raman spectroscopy method using multivariate curve resolution6,7 to probe hexadecane-in-water emulsions, aided by a monomer-field theoretical model for Raman spectroscopy8. Our results indicate that oil–water emulsion interfaces can exhibit reduced tetrahedral order and weaker hydrogen bonding, along with a substantial population of free hydroxyl groups that experience about 95 cm−1 redshift in their stretching mode compared with planar oil–water interfaces. Given the known electrostatic zeta potential characteristic of oil droplets9, we propose the existence of a strong electric field (about 50–90 MV cm−1) emanating from the oil phase. This field is inferred indirectly but supported by control experiments and theoretical estimates. These observations are either absent or opposite in the molecular hydrophobic interface formed by small solutes or at planar oil–water interfaces. Instead, water structural disorder and enhanced electric fields emerge as unique features of the mesoscale interface in oil–water emulsions, potentially contributing to the accelerated chemical reactivity observed at hydrophobic–water interfaces10–13.

 Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (for example, light-emitting diodes)1,2. In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared emission of confined light–matter excitations called phonon polaritons3,4, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) present hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light–matter coupling5,6. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors7,8. However, as HPhPs are locally confined, they are inaccessible in the far field, and as such, any hint of electroluminescence has been based on indirect electronic signatures and has yet to be confirmed by direct observation. Here we demonstrate far-field mid-infrared (wavelength approximately 6.5 μm) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed by far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy owing to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The resulting radiative flux is quantified by mid-infrared pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is also shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process.

 Phonon polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from the coherent coupling of photons with optical phonons in polar dielectrics1. Owing to their exceptional ability to confine electric fields to deep-subwavelength scales with low loss, they are uniquely poised to enable a suite of applications beyond the reach of conventional photonics, such as subdiffraction imaging2 and near-field energy transfer3–5. The conventional approach to exciting phonon polaritons through optical methods, however, involves costly light sources along with near-field schemes6,7, and generally leads to low excitation efficiency owing to substantial momentum mismatch between phonon polaritons and free-space photons. Here we demonstrate that under proper conditions, phonon polaritons can be excited all-electrically by drifting charge carriers. Specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures, by electrically driving charge carriers in ultrahigh-mobility graphene out of equilibrium, we observe bright electroluminescence of hBN’s hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared frequencies, which shows a temperature and carrier density dependence distinct from black-body thermal emission. Moreover, the carrier density dependence of the HPhP electroluminescence spectra reveals that HPhP electroluminescence can arise from both interband transition and intraband Cherenkov radiation8 of charge carriers in graphene. The HPhP electroluminescence offers avenues for realizing electrically pumped mid-infrared and terahertz phonon-polariton light sources.

Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes. Our study provides a method for spatially resolved mapping of trait-associated cells and demonstrates the gain of biological insights (such as the spatial distribution of trait-relevant cells and related signature genes) through these maps.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a life-threatening malignancy with limited therapeutic options following the failure of second-line treatments1,2. Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity3, offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1–PD-L1-blocking fusion protein4, for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. This provides a new avenue for treatment and advances the field of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapies. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

 Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain is mediated by cation-selective AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)1. AMPARs are critical for the learning and memory mechanisms of Hebbian plasticity2 and glutamatergic synapse homeostasis3, with recent work establishing that AMPAR missense mutations can cause autism and intellectual disability4–7. AMPARs have been grouped into two functionally distinct tetrameric assemblies based on the inclusion or exclusion of the GluA2 subunit that determines Ca2+ permeability through RNA editing8,9. GluA2-containing AMPARs are the most abundant in the central nervous system and considered to be Ca2+ impermeable10. Here we show this is not the case. Contrary to conventional understanding, GluA2-containing AMPARs form a continuum of polyamine-insensitive ion channels with varying degrees of Ca2+ permeability. Their ability to transport Ca2+ is shaped by the subunit composition of AMPAR tetramers as well as the spatial orientation of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins and cornichon auxiliary subunits. Ca2+ crosses the ion-conduction pathway by docking to an extracellular binding site that helps funnel divalent ions into the pore selectivity filter. The dynamic range in Ca2+ permeability, however, arises because auxiliary subunits primarily modify the selectivity filter. Taken together, our work proposes a broader role for AMPARs in Ca2+ signalling in the mammalian brain and offers mechanistic insight into the pathogenic nature of missense mutations.

 Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change.

 Lymphatic capillaries continuously take up interstitial fluid and adapt to resulting changes in vessel calibre1–3. The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)4 maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis5,6, LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell–cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.

 From experimental evolution in the laboratory to sustained measurements of natural selection in the wild, long-term studies have revolutionized our understanding of evolution. By directly investigating evolutionary dynamics in real time, these approaches have provided unparallelled insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern. These approaches can reveal oscillations, stochastic fluctuations and systematic trends that unfold over extended periods, expose critical time lags between environmental shifts and population responses, and illuminate how subtle effects may accumulate into significant evolutionary patterns. Long-term studies can also reveal otherwise cryptic trends that unfold over extended periods, and offer the potential for serendipity: observing rare events that spur new evolutionary hypotheses and research directions. Despite the challenges of conducting long-term research, exacerbated by modern funding landscapes favouring short-term projects, the contributions of long-term studies to evolutionary biology are indispensable. This is particularly true in our rapidly changing, human-dominated world, where such studies offer a crucial window into how environmental changes and altered species interactions shape evolutionary trajectories. In this Review article, we showcase the groundbreaking discoveries of long-term evolutionary studies, underscoring their crucial role in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of evolution across multiple systems and timescales.

 Superconducting (SC) states that break space-group symmetries of the underlying crystal can exhibit nontrivial spatial modulation of the order parameter. Previously, such states were intimately associated with the breaking of translational symmetry1,2, resulting in the density-wave orders3–8, with wavelengths spanning several unit cells9–19. However, a related basic concept has long been overlooked20: when only intra-unit-cell symmetries of the space group are broken, the SC states can show a distinct type of nontrivial modulation preserving long-range lattice translation. Here we refer to this new concept as the pair density modulation (PDM) and report the first observation of a PDM state in exfoliated thin flakes of the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we discover robust SC gap modulation with the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity and the amplitude exceeding 30% of the gap average. Notably, we find that the observed modulation originates from the large difference in SC gaps on the two nominally equivalent iron sublattices. The experimental findings, backed up by model calculations, suggest that, in contrast to the density-wave orders, the PDM state is driven by the interplay of sublattice symmetry breaking and a peculiar nematic distortion specific to the thin flakes. Our results establish new frontiers for exploring the intertwined orders in strong-correlated electronic systems and open a new chapter for iron-based superconductors.

 The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform us about the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, providing insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development1. Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections2 from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic ‘driver’ mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, CTNNB1 and KDM6A. The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.

 Fibrosis, the replacement of healthy tissue with collagen-rich matrix, can occur following injury in almost every organ1,2. Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury3, and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched ‘ECM-secreting’ (Csmd1-expressing) and ‘pro-resolving’ (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial–transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cells and matrix along the fibrotic trajectory in mouse lung identified PI16 as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential for therapeutic application in humans."

 Voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels contain cytoplasmically exposed β-subunits1–5 whose aldo-keto reductase activity6–8 is required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep9. Here we show that Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the KV1 channel Shaker in Drosophila7, forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls10–13, such as 4-oxo-2-nonenal or an endogenous analogue generated by illuminating a membrane-bound photosensitizer9,14, abstract an electron pair. NADP+ remains locked in the active site of KVβ until membrane depolarization permits its release and replacement with NADPH. Sleep-inducing neurons15–17 use this voltage-gated oxidoreductase cycle to encode their recent lipid peroxidation history in the collective binary states of their KVβ subunits; this biochemical memory influences—and is erased by—spike discharges driving sleep. The presence of a lipid peroxidation sensor at the core of homeostatic sleep control16,17 suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep.

 In the course of antibody affinity maturation, germinal centre (GC) B cells mutate their immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in a process known as somatic hypermutation (SHM)1–4. Panels of mutant B cells with different binding affinities for antigens are then selected in a Darwinian manner, which leads to a progressive increase in affinity among the population5. As with any Darwinian process, rare gain-of-fitness mutations must be identified and common loss-of-fitness mutations avoided6. Progressive acquisition of mutations therefore poses a risk during large proliferative bursts7, when GC B cells undergo several cell cycles in the absence of affinity-based selection8–13. Using a combination of in vivo mouse experiments and mathematical modelling, here we show that GCs achieve this balance by strongly suppressing SHM during clonal-burst-type expansion, so that a large fraction of the progeny generated by these bursts does not deviate from their ancestral genotype. Intravital imaging and image-based cell sorting of a mouse strain carrying a reporter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity showed that B cells that are actively undergoing proliferative bursts lack the transient CDK2low ‘G0-like’ phase of the cell cycle in which SHM takes place. We propose a model in which inertially cycling B cells mostly delay SHM until the G0-like phase that follows their final round of division in the GC dark zone, thus maintaining affinity as they clonally expand in the absence of selection. B cell germinal centres achieve a balance between clonal expansion and sequence diversification by suppressing somatic hypermutation during proliferative clonal bursts."

In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build ‘rings’ of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world. A population of neutrophils in the skin produces extracellular matrix, providing a defence strategy by reinforcing the barrier properties of the skin and helping to block the entry of pathogens."

 Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driven by systems orchestrating multiple large language models (LLMs) and other specialized tools, such as search engines and simulators. So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems. TextGrad empowers scientists and engineers to easily develop impactful generative AI systems.

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators involved in multiple biological processes. To achieve their gene repression function, they are loaded in miRNA-specific Argonautes to form the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Mammals and C. elegans possess more than one paralog of miRNA-specific Argonautes, but the dynamic between them remains unclear. Here, we report the conserved dipeptidyl peptidase DPF-3 as an interactor of the miRNA-specific Argonaute ALG-1 in C. elegans. Knockout of dpf-3 increases ALG-2 levels and miRISC formation in alg-1 loss-of-function animals, thereby compensating for ALG-1 loss and rescuing miRNA-related defects observed. DPF-3 can cleave an ALG-2 N-terminal peptide in vitro but does not appear to rely on this catalytic activity to regulate ALG-2 in vivo. This study uncovers the importance of DPF-3 in the miRNA pathway and provides insights into how multiple miRNA Argonautes contribute to achieving proper miRNA-mediated gene regulation in animals.

 Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is crucial for enzyme exploration and modification. Existing models face the problem of either low accuracy or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. In this work, we first developed unbiased datasets to evaluate the actual performance of these methods and proposed a deep learning model, CataPro, based on pre-trained models and molecular fingerprints to predict turnover number (kcat), Michaelis constant (Km), and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Compared with previous baseline models, CataPro demonstrates clearly enhanced accuracy and generalization ability on the unbiased datasets. In a representational enzyme mining project, by combining CataPro with traditional methods, we identified an enzyme (SsCSO) with 19.53 times increased activity compared to the initial enzyme (CSO2) and then successfully engineered it to improve its activity by 3.34 times. This reveals the high potential of CataPro as an effective tool for future enzyme discovery and modification. Enzyme kinetic parameter prediction is a challenge in enzyme discovery and engineering.

It is robust to binding site variability and learns from biochemical properties. 
 Tools available for inferring enzyme function from general sequence, fold, or evolutionary information are generally successful. However, they can lead to misclassification if a deviation in local structural features influences the function. Here, we present TopEC, a 3D graph neural network based on a localized 3D descriptor to learn chemical reactions of enzymes from enzyme structures and predict Enzyme Commission (EC) classes. Using message-passing frameworks, we include distance and angle information to significantly improve the predictive performance for EC classification (F-score: 0.72) compared to regular 2D graph neural networks. We trained networks without fold bias that can classify enzyme structures for a vast functional space (>800 ECs). Our model is robust to uncertainties in binding site locations and similar functions in distinct binding sites. We observe that TopEC networks learn from an interplay between biochemical features and local shape-dependent features. TopEC is available as a repository on GitHub:

 Tetracoordinate boron-based fluorescent materials have shown extensively applications in chemistry, biology and materials science owing to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, constructing chiral boron-stereogenic fluorophores through practical and universal strategies remains rare and challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, we report an enantioselective postfunctionalization of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), to acess boron-stereogenic BODIPYs in moderate to good yields with commendable enantioselectivity.

This method serves as a practical SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction) route to achieve a series of boron-stereogenic amido/amino BODIPYs as well as demonstrates their promising CD and·CPL·activities, excellent biocompatibility, and high specificities, showing potential applications as chiral fluorescent imaging agents.

 The interaction between photons and phonons plays a crucial role in broad areas ranging from optical sources and modulators to quantum transduction and metrology. The performance can be further improved using integrated photonic-phononic devices, promising enhanced interaction strength and large-scale integration. While the enhanced interaction has been widely demonstrated, it is challenging to realize large-scale integrated photonic-phononic circuits due to material limitations. Here, we resolve this critical issue by using gallium nitride on sapphire for scalable photonic-phononic integrated circuits. Both optical and acoustic fields are confined in sub-wavelength scales without suspended structures. This enables us to achieve the efficient launching, flexible routing, and reconfigruable processing of optical and acoustic fields simultaneously. With the controlled photonic-phononic interaction and strong piezoelectric effect, we further demonstrate the reconfigurable conversion between frequency-multiplexed RF and optical signals mediated by acoustics. This work provides an ideal platform for achieving ultimate performance of photonic-phononic hybrid systems with high efficiency, multiple functions, and large scalability.

 The northeast (NE) Pacific has experienced significant marine heatwaves (MHWs) in recent years, commonly known as “warm blobs.” This study examines the impact of Arctic warming, particularly in the Eastern Siberian-Chukchi Sea (ES-CS) region, on the occurrence of these warm blobs during boreal winters. We found that Arctic warming triggers a positive phase of the Tropical/Northern Hemisphere-like (TNH-like) atmospheric circulation, creating a pronounced high-pressure system over the Alaskan region. This system leads to easterly wind anomalies that weaken prevailing westerlies, reducing heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere and cold advection in the upper ocean. Consequently, sea surface temperatures rise, favoring the development of warm blobs. A numerical experiment confirmed that the projected changes in the ES-CS region impact warm blobs occurrences by inducing this high-pressure system, linking Arctic warming to MHWs in the NE Pacific."

 Access to detailed war impact assessments is crucial for humanitarian organizations to assist affected populations effectively. However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in widespread and prolonged conflicts.

 Current frameworks for evaluating biogeochemical climate change feedbacks in Earth System Models lack an explicit consideration of nitrogen cycling in the land and ocean spheres despite its vital role in limiting primary productivity. As coupled carbon-nitrogen cycling becomes the norm, a better understanding of the role of nitrogen cycling is needed. Here we develop a new framework for quantifying carbon-nitrogen feedbacks in Earth System Models and show that rising nitrogen deposition acts as a negative feedback over both land and ocean, enhancing carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation in a model ensemble. However, increased CO2 uptake due to rising nitrogen deposition is small relative to the large reduction in CO2 uptake when coupled carbon-nitrogen cycling is implemented in Earth System Models. Altogether, rising nitrogen deposition leads to only a minor increase in CO2 uptake but also enhances nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions over land and ocean, contributing only marginally to mitigating climate change.

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for climate studies and land surface process models as it indicates ground surface temperature variations across landscapes and timescales. However, satellite-based LST products derived from infrared sensors suffer from substantial missing values due to extensive cloud covers on the Earth’s surface. Traditional methods rely heavily on numerical LST simulations for gap-filling, but the latency significantly limits the timeliness of gapless LST products. In this study, a novel deep learning method called the Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) was proposed, which was based on a U-Net architecture but enhanced with two unique feature extraction modules for capturing spatially and temporally dependent LST variations. Unlike many previous methods depending highly on numerical simulations, STAN reconstructs LST relying on spatiotemporal context information learned from historical memories, enabling more efficient LST reconstruction in a more timely manner. Ground validation results demonstrate better performance of STAN over other companion methods, with root-mean-square errors of 1.99 K and 2.89 K under clear and cloudy sky respectively, when reconstructing LST data collected from the Chinese Fengyun-4A geostationary satellite in the Yangtze River Delta. Intercomparison studies and error analysis also confirm the superiority of STAN, showing high LST reconstruction accuracy across different land covers and seasons. Overall, the proposed STAN method offers a much more efficient solution to facilitate timely LST reconstruction, and the method can also be easily transferred to other parameters with significant spatio-temporal variation context."

 Scholars have documented that perceived safety of the visual built environment (VBE) can influence human behaviors. The dual developments of street view imagery (SVI) and deep learning techniques offer a cost-effective approach to measure perceived safety. However, current SVI-based perception models often lack specific definitions of perceived safety and demographic information when collecting data for model training. Furthermore, these models are rarely validated by onsite perception evaluations, which undermines their credibility.Given these gaps, this study builds a localized crowdsourcing survey to train crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety of the VBE captured by SVIs, and compares model-predicted perceptions with onsite perceptions. This study specifically focuses on their ability to represent onsite perceptions and examines gender differences as a test case in safety perception. This study recruits over 1,800 participants living in the Greater Toronto Area to rate SVIs in terms of crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety.Pearson correlation coefficients reveal a positive but weak correlation between female and male safety perceptions, indicating some consistency while highlighting potential gender differences in safety perceptions. Machine-learning perception models are then trained using this localized SVI survey. Model-predicted perceptions are further validated to assess their alignments with onsite perceptions at sampling locations. The results show that model-predicted perceptions do not exactly match onsite perceptions but align better when less stringent criteria are applied (within ± 1 scale point).In short, this study underscores the necessity of gender inclusivity and a clear definition of safety terms when using SVIs to model perceptions. While SVI-based perception models are cost-effective, the predicted perceptions cannot yet fully substitute onsite perceptions, necessitating broader research to refine the effectiveness."

 Understanding frontal clouds and precipitation is crucial due to its increasing variability and intensity driven by global warming, which impacts agriculture, water resource management, and climate adaptation. Autumn precipitation in Central China is frequently induced by extratropical cyclones, often featuring a frontal cloud system influenced by warm conveyor belt (WCB). In this paper, the detailed microphysical processes of an autumn precipitation event were examined using reconstructed vertical profiles of polarimetric variables, supplemented with numerical simulation to better depict the microphysics evolution in different stages. Results showed that during the initial stage, a strong, inclined updraft and supersaturated layer influenced by WCB, enhanced the formation and depositional growth of ice particles above −10 °C level, then ice particles grew by riming in addition to aggregation in −5–0 °C layer while precipitation particles coalescence and collecting cloud droplets occurred in warm cloud. As the vertical extent of supersaturated layer increased, the intensified process of collecting cloud droplets and vigorous riming process contributed to the maximum surface rainfall intensity. In the weakening stage, ice-phase processes attenuated before the warm cloud processes showed reducing tendencies. This decline is attributed to weakened inclined updraft and supersaturated layer falling below 0 °C level, which impaired the conditions necessary for ice-phase processes. It is concluded that the thermodynamic structure of WCB, namely the vertical extension of inclined updraft and the presence of supersaturated layer, significantly influenced both the ice-phase and liquid-phase microphysical processes of the frontal cloud system as well as the surface precipitation."

 Severe air pollution in urban areas poses a significant threat to residents' health and has raised considerable concerns. The influence of topography on air pollution, particularly in mountainous regions, is substantial. The Sichuan Basin (SCB), known as one of China's most polluted areas, exhibits complex topography that interacts synergistically with weather conditions and anthropogenic emissions to affect air pollution levels. Previous studies have primarily focused on the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on the SCB, while paying less attention to the role of complex terrain within the basin. In this study, an episode was investigated to figure out factors contributing to pollution deterioration prior to dissipation at Hechuan, a city located on the leeward side of parallel ridge-valleys in eastern SCB. Our findings indicate that enhanced vertical advection and suppressed vertical diffusion played dominant roles in pollutant accumulation rather than horizontal transport during the studied episode, which was primarily influenced by the combined effects of airflow crossing parallel valley-ridges and topography. When crossing airflow was weak, cold air concentrated near ground level leading to temperature inversion and weak downdrafts. As the crossing airflow intensified, gravity waves made an array of waves that facilitated downward transport of pollutants. As the crossing airflow further intensified, strong horizontal wind and updraft formed under cyclonic circulation facilitated pollutant dispersion. Considering the synergistic effects of synoptic circulation and topography on vertical dispersion ability at leeside valley-ridges, additional emission control measures are necessary to prevent further deterioration of air pollution prior to dissipation."

 The Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) is a crucial feature of the stratospheric system in winter. The variation in the strength of the Antarctic SPV significantly impacts the weather and climate of the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Although previous studies have provided a good understanding of the variations in the strength of the Antarctic SPV and its associated physical mechanisms, the trend of the Antarctic SPV after 2000 has not received sufficient attention. Here, based on observations and reanalysis data, we find that the middle SPV has a strengthening trend in austral winter during 2000–2022. Our findings indicate that warming SST alter atmospheric convection and planetary wave activity, reducing wavenumber-1 planetary waves into the stratosphere and thereby strengthening the polar vortex. Using idealized sea surface temperature (SST) patch experiments with a climate model, we quantified the specific contributions of SST warming in various regions. Among these, the tropical Atlantic, North Indian Ocean, West Pacific warm pool, and East Pacific contributed 106.86 %, −52.67 %, −40.72 %, and 36.94 %, respectively, to the cooling of the polar vortex from 2000 to 2022.

Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels.

However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicatingDrosophilasalivary gland andBombyxsilk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size.

Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022.

By targeting Thumpd1, a nonessential adapter protein required for Nat10-catalyzed tRNA acetylation, we determine that loss of tRNA acetylation leads to reduced levels of tRNALeu, increased ribosome stalling, and activation of eIF2α phosphorylation. Thumpd1 knockout mice exhibit growth defects and sterility. Concurrent knockout of Thumpd1 and the stress-sensing kinase Gcn2 causes penetrant postnatal lethality in mice, indicating a critical genetic interaction. Our findings demonstrate that a modification restricted to a single position within type II cytosolic tRNAs can regulate ribosome-mediated stress signaling in mammalian organisms, with implications for our understanding of translational control and therapeutic interventions."

This study explores low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) as a resuscitation strategy. Cervical LIPUS stimulation effectively elevated blood pressure in shocked rats. It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment. This method holds potential for improving blood pressure and organ perfusion in shock patients, especially in resource-limited environments."

Here, we developed acid-resistant, gut-environment–responsive composite microparticles based on microfluidic electrospray for the oral codelivery of probiotic [Lactobacillus acidophilus(LA)] biofilm and postbiotics (indole-3-propionic acid). Montmorillonite was selected for supporting biofilm formation due to its cation-exchange capability and clearly defined biosafety. The montmorillonite-LA biofilm was effectively protected by the microparticles and markedly improved the intestinal retention. Upon oral administration, the composite microparticles notably alleviated colitis in mice, including reducing the inflammatory response, improving intestinal barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiota. Consequently, the composite microparticles show high potential for enhancing probiotic delivery efficacy and present a promising strategy for UC treatment."

All members of this subfamily contain a single β-proteobacterial endosymbiont. Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site ofA. deanei.

We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbioticA. deaneithat lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts.

However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction."

Here, we defined the transcriptional regulators and epigenetic circuitry of Galectin-9 in pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), as an example of a disease with strong Galectin-9 expression, in which higher expression was associated with lower overall survival. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression.

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression ofSlLAX2andSlIAA3. The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters ofSlLAX2andSlIAA3, thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants. Our findings reveal a critical role of SlKD1 in modulating the auxin-response gradient and abscission initiation."

We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds).

Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD+levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD+and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction. These findings strongly support targeting PPDPF as a potential therapy for kidney fibrosis, offering possibilities for future CKD interventions."

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials."

Current models depict a global connection between mRNA synthesis and degradation, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that changes in RNA metabolism following depletion of TIP60/KAT5, the acetyltransferase subunit of the NuA4 transcriptional coactivator complex, reveal that transcript buffering occurs at a gene-specific level. By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering. We propose that cells dynamically adjust RNA splicing, export, and degradation in response to individual RNA synthesis alterations, thereby sustaining cellular homeostasis."

To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue.

We analyzed the size-resolved characteristics of hygroscopicity and volatility, the relationship between hygroscopic and volatile properties, and the hygroscopicity of heated submicron aerosols. 
 The hygroscopicity and volatility of submicron ambient aerosol particles with diameters of 50, 80, 110, and 150 nm and the hygroscopicity of their non-volatile cores were measured using a volatility hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (VH-TDMA) system at a relative humidity of 90 % and a thermal denuder temperature of 270 °C from 11 October to 6 November 2023 in Beijing. The mean hygroscopic growth factor (HGF) for particles of 50, 80, 100, and 150 nm diameter was 1.15 ± 0.07, 1.24 ± 0.08, 1.30 ± 0.09, and 1.36 ± 0.10, respectively, while the mean volatile shrink factor (VSF) was 0.51 ± 0.05, 0.55 ± 0.04, 0.56 ± 0.05, and 0.56 ± 0.07, respectively. Both the HGF probability density function (HGF PDF) and the VSF probability density function (VSF PDF) for all selected particle sizes exhibited a pronounced bimodal distribution, indicating that the particles were primarily in an external mixing state. Hygroscopicity was observed to increase with particle size in both clean and pollution periods, while volatility decreased slightly with particle size during the clean period, without an apparent trend during the pollution period. A positive correlation was identified between hygroscopicity and volatility, as well as between the number fraction of nearly hydrophobic (NH) and non-volatile (NV) particles.

An exposure scaling factor is defined, allowing  regional-scale simulations to be corrected to evaluate population exposure. Urban heterogeneities strongly influence NO2, black carbon, and ultrafine particles but less strongly PM2.5. 
 This study focuses on mapping the concentrations of pollutants of interest to health (NO2, black carbon (BC), PM2.5, and particle number concentration (PNC)) down to the street scale to represent the population exposure to outdoor concentrations at residences. Simulations are performed over the area of Greater Paris with the WRF-CHIMERE/MUNICH/SSH-aerosol chain, using either the top-down inventory EMEP or the bottom-up inventory Airparif, with correction of the traffic flow. The concentrations of the pollutants are higher in streets than in the regional-scale urban background, due to the strong influence of road traffic emissions locally. Model-to-observation comparisons were performed at urban background and traffic stations and evaluated using two performance criteria from the literature. For BC, harmonized equivalent BC (eBC) concentrations were estimated from concomitant measurements of eBC and elemental carbon. Using the bottom-up inventory with corrected road traffic flow, the strictest criteria are met for NO2, eBC, PM2.5, and PNC. Using the EMEP top-down inventory, the strictest criteria are also met for NO2, eBC, and PM2.5, but errors tend to be larger than with the bottom-up inventory for NO2, eBC, and PNC. Using the top-down inventory, the concentrations tend to be lower along the streets than those simulated using the bottom-up inventory, especially for NO2 concentrations, resulting in fewer urban heterogeneities. The impact of the size distribution of non-exhaust emissions was analysed at both regional and local scales, and it is higher in heavy-traffic streets. To assess exposure, a French database detailing the number of inhabitants in each building was used. The population-weighted concentration (PWC) was calculated by weighting populations by the outdoor concentrations to which they are exposed at the precise location of their home. An exposure scaling factor (ESF) was determined for each pollutant to estimate the ratio needed to correct urban background concentrations in order to assess exposure. The average ESF in Paris and the Paris ring road is higher than 1 for NO2, eBC, PM2.5, and PNC because the concentrations simulated at the local scale in streets are higher than those modelled at the regional scale. It indicates that the Parisian population exposure is underestimated using regional-scale concentrations. Although this underestimation is low for PM2.5, with an ESF of 1.04, it is very high for NO2 (1.26), eBC (between 1.22 and 1.24), and PNC (1.12). This shows that urban heterogeneities are important to be considered in order to represent the population exposure to NO2, eBC, and PNC but less so for PM2.5."

Measurements in the ionosphere during streamers did not differ from those expected for the given time. 
 For a better understanding of atmospheric dynamics, it is very important to know the general conditions (dynamics and chemistry) of the atmosphere. Planetary waves (PWs) are global-scale waves, which are well-known as main drivers of the large-scale weather patterns in mid-latitudes on timescales from several days up to weeks in the troposphere. When PWs break, they often cut pressure cells off the jet stream. A specific example is so-called streamer events, which occur predominantly in the lower stratosphere at mid-latitudes and high latitudes. For streamer events, we check whether there are any changes in gravity wave (GW) or infrasound characteristics related to these events in ionospheric and surface measurements (continuous Doppler soundings, two arrays of microbarometers) in the Czech Republic.Phenomena in infrasound arrival parameters undoubtedly related to streamer events were not identified in observations of two stations located in Central Europe. Simulations of infrasound propagation show influences of the streamer events on the waveguide formed near the tropopause. Microbarom propagation is influenced by the tropopause waveguide in a limited azimuth sector and at limited distances. Due to the typical occurrence of the streamer events over the North Atlantic, infrasound stations in western Europe can be of particular interest for future studies of streamer event signatures in infrasound arrivals. Arrivals to Central Europe are through the waveguide formed between the ground and the upper stratosphere. The upper-stratosphere waveguide is not influenced by the streamer events.Supplementary ground-based measurements of GW using the WBCI array in the troposphere showed that GW propagation azimuths were more random during streamer and streamer-like events compared to those observed during calm conditions. GW propagation characteristics observed in the ionosphere by continuous Doppler soundings during streamer events did not differ from those expected for the given time period."

In this work, we propose a hierarchical land-cover mapping framework to produce a novel global 10-m land-cover dataset with a fine classification system (called GLC_FCS10) using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series observations from 2023. First, the globally distributed training samples are hierarchically obtained from multisource prior products after applying a series of refinements. Then, a combination of hierarchical land-cover mapping, local adaptive modeling, and multisource features is used to produce land-cover maps for each 5 × 5 geographical tile. Next, using 56121 globally distributed validation samples and a third-party validation dataset (LCMAP_Val), the GLC_FCS10 is assessed. The GLC_FCS10 achieves an overall accuracy of 83.16 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.789 globally and an overall accuracy of 85.09 % in the United States. Meanwhile, comparisons with five released 10- or 30-m land-cover products also demonstrate that GLC_FCS10 has higher accuracy and captures more diverse land-cover information than three of the released global 10-m land-cover products. In summary, the novel GLC_FCS10 land-cover maps can provide important support for high-resolution land-cover related research and applications.

After 7 days of exposure, the B-, CA- and PVP-Fe3O4 NPs decreased the weight of the earthworms, caused oxidative stress and tissue damage. Functional Fe3O4 NPs showed increased accumulation in earthworms while alleviating oxidative stress and homeostatic imbalance by accelerating the activation of related enzymes. Moreover, hyperspectral and pathological observations indicated that CA and PVP modifications effectively alleviated tissue damage caused by Fe3O4 NPs via an improvement in NP biocompatibility, dispersion and stability evidenced by the levels of inositol metabolites, which has been upregulated more significantly by B–Fe3O4 NPs. Significant metabolic disturbances were observed, indicating that functional modifications forced earthworms to adjust amino acid metabolism and consume more energy to detoxify and repair damage.

Concentrations of THs and their TPs present in wastewater effluents ranged from 107 to 435 ng/L. Thus, THs and their TPs discharged from wastewater effluents pose a medium risk to freshwater algae in the receiving waters. Moreover, 4 THs (ametryne, atrazine, terbutryn, and prometryne) and 3 TPs (atrazine-desisopropyl, TP247, and TP258) pose significant risks in several effluents. Considering the persistent and mobile properties and ecological risk of THs and their TPs, these contaminants should be specifically considered in further environmental monitoring and included in the regulation."

In this process, the reaction rate is linked to pollutant properties, and identifying this correlation through descriptors offers insights into reaction mechanisms and water treatment strategies. However, most of the existing descriptors are based on static molecular properties and show limited correlation with reactivity and mechanisms. In this work, we proposed descriptors based on molecular thermodynamic state changes during reactions. The descriptor reflecting the energy change associated with losing two electrons and one proton (ΔE2e1p) proves most effective, exhibiting a strong correlation (R2 = 0.938) with the reaction rate of phenolic and amine pollutants in carbon nanotube/peroxydisulfate system. Multiscale characterizations elucidate the DOTP mechanism in this system, explaining ΔE2e1p’s superior performance and highlighting the critical role of pollutant proton transfer. A comprehensive analysis of the new and existing descriptors reveals the limitations of previous descriptors and the influence of the substrate range on applicability. Additionally, ΔE2e1p demonstrates broad applicability across diverse HCPO systems and practicality in real water matrices. This work provides insights for developing molecular descriptors for catalytic oxidation processes."

Limited knowledge of toxic components’ behaviors in the respiratory system hinders understanding of source-specific risks. This study developed a source apportionment and respiratory mass transfer coupling method to model toxic components’ behaviors and assess health risk. Analysis and modeling of 93 toxic components in nine-stage PM and gas samples from a Chinese megacity, revealed that potential toxic elements from different sources primarily deposited in the pulmonary region (PR) or dissolved in the upper respiratory (UR) and tracheobronchial region (TR) tracts. High-volatility and -solubility organics dissolved readily in UR and TR, while low-volatility and -solubility organics accumulated in PR. Industrial emissions dominated cancer risks across regions (incremental lifetime cancer risk: 1.04 × 10–5 in UR), while coal combustion, industrial emissions, and resuspended dust primarily contributed to noncancer risks. Arsenic from industrial emissions posed significant PR risks due to its accumulation in finer sizes, and traffic-emitted organics showed high pulmonary fractions due to strong absorption by carbonaceous components.

This study investigated the contribution of immigration to the community assembly of different-sized microbial aggregates in a full-scale aerobic granular sludge (AGS) system using genome-resolved metatranscriptomics. Our novel analysis revealed that negative-net-growth-rate populations, which persist due to immigration, can exhibit substantial activity and potentially contribute to the AGS system’s functionality. The results also highlighted that sulfate-reducing and fermenting bacteria, along with some nitrifiers and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs), were more active in the influent wastewater, serving as a continuous source of both beneficial and competing immigrants to the AGS system. Granular sludge (size >0.2 mm) demonstrated a robust capacity to resist immigration effects from competing immigrants, whereas flocculent sludge (size <0.2 mm) was more susceptible. Importantly, flocculent sludge harbored functional microbial groups such as active nitrifiers and fermentative polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) belonging to Ca. Phosphoribacter, while granular sludge enriched for active conventional PAOs such as Ca. Accumulibacter.

PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) such as IsPETase and variants like FAST-PETase demonstrate promising PET depolymerization capabilities at ambient temperatures and can be utilized to recycle and upcycle plastic waste. Whole-cell biocatalysts displaying PHEs on their surface offer high efficiency, reusability, and stability for PET depolymerization. However, their efficacy in fully breaking down PET is hindered by the necessity of two enzymes: PETase and MHETase. Current whole-cell systems either  display only one enzyme or struggle with performance when displaying larger enzymes such as the MHETase–PETase chimera. We developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based whole-cell biocatalyst for complete depolymerization of PET into its constituent monomers with no accumulation of intermediate products. Leveraging a cellulosome-inspired trifunctional protein scaffoldin displayed on the yeast surface, we co-immobilized FAST-PETase and MHETase, forming a multi-enzyme cluster. This whole-cell biocatalyst achieved complete PET depolymerization at 30 °C, yielding 4.95 mM terephthalic acid (TPA) when tested on a PET film. Furthermore, we showed improved PET depolymerization ability by binding FAST-PETase at multiple sites on the scaffoldin. The whole cells had the added advantage of retained activity over multiple reusability cycles. This breakthrough in complete PET depolymerization marks a step toward a circular plastic economy."

This study introduces a nonthermal, solvent-free process for the effective destruction of PFAS on AERs by co-milling piezoelectric boron nitride (BN) powders with contaminated AERs and stainless steel (SS) balls. The approach achieved complete PFOS destruction in two types of AERs (PFA694E and AmberLite IRA 67), with near-quantitative (∼100%) defluorination observed in the treatment of PFA694E AER. Comprehensive targeted PFAS analysis and suspect screening analysis of transformation products (TPs) elucidated the reaction mechanisms and confirmed that the functional groups of AERs did not participate in the reaction. The process’s effectiveness was further validated in treating field-collected single-use AERs (PFA694 and AmberLite PSR2 Plus) contaminated with PFAS mixtures of varying chain lengths and head groups. After treatment, PFAS levels on the AERs were reduced to below the nanogram per gram detection limits, and no PFAS release was observed in standard leaching tests."

The observed PAH concentrations in Nairobi were higher than those reported in cities with more stringent emission controls. Furthermore, the calculated benzo[a]pyrene equivalent in Nairobi’s background atmosphere exceeded 1 ng m–3, signaling a severe health concern.

Using large‐ensemble climate model simulations and Ridge Regression, this study quantifies the changing relative importance of the two drivers from 1861 to 2100. Up until recent years, low September sea ice largely enhanced sea ice growth via a negative feedback, as open water allows more freezing when the water is still cold enough. However, this negative feedback weakens with rising Arctic air and ocean temperatures that increasingly limit and delay sea ice freezing. Atmospheric circulation will relatively play an increasing role in driving sea ice growth in the next few decades.

Petty,Impacts of Terrain Slope and Surface Roughness Variations on Turbulence Generation in the Nighttime Stable Boundary Layer,"Terrain slopes with and without upslope large surface roughness impact downstream shear‐generated turbulence differently in the nighttime stable boundary layer (SBL). These differences can be identified through variations in the relationship between turbulence and wind speed at a given height, known as the HOckey STick (HOST) transition, as compared to the HOST relationship over flat terrain. The transport of cold surface air from elevated uniform terrain reduces downstream air temperature not much air stratification. As terrain slope rises, the increasing cold and heavy air enhances downstream hydrostatic imbalance, resulting in increasing turbulence for a given wind speed. That is, the rate of turbulence increase with wind speed from downslope flow is independent of terrain slope. Upslope large surface roughness elements enhance vertical turbulent mixing, elevating cold surface air from the terrain. Horizontal transport of this elevated, cold, turbulent air layer reduces the downstream upper warm air temperature. Benefiting from the progressive reduction of downstream stable stratification with increasing height in the SBL, wind shear can effectively generate strong turbulence. In addition to the turbulence enhancement from the cold downslope flow, the rate of turbulence increase with wind speed is elevated. This study demonstrates key physical mechanisms for turbulence generation captured by the HOST relationship. It also highlights the influence of terrain features on these mechanisms through deviations from the HOST relationship over flat terrain."

We detected four slow positive radio pulses associated with the first four gamma ray pulses. Another radio pulse candidate associated with the fifth gamma ray pulse was also seen. The polarity of the slow pulses suggests that the TGF were upward directed, and our detectors were observing it backward. This is the first detection of this kind on ground. The radio slow pulses were located in a thunderstorm cell located 3–6 km south from a nearly simultaneously on‐going ascending negative stepped leader emerged in another thunderstorm cell.

We dynamically downscale two contemporary summers, one dry and one moist, relatively to their respective seasonal‐mean specific humidity across AZ. Urban expansion impacts on HS are assessed by performing two identical simulations for each contemporary summer using different land use‐land cover representations: one simulation with the current urban landscape, and one simulation replaces the urban cover with the region's most representative MODIS vegetation type. Climate change impacts on HS are evaluated by performing four additional future simulations, two via dynamical downscaling of relatively dry conditions (one summer under the RCP8.5 and one summer under the RCP4.5 emissions pathways) and two of relatively moist conditions (one summer for each RCP pathway). The selection of future summers is based on their respective seasonal‐mean specific humidity across AZ from an end‐of‐century analysis of 2086–2100. We characterize impacts on HS by examining changes in near‐surface air temperature, Heat Index (HI), and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) across urban areas under dry and moist warm conditions. Our results demonstrate that climate change impacts on HS are not well captured by examining only the projected changes in air temperature and are dependent on the bioclimate index considered. Additionally, we apply a new human heat balance (HHB) approach to evaluate the number of hours per day that an acclimatized and non‐acclimatized person would experience uncompensable HS and compare these results (with the number of hours per day) that we obtain when the HI and UTCI surpass commonly used thresholds considered “dangerous” and of “extreme heat stress”, respectively. The HI and UTCI overestimate the number of hours per day that a healthy, acclimatized person would experience uncompensable HS and underestimate dangerous HS for a non‐acclimatized person under both dry and moist conditions, emphasizing that standard metrics may not produce the most informative physiological estimates of HS."

 The discovery of superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system (the cuprate) in the 30 K range marked a significant breakthrough, which inspired extensive explorations of oxide based layered superconductors to identify electron pairing with higher critical temperatures (Tc)1. Despite recent observations of superconductivity in nickel-oxide-based compounds (the nickelates), evidence of Cooper pairing above 30 K in a system that is isostructural to the cuprates, but without copper, at ambient pressure and without lattice compression, has remained elusive2–5. Here, we report superconductivity with a Tc approaching 40 K under ambient pressure in the d9-x hole-doped, late rare-earth infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO2 thin films with negligible lattice compression, supported by observations of a zero resistance state at 31 K and the Meissner effect. The material can be synthesized with essentially no Ruddlesden–Popper type structural defects, exhibiting ultralow resistivity of ~ 0.01 mΩ∙cm with a residual-resistivity-ratio of up to 10. Our findings demonstrate the potential of achieving high-temperature superconductivity using strongly correlated d-electron metal oxides beyond copper as the building blocks for superconductivity, offering a promising platform for further exploration and understanding of high-temperature Cooper pairing."

 Small modular reactors are the nuclear fission reactors with electric power output less than 300 MWe. To apply the enhanced safety of small modular reactors to build large-scale nuclear plants with any desired power ratings, the multi-modular scheme is recommended to be adopted, where multiple reactor modules are utilized to drive the common load equipment for power generation or cogeneration. The feasibility of multi-modular scheme is not verified until several plant-wide tests were carried out recently on the high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module (HTR-PM) nuclear plant. The HTR-PM plant consists of two inherently safe nuclear reactors of 200 MWt, adopts the scheme of two reactor modules driving a common steam turbine, and operates commercially since December 6, 2023. In this paper, the responses of key process variables of HTR-PM plant in the tests of power ramping, turbine trip and reactor trip are provided, and the related multi-modular coordinated control method is also proposed. This result manifests the feasibility of multi-modular scheme practically, and shows the promising future of building large-scale nuclear plants with a system of small modular reactors.

Here, the author shows that physics-based models for predicting lifetime of lithium-ion batteries must include how degradation modes evolve over lifetime, otherwise the models may be overfitting the experimental data. 
 Predicting lithium-ion battery lifetime remains a critical and challenging issue in battery research right now. Recent years have witnessed a surge in lifetime prediction papers using physics-based, empirical, or data-driven models, most of which have been validated against the remaining capacity (capacity fade) and sometimes resistance (power fade). However, there are many different combinations of degradation mechanisms in lithium-ion batteries that can result in the same patterns of capacity and power fade, making it impossible to find a unique validated solution. Experimentally, degradation mode analysis involving measuring the loss of lithium inventory, loss of active material at both electrodes, and electrode drift/slippage has emerged as a state-of-the-art requirement for cell degradation studies. This work represents the integration of five distinct degradation mechanisms. We show how three models with different levels of complexity can all fit the remaining capacity and resistance well, but only the model with five coupled degradation mechanisms could also fit the degradation modes at three temperatures. This work proves that parameterizing using only capacity and power fade is no longer sufficient, and experimental and modelling degradation studies should include degradation mode analysis for parameterization in the future. Accurately predicting battery lifetime is desirable. Here, the author shows that physics-based models for predicting lifetime of lithium-ion batteries must include how degradation modes evolve over lifetime, otherwise the models may be overfitting the experimental data."

Here, the authors introduce sandwiched hole transport configuration for more balanced carrier transport, achieving efficiency of 26.05%. 
 While individual perovskite and organic solar cells have demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving similar success in high-efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) has been challenging, primarily due to large voltage deficits and severe non-radiative recombination. By exploring the fundamental mechanisms of carrier losses, we identify that imbalanced carrier transport, particularly inadequate hole transport in the organic subcell significantly limits the overall performance of perovskite/organic TSCs. Herein, we implement a hole transport self-assembled monolayer (SAM) anchored to MoO3, which converts the inherently n-type MoO3 to a p-type surface. Further, a SAM/MoO3/SAM sandwich hole transport configuration is introduced, which significantly enhances hole extraction, facilitating a more balanced carrier transport, and markedly suppressing non-radiative recombination at the interconnection layer (ICL). The resulting perovskite/organic TSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, with an open-circuit voltage of 2.21 V (certified at 2.216 V) and enhanced operation stability.

Despite the pivotal roles of cellular metabolism, a comprehensive elucidation of metabolomic heterogeneity in cells and its connection with cellular oxidative and senescent status remains elusive. By integrating single-cell live imaging with mass spectrometry (SCLIMS), we establish a cross-modality technique capturing both metabolome and oxidative level in individual cells. The SCLIMS demonstrates substantial metabolomic heterogeneity among cells with diverse oxidative levels. Furthermore, the single-cell metabolome predicted heterogeneous states of cells. Remarkably, the pre-existing metabolomic heterogeneity determines the divergent cellular fate upon oxidative insult. Supplementation of key metabolites screened by SCLIMS resulted in a reduction in cellular oxidative levels and an extension of C. elegans lifespan. Altogether, SCLIMS represents a potent tool for integrative metabolomics and phenotypic profiling at the single-cell level, offering innovative approaches to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in cellular processes. Integrated analysis of metabolome and oxidative stress at single-cell level is challenging. Here, the authors develop SCLIMS, enabling simultaneous profiling of metabolome and oxidative stress levels and discoveries of key metabolites regulating oxidative stress, senescence, and healthy aging."

Here, the authors report an injectable bioadhesive and lubricating hydrogel, that prevents cartilage wear, provides long-term anti-inflammatory effects, and repairs damaged cartilage for RA therapy. 
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic autoimmune condition accompanied by lubrication dysfunction, inflammatory infiltration, and cartilage wear. Long-term improvements in joint lubrication, inflammation elimination, and worn cartilage repair are crucial for effective RA treatment. Herein, we present an injectable bioadhesive and lubricating hydrogel containing a dopamine-modified hyaluronic acid (DA-HA) network, sulfonated hyaluronic acid (SO3−-HA) network, and kartogenin (KGN)-grafted dopamine-hybridized graphene quantum dot-supported Cu single-atom nanozyme (DAGQD@Cu@KGN SAN) designed to restore cartilage lubrication and repair worn cartilage in RA. DA within the hydrogel networks provides bioadhesion, allowing it to persist in the joint cavity for extended periods. The hydrogel with SO3− group offer lubricity, reducing friction coefficient and alleviating cartilage wear. The DAGQD@Cu@KGN SAN exhibits excellent superoxide dismutase, catalase, and •OH scavenging activities, effectively inhibiting inflammation. KGN is sustainably released from the hydrogel, recruiting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair damaged cartilage by promoting their differentiation into chondrocytes. In vivo experimental results demonstrate that this injectable bioadhesive and lubricating hydrogel not only prevents cartilage wear and tear, providing long-term anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effects in early RA, but also repaired damaged cartilage in late-stage RA. This bio-adhesive and lubricating hydrogel presents a potential full-cycle strategy for RA therapy.

They show that drought delays springtime phenology, primarily through exogenous environmental memory effects, and suggest that future spring advances may be dampened by increasing drought. 
 Global warming has increased the frequency and intensity of droughts, causing large impacts on the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. The direct effect of droughts on autumn senescence is well-documented, but the extent to which the legacy effects influence plant phenology of the following year remains unclear. Using satellite greenness data and long-term in situ observations, we demonstrate that droughts substantially delay the green-up and leaf unfolding of the next spring, particularly following prolonged events with delayed soil moisture recovery. These delays cannot be explained by state-of-the-art phenology models and are strongly linked to postdrought temperature, local climate, drought characteristics and reductions in photosynthesis. Compared to the endogenous memory effects within plants themselves, the exogenous memory effects through changes in environment are five times stronger in drylands and twice as strong in non-drylands. Given projections of increased drought frequency and severity, future advances in spring phenology may be less pronounced than previously anticipated.

 The future of the northern peatland carbon (C) sink is uncertain as the effects of warming on microbial metabolisms are unclear. While increased microbial CO2 emissions are expected under warming, the response of microbial photosynthesis remains unknown, complicating predictions of net microbial effects on peatland carbon emissions. Here, using a continental-scale experimental study, we show that warming amplifies microbial photosynthesis by 3.4 mgC m−2 h−1 per 1 °C increase. By 2100, this increase translates to a gain of 51.1 Tg of carbon per year from the northern peatland area under the pessimistic SSP 5-8.5 climatic change scenario, offsetting ~14% of projected heterotrophic CO2 emissions in northern peatlands. By linking field and microcosm experiments, we further show that enhanced microbial photosynthesis accelerates peatland CO2 uptake as photosynthetic microbial-C subsidies stimulate nutrient mineralization. These results underscore the importance of photosynthetic microbes for mitigating carbon emissions and supporting long-term carbon storage in peatlands.

 Heatwaves pose serious risks to human health and lives, but how their occurrence patterns may change under global warming remains unclear. Here we reveal a systematic westward shift of heatwave hotspots across the northern mid-latitudes around the late 1990s. Both observational analysis and numerical simulation show that this shift is caused by intensified soil moisture–atmosphere coupling (SAC) in eastern Europe, Northeast Asia and western North America under recent background warming. The strengthened SAC shifted the atmospheric high-amplitude Rossby wavenumber-5 pattern westwards to a preferred phase position, which increased the probability of the occurrence of high-pressure ridges over these 3 hotspots by a factor of up to 39. Our results highlight the importance of SAC in shaping heatwave patterns and large-scale atmospheric circulation and challenge the conventional view that the land surface only passively responds to atmospheric forcing. Heatwaves are expected to become more frequent with warming, but how their spatial patterns change is not well understood.

 The imaging features of oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have significant differences due to factors such as marine environment, SAR sensors, oil film thickness and types, which makes it difficult to obtain a generalized model, and the limited number of SAR images obtained from new oil spill events hampers the effective training of deep learning networks. To solve these issues, an enhanced unsupervised domain adaptation with iterative pseudo-label refinement (EUDA-PLR) approach is proposed for inter-event oil spill SAR image segmentation. Specifically, the freely downloaded and collected Sentinel-1 and ERS-1/2 oil spill historical data are used as source domains, respectively, which are migrated to each new oil spill event with limited training samples based on adversarial training to improve the timeliness and accuracy of processing new oil spill events. Subsequently, the target domain is divided more rationally by combining the knowledge of the resolution and polarization mode of the satellite images, the wind speed information of the marine environment, and the computable oil-seawater power ratio. Finally, high-probability oil spill features are stored and updated based on top-K marginal probabilities to improve the completeness of oil spill features in the pseudo-labeling of strong samples in the target domain, and adversarial training is utilized to enhance the ability to extract oil spill features from weak samples in the target domain. EUDA-PLR is applicable to a variety of current mainstream SAR satellites. In the experiments, the source domain data contains the Sentinel-1 dataset from 2014 to 2021 and the ERS-1/2 dataset from 1991 to 2002, and the target domain data contains the GF-3 dataset of an oil spill event in the Bohai Bay region in 2018, the GF-3 and COSMO-SkyMed dataset of an oil spill event in the South China Sea region in 2019, the GF-3 dataset for an oil spill event in the East China Sea region in 2020, and the Radarsat-2 dataset for an oil spill event in the Bohai Bay region in 2021.

 The automated extraction of building facade footprints (BFFs) is a critical task in surveying and remote sensing. Existing methods primarily use mobile laser scanning point cloud as the data source, with limited methods utilizing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. This is mainly because current methods require explicit building extraction and wall detection, and the facade points in ALS point clouds are naturally sparse and prone to incompleteness, leading to insufficient robustness in rule-based wall extraction. To address this challenge, this paper presents an end-to-end method named deep projective prediction (DPP), which directly predicts BFF masks from ALS point clouds, avoiding explicit extraction of buildings and facades, thereby simplifying the BFF extraction process. Meanwhile, we introduce a back-projective attention (BPAtt) module that guides the decoding process while performing differentiable projections, enhancing the model’s sensitivity to projected feature locations. Additionally, a sparse feature completion (SFC) strategy is proposed to alleviate the impact of point cloud sparsity on footprint mask prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the DPP and facilitate relevant future research, an ALS-based BFF dataset is established, which provides more than 3k BFF annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DPP achieves promising results on the BFF extraction task. The BPAtt module and SFC strategy also promote the BFF extraction performance, particularly at the boundaries of footprints."

 Under anthropogenic disturbances and global warming, coral reef ecosystems are degrading, and there is growing concern about the changes in benthic habitats in shallow coral reef waters. As an essential parameter, bottom reflectance can be used to indicate the health of benthic habitats in coral reefs. However, accurately determining bottom reflectance from satellite data remains challenging. This study presents an equation-based analytical method to estimate the bottom reflectance from high-spatial-resolution multispectral images in shallow coral reef waters by establishing two equations independent of bottom type and water depth. With the required parameters estimated from the sampling pixels of the multi-spectral image, the bottom reflectance data for the blue and green bands were derived by solving the two equations without a prior knowledge of bottom types, water properties, and water depths. To evaluate the method, simulated remote-sensing reflectance datasets from various combinations of the water properties, depths, and bottom types were used to derive the bottom reflectance. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the derived bottom reflectance in the blue band were generally <0.02 for most cases, except when the colored dissolved organic matter spectral absorption coefficient at the 440 nm wavelength [aCDOM (440)] was 0.1 m−1 and concentration of chlorophyll (CCHL) was ≥0.5 μg/L. Comparatively, the lower RMSEs in the green band were observed only when aCDOM(440) < 0.05 m−1, concentration of non-algal particles (CNAP) < 0.25 mg/L, and CCHL < 0.5 μg/L. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to the two real satellite multispectral images to derive the bottom reflectance. By visually comparing to the subsurface reflectance images and validating with the field-measured reflectance data, we demonstrated that the satellite derived bottom reflectance in the blue and green bands was accurate in both magnitude and shape by the proposed method. Finally, the impacts of the spatial inhomogeneity of the water properties, purity of sampling pixels for estimating the band ratio of the total diffused attenuation coefficients, and errors in the radiometric correction on the bottom reflectance retrieval were discussed and analyzed."

 Considering the importance of greenspace for the health and life of urban citizens, different levels of greenspace exposure (GE) have received increasing attention. However, the understanding of human travel-related greenspace exposure is still limited, especially the lack of quantitative description of the fine-grained dynamics of greenspace exposure for active travel. Therefore, this study aims to quantify and analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel using dockless bike-sharing data in Beijing. Firstly, this study analysed the spatio-temporal patterns and community structure of bike-sharing travel using graph networks. Second, the daily travel-related greenspace exposure dynamics were estimated using a population-weighted exposure model. Finally, the spatial heterogeneity and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel were assessed. The results show that greenspace exposure is shaped by both human mobility and greenspace distribution. Greenspace exposure is higher during the daytime than the early morning, and there are no significant changes of the average greenspace exposure across weekdays and weekends. In addition, there is an imbalance between greenspace coverage and exposure, with high greenspace coverage not implying high greenspace exposure and vice versa. Areas with lower greenspace coverage (less than 30 %) occurred for more than 80 % of the travels. We also found significant inequality of greenspace exposure during daily travel, with an average Gini index above 0.50. Driven by human mobility, inequality varied over time, with the highest inequality occurring between midnight and early morning, when the Gini index is higher than 0.65. This study provides a detailed understanding of greenspace exposure in active travel modes and may offer valuable insights for urban greenspace planning and health-oriented mobility strategies."

Compared with observation data from other regions, such as Chengdu, summer convective cloud precipitation data in the MER revealed two unique macro- and microstructural characteristics. The internal physical mechanism underlying the influence of the northern slope on summer convective cloud precipitation in the MER is that the extremely high elevation, complex topography, summer South Asian monsoon and intense solar radiation jointly promote the formation of intense thermal vertical motion throughout the troposphere and weak dynamic uplift and poor water vapor conditions in the boundary layer.

Precipitation δ18O and d-excess show significant variability and distinct seasonal patterns, with δ18O values ranging from 1.78 ‰ to −24.51 ‰ and d-excess values from −26.28 ‰ to 39.08 ‰. Temperature is identified as the primary factor influencing precipitation δ18O and d-excess, accounting for 42 % of the monthly δ18O variation and 16 % of the monthly d-excess variation. The Local Meteoric Water Line, δ2H = 6.66δ18O – 3.48, highlights the dry, low-rainfall, and high-evaporation characteristics of the Hunshandake Sandy Land. The backward trajectory calculations reveal that northern China, central China, and Mongolia are the primary sources of moisture absorption, contributing 38.25 %, 26.20 %, and 14.21 % of the moisture to Hunshandake Sandy Land precipitation, respectively. The influence of monsoon climates varies over time, leading to significant variability in the contribution of different moisture source regions to Hunshandake Sandy Land precipitation. Specifically, northern China contributes 36.09 % of the moisture in the wet season and 40.42 % in the dry season, whereas central China contributes 29.39 % in the wet season and 23.02 % in the dry season. The Hunshandake Sandy Land precipitation sample index (IHSL) was defined, and a multiple linear model for monthly precipitation δ18O values was developed using temperature, relative humidity, and IHSL: (δ18O = 0.320 T - 0.068RH + 0.022 IHSL - 11.615). This model can explain 49 % of the monthly precipitation δ18O variability.These findings enhance the understanding of the water cycle in arid and semi-arid regions."

 Extreme precipitation events have recently increased due to global warming, leading to higher humidity and temperatures. Therefore, accurate, updated, and comprehensive precipitation estimations are essential to mitigate the severe losses caused by these extreme events. Satellite precipitation products provide high spatiotemporal resolution and global coverage, enabling improved detection and estimation of precipitation, especially in areas with limited ground observations. This research leverages some of the advanced satellite precipitation products and atmospheric dataset reanalysis available, enhancing the accuracy of precipitation estimates, particularly during heavy and extreme precipitation events. In this work, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and optimization techniques to introduce a two-step methodology for improving satellite-based estimation and detection of heavy and extreme precipitation events. In the first step, feature centroids are integrated into a resampling method to increase the diversity of samples. The second step applies the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to refine categorical evaluation criteria, enhancing prediction accuracy. This study uses the ACO meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, using CNN-based precipitation estimates as input. The performance of the models and products in estimating and detecting heavy and extreme precipitation events is evaluated using various metrics, including Pearson correlation (r) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). The results show that the Ant Colony-optimized MLP (ACO-MLP) outperforms the satellite precipitation products and CNN models in estimating the extreme and heavy precipitation with r = 0.89, 0.82, and KGE = 0.71, 0.65, over the continental area of Australia. The result of utilizing the proposed ACO-MLP and CNN models in Australia showed that the spatial pattern of the extreme precipitation event over the country's east coast on 23 February 2022 is effectively captured. This work contributes to improving water resources management and advancing climate studies, particularly in understanding and addressing extreme precipitation conditions."

We defined the basis of this selectivity using mice in which Tregcells reactive to a single prostate-specific self-peptide were selectively depleted. We found that self-peptide–specific Tregcells were dispensable for the control of Tconvcells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such Tconvcells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the Tregcell response to self-peptide did not affect protective Tconvcell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific Tregcells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling Tconvcells of shared self-specificity."

This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation.

Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior."

Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry."

In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species.

While hazard and exposure are key factors, vulnerability drivers play a crucial role in shaping these outcomes. However, few studies have examined these drivers at a continental scale. This study presents the first dynamic heat vulnerability assessment for Europe, incorporating spatial and temporal dimensions through ordinary least squares regression. Subnational (NUTS2) heatwave mortality data is used as the dependent variable, while independent variables include high-resolution raster data on heat hazard parameters, estimated population exposure, and socio-economic, demographic, and environmental vulnerability factors at both raster and subnational (NUTS2) scales. Our results (adjusted R2 = 0.662) identify foreign citizenship and urbanization as the most influential drivers, with a 1% increase in the percentage of foreign citizens and the size of urban areas associated with a 12.1% and 7.3% rise in heatwave-related mortality, respectively. Based on these findings, we construct the European heat vulnerability index for 2000–2019 as a weighted sum of the identified drivers, using the regression coefficients as weights. The results suggest that foreign citizens may face increased heat vulnerability due to intersecting socioeconomic factors. Policy recommendations include promoting inclusive integration measures to address disparities among foreign populations, and prioritizing sustainable urban planning and nature-based solutions to enhance resilience in rapidly urbanizing areas, ensuring equitable access to green spaces."

Current methods of estimating and predicting residential cooling demand are primarily based on daily temperature, which neglects intraday temperature variations. To determine whether large-scale cooling demand is substantially affected by intraday temperature variations, we conduct a thorough comparison between variable degree days (VDDs) derived from daily temperature data with variable degree hours (VDHs) derived from hourly temperature data during the summer seasons in the United States. The results imply that incorporating intraday variations in temperature will have substantial impacts on cooling estimation and prediction. A comparison of the historical (1990–2014) VDD and VDH calculated from ERA5 temperature data reveals that US summer cooling demand estimated from hourly temperature is 29%–45% higher than those estimated from daily temperature, with differences exceeding 60% when hourly solar radiation is considered. This occurs because the hourly calculations captures the ‘hot hours’ of the mild days. Future scenario analysis, using the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections, indicates that under the medium greenhouse gas emissions pathway (SSP2-45), US summer VDH and VDD are expected to increase by approximately 45% and 100% by the late century (2081–2100). This suggests that, daily-based predictions generally project cooling demand growth at twice the rate of hourly-based predictions, as the daily method accounts for increases in both high and low temperatures regardless of whether they exceed the baseline, while the hourly method, with its finer temporal resolution, includes only temperatures that surpass the baseline. Such effects are seen across most areas of the US. Our analysis underscores the significance of incorporating temperature data at higher temporal resolution in estimating and predicting cooling demand, which is essential for effectively implementing various measures to achieve energy conservation and climate goals."

In Western Europe, weather patterns are strongly influenced by large scale climate systems such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAOi). Recently, however, a new climate index has been developed, called the West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPAi), which may be more relevant for weather in North Western Europe. Recent attempts have tried to link variability in weather patterns as described by hydro-climatic indices and amplifications in the degradation of water quality. However, to our knowledge, no previous work has been undertaken on investigating their effects on suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs). A study was conducted in southwest England using long-term meteorological, monthly NAOi and WEPAi, and 15 min discharge and turbidity datasets collected from an instrumented field and catchment scale monitoring platform. Monthly winter precipitation totals, and air temperature were both found to be significantly positively related to NAOi, but not in the summer. Both variables were significant and more strongly related with the WEPAi for both seasons. Flow weighted mean SSCs calculated for both seasons over a 4 year period were compared to monthly NAOi and WEPAi. In winter months, no significant relationships were found at any scale for NAOi. However, significant positive relationships with the WEPAi were present regardless of catchment size. In the summer months there were no significant relationships with either climate indices. Large-scale climate drivers are important in the sediment responses of agricultural landscapes. An ability to forecast monthly climate scale drivers could enable farmers to better plan for those periods when hydro-sedimentological responses are likely to be elevated. More work is needed across a range of landscape typologies to confirm that the relationships observed hold true more widely."

This motivated the rapid development of trait-based ecological approaches that quantify functional traits of individuals to make inferences about ecological function. Long-term monitoring programs often collect community abundance data annually; yet, to our knowledge, these very different types of datasets have rarely been combined to hindcast shifts in community structure and function. Here, we merge the Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research dataset on benthic communities with a contemporary tropical seaweed trait database to quantify shifts in community function over nearly 20 years and through three distinctly different environmental disturbances. This research was motivated by global shifts on reefs to seaweed domination with unknown shifts in ecosystem functions. Using ordination, we visualized dramatic shifts in community trait space occupancy over time. When comparing mean trait value over time for each trait in each reef type, we describe rapid transitions in the functional ecology of seaweed communities in response to well-documented biotic and abiotic disturbances. A biotic disturbance that killed coral created seaweed communities with traits maximized for resistance to herbivory, while a physical disturbance resulted in a replacement community maximizing resistance to physical disturbance traits. Overall, we document transient shifts in community functional traits in response to shifts in environmental drivers, but also evidence for a stable attractor characterized by tall, less herbivore-resistant communities. Uncovering these shifts in ecological strategies in response to major disturbances demonstrates that combining trait-based approaches with long-term data provides a powerful tool for furthering understanding of how functional changes in communities are driven by environmental change."

Furthermore, changes to the fire regime, including the frequency, severity or seasonality of fire, can reduce resilience and promote persistent changes in ecosystem state. Wet sclerophyll forests are found in potentially dynamic mosaics of rainforest and dry sclerophyll forests and contain species from both these contrasting community types. As such, they create an opportunity to study alternative state theory in which states are mediated by fire regimes. To assess the resilience of wet sclerophyll forests to extreme fire events we specifically asked; do mortality rates and recruitment after fire differ between sclerophyllous and non-sclerophyllous components of wet sclerophyll forests, how do these impacts differ along gradients of fire severity and frequency, and is there evidence of positive fire feedback loops, and if so what levels of fire severity and frequency thresholds influence state shifts towards dry sclerophyll forest? We surveyed all canopy (upper and mid canopy) and grass species, to represent three key plant groups; Eucalyptus trees, non-sclerophyllous trees and grasses. We found strong evidence that fire frequency and severity determined the initial trajectory of wet sclerophyll forest recovery. Key findings showed that extreme fire severity can have significant impacts on non-sclerophyllous tree mortality, with an average of 72% of trees killed, much greater than in Eucalyptus species (mean mortality = 9%). However, our findings also highlighted the importance of analysing past fire regime variables, with sites experiencing 4–5 fires in 60 years also experiencing mortality rates of above 75% for non-sclerophyllous trees. Our results support the conclusion that a long multi-decadal fire-free interval is essential for these recovering wet sclerophyll forests, both to rebuild the resilience of their non-sclerophyllous biota and to reduce the risk of recurrent high severity fires in future."

While the direct effects of biochar on soil properties have been studied to some extent, the overall impact on ecosystem carbon balance remains uncertain, as field and lab studies typically do not account for interactions with vegetation. The LiDELS (LiBry-DETECT Layer Scheme) model offers a process-based approach to assess these soil-vegetation interactions and the potential for carbon sequestration in response to biochar application under diverse environmental conditions. This study presents an overview of the LiDELS model and its application to a sandy soil profile under the climate conditions of northern Germany. LiDELS simulates the impacts of biochar on key soil functions, including water retention, thermal properties, evapotranspiration rates, and net primary production (NPP). Model validation shows strong agreement with observed data for soil moisture, temperature, and CO2 flux, confirming LiDELS’s applicability across varying soil textures, vegetation types, and biochar treatments. Results indicate that biochar application to sandy soil in Hamburg enhances soil water availability by 35%, increases NPP by 6%, raises soil CO2 by 21%, and has no significant impact on soil respiration or soil temperature. LiDELS thus represents a valuable predictive tool for evaluating environmental feedback of biochar in agriculture and carbon management, supporting sustainable land use practices."

Recent satellite observations show TZCF shifting notably northward at a rate of 1.40 degrees per decade from 1998 to 2022, accompanied by a reduction of the chlorophyll concentration in the TZ. Using CMIP6 models with longer data, we find that this northward shift of TZCF is robust and accelerates with increasing warming. The weakening of zonal wind stress under global warming leads to a shallower vertical mixed layer and reduces southward transport via horizontal Ekman. These changes result in decreased nutrients in the upper ocean, ultimately causing a reduction in phytoplankton biomass in the North Pacific TZ and a northward shift of the TZCF. Our findings reveal a significant intervention of anthropogenic warming on marine ecosystems and provides a framework for understanding the linkage between anthropogenic warming and phytoplankton dynamics in the open ocean."

The Third Pole (TP) of the Earth, which serves as a critical water source for two billion people, is also experiencing this decline. However, the interplay between rising temperatures and increasing precipitation in the TP results in complex cryospheric responses, introducing uncertainties in the future budget of TP cryospheric water (including glacier and snow water equivalents and frozen soil moisture). Using a calibrated model that integrated multiple cryospheric-hydrological components and processes, we projected the TP cryospheric water budgets under both low and high climatic forcing scenarios for the period 2021–2100 and assessed the relative impact of temperature and precipitation. Results showed (1) that despite both scenarios involving simultaneous warming and wetting, under low climatic forcing, the total cryospheric budget exhibited positive dynamics (0.017 mm yr−1 with an average of 1.77 mm), primarily driven by increased precipitation. Glacier mass loss gradually declined with the rate of retreat slowing, accompanied by negligible declines in the budget of snow water equivalent and frozen soil moisture. (2) By contrast, high climatic forcing led to negative dynamics in the total cryospheric budget (−0.056 mm yr−1 with an average of −1.08 mm) dominated by warming, with accelerated decreases in the budget of all cryospheric components. These variations were most pronounced in higher-altitude regions, indicating elevation-dependent cryospheric budget dynamics. Overall, our findings present alternative futures for the TP cryosphere, and highlight novel evidence that optimistic cryospheric outcomes may be possible under specific climate scenarios."

Although palm oil production is crucial in the region, the factors driving regional variation in palm oil yield remain unclear, with in-situ evidence indicating that management practices, climatic conditions, stand age, and the presence of peatland are the potential factors. In the current study, the spatiotemporal variation of the actual palm oil yield across Indonesia and Malaysia in the past 20 years was evaluated using national survey data, remote sensing, and machine learning. Our results indicate that 95% of plantations in the region experienced yield increases, with an average rate of 0.14 ± 0.09 ton ha−1 yr−1. Climatic conditions were identified as the primary drivers of yield, followed by management practices (i.e. industrial and smallholder). The optimal temperature for palm oil production is approximately 25 °C, and 93% of the plantation areas exceeded this figure. Meanwhile, precipitation generally enhanced yield, with peatland plantations being more sensitive to precipitation than non-peatland plantations. These findings delineate the key factors influencing palm oil yield variability and provide critical insights for improving management strategies and planning in the world’s largest palm oil-producing regions."

Phenological monitoring allows us to understand the vegetation responses to the effects of climate change. This study examines tropical forest phenology in the Brazilian Amazon using the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), which observes tropical and temperate forests using a self-contained laser altimeter on the International Space Station. The plant area index (PAI) from the GEDI laser product, measured at every 5 m from the ground, was used to create an upper canopy and understory time-series PAI at 2° spatial resolution. Spline algorithms were employed to produce PAI time-series free of time gaps. These data were then utilized to identify the phenological timing of both the upper canopy and understory layers. The results revealed that upper canopy PAI consistently increased during early dry seasons, while understory PAI likely increased due to sunlight that penetrated the upper canopy during its leaf abscission period in the late dry season. The phenological timing within the Brazilian Amazon varied in both space and year.

A global assessment of policy effectiveness across 150 nations, 1990–2020","Industry is the fastest growing sector of carbon dioxide emissions, as well as the single largest source of global greenhouse emissions. Industrial decarbonization policies have therefore emerged as critical components of any attempt to achieve net-zero energy transitions. However, little research has examined the effectiveness of those industrial decarbonization policies. We fill this gap by examining trends in industrial greenhouse gas emissions and whether industrial decarbonization policies (and particular policy instruments) are effective in reducing industrial sector emissions. We use panel data from 150 nations from 1990 to 2020 to examine the effect of industrial decarbonization policy instruments (drawing from an inventory of more than 700 policies across different countries) on industrial greenhouse gas emissions. We find that Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Cuba experienced the largest decreases in industrial emissions, whereas developing countries in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Kuwait experienced the greatest growth in emissions. We also find that industrial decarbonization policy leads to reductions in industrial greenhouse gas emissions, and that these effects are primarily driven by two policy types: (1) payments, finance, and taxation and (2) strategic plans. We also find some (but inconsistent) evidence that (1) regulation, (2) grants, (3) codes and standards, (4) minimum energy performance standards, (5) voluntary approaches, and (6) negotiated agreements (public–private sector) are associated with a reduction in emissions and that (1) payments and transfers, (2) information and education, and (3) targets, plans, and framework legislation may be associated with decreases or increases in emissions. By using dynamic modeling and event study approaches, we observe that the introduction of industrial decarbonization policy has persistent effects well into the future. The effect of each additional policy lasts between 4–19 years, and the effects of payments, finance, and taxation and strategic planning policies last between 4–18 years on average."

One prominent CDR approach is enhanced weathering (EW), in which crushed silicate rock is applied on land or in the open ocean to accelerate natural weathering processes that absorb carbon dioxide from Earth’s ocean–atmosphere system. However, in addition to a range of potential environmental, socioeconomic, and ethical issues associated with this pathway, bottlenecks in feedstock sourcing represent a key barrier for deployment of EW at scale. Here, we evaluate the potential of silicate wastes produced from industrial processes—such as steel slag and cement waste—as feedstocks for the EW process. An empirical model that links industrial alkaline waste production to gross domestic product at purchase power parity is developed to forecast waste production in the alternative futures described by the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) framework. By incorporating these results into an intermediate-complexity Earth system model, we also explore the impacts of EW using industrial waste on changes to global temperature, ocean pH, and ocean aragonite saturation state, while also quantifying overall CDR efficiency through the end of the century. We estimate a maximum cumulative end-of-century capture potential of ∼400 GtCO2 for industrial waste, which could represent a significant fraction of the projected CDR requirement of many mitigation scenarios in the SSP framework. However, feedstock-dependent environmental impacts and the technoeconomics of feedstock redistribution may ultimately limit deployment scope."

 Sedimentary recycling of phosphorus is a key aspect of coastal eutrophication. Here, we present data on benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from the Baltic Sea, an area with a long eutrophication history. The presented dataset contains 499 individual fluxes measured in situ with three types of benthic chamber landers at 59 stations over 20 years, and data cover most of the Baltic Sea sub-basins (Hylén et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14812160). The dataset further contains information about bottom-water dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations, sedimentary organic carbon (OC) content and sediment type. The DIP fluxes differ considerably between basins depending on OC loading and the level of O2 depletion and generally increase from the coast to the central basins. Several stations have been visited on multiple occasions, also at times with different O2 concentrations, which enables investigation of the immediate effects of shifting bottom-water O2 concentrations on the benthic DIP release. The Baltic Sea-wide benthic DIP release is estimated to be 391 – 489 kton y-1 based on a data integration based on sediment type and O2 conditions during three years with varying extents of hypoxia and anoxia (2004, 2013 and 2018). The dataset reveals a lack of flux measurements in winter months, coastal areas and sandy sediments; these should be targeted in future studies. Overall, the data is of high quality and will be important for marine management and studies on mechanisms in benthic phosphorus cycling."

The results further point to food contact material and industrial processing as possible contamination sources. Compared with previous studies of ABFs, NPBFs generally showed higher contamination levels, leading to a higher dietary exposure in a vegan diet scenario. While the adult population is not at immediate risk following NPBF consumption, based on these results, a direct replacement of all ABFs with NPBFs is not recommended.

Atmospheric Hg2+ is the primary source of surface soil Hg (54 ± 13%), followed by atmospheric Hg0 (40 ± 10%) and geogenic Hg. The Hg accumulation in soils increased by a factor of 5 at an accelerating rate from the 1870s to 2010s. The Hg release flux from melting glaciers is 3.51 ± 0.01 μg m–2 yr–1. The highly positive Δ199Hg (1.03 ± 0.49‰) in precipitation due to photoreduction of Hg2+ in water droplets causes all samples in ecosystems to have positive Δ199Hg values.

However, the potential human exposure to contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) through plant accumulation is a significant barrier. Currently, knowledge on CEC contamination of edible produce and effective mitigation strategies for the safe reuse of TWW is limited, particularly under field conditions. This study examined the accumulation of a representative set of CECs, including perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and tire wear particle (TWP) chemicals, in radish, lettuce, and tomato under three irrigation practices: FULL (continuous TWW irrigation), HALF (midseason switch from TWW to FW), and FW-only. Despite low PFAS concentrations (8.1–25.7 ng/L) in TWW, the plant uptake was consistently observed, including in tomato fruits. Alternating TWW with FW significantly reduced CEC accumulation in edible tissues, particularly for compounds with short half-lives, with reductions up to 82.4% even for persistent PFAS. For most CECs and plant species, edible tissue concentrations were similar between the HALF and FW treatments. These findings demonstrate the on-farm applicability of simple irrigation modifications to reduce food contamination and contribute to the promotion of safe reuse of nonconventional waters."

Herein, submicron ZVI particles were phosphatized to produce phosphatized ZVI (P-ZVI), which was employed to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for phenol degradation. As anticipated, phosphatization significantly enhanced both the storage stability (>10 months vs 1 d) and catalytic activity (4.37 vs 0.12 L m–2 h–1) of ZVI compared to unphosphatized counterparts attributed to the formation of a crystalline Fe3P shell on P-ZVI. This Fe3P shell selectively interacts with H2O/O2/PDS, maintaining the stability of P-ZVI under high humidity and oxygen conditions while creating mass transfer channels that enhance reactivity in the presence of PDS. Characterization results from the reaction process demonstrated that the Fe3P shell activated PDS through both direct (via Fe cations) and indirect pathways (through a phosphorus anion-mediated Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle), generating reactive species and facilitating mass transfer between core Fe0 and external PDS for efficient PDS activation and phenol degradation. This study elucidates how constructing an Fe3P shell can realize selective activation of PDS while simultaneously enhancing both the storage and catalytic stabilities of ZVI, thereby boosting the practical application of PDS-based advanced oxidation processes in various environmental remediation."

Previous studies, based on geophysical and xenolith evidence, mainly suggest that MLDs are formed through metamorphic processes and have low strength. This raises the question of how most cratons remain stable with weak MLDs. Using numerical models and theoretical analysis, we show that the spatial distribution of MLDs can influence cratonic behavior during plate motion. Mantle flow can shear the cratonic root along a weak, laterally continuous MLD, leading to cratonic destruction. However, when the MLDs are laterally intermittent and contain several 10's–1,000's km‐wide gaps, especially near the side boundaries, they can generate a viscous coupling that can counterbalance the basal traction force from mantle flow and contribute to stabilizing the cratons."

For both variables, over 60% of extreme events are associated with ETCs over northeastern North America (NNA) regardless of the season. When one type of extreme is observed, the probability that it is a compound wind‐precipitation extreme reaches up to 40% along the coasts and ocean, and about 20% in the NNA region.

Traditionally, trend assessments have been limited to total evaporative demand, overlooking shifts in daily extremes, which are meaningful for agrohydrological outcomes yet largely unknown. Here, using a fully physical metric of evaporative demand, that is, standardized short crop reference evapotranspiration, we introduce the concept of thirstwaves—prolonged periods of extremely high evaporative demand—and analyze their characteristics during 1981–2021 growing seasons for the conterminous US. Findings show that long‐term mean spatial patterns demonstrated by thirstwave characteristics do not follow that of total or mean evaporative demand.

However, projected changes in total consumer biomass from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) global MEM ensemble highlight an uncertain future for the Southern Ocean, indicating the need for a region‐specific ensemble. A large source of model uncertainty originates from the Earth system models used to force FishMIP models, particularly future changes to lower trophic level biomass and sea‐ice coverage. To build confidence in regional MEMs as ecosystem‐based management tools in a changing climate that can better account for uncertainty, we propose the development of a Southern Ocean Marine Ecosystem Model Ensemble (SOMEME) contributing to the FishMIP 2.0 regional model intercomparison initiative. One of the challenges hampering progress of regional MEM ensembles is achieving the balance of global standardised inputs with regional relevance. As a first step, we design a SOMEME simulation protocol, that builds on and extends the existing FishMIP framework, in stages that include: detailed skill assessment of climate forcing variables for Southern Ocean regions, extension of fishing forcing data to include whaling, and new simulations that assess ecological links to sea‐ice processes in an ensemble of candidate regional MEMs. These extensions will help advance assessments of urgently needed climate change impacts on Southern Ocean ecosystems."

Here, we use a flexible and stepwise approach, incorporating high conservation values of biodiversity, carbon and water and their complex interactions, to identify three targeted priority areas at regional and ecological jurisdictions on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We find that 49% of the targeted priority areas could effectively protect about 60% of biodiversity, carbon, and water at the ecoregion scale. However, at the regional scale, 48% of the targeted priority areas have the potential to conserve up to 70% of biodiversity, carbon and water. Although the QTP has achieved the target three of the Kunming‐Montreal GBF (i.e., to protect 30% of areas), more than 75% and 70% of priority areas remain unprotected at the regional and ecoregion scales, respectively. More importantly, over 55% of the unprotected priority areas at the regional scale are under moderate to high human pressure. Our spatially explicit insights demonstrate the importance of expanding existing protected areas on the QTP, while highlighting the potential of targeted conservation initiatives at the subnational level to ensure the Kunming‐Montreal GBF in a more efficient manner."

Blanchard,The Ocean System Pathways (OSPs): A New Scenario and Simulation Framework to Investigate the Future of the World Fisheries,"The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) has dedicated a decade to unraveling the future impacts of climate change on marine animal biomass. FishMIP is now preparing a new simulation protocol to assess the combined effects of both climate and socio‐economic changes on marine fisheries and ecosystems. This protocol will be based on the Ocean System Pathways (OSPs), a new set of socio‐economic scenarios derived from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) widely used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The OSPs extend the SSPs to the economic, governance, management and socio‐cultural contexts of large pelagic, small pelagic, benthic‐demersal and emerging fisheries, as well as mariculture. Comprising qualitative storylines, quantitative model driver pathways and a “plug‐in‐model” framework, the OSPs will enable a heterogeneous suite of ecosystem models to simulate fisheries dynamics in a standardised way. This paper introduces this OSP framework and the simulation protocol that FishMIP will implement to explore future ocean social‐ecological systems holistically, with a focus on critical issues such as climate justice, global food security, equitable fisheries, aquaculture development, fisheries management, and biodiversity conservation. Ultimately, the OSP framework is tailored to contribute to the synthesis work of the IPCC. It also aims to inform ongoing policy processes within the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Finally, it seeks to support the synthesis work of the Intergovernmental Science‐Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), with a particular focus on studying pathways relevant for the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity."

To achieve this, many countries have made net zero greenhouse gas emissions targets, with the aim of halting global warming and stabilizing the climate. Here, we analyze the stability of global and local temperatures in an ensemble of simulations from the zero‐emissions commitment Model Intercomparison Project, where CO2 emissions are abruptly ceased. Our findings show that at both the global and local level stabilization does not occur immediately after net zero CO2 emissions. The multi‐model median (mean) global average temperature stabilizes after approximately 90 (124) years, with an inter‐model range of 64–330 years. However, for some models, this may underestimate the actual time to become stable, as this is the end of the simulation. Seven models exhibited cooling post‐emission cessation, with two of the models then warming after the initial cooling. One model gradually warmed through the entire simulation, while another had alternating cooling and warming. At the local level, responses varied significantly, with many models simulating the reversal of trends in some areas. Changes at the local level, at many locations, continue beyond the stabilization of global temperature and are not stable by the end of the simulations."

A network analysis of annual log‐transformed WNV case numbers (2003–2022) generated four spatially and temporally coherent clusters among 48 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 were the largest groups corresponding to the Central Flyway and the closely associated Eastern Flyway (with an east‐coast subset). Cluster 2 and Cluster 4 corresponded with less‐well defined segments of a distinctly different Western Flyway. Thus, clustering can be explained by migratory pathways of terrestrial birds. We investigated avian involvement in the spread of WNV from potential sources in the southern U.S. Analyses revealed consistent patterns in log‐transformed case numbers of human WNV. This study highlights the significant role of migratory birds in shaping the spatiotemporal patterns of WNV incidence across North America. However, the observed variability in incidence also likely reflects the interplay of other factors including local environmental conditions, mosquito populations, and regional variations in both migratory and non‐migratory bird populations."

 Weather prediction is critical for a range of human activities including transportation, agriculture and industry, as well as the safety of the general public. Machine learning is transforming numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline 1,2,3,4,5,6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialisation and to produce local forecasts, limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skillful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models to be realised. We believe Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude, and enable rapid, affordable creation of customised models for a range of end-users."

 In patients with atrophic age-related macular degeneration, subretinal photovoltaic implant (PRIMA) provided visual acuity up to 20/440, matching its 100 µm pixels size. Next-generation implants with smaller pixels should significantly improve the acuity. This study in rats evaluates removal of a subretinal implant, replacement with a newer device, and the resulting grating acuity in-vivo. Six weeks after the initial implantation with planar and 3-dimensional devices, the retina was re-detached, and the devices were successfully removed. Histology demonstrated a preserved inner nuclear layer. Re-implantation of new devices into the same location demonstrated retinal re-attachment to a new implant. New devices with 22 µm pixels increased the grating acuity from the 100 µm capability of PRIMA implants to 28 µm, reaching the limit of natural resolution in rats. Reimplanted devices exhibited the same stimulation threshold as for the first implantation of the same implants in a control group.

 Heat stress inhibits photosynthesis efficiency, thereby suppressing plant growth and crop yield. However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition is not fully understood. Here, we report that the multiple organellar RNA-editing factor 8 (MORF8) forms condensates with solid-like properties in chloroplasts upon heat stress. In vitro data show that the MORF8 condensation is intrinsically heat-dependent and primarily determined by its IDR (intrinsically disordered region). Purification and characterization of MORF8 condensates show that numerous editing factors including PPR proteins and MORFs are partitioned. We provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that MORF8 condensation inhibits chloroplast RNA editing. In agreement, we find that both heat stress and MORF8 condensation lead to reduced editing of RNAs encoding NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex and impaired NDH activity and photosynthesis efficiency. These findings uncover MORF8 as a putative chloroplastic thermosensor that mediates photosynthesis inhibition by heat and highlight the functional significance of solid material properties of biomolecular condensates. How plants perceive and respond to heat stress via chloroplast is obscure.

 We unravel the response of terrestrial ecosystems in India to Tropical Cyclones (TCs) originating in the North Indian Ocean (NIO). We find that about 34.6% of TCs drove greening and 65.4% caused browning response of vegetation during 2000–2020. TC-induced greening is more likely for TCs originated in pre-monsoon (100%) or monsoon (62.5%) than post-monsoon with large browning response (94%). Rainfall by TCs increases soil moisture (SM) and reduces climatic water deficit (CWD) for a moisture-stressed region, and its effective utilisation by vegetation triggers the greening response. Granger Causality reveals that TC-induced rain and greening response exhibit a maximum temporal lag of 40 days. The favourable vegetation response to TCs is a new insight as it sheds light on the complex Atmosphere-Land-Ocean (ALO) interactions on a regional scale. The findings can aid to improve climate models for better policy decisions aimed at climate adaptation and sustainability on both regional and global scales."

Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5, the surface temperature response to strong El Niño intensifies in North America, northern Africa, Australia and the North Atlantic compared to present day. However, future strong El Niño has a weaker climate impact in southern America and Africa. Temperature extremes under strong El Niño intensify in the future in some regions, with more cool days in eastern North America, while warm days in northern South America decrease. Assuming that the characteristics of strong El Niño events will not change in the future, we distinguish between changes in El Niño teleconnections and background climate changes, and found that the latter dominates the absolute climate response to strong El Niño events."

 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was identified as the dominant factor influencing the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), especially after the mid-1970s when the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) response remarkably strengthened. Here, we find that the influence of ENSO on the EASM has been diminishing since the early 2000s. The EASM in wind anomalies associated with the positive phase of ENSO quickly disintegrates in August, changing from an anticyclone over the western North Pacific (WNPAC) to a cyclone over the western North Pacific (WNP), which exerts significant influence on the East Asia rainfall. These weakened EASM responses are closely linked to the changes in ENSO’s rate of decay around the early 2000s. During 1977–1999, ENSO events peaking in the boreal winter frequently display a gradual decay, triggering robust positive ocean–atmosphere feedback, which extends beyond the TIO and involves the WNP. The resultant North Indian Ocean (NIO) warming develops and persists through the decaying summer, maintaining the WNPAC in August. In contrast, ENSO events exhibit a faster decay during 2000–2022, leading to a weakened ENSO-induced TIO feedback. Additionally, the WNP warms up, accompanied by the collapse of the easterly wind response, contributing to the weak summer peak in the NIO. In turn, the weak NIO warming rapidly decays, which cannot sustain the WNPAC in August. This study emphasizes the crucial role of WNP air–sea coupling in the changing influences of ENSO on the EASM."

 Seasonal climate forecasting is important for societal welfare, as it supports decision-makers in taking proactive steps to mitigate risks from adverse climate conditions or to take advantage of favorable ones. Here, we introduce TelNet, a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model for short-to-medium lead seasonal precipitation forecasting. The model takes past seasonal precipitation values and climate indices to predict an empirical precipitation distribution for every grid point of the target region for the next six overlapping seasons. TelNet has a simple encoder-decoder-head architecture, allowing the model to be trained with a limited amount of data, as is often the case in climate forecasting. Its deterministic and probabilistic performance is thoroughly evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art dynamical and deep learning models in a prominent region for seasonal forecasting studies due to its high climate predictability. The training, validation, and test sets are resampled multiple times to estimate the uncertainty associated with a small dataset. The results show that TelNet ranks among the most accurate and calibrated models across multiple initialization months and lead times, especially during the rainy season when the predictable signal is strongest. Moreover, the model allows instance- and lead-wise forecast interpretation through its variable selection weights.

 Subglacial hydrology plays an important role in controlling glacier behaviour, influencing glacier retreat and the resulting contributions to sea level rise. Here we present a detailed seasonal data set from four soft-bedded temperate glaciers and demonstrate a continuum of subglacial hydrology from channelized to a multichannel distributed behaviour. Our results illustrate how this continuum may be affected by till grain size and subaqueous processes, and we quantify the relative timings of basal sliding and deformation. These different hydrologies have a distinctive seasonal velocity pattern, which although have been identified using a multi-data stream, we suggest can be classified using solely Sentinel-1 satellite-based glacier velocity data. The ability to categorize subglacial glacier hydrology over a much larger data set would allow a better parameterization of subglacial processes for ice sheet models.

 Wildfires exhibit extensive nonlinear characteristics and threshold effects in response to environmental changes. However, how threshold effects affect wildfire responses and their future changes remains unclear. Here we identified thresholds where wildfire-driver relationships shift and estimated the impact of threshold effects on wildfire dynamics in the 21st century in northern mid- and high latitudes (>30°N). Wildfire-driver thresholds, coregulated by gradient differences in heat and moisture conditions, vegetation productivity, and human activities, effectively explain the spatial patterns and uneven responses of wildfires. Despite the dominance of temperature, precipitation, and socioeconomic status on wildfires, 30.70% of wildfire changes are attributed to their threshold effects, notably in boreal and temperate ecosystems. Climate change will enhance the threshold effects of wildfire drivers, leading to a 47.81 ± 3.08% increase in burned areas by 2030–2100 compared with 2001‒2022.

 Infrastructure across the circumpolar Arctic is exposed to permafrost thaw hazards caused by global warming and human activity, creating the risk of damage and economic losses. However, losses are underestimated in existing literature due to incomprehensive infrastructure maps. Here, we mapped infrastructure from 0.5 m resolution satellite imagery of 285 Alaskan communities with a deep learning detection model. Combined with OpenStreetMap, we mapped a statewide Alaskan building footprint of 53 M m2 and a road network of 50,477 km. With deep learning, we expanded the OpenStreetMap building footprint by 47% statewide and 86% on discontinuous and continuous permafrost. Doubling the amount found in existing literature by using our improved map, we estimated that building and road losses due to permafrost thaw could cost Alaska $37B to $51B under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. Finally, we highlight shortcomings in U.S. national risk assessments, which do not account for Alaskan permafrost hazards.

 Machine learning models can predict laboratory earthquakes using Acoustic emission, the lab equivalent of microseismicity, and changes in fault zone elastic properties during the lab seismic cycle. Applying them to natural earthquakes requires testing their generalizability across lab settings and stress conditions.

Our model employs techniques from natural language processing, including decoder techniques, to capture the relationship between AE and fault stress. We fine-tune the regression head of a deep CNN while fixing the decoder’s weights and successfully predict lab seismic events for a range of conditions.

 The artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecast foundation models can infer and generate precise global atmospheric state forecasts on the user’s device and with speed over 10,000 times faster than the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and it is making increasingly significant contributions to geodetic applications represented by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, existing studies on the investigation of these AI models are typically carried out by concentrating on specific one or several meteorological events in certain regions or by comparison with physical models, and the evaluation results obtained in this manner are not comprehensive and universal. Additionally, we find that the results obtained by the foundation models through the “rollout” method for forecasting are not uniform in terms of time and space. This temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of accuracy and accuracy degradation are related to AI algorithms and attributes of training data, etc., but these characteristics have not been thoroughly explored and analyzed. In this study, we obtained the global forecast results of foundation models for 2022 and subsequently derived the GNSS tropospheric delay through numerical integration. We calculated the mean deviation, mean absolute error, and root mean square error of these data. Using these metrics, we analyzed the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity in the accuracy degradation of foundation models, represented by Huawei Cloud Pangu-Weather, Google DeepMind GraphCast, and Shanghai AI Lab FengWu. We evaluated how this inhomogeneity changes with forecast time and identified the best-performing models across different regions and forecast durations. From the results, we find that taking topography into account when training the model enhances its accuracy at high altitudes, and the facilitating influence between the high related atmospheric variables such as precipitation and water vapor. The contributions of this study are twofold: it serves as a valuable reference for geodetic and remote sensing users employing foundational models, and offers insights and case supports for AI practitioners aiming to develop more accurate models for weather forecasting."

An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 84.53% was achieved for overstory mapping for the composition of Vegetation Indices (VIs), Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures, vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) of Sentinel-1, and elevation, integrated with biophysical models. Cropland, urban, non-fuel, and various forest classes, particularly evergreen needle-leaved forests, demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving F1 scores ranging from 83% to 100%.

 High-accuracy digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for remote sensing and geospatial analysis, yet integrating multi-source data over large and complex terrains remains challenging. To address these challenges, this study presents the Multi-source Data Joint Processing (MDJP) framework. This framework establishes a systematic way for correcting DEM errors of varying quality and integrating multi-source data, leveraging deep learning-based calibration and spatially adaptive fusion techniques to enhance DEM accuracy and consistency in large and complex regions. For calibration, our proposed DEM calibration model (DemFormer) combines a lightweight Transformer module with a bagging decision-tree network in a stacking framework, specifically designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of DEM elevation error predictions. For fusion, our DEM fusion model (DemFusion) employs spatial autocorrelation analysis and KD-Tree clustering to compute optimal fusion weights, effectively integrating complementary elevation information from multiple DEM sources. We evaluate the MDJP framework using four widely used global DEMs—Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X), Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D-30 m (AW3D30)—each at 1-arc second (∼30 m) resolution.

 The absence of in situ precipitation data in remote small and medium watersheds (SMWs) highlights the need for reliable satellite precipitation estimations (SPEs). This study evaluates and compares the updated Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) V07 Final Run uncalibrated (V07F-Uncal) and calibrated (V07F-Cal) products against their predecessors (V06F-Uncal and V06F-Cal). The comparison is conducted across 339 SMWs in Chinese humid regions during the summers from 2015 to 2020, using rain gauge observations as benchmarks. Conditional multivariate regression is employed to examine the relationships between satellite precipitation bias values and factors such as precipitation intensity, surface temperature, and fraction of vegetation cover (FVC). Results show that V07F-Uncal outperforms V06F-Uncal in terms of CC and RMSE in most mountainous and coastal SMWs, but it consistently underestimates precipitation, particularly in the mountainous regions. Bias for both V07F-Uncal and V06F-Uncal transitions from positive to increasingly negative values with rising precipitation intensity. V07F-Uncal exhibits a tighter distribution of bias values across all intensity categories compared to V06F-Uncal, but it shows a pronounced negative bias in high-intensity categories. In terms of performance metrics and the distribution of bias values, V06F-Cal demonstrates marked improvements over V06F-Uncal. However, the enhancements observed in V07F-Cal relative to V07F-Uncal are not substantial. As for the variability of bias values associated with changes in precipitation intensity, surface temperature and FVC, the explained bias variability in V07F-Uncal is significantly higher than in V06F-Uncal, averaging approximately 43 % versus 22 %. In western mountainous SMWs, this variability is also greater than in the eastern region (52 % versus 34 %). Precipitation intensity is the primary factor explaining bias variability for both V07F-Uncal and V06F-Uncal, although in specific regions, the bias variability of V06F-Uncal may relate to the surface temperature or its interaction with precipitation intensity. FVC exerts minimal influence (<3 %) on bias variability for both products. This research is crucial for improving the accuracy of SPEs in SMWs, which are vital for flood simulation and disaster adaptation in ungauged SMWs."

 The Indian Lightning Location Network (ILLN), established by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), provides a comprehensive framework for investigating lightning phenomena, thunderstorm dynamics, and associated nowcasting/forecasting methodologies. ILLN is a ground-based lightning location system operating in VLF/LF/HF radio frequency bands, facilitating effective nationwide lightning mitigation strategies. The detection accuracy of ILLN was thoroughly evaluated using a comprehensive approach, including ground-based observations with electric field mills (EFMs) and C-band polarimetric radar, alongside satellite data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and the ISS Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS). The findings reveal that the ILLN exhibits a Relative Detection Efficiency (RDE) of 67.6 % in Pune, 69.4 % in Kohima, and 64.9 % in Rampurhat compared to electric field mill observations, closely aligned during high lightning activity during significant numbers of electric field changes. The average RDE for ILLN with reference to EFM is approximately 60 %, with lower values potentially due to a predominance of intra-cloud (IC) lightning. Lightning flashes detected by ILLN are primarily located within high reflectivity areas detected by GPM and ground radar, concentrated in regions exceeding 30 dBZ. Spatial RDE values concerning ISS ranged from 43 % to 97 %, with quartiles between 55 % and 84 % and median values between 67 % and 85 % across different cases, indicating occasional lower detection of IC lightning by ISS compared to ILLN. Factors such as IC:CG ratios may impact ISS-LIS detection, influencing discrepancies in the spatial pattern between ILLN and ISS over Northwest and Eastern regions. Despite minor regional differences, the overall alignment between ISS and ILLN lightning detections is close. These findings underscore the challenges and reliability of lightning detection methods, highlighting ILLN's consistent performance across diverse scenarios.

 This study investigates the spatial characteristics and prediction of Tropical Cyclone (TC)-induced storm surges at 18 coastal sites along the Guangdong and Hong Kong coasts when TCs are within 800 km of the sites, using the TC best-track datasets and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts datasets from 2009 to 2023. Innovatively, we developed a figure-based statistical model utilizing polar coordinates to determine TC positions relative to specific sites, with shadings denoting historical storm surge values at the site associated with TC intensity, position and size. The model for storm surges at the 18 sites induced by TCs was calibrated with data from 2009 to 2018 and validated with data from 2019 to 2022. Data from 2023 was used to test the model's predictive accuracy. Results show that TC intensity is a significant driver of storm surge, with higher-intensity TCs causing larger surges. Storm surges are influenced by TC azimuth and distance relative to the sites. TCs in the southeast and southwest quadrants, particularly within 600 km, generate more severe surges. Notably, TCs within 0–200 km of the sites, regardless of quadrant, pose the highest risk due to their high intensity around landfall. TC size and SLR also play crucial roles, with larger TCs and higher SLR values (computed using a 60-km radius) leading to larger surges. The figure-based statistical model effectively predicts TC-induced storm surges with minimal computational resources and provides a valuable tool for forecasting future storm surges, supporting disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts along the coast."

The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 inPlasmodium berghei(PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption ofpbsip2resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN4–6GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites."

Here, we systematically investigated the interplay between visual attention and stimulus feature coding by training macaques to perform a free-gaze visual search task with natural stimuli. Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features. Together, our results suggest a complex interplay between visual feature and attention coding in the primate brain, likely driven by interactions between brain areas engaged in these processes."

However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication inHoxC10intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in highHoxCexpression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, andHoxCmisexpression alters feather shapes.

Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment andPark2−/−signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor.

However, the presence of nonuniform geometric effects would be induced to impact the nonuniform geometric distribution of overpotential, leading to impurity dissolution and nonuniform Ti deposition. Here, in situ high-temperature characterizations on the molten salt electrorefining process are applied to establish an anodic dissolution principle for quantitatively evaluating nonuniform geometric effects of electrode. For eliminating the nonuniform geometric effects, coaxial anode-cathode configurations are designed to promote the nonuniform anodic dissolution and nonuniform cathodic deposition. Consequently, the geometric uniformity of titanium products on the cathodes is substantially enhanced, and thus, long-term stable electrorefining process (~12 hours, ~330% increment compared to the electrode of reference configuration) and highly purified titanium products (99.2%) are achieved."

To explore their potential as detectors for ultrabroadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses, we measure the transient optical birefringence the terahertz field induces. Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in <10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy."

The synchronization regions generally broaden monotonically with the strength of the forcing, thereby featuring a tongue-like shape in parameter space, known as Arnold’s tongue. Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions. Our work opens the possibility to study intriguing synchronization dynamics using a simple breathing-soliton laser as a test bed."

However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD+metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD+via unexpected metabolic pathways."

Consequently, specific induction of sensory innervation to mediate immunoregulation becomes a promising therapeutic approach.

Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation.

We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway.

Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids.

To tackle this issue, we developed a novel framework based on maximum entropy production (MEP) theory. By incorporating heat storage effects and refining the Bowen ratio, we enhanced the MEP method's accuracy. This research derives a new long-term global ocean latent heat flux dataset that offers high accuracy, enhancing our understanding of ocean energy dynamics. 
 Ocean evaporation, represented by latent heat flux (LE), plays a crucial role in global precipitation patterns, water cycle dynamics, and energy exchange processes. However, existing bulk methods for quantifying ocean evaporation are associated with considerable uncertainties. The maximum entropy production (MEP) theory provides a novel framework for estimating surface heat fluxes, but its application over ocean surfaces remains largely unvalidated. Given the substantial heat storage capacity of the deep ocean, which can create temporal mismatches between variations in heat fluxes and radiation, it is crucial to account for heat storage when estimating heat fluxes. This study derived global ocean heat fluxes using the MEP theory, incorporating the effects of heat storage and adjustments to the Bowen ratio (the ratio of sensible heat to latent heat).  We utilized multi-source data from seven auxiliary turbulent flux datasets and 129 globally distributed buoy stations to refine and validate the MEP model. The model was first evaluated using observed data from buoy stations, and the Bowen ratio formula that most effectively enhanced the model performance was identified. By incorporating the heat storage effect and adjusting the Bowen ratio within the MEP model, the accuracy of the estimated heat fluxes was significantly improved, achieving an R2 of 0.99 (regression slope: 0.97) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.7 W m−2 compared to observations. The improved MEP method successfully addressed the underestimation of LE and the overestimation of sensible heat by the original model, providing new global estimates of LE at 93 W m−2 and sensible heat at 12 W m−2 for the annual average from 1988–2017. Compared to the 129 buoy stations, the MEP-derived global LE dataset achieved the highest accuracy, with a mean error (ME) of 1.3 W m−2, an RMSE of 15.9 W m−2, and a Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.89, outperforming four major long-term global heat flux datasets, including J-OFURO3, ERA5, MERRA-2, and OAFlux. Analysis of long-term trends revealed a significant increase in global ocean evaporation from 1988–2010 at a rate of 3.58 mm yr−1, followed by a decline at −2.18 mm yr−1 from 2010–2017. This dataset provides a new benchmark for the ocean surface energy budget and is expected to be a valuable resource for studies on global ocean warming, sea surface–atmosphere energy exchange, the water cycle, and climate change.

As a persistent chemical, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is regulated due to a great potential to induce multiple diseases, including renal fibrosis, a major pathological characteristic of CKD. It is hypothesized that sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS), a typical alternative to PFOS, may also induce renal fibrosis. We observed distinct renal fibrosis in mice exposed to OBS. Metabolomics analysis showed that Nα-acetyllysine was the primary metabolite biomarker, whose level decreased greatly due to its excessive consumption by lysyloxidase (LOX). This suppressed the miR-140-5p expression, promoting upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), thereby enhancing proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. Supplement of Nα-acetyllysine upregulated miR-140-5p expression, reduced expressions of FGF9 and FGFR3, and eventually ameliorated  OBS-induced renal fibrosis. Similarly, treatment with miR-140-5p agomir and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002 attenuated OBS-induced renal fibrosis. Taken together, OBS caused renal fibrosis through the LOX–Nα-acetyllysine–miR-140-5p–FGF9–FGFR3–PI3K/Akt–Bad–Bcl-2–fibroblast axis.

This study aims to mitigate alkaline scaling, without pretreatment or antiscalant dosing, by optimizing the ED stack design to restrict divalent cation transport toward the cathode. We evaluated three ED stack configurations, each forming the cathode chamber with a distinct ion transport control mechanism: (1) a monovalent selective cation exchange membrane (SCEM), (2) a bipolar membrane (BPM), and (3) a mediating solution chamber adjacent to the cathode chamber (EDM). Our results indicated that stacks employing the SCEM or BPM partially restricted divalent cation migration but remained vulnerable to scaling under higher feed salinities, due to weakened Donnan exclusion within the SCEM, and strong internal ion polarization at the BPM interface. In contrast, the EDM stack exhibited superior antiscaling performance by combining strong Donnan exclusion through an AEM with ionic buffering in the mediating solution chamber, effectively blocking cation transport and eliminating conditions conducive to scaling. Additionally, the EDM stack maintained low electrical resistance and high operational stability, making it a simple, efficient, and cost-effective solution for scaling mitigation in ED systems."

However, compared to conventional microplastics (MPs), they degrade rapidly into biodegradable microplastics (BMPs), which may lead to a more significant accumulation of BMPs in the environment. This review systematically compares BMPs and MPs, summarizes current knowledge on their environmental behaviors and impacts on ecosystems and human health, and offers recommendations for future research. BMPs are detected in water, sediments, indoor dust, food, marine organisms, and human samples. Compared to MPs, BMPs are more prone to environmental transformations, such as photodegradation and biodegradation, which results in a shorter migration distance across different matrices. Like MPs, BMPs can adsorb pollutants and transport them into organisms, enhancing toxicity and health risks through the Trojan horse effect. Studies indicate that BMPs may negatively impact terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems more than MPs by disrupting nutrient cycling and inhibiting plant and animal growth. In vivo and in vitro research also shows that BMP degradation products increase bioavailability, exacerbating neurotoxicity and overall toxicity.

The current carbon-neutral roadmap for materials generally assumes an uncertain dissemination of innovative production technologies, making the changes in material flows required for a carbon-neutral society unclear. This study introduces three material reduction scenarios and an input–output optimization model to explore material flows in Japan for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 without disseminating innovative technologies. The results indicate that Japanese carbon emissions could reach neutrality by 2050 if the country can manage a yearly material reduction of 4% together with the decarbonization of electricity generation. To achieve this, the material efficiency of consumption must increase nearly 4-fold, and the material circulation rate must be doubled. Achieving such a rapid improvement in material efficiency and circularity is as challenging as the early large-scale deployment of material decarbonization technologies. Therefore, the critical choice in the remaining years is whether to bet heavily on innovative material decarbonization or prioritize technologies and policies accelerating material efficiency."

Cribs consisting of wood, drywall, and plastics were assembled into cubic structures, all with the same mass fraction for each material. Three packing densities and two crib sizes were studied. While a crib burned to completion, the smoke was collected in a fire calorimetry system for the heat release rate (HRR), combustion gases, and smoke measurements. The scale of cribs affected the burn duration and the total heat release, but the packing density had a greater effect on modified combustion efficiency, peak HRR, and the emission factors of CO2, CO, formaldehyde, acrolein, SO2, and total hydrocarbons.

The safety of exposure to pesticides has raised concerns due to their presence in the environment and their potential effects on human health. The ovary is the major female reproductive organ and is considered a potential target organ for pesticide toxicity. This comprehensive Review examines the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on the ovary based on evidence from human biomonitoring, epidemiological studies, and toxicological studies. Epidemiological studies have shown that pesticide exposures are associated with early/delayed menarche, menstrual cycle disorders, early menopause, long time to pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, infertility, and implantation failure in women. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that exposure to pesticides disrupts the estrous cycle, reduces the follicle pool, alters hormone levels, and impairs oocyte maturation. Mechanisms of action of pesticides on ovarian function include effects on steroid receptors, hormone synthesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, epigenetic modifications, and signaling pathways. Gaps in knowledge and further research needs include prospective cohort studies with adequate sample sizes to elucidate the effects of different classes of pesticides (especially emerging insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and mixture exposures on ovarian health, the development of effective toxicological models that can approximate or simulate realistic human exposure scenarios, and the translation of toxicological findings into measurable indicators that can be used in human health risk assessment. In summary, this Review aims to improve the understanding of the risk to women’s reproductive health from exposures to pesticides and to provide insights into strategies for preventing and managing reproductive health risks."

Here, we first report the penetration of near‐inertial energy generated by distinct synoptic wind forcing events using yearlong subsurface mooring data in this region. It is found that approximately half of the near‐inertial energy efficiently penetrates into the deep ocean in wintertime. However, in summertime with a shallow mixed layer, the downward propagating NIWs are constrained to the region of strong near‐surface stratification with the surface warming and residual winter cold water, resulting in the absence of near‐inertial energy below the permanent pycnocline. Meanwhile, the downward propagating NIWs are partially reflected upward due to the abrupt changes in stratification above the dichothermal water. Given the high vertical shear of NIWs, the present work is important for understanding ocean mixing, upward heat transfer, and sea‐ice melting in the subarctic and the broader Arctic."

The observations showed elevated turbulence in the core of the eddy, coincident with regions of low Richardson number (Ri) $(Ri)$. Shear leading to the low Ri $Ri$ was associated with a downward‐propagating near‐inertial wave that appeared to be trapped in the negative vorticity associated with the eddy, as has been found previously. The magnitude of the turbulence production agreed well with the vertical divergence of the vertical energy flux of the wave. The mixing coefficient of the turbulence was near 0.2, which together with the correlation with low Ri $Ri$ suggests that shear instability drives the turbulence. A high shear‐to‐strain ratio of 10.3 was found, as expected for a shear‐dominated near‐inertial wave. Fine‐structure parameterizations using strain only and both shear and strain overestimate the turbulence by factors of 2.7 and 12 respectively."

 What features of transcription can be learnt by fitting mathematical models of gene expression to mRNA count data? Given a suite of models, fitting to data selects an optimal one, thus identifying a probable transcriptional mechanism. Whilst attractive, the utility of this methodology remains unclear. Here, we sample steady-state, single-cell mRNA count distributions from parameters in the physiological range, and show they cannot be used to confidently estimate the number of inactive gene states, i.e. the number of rate-limiting steps in transcriptional initiation. Distributions from over 99% of the parameter space generated using models with 2, 3, or 4 inactive states can be well fit by one with a single inactive state. However, we show that for many minutes following induction, eukaryotic cells show an increase in the mean mRNA count that obeys a power law whose exponent equals the sum of the number of states visited from the initial inactive to the active state and the number of rate-limiting post-transcriptional processing steps. Our study shows that estimation of the exponent from eukaryotic data can be sufficient to determine a lower bound on the total number of regulatory steps in transcription initiation, splicing, and nuclear export.

 The direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to value-added chemicals has garnered considerable interest in recent years. However, achieving high productivity while maintaining high selectivity at an appreciable methane conversion rate remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present photochemically-triggered and photothermally-enhanced oxidative coupling of methane to multi-carbon C2+ alkanes over an Au and CeO2 nanoparticle-decorated ZnO photocatalyst, which exhibits a record-breaking C2+ production rate of 17,260 μmol g−1 h−1 with ~90% C2+ selectivity under wide-spectrum light irradiation without a secondary source of heating. Comprehensive characterizations and computational studies reveal that CH4 activation is a photochemical reaction initiated by ultraviolet light-excited ZnO, and the introduction of CeO2 substantially enhances the activation of CH4 and O2 due to the cooperative interaction between Au and CeO2. Concurrently, Au nanoparticles capture visible and near-infrared light to generate localized heating, which greatly promotes the subsequent desorption of produced methyl radical for C–C coupling prior to undergoing further undesired overoxidation. Achieving both high activity and selectivity in CH4 photooxidation to C2+ hydrocarbons is challenging.

 Personalized synergistic antibacterial agents against diverse bacterial strains are receiving increasing attention in combating antimicrobial resistance. However, the current research has been struggling to strike a balance between strain specificity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. Here, we propose a bacterial cell wall-specific antibacterial strategy based on an in situ engineered nanocomposite consisting of carbon substrate and decorated TiOx dots, termed TiOx@C. The fiber-like carbon substrate of TiOx@C is able to penetrate the bacterial membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), but not that of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) due to its thicker bacterial wall, thus achieving bacterial wall specificity. Furthermore, a series of experiments demonstrate the specific electro-mechanical co-sterilization effect of TiOx@C. On the one hand, TiOx@C can disrupt the electron transport chain and block the energy supply of S. aureus. On the other hand, TiOx@C capable of destroying the membrane structure of P. aeruginosa could cause severe mechanical damage to P. aeruginosa as well as inducing oxidative stress and protein leakage. In vivo experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TiOx@C in eliminating 97% of bacteria in wounds and promoting wound healing in wound-infected female mice. Overall, such a bacterial cell wall-specific nanomedicine presents a promising strategy for non-antibiotic treatments for bacterial diseases.

 As heat pumps become more prevalent in residential buildings, effective performance monitoring is essential.

 The interfacial electron interactions in heterogeneous catalysts are critical in determining the adsorption strengths and configurations of reaction intermediates, which are essential for the efficiency of multistep tandem catalytic processes. Amorphous-crystalline (a-c) heterostructures have garnered significant interest due to their unusual atomic arrangements, adaptable electron configurations, and exceptional stability. Here, we introduce a mesoporous a-c heterojunction catalyst featuring enriched amorphous-crystalline Ni(OH)2/Pt boundaries (ac-Ni(OH)2@m-Pt), designed for efficient acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This catalyst enables electron redistribution at the heterogeneous interface, thereby enhancing both catalytic activity and durability. As anticipated, the ac-Ni(OH)2@m-Pt delivers a high mass activity (MA) of 0.95 A mgPt−1 and maintains good durability (89.8% MA retention) over 15000 cycles. Advanced characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the catalyst’s high performance stems from the dynamic heterogeneous-interface electron redistribution at the a-c interface. This dynamic-cycling electron transfer, driven by the applied potential, promotes O2 activation and accelerates the protonation of *O intermediate during ORR.

 Cerebellar ataxia is the primary manifestation of cerebellar degenerative diseases, and mitochondrial dysfunction in Purkinje cells (PCs) plays a critical role in disease progression. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of mitochondria transplantation as a potential therapeutic approach to rescue cerebellar neurodegeneration and elucidate the associated mechanisms. We constructed a conditional Drp1 knockout model in PCs (PCKO mice), characterized by progressive ataxia. Drp1 knockout resulted in pervasive and progressive apoptosis of PCs and significant activation of surrounding glial cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers mitophagy, is a key pathogenic factor contributing to morphological and functional damage in PCs. Transplanting liver-derived mitochondria into the cerebellum of 1-month-old PCKO mice improved mitochondrial function, reduced mitophagy, delayed apoptosis of PCs, and alleviated cerebellar ataxia for up to 3 weeks.

Here, the authors show that these changes are mediated by cell autonomous TGF-β signaling in microglia, which is developmentally regulated by ITGB8 in radial glia. 
 Microglial diversity arises from the interplay between inherent genetic programs and external environmental signals. However, the mechanisms by which these processes develop and interact within the growing brain are not yet fully understood. Here, we show that radial glia-expressed integrin beta 8 (ITGB8) activates microglia-expressed TGFβ1 to drive microglial development. Domain-restricted deletion of Itgb8 in these progenitors results in regionally restricted and developmentally arrested microglia that persist into adulthood. In the absence of autocrine TGFβ1 signaling, microglia adopt a similar phenotype, leading to neuromotor symptoms almost identical to Itgb8 mutant mice. In contrast, microglia lacking the canonical TGFβ signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3 have a less polarized dysmature phenotype and correspondingly less severe neuromotor dysfunction. Our study describes the spatio-temporal regulation of TGFβ activation and signaling in the brain necessary to promote microglial development, and provides evidence for the adoption of microglial developmental signaling pathways in brain injury or disease.

 Accelerated climate warming has caused the majority of marine-terminating glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere to retreat substantially during the twenty-first century.

 Carbon dioxide removal is crucial for moderating the rapid pace of power sector transformation, while electrification can reduce the emission intensity of the carbon removal process. Here, we use a multisector model to explore the impact of varying levels of CO2 removal (1 to 10 gigatonnes CO2 per year) on the electricity sector by 2050 under 1.5 °C and 2 °C future warming. Our results show that under high CO2 removal pathways, up to 5% of electricity consumption could be dedicated to removing CO2. Limited CO2 removal by 2050 could increase asset stranding costs by US$165-225 billion in fossil-intensive countries like China, the US, and India. Also, a 15% additional mitigation of committed emissions in the power sector would be needed under constrained CO2 removal pathways. While a high CO2 removal future is key to alleviating the burden of power sector transformation, it carries the risk of increased committed emissions. Careful planning is required to balance a less disruptive transformation without compromising climate targets.

 Compound heatwaves (CHWs) pose more severe environmental and socio-economic risks than individual heatwave events, with their frequency increasing rapidly worldwide. In the Arctic, particularly the Barents–Kara Sea (BKS), CHWs are intensifying, accelerating ice melt, permafrost thaw, and ecosystem disruptions. Accurate climate projections require a robust assessment of climate models' ability to simulate these extreme events. This study evaluates the performance of 24 CMIP6 models in reproducing autumn CHW trends in the BKS, revealing substantial intermodel discrepancies in trend magnitudes and spatial patterns. The observed BKS regional CHW trend is 0.55 events per decade. Group A models (e.g., ACCESS-CM2, CanESM5, GFDL-CM4) exhibit smaller errors, with a mean absolute bias of −0.03 events per decade, while Group B models (e.g., FGOALS-g3, GFDL-ESM4, MIROC6) show larger discrepancies, with a mean absolute bias of −0.40 events per decade. Further analysis reveals that Group A models better simulate the enhanced moisture transport from the Atlantic to the BKS, a key driver of CHWs, with smaller deviations in latent heat flux and net longwave radiation. The results highlight the significant role of water vapor in the occurrence of CHWs and suggest that improving the representation of these processes could enhance the accuracy of future Arctic CHW projections. This study underscores the importance of model evaluation for improving climate predictions and understanding the dynamics of extreme heat events in high-latitude regions."

Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes Tregsby inducing hypermethylation at theFoxp3locus. Restoring NAD+with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing Tregsback to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral Tregs, sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD+axis disrupts Tregsmetabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses."

We proposed a specific, noninvasive technique using paramagnetic susceptibility imaging via magnetic resonance imaging to quantify in vivo brain iron levels, aiming to enhance our understanding of epilepsy pathology and improve diagnostic accuracy. Our imaging and histopathological studies demonstrated that paramagnetic susceptibility is a sensitive biomarker for iron quantification in epilepsy. This method effectively detects iron abnormality from various causes and highlights that iron alters within epileptogenic zones, indicating the presence of potentially salvageable tissue. Furthermore, iron accumulation was observed to disrupt cortical laminar structures in epileptogenic zones and was associated with the proliferation of central nervous system cells, particularly astrocytes.

Besides well-known external stimuli like the light–dark cycle and temperature, circadian rhythms can also be modulated by environmental substances. However, this area remains largely underexplored. Here, we developed a robust Pattern Recognition-Driven Prediction Approach (PRD–PA) that enables the identification of circadian-disruptive compounds from large-scale zebrafish transcriptomic profiling. The approach utilizes a circadian gene panel consisting of over 270 Circadian-Indicating Genes (CIGs) with stable and robust periodicity and combines it with a predictive model, known as the Differential Gene Expression Values of an Individual Comparison Model (DGVICM), that can effectively predict internal circadian phases from transcriptomic samples. By analyzing 692 aggregated gene expression profiles across 40 environmental substances, several were identified as having significant circadian-disruptive potential. These include glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone (PRE) and triamcinolone (TRI)), the antithyroid agent propylthiouracil (PTU), and the widely used UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP-3). Both glucocorticoids and PTU are well-documented disruptors of circadian rhythms, and BP-3’s circadian-disrupting properties were validated through experimental exposures. Moreover, BP-3 analogs, including 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) and 2,2’-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-8), were also found to exhibit similar circadian-disruptive effects.

The results indicate that default WRF‐Lake simulations reproduce the seasonal variations of ice phenology dynamics and thermal evolution patterns but exhibit excessively slow under‐ice warming, premature ice‐off, and overestimated sublimation. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements suggest that the typical ice surface z0m ${\mathrm{z}}_{0\mathrm{m}}$ value 1.65×10−4m $\left(1.65\times {10}^{-4}\mathrm{m}\right)$ is approximately one order of magnitude lower than the default value 1×10−3m $\left(1\times {10}^{-3}\mathrm{m}\right)$, causing weaker water warming, reduced sublimation, and earlier ice‐off. Solar radiation transmission considerably enhances under‐ice warming but also advances ice melt. Snowfall accumulation can significantly cool the lake, postpone the ice‐off date, prolong the ice‐covered period, and substantially reduce sublimation.

Different ARDTs have been observed to capture a variety of frequencies, shapes, and sizes of ARs. Due to this, questions have arisen about the underlying phenomena associated with the detected ARs: do all ARDTs detect the same meteorological phenomena? In this paper, we assess eight ARDTs and investigate the underlying synoptic scale phenomena during landfalling ARs along the west coast of North America. We find that during landfalling AR events, prevalent low‐pressure and high‐pressure systems converge and enhance moisture influx toward the landfalling site. We identify that all eight ARDTs identify AR conditions associated with baroclinic waves, with the region of intense integrated vapor transport (IVT) located downstream of the upper level (500 hPa) trough. The magnitude of IVT is enhanced by the strength of the pressure gradients in the confluence region. Although the ARDTs assessed agree on the general phenomena, there are however subtle differences in each ARDT per the clustering analysis we performed.

Results reveal significant variability in TC activity projections between the two modeling approaches, reflecting substantial uncertainties. Fully‐coupled models projected an El Niño‐like sea surface temperature (SST) warming over the equatorial Pacific, while atmosphere‐only models demonstrated a La Niña‐like warming pattern. These contrasting SST responses drive diverse atmospheric circulation anomalies, eventually contributing to distinct TCGF and TCTD changes under climatology and during ENSO phases for future projections. Further detailed analysis reveals that the El Niño‐like or La Niña‐like warming patterns belong to two extreme conditions. It shows a strong spread of simulated SST biases across different models. The accurate projection and simulation of SST magnitudes and ENSO patterns are key to reducing the diverse behaviors of TC activities among these models. We detected three crucial regions, the central Pacific, the subtropical eastern North Pacific, and the equatorial eastern Pacific, that could modulate TC activity in response to ENSO in numerical models.

Here, we present distinct warming patterns emerging by the late 21st century between the first two generations of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM‐LE) and use daily diagnostics to assess associated changes in mid‐latitude circulation. We show that the subsequent versions of CESM represent categorically different storylines of North Atlantic climate change.

In contrast, CESM2‐LE (hereafter LENS2) presents subdued AA, a more pronounced North Atlantic warming hole, and a late‐century climate dominated by upper‐tropospheric tropical warming. Uniquely, in LENS2 during winter, the North Atlantic sector projects less warming in the Arctic than in the mid‐latitude mid‐troposphere.

Here, we primarily analyze the changes in compound hot‐dry events and compound hot‐wet events in China from 1985 to 2019, based on meteorological observations from 686 stations. Then, their contributions to losses in cropland net primary productivity (CNPP) are identified using the extreme gradient boosting and Shapley additive explanations models. Results indicate that compound extreme events have become increasingly frequent, persistent, and severe over the past 35 years. With the increasing risks of compound extreme events, greater CNPP losses are observed in the northern regions compared to the southern regions. Throughout the growing season, CNPP losses caused by compound extreme events initially increase, peak in summer, and then gradually decrease. CNPP losses in China are primarily influenced by compound hot‐dry events. From north to south, the events dominating CNPP losses shift sequentially from compound daytime hot and dry events to compound day‐night hot and dry events, and finally to compound nighttime hot and dry events. This study explores the threats posed by compound extreme events to regional crop production and provides new insights into extreme climate risks in China, supporting climate‐adaptive agricultural development."

Within the framework of climate change, this study treats the rainfall erosion factor as a dynamic factor and examines three types of contrasting precipitation—general, heavy, and extreme—through integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and Geographic Information Systems to reveal differences in water erosion driven by varying intensities of precipitation. The results reveal that over 63% of China's land area has experienced soil erosion during the historical period (1980–2022), with slight erosion being the most common. Severe water erosion is predominantly found in the Southwest Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Yellow River basin. The multi‐year average soil erosion rate in China is estimated at 2.46 t·ha−1 yr−1, with R95P and R99P contributing 26.50% and 7.71%, respectively. Future projections (2023–2100) indicate that soil erosion driven by PRCPTOT, R95P, and R99P could increase by 22%–91% under SSP5‐RCP8.5 and SSP2‐RCP4.5 scenarios. Overall, climate change has a limited effect on the spatial pattern of soil erosion in China, mainly influencing the intensity and extent of water erosion and adversely impacting most regions. Extreme precipitation is more sensitive to climate change, making future erosion risks associated with it a critical concern.

However, the lagged effects of future change in soil moisture on soil C‐N dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we employed the Microbial‐ENzyme Decomposition model to simulate the long‐term impacts of future soil moisture variation on soil C‐N dynamics using the standardized soil moisture index (SSI) across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Our results demonstrated that soil C‐N dynamics exhibited both lagged and cumulative responses to moisture fluctuations over extended periods. Active microbes were closely associated with short‐term (3‐month) change in soil moisture, whereas soil organic C (SOC) and total N (TN) exhibited stronger correlations over extended periods (72 months). Under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario, SOC and TN decreased in wet conditions but increased during droughts, with increases of 28.9% and 13.1%, respectively, under extreme drought conditions. We found that the active microbial biomass was significantly more sensitive to soil moisture variation than total microbial biomass, especially under extreme drought conditions. Furthermore, microbes and enzymes were key drivers of soil C‐N transformations, with soil enzymes displaying the highest correlation with SSI (nonlinear correlation coefficient based on mutual information = 0.81).

 The widespread integration of AI algorithms in healthcare has sparked ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy and fairness. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to learn from a broad spectrum of patient data without directly accessing individual records, enhancing privacy while facilitating knowledge sharing across distributed data sources. However, healthcare institutions face significant variations in access to crucial computing resources, with resource budgets often linked to demographic and socio-economic factors, exacerbating unfairness in participation. While heterogeneous federated learning methods allow healthcare institutions with varying computational capacities to collaborate, they fail to address the performance gap between resource-limited and resource-rich institutions.

This study comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution, trends, and potential flood risks associated with ROS (snow water equivalent (SWE) ≥ 1 mm and rainfall ≥ 1 mm) and ROS flood (SWE ≥ 10 mm and rainfall ≥ 10 mm) events in HMA using SWE and ERA5-Land rainfall data.

The dominant seasons for ROS production were winter at low altitudes, spring at mid-altitudes, and summer at high altitudes. Trend analysis revealed that lower elevations showed a decline in ROS events attributable to reduced SWE; whereas, higher elevations experienced an increase owing to a shift from snowfall to rainfall. ROSflood events significantly accelerated snowmelt (1.27-times faster than non-ROS events, respectively). ROSflood events, though low-frequent, accounted for 2.52% and 1.55% of the total regional rainfall and snowmelt, respectively, with the main flood risk concentrated in mid-altitude regions around 3.0‒4.5 km.

 Forest disturbance regimes are changing across the globe under the influence of climate change and other global change factors, with potentially substantial consequences for tree mortality rates.

 Interactive segmentation of remote sensing images enables the rapid generation of annotated samples, providing training samples for deep learning algorithms and facilitating high-quality extraction and classification for remote sensing objects. However, existing interactive segmentation methods, such as SAM, are primarily designed for natural images and show inefficiencies when applied to remote sensing images. These methods often require multiple interactions to achieve satisfactory labeling results and frequently struggle to obtain precise target boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality one-shot interactive segmentation method (OSISeg) based on the fine-tuning of foundation models, tailored for the efficient annotation of typical objects in remote sensing imagery. OSISeg utilizes robust visual priors from foundation models and implements a hybrid adapter-based strategy for fine-tuning these models. Specifically, It employs a parallel structure with hybrid adapter designs to adjust multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks within foundation models, effectively aligning remote sensing image features for interactive segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the proposed OSISeg integrates point, box, and scribble prompts, facilitating high-quality segmentation only using one prompt through a lightweight decoder. Experimental results on multiple datasets—including buildings, water bodies, and woodlands—demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning methods and significantly enhances the quality of one-shot interactive segmentation for typical remote sensing objects.

 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the distribution shift across various Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, most UDA approaches require access to source data, which may be infeasible due to data privacy or transmission constraints. Source-free Domain Adaptation addresses the absence of source data but usually demands a large amount of target domain data beforehand, hindering rapid adaptation and restricting their applicability in broader scenarios. In practical cross-domain RS image classification, achieving a balance between adaptation speed and accuracy is crucial. Therefore, we propose Low Saturation Confidence Distribution Test-Time Adaptation (LSCD-TTA), marketing the first attempt to explore Test-Time Adaptation for cross-domain RS image classification without requiring source or target training data. LSCD-TTA adapts a source-trained model on the fly using only the target test data encountered during inference, enabling immediate and efficient adaptation while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, LSCD-TTA incorporates three optimization strategies tailored to the distribution characteristics of RS images. Firstly, weak-confidence softmax-entropy loss emphasizes categories that are more difficult to classify to address unbalanced class distribution. Secondly, balanced-categories softmax-entropy loss softens and balances the predicted probabilities to tackle the category diversity. Finally, low saturation distribution loss utilizes soft log-likelihood ratios to reduce the impact of low-confidence samples in the later stages of adaptation. By effectively combining these losses, LSCD-TTA enables rapid and accurate adaptation to the target domain for RS image classification. We evaluate LSCD-TTA on six domain adaptation tasks across three RS datasets, where LSCD-TTA outperforms existing DA and TTA methods with average accuracy gains of 4.99% on Resnet-50, 5.22% on Resnet-101, and 2.37% on ViT-B/16."

 Recent advances in deep learning have enhanced crop classification, yet current research still underutilizes the hierarchical information of crop types, limiting classification accuracy. As categories are subdivided, the sample imbalance intensifies, posing a challenge to fine classification of crops. To address this, we propose the Class Semantic Guided Hierarchical Segmentation Framework (SemHi framework) for satellite image time series (SITS) crop classification. This framework effectively leverages the hierarchical information in the class system and outputs classification results at each level in an end-to-end manner. The SemHi framework comprises four modules: (1) The backbone that learns the spatio-temporal features; (2) The label embedding module, a core component that guides the feature learning through the fusion of hierarchical structure and textual representations; (3) The prototype distance measurement module to enhance class separation and reduce within-class variation; (4) The hierarchical logic regularization module, which enables multi-granularity crop predictions and strengthens the hierarchical logic between them. The validation results on the public crop classification dataset show that the SemHi framework with multi-dimensional fusion of spatio-temporal-text information significantly improves the performance of all state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks on fine-grained classes, with an overall accuracy improvement of 0.48% to 13.86%.

However, PM2.5 cannot be used to assess the effects of ultrafine particles, nor it cannot explain why in some regions PM mass seems to be relatively more harmful. In this study, the detailed physical and chemical characteristics of urban aerosol, together with particle lung deposited surface area (LDSAal) measurement, were analysed in Düsseldorf, Germany, to understand the aerosol that people are exposed to in a typical large Central European city. Overall, LDSAal, PM2.5 and chemical composition were mainly dependent on the regional aerosol, which was linked to aged aerosol as well as traffic and biomass burning within the city. Near pollution hotspots (airport, river, city centre), LDSAal increased by 14–19 %, whereas PM2.5 increased by 4–13 %. However, a major fraction of particles were smaller than 10 nm, suggesting potential health effects (like brain effects) without clear contribution to LDSAal. Particle number concentrations were clearly elevated near the pollution hotspots, especially the airport, showing the importance of non-road-traffic local pollution sources in urban environments. The study highlights the need to control pollution sources both outside and within cities in Central European cities. Also, the need to understand the health-damaging potential of ultrafine particles, including the semi-volatile, non-volatile and sub-10 nm fractions, is emphasised."

Hurtado;Eduardo Agosta Scarel,On the spatio-temporal coherence of extreme precipitation indices in subtropical Argentina,"•Machine learning clusters showed overall poor spatio-temporal coherence. •A proposed correlation-based method outperformed machine learning schemes. •Some indices reflecting extreme precipitation intensity could not be regionalized. •Different extreme indices exhibited coherent spatio-temporal behaviour in the region. •Indices with different percentiles as thresholds presented high co-variability. 
 This study evaluates the spatio-temporal coherence of regional extreme precipitation indices in subtropical Argentina (STAr) derived from rain gauge station data from 1991 to 2021. For the regionalization two machine learning clustering algorithms are used—Ward's method and K-means—and a novel stepwise regionalization approach, HAZ. While machine learning algorithms require the apriori definition of the optimal number of clusters, which varies considerably with the used metric and selection criteria, the HAZ method relies on a Pearson's correlation coefficient threshold and avoids this limitation. In most cases machine learning algorithms struggled to produce coherent regions, with fewer clusters prioritizing spatial coherence at the expense of temporal consistency, and vice versa. Conversely, the HAZ method systematically outperformed machine learning approaches, providing regions with adequate spatio-temporal coherence. Notably, HAZ permits some stations to remain unclustered, allowing to reflect the local variability in extreme precipitation. The overall good performance of the HAZ method demonstrates its potential for broader applications in hydro-climatic studies. Moreover, two intensity indices were unsuitable for regionalization due to poor coherence, while the other three were prone to regionalization throughout the year. The Accumulated index, particularly using the 95th percentile as a threshold, emerged as the most representative, effectively synthesizing extreme precipitation characteristics in STAr. Finally, the necessity of validating the spatio-temporal internal coherence of clustering algorithms outputs is emphasized to avoid mischaracterization and ensure robust regionalization results."

 Regional extreme precipitation can cause severe flooding with major environmental and social impacts. While most existing studies either ignored their spatiotemporally contiguous or abnormally break down the events with multiple rainstorm cores, rapid movement, or transient interruptions into multiple isolated fragments. Here, we propose a novel approach for identifying regional rainstorm events (RREs), which integrates dual-threshold with a three-dimensional (longitude, latitude, and time) image connectivity perspective. There were 1163 RREs identified across mainland China from 1991 to 2022 based on the CN05.1 dataset. The spatial, temporal, and movement patterns of RREs were analyzed. Results showed that 71.2 % of RREs lasted only one day, with intensity mostly around 60–70 mm/day. The cumulative magnitude of RREs was most positively correlated with its affected area (r = 0.95). The occurrence frequency of RREs had a significant upward trend during 1991–2022, approximately increased 2.7 events per decade, while the severity slightly declined. Spatially, the highest frequencies of RREs were observed in southeastern China. Based on the movement direction and distance, RREs were classified into four patterns: Eastward Moving, Southwestward Moving, Localized, and Northward Moving. Northward Moving RREs exhibited the largest affected area, the greatest cumulative magnitude, and the longest movement distance, followed by Eastward Moving RREs. Localized RREs had the shortest duration, the smallest affected area and movement distance, but the highest intensity (averaging 92.6 mm/day). Our findings provide new insights for understanding the characteristics of regional extreme precipitation and their driving mechanisms, which are valuable for forecasting and adapting to the resultant disasters."

Although efforts to decarbonize the global economy have significantly shifted global anthropogenic emissions away from the most extreme emission scenarios, intermediate emission scenarios are still plausible. Significant warming in these scenarios cannot be ruled out as uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) remain very large. Until now, long-term climate change projections and their uncertainties for such scenarios have not been investigated using Earth system models (ESMs) that account for all major carbon cycle feedbacks. Using the fast ESM CLIMBER-X with interactive CO2 and CH4 (the latter typically not included in most models), we performed simulations for the next millennium under extended SSP1-2.6, SSP4-3.4 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. These scenarios are usually associated with peak global warming levels of 1.5 ∘C, 2 ∘C and 3 ∘C, respectively, for an ECS of ∼3 ∘C, considered the best estimate in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. As ECS values lower or higher than this estimate cannot be ruled out, we emulate a wide range of ECS from 2 ∘C to 5 ∘C, defined as the ‘very likely’ range by the IPCC. Our results show that achieving the Paris Agreement goal of a 2 ∘C temperature increase is only feasible for low emission scenarios and if ECS is lower than 3.5 ∘C. With an ECS of 5 ∘C, peak warming in all considered scenarios more than doubles compared to an ECS of 3 ∘C. Approximately 50% of this additional warming is attributed to positive climate–carbon cycle feedbacks with comparable contributions from CO2 and CH4. The interplay between potentially high ECS and carbon cycle feedbacks could drastically enhance future warming, demonstrating the importance of properly accounting for all major climate feedbacks and associated uncertainties in projecting future climate change."

Large amounts of organic matter and nitrogen from river discharge may stimulate production and emission of greenhouse gases including N2O, thus reducing the blue carbon storage capacity of mangrove wetlands. However, it is unclear how the input of organic matter and nitrogen affect the emission fluxes of these greenhouse gases in mangrove wetlands. In this study, we compared the effluxes of N2O between the estuarine and non-estuarine mangrove wetlands near the seven major rivers on Hainan Island of China. The averaged N2O emission flux in the estuarine mangrove wetlands was 6.9 times than the non-estuarine mangrove wetlands. In the non-estuarine mangrove wetlands N2O emission flux increased significantly with total nitrogen content in the sediments. In contrast, organic carbon (OC)/organic nitrogen (ON) ratios were associated with N2O emissions in the estuarine mangrove wetlands. As rivers bring in more organic matter with high ON content, more N2O emissions occur in estuarine areas. OC in sediments are from different sources between estuary (fresh water dissolved OC (DOC)) and non-estuary (marine DOC) area. A higher OC/ON ratio leads to higher nitrification and lower N2O consumption enzyme activities in estuary areas compared with non-estuaries, which contributes extra N2O fluxes. Our study provides a direct process assessment of the response of natural N2O emissions to sediment chemistry changes caused by river inputs."

 The rapid development of remote sensing technology has led to an exponential growth in satellite images, yet their inherent complexity often makes them difficult for non-expert users to understand. Natural language, as a carrier of human knowledge, can bridge the gap between common users and complicated satellite imagery. Additionally, when paired with visual data, natural language can be utilized to train large vision–language foundation models, significantly improving performance in various tasks.

 Parameterizations in earth system models (ESMs) are subject to biases and uncertainties arising from subjective empirical assumptions and incomplete understanding of the underlying physical processes. Recently, the growing representational capability of machine learning (ML) in solving complex problems has spawned immense interests in climate science applications. Specifically, ML-based parameterizations have been developed to represent convection, radiation,  and microphysics processes in ESMs by learning from observations or high-resolution simulations, which have the potential to improve the accuracies and alleviate the uncertainties. Previous works have developed some surrogate models for these processes using ML. These surrogate models need to be coupled with the dynamical core of ESMs to investigate the effectiveness and their performance in a coupled system. In this study, we present a novel Fortran–Python interface designed to seamlessly integrate ML parameterizations into ESMs. This interface showcases high versatility by supporting popular ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. We demonstrate the interface's modularity and reusability through two cases: an ML trigger function for convection parameterization and an ML wildfire model.

However, conventional systems predominantly depend on costly ion exchange membranes, which are often plagued by fouling and scaling challenges. Here, we introduce an ingenious electrochemically assisted calcium silicate (EACS) system capable of achieving a rapid pH swing from 8.5 to 10 within 1 h through the in situ utilization of H+ and OH– ions, eliminating the need for membranes. The EACS system incorporates a novel 3D-printed porous basket holder designed to house calcium silicate particles and a rod-shaped Ru–Ir anode. Under closed-circuit conditions, the packed calcium silicate reacts with H+ generated at the anode, releasing Ca2+ into bulk solution, while OH– produced at the cathode accumulates, resulting in an elevated bulk pH. This mechanism enables the EACS system to achieve exceptional phosphorus recovery efficiency (88.4%–96.6%) from various waste streams, with energy consumption as low as 24.4 kWh kg P–1. Long-term continuous flow experiments demonstrate that periodic replacement of depleted silicate minerals sustains system efficiency and stability. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that while carbonate and silicate minerals are functionally viable, silicate minerals exhibit superior performance in removal kinetics, product purity, and reduced carbon emissions. Notably, the effluent from the EACS system, enriched with Ca2+ and characterized by a high pH, exhibits potential for direct air carbon capture. The proposed EACS system offers a transformative approach to environmental remediation and industrial applications, leveraging the fundamental principle of pH-swing to open new avenues for sustainable solutions."

Herein, dynamic Mn–VO associates were crafted onto the Mn-incorporated CeO2 mesocrystal (Mn/meso-CeO2) surface with Mn substituting a Ce atom through an easy-to-handle precipitation strategy. Experiments and theoretical calculation demonstrated that the asymmetric surface Mn–O–Ce configuration induced electron delivery from the low-valent Mn to adjacent Ce, destabilizing the circumambient O atoms and facilitating the formation of dynamic Mn–VO associates. Compared to pristine meso-CeO2, the Mn/meso-CeO2 with dynamic Mn–VO associates could efficiently activate O2 into a superoxide radical and a peroxanion (O2•– and O22–) at higher reaction temperature (over 200 °C). Meanwhile, the O atom adjacent to Mn featuring substantially elevated Lewis acidity promoted the adsorption and activation of benzene. Consequently, the Mn/meso-CeO2 catalyst exhibited a superior catalytic oxidation reactivity (T90 = 215 °C) toward C6H6 combustion via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. This work underlines the importance of rational design and regulation of catalytic sites over metal oxide surfaces for robust O2 activation and durable refractory AVOC combustion."

Here, we explore the mechanical properties of Pelona schist, Westerly granite, phyllosilicate‐rich gouge, gabbro, hornblende, lawsonite blueschist, montmorillonite, and smectite in hydrothermal conditions at various confining pressures and explain the laboratory observations with a physical model of fault friction. The thermobaric activation of healing and deformation mechanisms explains the boundaries of unstable slip as a function of slip‐rate, temperature, and effective normal stress for a given lithology. The constitutive law affords extrapolation of laboratory data in the conditions relevant to seismic cycles throughout the crust, explaining the focus of large earthquakes in collision, subduction, and continental and oceanic transform settings."

Jyoteeshkumar Reddy,A Machine Learning Tool for Determining the Required Sample Size for GEV Fitting in Climate Applications,"Extreme climate events (ECEs) like heavy rainfall and heatwaves significantly impact society, and climate change is altering their magnitude and frequency. Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions help quantify these ECEs and guide human system design. We train a machine learning (ML) model using a set of arbitrary GEV distributions to estimate the sample size required to determine a return value with specific uncertainty. For ECEs like heatwaves with a negative GEV shape parameter the maximum extreme temperatures of heatwaves are bounded and fewer samples are needed to estimate the return value to given uncertainty than rainfall extremes which have positive shape parameter with unbounded extreme values. For example, if a 1‐in‐20‐year heatwave event requires 400 samples to estimate return value to ± $\pm $1% uncertainty, one would need 20 different 20‐year simulations. Achieving such quantities will require extensive climate downscaling simulations, potentially aided by ML‐based downscaling methods to increase the ensemble size."

Here, we reconstructed land surface temperature (LST) variations over the past 27,000 years in two loess‐paleosol profiles from the Chinese Loess Plateau based on soil bacterial lipid signatures. By combining our data with other published records derived from the same proxy, we identify notable spatial inconsistencies in LST trends across geographically proximate areas with distinct vegetation cover, despite the expectation that air temperature trends should be consistent. By integrating modern meteorological data, we propose that rainfall‐induced changes in surface vegetation dynamics are a key factor contributing to this divergence. This contributes to our understanding of past climate dynamics in East Asia and underscores the importance of considering vegetation effects when interpreting paleoclimate data and resolving controversies over Holocene temperature trends."

We investigated anomalies of remote sensing vegetation indexes under droughts across the upper Yangtze River (UYR) basin, characterized as humid but having experienced frequent seasonal droughts from 2000. Then we compared global big river basins by focusing on the Nile and Congo basins, which have similar characteristics to the UYR. The vegetation across the UYR was affected by water stress in recent years but shows reduced sensitivity to drought. The compound effect of drought timing and phenology largely drives the response. Results show that late‐season droughts generally have a greater impact on vegetation growth compared to early season droughts, with alpine grasslands showing particularly pronounced responses due to their ecological features such as shallow root depth and aggressive hydrological behavior. The Nile basin, similar to the UYR basin, exhibits pronounced late‐season vegetation vulnerability, highlighting shared patterns of drought impact across heterogeneous landscapes. In contrast, the tropical rainforests in the Congo basin demonstrate greater resilience, supported by complex root systems, dense canopies, and low cloud cover that reduces evaporation. This study underscores the importance of considering regional ecological characteristics, drought timing, and phenological stages in assessing vegetation responses to drought. These insights are critical for predicting and managing ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions."

Even though it is among the largest physio‐climatic regions of the northern circumpolar, these knowledge gaps are acute in the Taiga Shield. This research aimed to determine if hydrology and biogeochemistry regimes of the Taiga Shield have been resilient to recent climate warming. We apply a recently developed framework of hydrological resilience that shows the first 20 years of the 21st century were the warmest and wettest of the previous 300 years. These conditions altered the catchment such that >50% of the water year streamflow now occurs during winter, shifting the catchment from a nival to a cold season pluvial hydrological regime. This regime shift has significantly changed the fraction of inorganic nitrogen export, but insufficiently to shift the biogeochemical regime. Sustained multi‐year physical process synchronization was the cause of these changes. This behavior is not well simulated by existing Earth system models. The tipping point in local mean annual air temperatures was crossed near the turn of the century well below the warming threshold of the Paris Accord. A one‐size‐fits‐all approach to mitigation targets is not effective at preventing all shifts in Earth systems. This is important to consider as regime changes in small hydrological systems have the potential to trigger cascading effects in the larger catchments to which they contribute."

 The efficient and modular diversification of molecular scaffolds, particularly for the synthesis of diverse molecular libraries, remains a significant challenge in drug optimization campaigns.1–3 The late-stage introduction of alkyl fragments is especially desirable due to the high sp³-character and structural versatility of these motifs.4 Given their prevalence in molecular frameworks, C(sp²)−H bonds serve as attractive targets for diversification, though this process often requires difficult pre-functionalization or lengthy de novo syntheses. Traditionally, direct alkylations of arenes are achieved by employing Friedel–Crafts reaction conditions using strong Brønsted or Lewis acids.5,6 However, these methods suffer from poor functional group tolerance and low selectivity, limiting their broad implementation in late-stage functionalization and drug optimization campaigns. Herein, we report the application of a novel strategy for the selective coupling of differently hybridized radical species, which we term dynamic orbital selection. This mechanistic paradigm overcomes common limitations of Friedel-Crafts alkylations via the in situ formation of two distinct radical species, which are subsequently differentiated by a copper-based catalyst based on their respective binding properties. As a result, we demonstrate herein a general and highly modular reaction for the direct alkylation of native arene C−H bonds using abundant and benign alcohols and carboxylic acids as the alkylating agents. Ultimately, this solution overcomes the synthetic challenges associated with the introduction of complex alkyl scaffolds into highly sophisticated drug scaffolds in a late-stage fashion, thereby granting access to vast new chemical space. Based on the generality of the underlying coupling mechanism, dynamic orbital selection is expected to be a broadly applicable coupling platform for further challenging transformations involving two distinct radical species."

 Electron shuttle plays a decisive role in extracellular electron transfer (EET) of exoelectrogens. However, neither identifying the most efficient electron shuttle molecule nor programming its optimal synthesis level that boosts EET has been established. Here, the phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) biosynthesis pathway is first constructed to synthesize PCA at an optimal level for EET in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. To facilitate PCA transport, the porin OprF is expressed to improve cell membrane permeability, the cytotoxicity of which, however, impaired cell growth. To mitigate cytotoxicity, PCA biosensor is designed to dynamically decouple PCA biosynthesis and transport, resulting in the maximum output power density reaching 2.85 ± 0.10 W m−2, 33.75-fold higher than wild-type strain. Moreover, extensive analyses of cellular electrophysiology, metabolism, and behaviors reveal PCA shuttles electrons from cell to electrode, which is the dominant mechanism underlying PCA-boosted EET.

 Information technology has a great demand for magnetoresistance (MR) sensors with high sensitivity and wide-temperature-range operation. It is well known that space charge inhomogeneity in graphene (Gr) leads to finite MR in its pristine form, and can be enhanced by increasing the degree of spatial disorder. However, the enhanced MR usually diminishes drastically as the temperature decreases. Here, by stacking a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) on top of graphene to form an FGT/Gr heterostructure, we demonstrate a positive MR of up to ~9400% under a magnetic field of 9 T at room temperature (RT), an order of magnitude larger MR compared to pure graphene. More strikingly, the giant MR of the FGT/Gr heterostructure sustains over a wide temperature range from RT down to 4 K. Both control experiments and DFT calculations show that the enhanced MR originates from spin-dependent orbital coupling between FGT and graphene, which is temperature insensitive. Our results open a new route for realizing high-sensitivity and wide-temperature-range MR sensors.

Moreover, intranasal immunization with the nanocage vaccine significantly enhances mucosal immune responses with more efficient B-cell memory generation and antibody maturation, as well as more balanced (Th1/Th2) immune responses with increased IFN-γ and IL-17 production, comparing with fusion vaccine. Mice immunized with the nanocage vaccine exhibited enhanced protection against lethal infection compare to the FlaB-tPspA fusion group.

 Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, and its intracellular levels must be tightly regulated to avoid toxicity. XPR1, the sole known phosphate exporter, is critical for maintaining this balance. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the human XPR1-KIDINS220 complex in substrate-free closed and substrate-bound outward-open states, as well as an XPR1 mutant in a substrate-bound inward-facing state. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6) and phosphate, the complex adopts an outward-open conformation, with InsP6 binding the SPX domain and juxtamembrane regions, indicating active phosphate export. Without phosphate or InsP6, the complex closes, with transmembrane helix 9 blocking the outward cavity and a C-terminal loop obstructing the intracellular cavity. XPR1 alone remains closed even with phosphate and InsP6. Functional mutagenesis shows that InsP6, whose levels vary with Pi availability, works with KIDINS220 to regulate XPR1 activity.

 Agriculture is one of the leading causes of detrimental environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and depletion of freshwater resources. Such impacts can be assessed by environmental sustainability indices; however, limitations in current indicators necessitate the development of more robust and standardized crop-specific environmental sustainability indices. Here we developed the crop environmental sustainability index (PLANTdex), a spatially explicit index (5 arcmin resolution) quantifying crop production’s environmental impacts. PLANTdex includes globally standardized indicators of environmental impacts assessing water stress and biodiversity loss via five emissions pathways: greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, land occupation, and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application. We applied PLANTdex to 16 crops, revealing high variability across production system efficiencies, crop types and local context environmental sensitivities. Globally and nationally, no clear correlation emerged between PLANTdex scores and crop production, but stronger correlations were evident at finer spatial scales and for individual crops. Sugar cane showed the strongest negative correlation (low impacts in high-production areas), while oil palm had the strongest positive correlation (high impacts in high-production areas), highlighting the importance of sub-national, crop-specific assessments. PLANTdex’s spatial resolution and crop specificity make it valuable for initiatives such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures and corporate sustainability strategies.

 Multi-year La Niña (ML) has occurred more frequently since the 1960s, but whether and to what extent it is due to external forcing remains unknown. Here, using 15 large ensemble (LENS) experiments under the same external forcing with ~500 realizations, we find that external forcings contribute only 18% of the post-1960 ML increase. The observed ML increase is mainly attributed to the higher transition rate of strong El Niño (SE) into ML because of increased SE amplitude, with a relatively small contribution from its increased frequency. However, the SE amplitude remains unchanged in the experiments under external forcing. It suggests that internal variability plays a dominant role in the increased SE amplitude in observations, hence increases its transition and the ML frequency. Associated with stronger SE, some factors outside the tropical Pacific become more active, also favoring ML development. The essential role of internal variability is confirmed by comparing the SE amplitude and ML frequency changes in members with the highest increased transition rate across LENS with observations."

 Attainment of corporate net-zero goals will depend on sufficient mitigation of scope 3 emissions, but implementation is challenged by measurement and management complexities. Here, we investigate the multi-tier greenhouse gas emissions structures of supply chains to assess mitigation potential using environmentally extended input-output models. We find that 56–70% of scope 3 emissions included in current science-based coverage guidance occur within the operational emissions of the first two tiers of supply. To meet net-zero objectives, companies will typically need to reach deep into tiers 4 or 5 of supply, where traceability has proven impractical.

Here, we projected the economic and carbon costs of seven ammonia production technologies by combining a prospective life cycle assessment with the Global Change Assessment Model and a provincial-level power system optimization model. Using this integrated approach, we evaluated the impact of the emissions trading system on the levelized cost of ammonia across 30 provinces in China from 2018 to 2060. Our results indicated that without the emissions trading system or with it covering the electricity industry, renewable ammonia cannot achieve cost parity with conventional ammonia for almost all provinces until 2040. Expanding emissions trading system coverage to the life cycle of ammonia production would accelerate the timeline of cost parity by 6–37 years across all 30 provinces.

 Extreme Indian Ocean dipole events (EXIODs) exert pronounced climate impacts both regionally and globally, which are closely associated with their sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). Here we find an evident asymmetry in SSTA patterns between the positive (EXpIOD) and negative (EXnIOD) phases of the EXIOD. Specifically, the warm SSTA center of the EXnIOD eastern pole is confined south of Java, whereas the cold pole during EXpIODs is primarily located off Sumatra. Diagnoses with model experiments further reveal that the pattern asymmetry is attributed to the non-uniformly distributed nonlinear vertical heat advection and latent heat flux anomalies along the Sumatra–Java coasts. Due to pattern asymmetry, more frequent and intense marine heatwaves and extreme sea level rise events induced by EXnIODs occur along the Java coast. However, current climate models systematically underestimate the degree of pattern asymmetry and its influences on local marine disasters, thereby challenging accurate predictions of coastal extremes.

 Climate warming in northern and Arctic regions drives vegetation growth and shifts species distribution. In northern Quebec's Boreal-Arctic transition (forest-tundra ecotone), this is seen in the replacement of lichen by shrubs, primarily dwarf birch. These changes impact surface albedo, contributing to climate forcings with broad consequences. This study measures vegetation changes in Tasiapik valley near Umiujaq, Quebec, using a combination of (1) hyperspectral data (347–2400 nm) collected from 62 vegetation assemblages, including lichen, dwarf birch, willow, and spruce, to calculate broadband albedo, and (2) remote sensing data from Landsat satellites over 1984–2023. By combining these data, the proportion of vegetation type for each pixel was determined at the beginning and end of the 40-year period. The areal coverage of six main vegetation types was quantified over the 9.25 km2 valley. The most significant change was lichen replacement by dwarf birch with lichen understory, leading to an albedo reduction from 0.233 to 0.168 and a summer shortwave forcing of 11.17 W m−2. At the valley scale, the spatially-averaged summer forcing was 2.16 W m−2 when considering all observed vegetation changes. These values, lower than those in previous Norwegian studies, highlight the spatial variability of shortwave forcing due to lichen replacement. We observed that the vegetation change producing the greatest positive radiative forcing also caused the strongest greening. This suggests that Landsat-based greening may be used as a proxy for surface albedo change on an Arctic scale. This unique combination of ground and satellite data allows quantification of a direct, first-order effect of Arctic shrubification."

 High-resolution maps of climate and ecosystem variables are essential for supporting terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes estimation, climate change mitigation, and ecosystem degradation assessment. These maps are usually created using remotely sensed data obtained from various types of imagery and sensors. The remote sensing data typically serve as covariates to deliver spatially explicit information using machine learning algorithms. Often the uncertainty associated with the maps is also quantified, for instance by prediction error variance maps or by maps of the lower and upper limits of a prediction interval. In addition, these products are often aggregated to regional, national, or global scales relevant to climate policy, natural resource inventory, and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) frameworks. Quantifying uncertainty in aggregated products is crucial as it is necessary to assess their value and evaluate whether changes and trends in aggregated estimates are statistically significant. However, we argue that such uncertainty is frequently inaccurately assessed due to the neglect of spatial correlation in map errors.

Lightning prediction with intensity estimation is an important reference for disaster warning, determining lightning protection level and real-time and dynamic lightning risk assessment. Real-time observation of total lightning can compensate for the problem of limited range or shielding of radar observation and is of great significance for thunderstorm tracking and lightning nowcasting. In this paper, the VLF Lightning Location Network (VLF-LLN) is used to obtain real-time long-range lightning location data. Through density estimation based on the Gaussian mixture model and weighted according to time proximity, the spatio-temporal range and frequency information of lightning high-density area are obtained. Then, a spatio-temporal data extrapolation model ME-RNN is proposed to predict the intensity of lightning activity and its evolution pattern in the thunderstorm region, so as to realize the nowcasting of lightning activity. Based on the PredRNN architecture, the model integrates the MotionGRU operator optimized for the characteristics of lightning data, and integrates the generative adversative network (GAN) to capture the transient changes of lightning phenomena and predict its movement trend. At 6 min, 18 min and 36 min before the thunderstorm reached the area of concentration (AOC), the prediction accuracy of the model was 94.1 %, 79.4 % and 65.8 %, respectively.

 The Andes-Amazon transition region features critically important ecological services on the local, regional and global scales. This region is among the rainiest zones in the world, with rainfall rates of up to 7000 mm/year. However, the physical mechanisms leading to the existence of these “precipitation hotspots” remain poorly known. Here, we attempt to disentangle the controlling atmospheric mechanisms exerted by local topographic structures that started to uplift about 5–10 million years ago in response to the Nazca Ridge subduction, in the vicinity of the Quincemil hotspot, the most intense of them. We first use the Weather Research and Forecasting model to conduct sensitivity tests to planetary boundary layer parameterizations at 5 km horizontal grid spacing during the austral summer of 2012–13. After finding the most suitable configuration in terms of the diurnal cycle of rainfall intensity and extent, we further perform topographic sensitivity tests by reducing the Fitzcarrald Arch lowlands and, on top of it, by removing the Camisea mountain. The Fitzcarrald Arch deflects moisture flux towards Quincemil, while the Camisea mountain induces local vortical circulations that increase moisture transport, convergence and rainfall over Quincemil, ultimately controlling its location and intensity by up to 40 %. When reducing the height of the Andes in half, we find that it sustains the development of precipitation hotspots, accounting for up to 60 % of rainfall, by providing a mechanical forcing to increase regional-scale moisture fluxes. Such mechanisms dominate during nighttime, when rainfall peaks in the region, and might explain the existence of the rainiest zone in the Andes-Amazon transition."

Here we suggest ways to tackle these pressing challenges in an integrated and comprehensive manner by applying key concepts from systemic risk research to triple- and multiple-dividend approaches. The central idea is that additional dividends (i.e., economic, social, and environmental co-benefits of disaster-risk reduction that go beyond loss-reduction benefits) can be related to different system boundaries (e.g., individual systems and system of systems) through their interdependencies. This approach allows for an integrated evaluation of interventions that may be more beneficial across various scales and for corresponding threats, thus increasing synergies (or co-benefits) and decreasing asynergies (or trade-offs) of disaster-risk reduction in a systemic way. Importantly, triple and multiple dividends, along with their related tools and approaches, can be seen as part of a ‘dividend continuum’, reflecting the varying levels of interdependencies across spatial and temporal scales within complex risk landscapes. As a consequence, dividends within and across systems can be managed simultaneously, based on determining priority needs, risk perceptions, and trade-offs involved in building resilience against current and future risks."

The coupler simulates the driving effect of atmosphere on MHWs while the probabilistic data argumentation approaches significantly boost the forecast ability of extreme MHWs based on the idea of ensemble forecast. Compared with traditional numerical prediction, our framework has significantly higher accuracy and requires fewer computational resources. What’s more, explainable AI methods show that wind forcing is the primary driver of MHW evolution and reveal its relation with air-sea heat exchange. Overall, our model provides a framework for understanding MHWs’ driving processes and operational forecasts in the future."

We simultaneously studied the recovery of vegetation, subsurface soil moisture, and active layer thickness (ALT) post-fire in the permafrost-underlain uplands of the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska to understand the interaction between these factors and their potential implications. We used a space-for-time substitution methodology with 2017 Landsat 8 imagery and synthetic aperture radar products, along with 2016 field data, to analyze tundra recovery trajectories in areas burned from 1953 to 2017. We found that spectral indices describing vegetation greenness and surface albedo in burned areas approached the unburned baseline within a decade post-fire, but ecological succession takes decades. ALT was higher in burned areas compared to unburned areas initially after the fire but negatively correlated with soil moisture. Soil moisture was significantly higher in burned areas than in unburned areas. Water table depth (WTD) was 10 cm shallower in burned areas, consistent with 10 cm of the surface organic layer burned off during fire. Soil moisture and WTD did not recover in the 46 years covered by this study and appear linked to the long recovery time of the organic layer."

Fractal geometry offers a universal measure of complexity, shape, and self-similarity across scales, and a powerful tool for characterizing MIZ evolution. Here we analyze the fractal dimension of the Arctic MIZ boundary and find a pronounced seasonal cycle that is repeated almost exactly each year, with a sharp maximum in late summer. The long-term trend is slight, with a decrease of less than 2% over the satellite era, while MIZ width has increased over the same period by almost 40%.

In this study, we analyze how the spatial resolution of different GCMs and RCMs affects the reliability of simulated wind speeds and wind power, using ERA5 data as a reference. We present a systematic procedure for model evaluation for wind resource assessment as a downstream task. Our results show that while a high spatial resolution can improve the representation of wind speed characteristics, notably extremes, the model choice is more critical for capturing the full wind speed distribution and corresponding power generation. The IPSL model preserves the wind speed distribution particularly well in Europe, producing the most accurate wind power forecasts relative to ERA5 data. Therefore, selecting the right GCMs and RCMs should precede considerations of spatial resolution or GCM boundary conditions.

The analysis reveals that July–August are key months; ice concentration and thickness during this time determines the fate of the sea ice survival in September. Before July 2024, sea ice near Wrangel Island has experienced rapid and sustained thickening, with its distribution closely resembling the levels observed in 2000 and 2001 (the only other summers with ice survival). Persistent northerly winds east of Wrangel Island during the melt season contributed to sea ice thickening and played a crucial role in its survival. At the same time, a cooler-than-normal air temperature near Wrangel Island supported the stable presence of sea ice in this region.

We analyzed the lung tissues for the first time and the intestinal contents of 11 dead finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) to assess the intake of microplastics from prey and atmospheric sources. The lung tissues and intestinal contents contained average concentrations of 0.14 ± 0.11 MPs/g and 0.35 ± 0.36 MPs/g, respectively. Microplastics found in the lung tissues and intestinal contents were similar in physical characteristics (e.g., fragment shape, transparent to white color, and size <100 μm). On the other hand, they differed in the polymer types, with a higher proportion of epoxy-type microplastics in the lungs. Epoxy is a highly hazardous polymer according to the polymer hazard index, and in the present study, the lung tissues had a higher plastic hazard index than the intestinal contents. Hence, the respiratory system is more vulnerable to microplastic pollution from atmospheric sources than the digestive system is from water and food intake.

Results showed that 0.1 g L–1 CuO elevated the cytotoxicity of chlorinated waters by 20% and 120% at initial bromide concentrations of 15 and 415 μg L–1, respectively. Increasing the CuO dose increased the cytotoxicity induced by both known and unknown DBP fractions, and a more pronounced elevation was observed for the former one.

The contribution of bromine addition/substitution pathways to the alteration of identified formulas in the presence of CuO almost doubled that in the absence of CuO.

Yet, the regulatory role of different humic components involved in the initial formation of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides is still lacking. In this study, we identified the characteristic formation periods of ferrihydrite (Fh), the initial phase of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, through real-time monitoring of solution pH and in situ observations of precipitated Fh nanoparticles in the absence and presence of different humic components. The kinetics of Fh formation were quantified at micrometer and nanometer scales using Raman spectroscopy (RS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Results indicated that the extension of induction time, retardation of phase occurrence, and inhibition of nucleation rates for Fh formation were all dependent on the specific humic component with an order of fulvic acid (FA) > humic acid (HA) > humin (HM). Nanoscale data analysis revealed that the thermodynamic barrier to Fh nucleation increased by maximizing the interfacial free energy (γ) of the reaction system. Through molecular bonding quantification, AFM-based dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) measurements demonstrated a linear relationship between Gibbs free energies (ΔGb) of soil organic matter (SOM) binding to Fh and γ within the classical nucleation theory (CNT), linking heterogeneous nucleation barriers with organo-mineral bonding. This study is the first to provide in situ evidence of the inhibitory effects of soil humic components on the formation of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides and quantitatively establish that higher energy barriers to nucleation correlate with stronger organo-mineral bonding. This relationship suggests that good organic binders are good inhibitors for mineral formation, offering a novel perspective for predicting the formation and fate of soil minerals through the lens of organo-mineral binding free energies."

Therefore the development of novel strategies to efficaciously control infectious inflammation is urgently required. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as the central activator of pro-inflammatory genes plays a pivotal role in infectious inflammation. Here, nanoscale chirality was designed to modulate the inflammatory response through enantiomer-dependent blockade of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Chiral gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with good cytocompatibility were prepared through a one-pot seedless method under wild conditions, showing efficacious alleviation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo only by AuNPs with levorotatory chirality (L-AuNPs) rather than the dextrorotatory enantiomer (D-AuNPs). Mechanism investigation elucidated that lysosomal acidification of macrophages was inhibited through a high cellular uptake of L-AuNPs due to their weak interaction energy with cell membranes. Accordingly, the NF-κB rather than mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was blocked by L-AuNPs through the selective inhibition of p65 phosphorylation, wherein the nuclear translocation of p65 was simultaneously depressed, so the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators was reduced significantly.

Peracetic acid, a neutral peroxide, rapidly inactivated murine norovirus vesicles. In contrast, negatively charged peroxides, i.e., peracetate and peroxymonosulfate, exhibited restricted effectiveness in inactivating murine noroviruses within vesicles. The largely intact viruses cloaked within vesicles remained infectious and retained their ability to replicate upon vesicle lysis triggered by mechanical forces, enzymatic activity, or chemical reactions following disinfection. Peroxides primarily targeted vesicle/viral proteins, particularly amino acid residues such as cysteine and methionine, without affecting the viral ORF2 gene fragment or vesicle structures.

This study provides the first direct comparison of PFAS in septage and pump stations, targeting 70 PFAS compounds and employing the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. Septage exhibited markedly higher PFAS and precursors concentrations than pump stations, with median post-TOP levels of 687.5 ng/L vs 84.2 ng/L, respectively. FTCAs were fully oxidized, while diPAPs showed incomplete oxidation due to high organic loads. Septic systems function as PFAS reservoirs, increasing risks of groundwater contamination, particularly in areas with shallow aquifers. Pump stations contributed to episodic PFAS spikes, likely affecting downstream wastewater treatment. The detection of 27 PFAS compounds, including short-chain alternatives, highlights shifting contamination patterns. Findings emphasize the need for tailored analytical frameworks and pretreatment technologies to mitigate PFAS risks across decentralized and centralized wastewater systems. Integrating precursor analysis is critical for accurate risk assessment, as targeted PFAS measurements underestimate contamination. These results provide new insights into PFAS behavior in residential wastewater, guiding future mitigation efforts."

Evidence suggests their involvement in hormone homeostasis, yet their exposure patterns and links to gestational hypothyroidism remain unknown. Measuring trace elements in maternal hair using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a promising technique to assess both cumulative and time-resolved exposures. In this prospective nested case-control study, we characterized temporal variations in trace elements preceding gestational hypothyroidism diagnosis and examined their associations with the disease risk. Compared to controls, cases exhibited consistently elevated levels of arsenic (As), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), along with reduced zinc (Zn) levels, up to two months prior to diagnosis. An interquartile range increase in Zn levels was associated with a 39% lower risk of gestational hypothyroidism, while higher levels of As, Sr, and Ba were linked to increased risk (odds ratios: 1.32–1.42). The combination of Zn, As, Sr, and Ba achieved the highest predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80.

This study investigated ten bisphenol compounds in self-leveling floors and the dust on their surfaces, revealing total concentrations in the range of 14.5–1.82 × 106 and 317–1.39 × 105 μg/kg, respectively. Bisphenol A constituted a median of 99.7% and 97.7% of the total concentrations found in the floor and dust, respectively. These chemicals likely originated from  intentional use in either floor coatings or as impurities. The bisphenols released from the flooring may significantly contribute to  contamination of the dust. Additionally, the estimated human exposure levels to bisphenols A and F from  floor dust were found to be higher than those from other indoor dust and related products. Our results indicate that self-leveling floors could be a significant source of human exposure to bisphenols; however, the noncarcinogenic risks associated with bisphenol-laden dust seem to be within acceptable limits. More research is needed to investigate the presence of chemicals in self-leveling floors and their health implications as it is likely that various harmful chemicals are present in these materials."

While previous studies have emphasized the seasonal mechanism driving Antarctic ocean surface warming, the processes governing land surface warming remain less explored. Here we show that, under abrupt quadrupled CO2 forcing, Antarctic land surface experiences uniform warming throughout the year, primarily driven by poleward atmospheric heat transport, with latent energy transport playing a dominant role. This moisture‐related transport not only delivers energy but also amplifies the water vapor feedback, significantly contributing to the warming. Our findings suggest that the discrepancies in representing these atmospheric processes across models, contribute substantially to the uncertainties in Antarctic land surface warming projections. The result emphasizes the need for improved understanding of the atmospheric dynamics in polar regions to reduce model uncertainties under future climate scenarios."

This study employs sparse‐input reanalysis as a reference to detect and correct potential inhomogeneities in observed surface RH records from 2380 stations across China (1959–2020). Systematic inhomogeneities are primarily linked to the nationwide replacement of psychrometers with capacitive sensors in the 2000s and subsequent sensor instability. Raw data suggest an artificial decreasing trend of −0.43% per decade in RH particularly pronounced in southern China. Homogenization effectively removes this spurious trend, yielding stable RH records and eliminating regional discrepancies. Manual psychrometers derive RH from measurements of dry‐bulb and wet‐bulb temperatures using a psychrometric coefficient—a function of wind speed that is typically assumed constant. In this study, we calculated the psychrometric coefficient based on wind speed and applied it to derive RH, revealing that the raw manual psychrometer data overestimate RH by approximately 1.5% in China. This result supports our homogenization corrections and aligns with findings from nearby stations used as references. Because ERA5 and JRA‐55 assimilate raw data, they inherit these artificial trends in their surface‐level analyses. These findings have important implications for the reported RH decline over land in the 21st century given that the instrument replacement occurred worldwide."

Models were trained on ceilometer data with radiosonde measurements used for validation. We evaluated model performance by withholding approximately 10% of the data (as complete months) for testing, comparing predictions against ERA‐5 reanalysis data using RMSE, nRMSE, and R2 metrics. Our results show that gradient boosted ensemble models using all available features perform best. A modified recursive feature elimination algorithm identified minimal sets of 5–7 surface measurements sufficient for accurate zi prediction, demonstrating potential for wider spatial monitoring using cost‐effective sensors. The study revealed previously unrecognized variables influential in determining zi, such as deep soil temperature measurements (40 cm), suggesting new avenues for investigating land‐atmosphere interactions.

However, the response of atmospheric humidity to hot weather in urban versus rural settings remains unknown. Using long‐term summer (June–August) observations at 1662 stations over 1961–2020, we find that China is dominated by drying trends in atmospheric humidity (i.e., increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD)). These drying trends are aggravated on hot days and amplified by urbanization, that is, the UDI effect is stronger in hot weather. This amplification of the UDI effect on hot days is more prominent in humid than in arid regions. Attributions show that the stronger VPD‐based UDI effect on hot days is explained by increased contribution of air temperature in southeastern China and specific humidity in northern China. We suggest that adaptations are required to mitigate adverse combined effects of urban heatwaves and UDIs."

This study employs a ground‐based Doppler wind radar (DWL) in Lujiazui, Shanghai, to examine the evolution of TCBL wind and turbulence during Typhoon Muifa (2022), focusing on the transition from the periphery to the eyewall. Observations reveal significant changes in wind characteristics, highlighting the eye region's unique features and the complex dynamics of landfalling typhoons. Before Muifa's passage, the horizontal wind speed exhibited a low‐level C‐shape, with minimum speeds at 100–200 m, deviating from the typical logarithmic increase, due to high friction velocity and urban terrain effects. The vertical wind profile showed alternating updrafts and downdrafts, indicating dynamic turbulence within the TCBL. Turbulent integral length scales for tangential (Lv ${L}_{v}$) and radial (Lu ${L}_{u}$) winds at 104–208 m were smaller before the typhoon passage than after, with Lu ${L}_{u}$ notably less than Lv ${L}_{v}$, reflecting the influence of typhoon rotation and localized shear. Streak and roll intensities revealed intensified turbulence and energy transport near the surface before Muifa's passage, potentially contributing to localized wind damage. These structures exhibited periodic interactions, weakening after the typhoon's passage, likely due to changes in typhoon intensity or structure. Spectral analysis of radial and tangential winds highlighted variations in low‐frequency and inertial subrange regions, emphasizing the role of turbulence and scale interactions in modulating energy and momentum transfer. This study demonstrates DWL's effectiveness in detecting fine‐scale structures within the TCBL, enhancing understanding of wind and turbulence dynamics during landfalling typhoons."

 With the near eradication of poliovirus due to global vaccination campaigns, attention has shifted to other enteroviruses that can cause polio-like paralysis syndrome (now termed acute flaccid myelitis (AFM))1–3. In particular, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is believed to be the main driver of epidemic outbreaks of AFM in recent years4, yet not much is known about EV-D68 host interactions. EV-D68 is a respiratory virus5 but, in rare cases, can spread to the central nervous system to cause severe neuropathogenesis. Here, we used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify the poorly characterized multipass membrane transporter MFSD6 as a host entry factor for EV-D68. Knockout of MFSD6 expression abrogated EV-D68 infection in cell lines and primary cells corresponding to respiratory and neural cells. MFSD6 localized to the plasma membrane and was required for viral entry into host cells. MFSD6 bound directly to EV-D68 particles via its third extracellular loop (L3). We determined the cryo-EM structure of EV-D68 in complex with L3 at 2.1 Å resolution, revealing the interaction interface. A decoy receptor, engineered by fusing MFSD6(L3) to Fc, blocked EV-D68 infection of human primary lung epithelial cells, and provided near complete protection in a lethal mouse model of EV-D68 infection. Collectively, our results reveal MFSD6 as an entry receptor for EV-D68, and support targeting MFSD6 as a potential mechanism to combat infections by this emerging pathogen with pandemic potential."

Here, using periodic modulation, the authors reveal effects of synchronization, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics, demonstrating universal nonlinear effects in a time-crystalline platform. 
 The coupled electron-nuclear spin system in an InGaAs semiconductor as testbed of nonlinear dynamics can develop auto-oscillations, resembling time-crystalline behavior, when continuously excited by a circularly polarized laser. We expose this system to deviations from continuous driving by periodic modulation of the excitation polarization, revealing a plethora of nonlinear phenomena that depend on modulation frequency and depth. We find ranges in which the system’s oscillations are entrained with the modulation frequency. The width of these ranges depends on the polarization modulation depth, resulting in an Arnold tongue pattern. Outside the tongue, the system shows a variety of fractional subharmonic responses connected through bifurcation jets when varying the modulation frequency. Here, each branch in the frequency spectrum forms a devil’s staircase. When an entrainment range is approached by going through an increasing order of bifurcations, chaotic behavior emerges. These findings can be described by an advanced model of the periodically pumped electron-nuclear spin system. We discuss the connection of the obtained results to different phases of time matter.

Here, the authors show in a female sample that eating disorder symptoms, emotional arousal, and interoceptive awareness modulate goal-irrelevant food biases during reinforcement learning. 
 Food seeking and avoidance engage primary reward systems to drive behavior. It is nevertheless unclear whether innate or learned food biases interact with general reward processing to interfere with goal-directed choice. To this end, we recruited a large non-clinical sample of females with high eating-disorder symptoms (‘HED’) and a matched sample of females with low eating-disorder symptoms (‘LED’) to complete a reward-learning task where the calorie content of food stimuli was incidental to the goal of maximizing monetary reward. We find and replicate a low-calorie food bias in HED and a high-calorie food bias in LED, reflecting the strength of pre-experimental food-reward associations. An emotional arousal manipulation shifts this group-dependent bias across individual differences, with interoceptive awareness predicting this change. Reinforcement-learning models further identify distinct cognitive components supporting these group-specific food biases. Our results highlight the influence of reinforcement-based mechanisms and emotional arousal in eliciting potentially maladaptive food-reward associations.

 Materials capable of light upconversion—transforming low-energy photons into higher-energy ones—are pivotal in advancing optoelectronics, energy solutions, and photocatalysis. However, the discovery in various materials pays little attention on few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides, primarily due to their indirect bandgaps and weaker light-matter interactions. Here, we report a pronounced light upconversion in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides through upconversion photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our joint theory-experiment study attributes the upconversion photoluminescence to a resonant exciton-exciton annihilation involving a pair of dark excitons with opposite momenta, followed by the spontaneous emission of upconverted bright excitons, which can have a high upconversion efficiency. Additionally, the upconversion photoluminescence is generic in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, showing a high tuneability from green to ultraviolet light (2.34–3.1 eV).

 The Baltic Sea is a marginal sea in northern Europe. Anthropogenic eutrophication and related deoxygenation are among its pressing environmental problems. To this end intermittent major salt water inflows from the North Sea are of major importance because they replace deep low-oxygenated waters with oxygenated surface water that sinks to depth after passing the shallow Danish Straits. Here we show, guided by machine-learning and backed by geophysical fluid dynamic modelling, that major inflows come in two “flavours” as a result of distinctly-different successions of the driving synoptic atmospheric patterns: (1) Relatively salty inflows, carrying mainly waters of pristine Atlantic origin, preconditioned by moderate high-pressure systems over the Baltic that are ultimately driven by gale force westerly winds. (2) Relatively sweet (fresh) inflows, preconditioned by pronounced high-pressure systems that build up oceanic barotropic pressure gradients across the Danish Straits. The latter, in conjunction with moderate to strong westerly winds, ultimately drive inflows that carry a mix of previously-exported brackish Baltic Sea water and salty Kattegat water - rather than more pristine Atlantic flavours. Our conceptual framework provides, for the first time, an explanation for the question why inflow strength is not directly linked to re-oxygenation of the deep Baltic.

 We synthesise advances in the understanding of the physical processes that play a role in developing, intensifying, and terminating meteorological droughts. We focus on Australia, where new understanding of drought drivers across different climate regimes provides insights into drought processes elsewhere in the world. Drawing on observational, climate model and machine learning-based research, we conclude that meteorological drought develops and intensifies largely through an absence of synoptic processes responsible for strong moisture transport and heavy precipitation. The subsequent presence of these synoptic processes is key to drought termination. Large-scale modes of climate variability modulate drought through teleconnections, which alter drought-determining synoptic behaviour. On local scales, land surface processes play an important role in intensifying dry conditions and propagating meteorological drought through the hydrological cycle. In the future, Australia may experience longer and more intense droughts than have been observed in the instrumental record, although confidence in drought projections remains low. We propose a research agenda to address key knowledge gaps to improve the understanding, simulation and projection of drought in Australia and around the world.

 Most climate projections represent volcanic eruptions as a prescribed constant forcing based on a historical average, which prevents a full quantification of uncertainties in climate projections. Here we show that the contribution of volcanic forcing uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in global mean surface air temperature projections reaches up to 49% in 2029, and is comparable or greater than that from internal variability throughout the 21st century. Furthermore, compared to a constant volcanic forcing, employing a stochastic volcanic forcing reduces the probability of exceeding 1.5 °C warming above pre-industrial level by at least 5% for high climate mitigation scenario, and enhances the probability of negative decadal temperature trends by up to 8%. Intermediate to high climate mitigation scenarios are particularly sensitive to the choice of future volcanic forcing implementation. We recommend the use of either a stochastic approach or prescribed constant forcing levels that sample volcanic uncertainty in future climate simulations.

By simultaneously preforming edge detection and segmentation tasks, the multitask model was able to robustly detect glacier crevasses of different shapes within different illumination conditions with a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %. Our approach is applicable to large-scale applications as demonstrated by creating high-resolution crevasse maps for the entire Oetztal and Stubai Alps for the years 2019/2020.

 Remote sensing scene captioning is crucial for the deep understanding and intelligent analysis of Earth observation data. Many existing methods and datasets lack a fine-grained description of key geographical elements, fail to capture the full diversity of spatial relations, and are limited in their applicability to real-world geospatial scenarios. To address these shortcomings, we propose HI4HC (hybrid intelligence for remote sensing scene hierarchical captioning), a novel method that combines deep learning algorithms with expert knowledge to generate hierarchical captions for remote sensing scenes. This approach comprehensively describes scenes across three dimensions: geographical elements, spatial relations, and scene concepts, resulting in more accurate, detailed, and comprehensive captions. Leveraging HI4HC, we have constructed and made public a high-quality hierarchical caption dataset named AAAAD (adopt-amend-annihilate-add dataset). Extensive experiments show that AAAAD outperforms traditional single-level caption datasets in terms of the richness of geographical elements, the precision of spatial relations, and overall caption diversity, with improvements observed across 11 out of 13 evaluation metrics. Moreover, the hierarchical captions generated by HI4HC offer users the flexibility to organize information according to specific application needs such as imagery classification, change detection, multimodal understanding and cross-modal retrieval. This adaptability not only alleviates the semantic gap in imagery understanding but also plays an important role in advancing intelligent analysis of remote sensing imagery.

 The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a vital metric for assessing vegetation growth, yet accurate prediction remains challenging, particularly in regions with complex geographic and climatic conditions. Machine learning methods offer promise but are often hindered by sensitivity to model structure, input parameters, and training samples. To address these limitations, this study developed an NDVI time-series prediction optimization model, LSKRX, which integrates multiple machine learning algorithms with local geographic and climatic data. Using the Southwest Basin of China as a case study, dominant climatic factors were identified through sub-basin analysis, and machine learning models were constructed to link NDVI with these factors. The LSKRX model demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to single-model approaches, with the most notable enhancement in BIAS. Spatially, the model’s predictions aligned closely with observed values, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The model performed exceptionally well in winter (CC: 0.964) and summer (CC: 0.918) and achieved optimal accuracy in alpine regions at altitudes of 4000–5000 m (CC: 0.900).

In this study, to mitigate these errors, we propose a novel calibration algorithm that enhances the spatial and temporal performance of FY-2G QPE at both daily and hourly scales. This method consists of two components: first, a daily-scale spatial calibration using a multi-variable-assisted Random Forest (RF) technique, and second, an hourly-scale temporal calibration based on an Improved Proportional Factor (IPF) method, which refines traditional PF approaches by integrating Geographic Difference Analysis (GDA) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) for error correction. The proposed approach was applied to generate a high-quality FY-2G precipitation dataset for the Chinese mainland (0.1°/hr, 2018–2019). Validation against the China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA) dataset demonstrates significant improvements: Daily-scale spatial calibration using RF increases the correlation coefficient (CC) from 0.74 to 0.92 (+24.3 %), reduces BIAS from 15.69 % to 8.04 % (−48.8 %), and decreases RMSE from 5.97 mm to 2.93 mm (−50.9 %). Hourly-scale temporal calibration using RF-IPF improves CC from 0.47 (FY-2G) to 0.77, reduces BIAS from −36.73 % to 8.25 %, and lowers RMSE from 2.98 mm to 2.11 mm during extreme precipitation events. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed calibration framework in enhancing both spatial and temporal accuracy of infrared-based QPEs. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on daily-scale corrections, our approach extends calibration to the hourly level, improving precipitation estimates crucial for short-duration extreme weather events. While this methodology is demonstrated in China, its framework can be adapted to other satellite-based precipitation datasets and applied across diverse climatic and topographic regions, providing valuable insights for hydrological and climatic research worldwide."

We developed a pollen emissions model using phenology and random forests. Key factors affecting annual pollen emissions include temperature, relative humidity and sunshine hours. Pollen dispersal starts around 10 August, peaks around 30 August and ends by 25 September, lasting about 45 d. Over time, annual pollen emissions exhibit significant fluctuations and a downward trend. 
 In recent years, the intensification of global climate change and environmental pollution has led to a marked increase in pollen-induced allergic diseases. This study leverages 16 years of continuous pollen monitoring data, alongside meteorological factors and plant functional type data, to construct a pollen emissions model using phenology and random forests (RFs). This model is then employed to simulate the emission characteristics of three primary types of autumn pollen (Artemisia, chenopods and total pollen concentration), elucidating the emission patterns throughout the seasonal cycle in Beijing. Phenology and RFs precisely simulate the start and end day of year of pollen, as well as the annual pollen production. There are significant spatiotemporal differences among the three types of pollen. On average, pollen dispersal begins around 10 August, peaks around 30 August and concludes by 25 September, with a dispersal period lasting approximately 45 d. Furthermore, the relationship between pollen emissions and meteorological factors is investigated, revealing that temperature, relative humidity (RH) and sunshine hours (SSHs) significantly influence annual pollen emissions. Specifically, temperature and RH exhibit a strong positive correlation with annual pollen emissions, while SSHs show a negative correlation. Different pollen types display varied responses to meteorological factors. Finally, the constructed pollen emissions model is integrated into the ICTP Regional Climate Model (RegCM) and validated using pollen observation data, confirming its reliability in predicting pollen concentrations. This study not only enhances the understanding of pollen release mechanisms but also provides scientific evidence for the selection and planting of urban greening plants."

Harris,Revised and updated geospatial monitoring of  21st century forest carbon fluxes,"Updated global maps of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sequestration by forests from 2001 onwards using satellite-derived data show that forests are strong net carbon sinks, capturing about as much CO2 each year on average as the USA emitted from fossil fuels in 2019. After reclassifying fluxes to countries’ reporting categories for national GHG inventories, we found that roughly two-thirds of the net CO2 flux from forests is anthropogenic and one-third is non-anthropogenic. 
 Earth observation data are increasingly used to estimate the magnitude and geographic distribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and reduce overall uncertainty in the global carbon budget, including for forests. Here, we report on a revised and updated geospatial, Earth-observation-based modeling framework that maps GHG emissions, carbon removals, and the net balance between them globally for forests from 2001 to 2023 at roughly 30 m resolution, hereafter referred to as the Global Forest Watch (GFW) model (see the “Code and data availability” section). Revisions address some of the original model's limitations, improve model inputs, and refine the uncertainty analysis. We found that, between 2001 and 2023, global forest ecosystems were, on average, a net sink of −5.5 ± 8.1 Gt CO2e yr−1 (gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year ± 1 standard deviation), which reflects the balance of 9.0 ± 2.7 Gt CO2e yr−1 of GHG emissions and −14.5 ± 7.7 Gt CO2 yr−1 of removals, with an additional −0.20 Gt CO2 yr−1 transferred into harvested wood products. Uncertainty in gross removals was greatly reduced compared with the original model due to the refinement of uncertainty for carbon removal factors in temperate secondary forests. After reallocating GFW's gross CO2 fluxes into anthropogenic fluxes from forest land and deforestation categories to increase the conceptual similarity with national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs), we estimated a global net anthropogenic forest sink of −3.6 Gt CO2 yr−1, excluding harvested wood products, with the remaining net CO2 flux of −2.2 Gt CO2 yr−1 reported by the GFW model as non-anthropogenic. Although the magnitude of GFW's translated estimates aligns relatively well with aggregated NGHGIs, the temporal trends differ. Translating Earth-observation-based flux estimates into the same reporting framework that countries use for NGHGIs helps build confidence around land use carbon fluxes and supports independent evaluation of progress towards Paris Agreement goals. The data availability is as follows: carbon removals (Gibbs et al., 2024a,  https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/V2ISRH), GHG emissions (Gibbs et al., 2024b,  https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LNPSGP), and net flux (Gibbs et al., 2024c, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TVZVBI)."

We developed a 30-m annual forest aboveground biomass dataset from 1985 to 2023 using satellite data and deep learning. Our results reveal significant biomass gains, regional variations, and the impact of forest policies. This dataset provides valuable insights for climate research, conservation planning, and sustainable forest management. 
 Accurate estimation and monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for understanding carbon dynamics, managing forest resources, and guiding environmental policies. However, the spatial and temporal patterns, dynamics, and driving factors of forest AGB in China over recent decades remain insufficiently understood, hindering ecosystem analysis and forest management strategies. This study combines multi-source remote sensing data with residual neural networks (ResNets) to develop the first 30 m resolution annual China Forest AGB dataset (1985–2023) with uncertainty quantification. Validation results confirm the robustness of the ResNets model, achieving an R2 of 0.92, RMSE of 16.06 Mg/ha, and Bias of 0.06 Mg/ha against GEDI footprint AGBD, and an R2 of 0.63, RMSE of 68.26 Mg/ha, and Bias of -19.87 Mg/ha against independent multi-year ground survey data. The dataset reveals a notable increase in China’s average forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) from 95.74±11.30 Mg/ha in 1985 to 122.69±13.94 Mg/ha in 2023. During this period, total forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stock rose from 5.50±0.23 PgC to 13.97±0.87 PgC, establishing China’s forests as a significant carbon sink over the past four decades, with a net carbon sink of 0.22±0.01 PgC yr⁻¹, offsetting 11.5 %–14.9 % of China’s fossil fuel and industrial emissions. Forest growth contributed 65.1 % (5.75 PgC) of the total AGC increase, while forest expansion accounted for 34.9 % (3.09 PgC).

Using satellite imagery and field observations, we identify key drivers of bank erosion in large spatial scale and highlight role of river discharge and permafrost. The dataset enhances understanding of river channel dynamics and supports the development of predictive models for river channel evolution and erosion risk assessment. 
 Riverbank erosion monitoring and modeling has a long-standing tradition in Earth system science. The current body of research primarily relies on observations at the basin and reach levels. We endeavored to compile a comprehensive dataset of riverbank migration observations using a variety of measurement techniques, both field-based and remote sensing data. The dataset comprises information from twelve extensive river basins situated in Northern Eurasia, encompassing rivers that drain into the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, and the Caspian Sea, specifically the catchments of the Vistula, Volga, Ural, Ob, Nadym, Yenisey, Lena, Indigirka, Yana, Kolyma, Amur and Kamchatka rivers. The rivers included in the dataset vary in terms of environmental conditions and have average discharges of between 0.3 and 19,700 m3/s. This study examined approximately 140,000 kilometers of rivers in Northern Eurasia, covering small, medium, and large rivers, with data from up to 70 years of water classifications obtained from satellite images, including those from LandSat and Keyhole, across 626,700 river channel segments. The dataset collected average and maximum bank retreat rates (m/year), average areas of bank retreat (m2/year), and volumes of channel erosion (t/year). It also recorded possible causes, encompassing both hydrological and catchment factors like permafrost, natural land zones, and geology. Our study showed that river discharge and permafrost distribution are the primary indicators of riverbank erosion in Northern Eurasia. These data will enhance the comprehension of bank erosion processes and their underlying factors, thereby facilitating the development of more accurate predictive models of river channels.

This is often lacking in current disaster databases. SHEDIS-Temperature fills this gap by integrating impact records with information on disaster locations, high-resolution meteorological data, and population estimates. Covering 382 disasters in 71 countries (1979–2018), this dataset enables deeper analyses of heat-related risk and vulnerabilities. 
 International databases of disaster impacts are crucial for advancing disaster risk research, particularly as climate change intensifies the frequency and intensity of many natural hazards – including temperature extremes. However, many widely-used disaster impact databases lack information on the physical dimension of the hazards associated with an impact, and on the exposure to such hazards. This hinders analysing drivers of severe disaster outcomes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present SHEDIS-Temperature, a dataset that provides Subnational Hazard and Exposure information for temperature-related DISaster impact records (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WNOTTC; Lindersson and Messori, 2025). This open-access dataset links temperature-related impact records from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) with subnational data on their locations, associated meteorological time series, and population maps. SHEDIS-Temperature provides hazard and exposure data for 2,835 subnational locations associated with 382 disaster records from 1979 to 2018 in 71 countries. Detailed hazard metrics, derived from 0.1° 3-hourly data, encompass absolute indicators, such as the heat stress measure apparent temperature accounting for humidity and wind speed, as well as percentile-based indicators of when and where temperatures exceeded local thresholds. Population exposure data include annual population figures for impacted subnational administrative units and person-days of exposure to threshold-exceeding temperatures. Outputs are available at grid-point level as well as zonally aggregated to administrative subdivision units, and disaster-record levels. By providing comprehensive attributes across the hazard-exposure spectrum, SHEDIS-Temperature supports interdisciplinary research on past temperature-related disasters, offering valuable insights for future risk mitigation and resilience strategies."

The datasets were developed using a data-driven approach and rigorously validated against in situ observations and existing H and Tsa datasets, demonstrating both high accuracy and exceptional spatial resolution. 
 Accurate estimation of land surface sensible heat flux (H) is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of surface energy transfer and the cycles of water and carbon. Yet, existing H products mainly are meteorological reanalysis datasets with coarse spatial resolutions and high uncertainties. FLUXCOM is the sole remotely sensed product with its 0.0833° spatial and 8-day temporal resolution spanning from 2001 to 2015, so there is still a need for accurate and high spatial resolution global product based on satellite data. To address these issues, we generated the first global high resolution (1 km) daily H product from 2000 to 2020 using long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models, incorporating data from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite. Furthermore, considering that the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature (Tsa) is a key driver of H, we introduce the first global accurate satellite-based Tsa product. This product refines the uncertainty compared with obtaining Tsa directly from existing products by subtracting air temperature from land surface temperature. Our model, distinct from previous models that estimate H per pixel through physically-based models requiring parameters that are not readily accessible, can conveniently derive global values and efficiently capture nonlinear interactions. Additionally, it accounts for the temporal variation of H. Validation against independent in-situ measurements yielded a root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) of 25.54 Wm⁻2, 18.649 Wm⁻2, and 0.54 for H, and 1.459 K, 1.071 K, and 0.53 for Tsa, respectively. The estimated H and Tsa values are more accurate than current products such as MERRA2, ERA5-Land, ERA5, and FLUXCOM under most conditions. Additionally, the new H product offers more detailed spatial information in diverse landscapes. The estimated global average land surface H from 2000 to 2020 is 35.29±0.71 Wm⁻2. These high-resolution H and Tsa products are invaluable for climatic researches and numerous other applications.

The model is validated globally with satellite data and nearshore using in situ data. The model allows for the first time direct comparisons with in situ data collected at 10–30 m water depth, which is very close to shore due to the steep slope usually surrounding volcanic islands. 
 Climate change is driving sea-level rise and potentially intensifying extreme events in the tropical belt, thereby increasing coastal hazards. On tropical islands, extreme sea levels and subsequent marine flooding can be triggered by cyclones but also distant-source swells. Knowledge of sea states in the tropical ocean is thus of key importance, and their study is usually based on spectral wave models. However, existing global wave models typically employ regular grids with a coarse resolution, which fail to accurately represent volcanic archipelagos, a problem usually circumvented by the use of obstruction grids but typically resulting in large negative biases. To overcome this problem, this study presents a new global wave model with a focus on distant-source swells, which have received less attention than waves generated by cyclones. To accurately simulate sea states in tropical areas, we implemented the spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III© (WW3) over a global unstructured grid with a spatial resolution ranging from 50 km to 100 m. The model is forced by ERA5 wind fields, corrected for negative biases through a quantile–quantile approach based on satellite radiometer data. The wind input source terms adjusted accordingly and the explicit representation of tropical islands result in improved predictive skills in the tropical ocean. Moreover, this new simulation allows for the first time direct comparisons with the in situ data collected on volcanic islands at water depths ranging from 10 to 30 m, which corresponds to a few hundred meters from the shore."

An arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from each source location in forward tracking is found to cause ambiguous self-recruitment. In contrast, we found that an arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from the settlement location in backtracking leads to unambiguous self-recruitment. 
 Accurately estimating self-recruitment (SR), the fraction of recruits in a location that originated locally, is critical for understanding population connectivity. Biophysical models have been typically applied to compute SR by releasing a certain number of larval particles from each assumed source location and tracking them forward in time. However, various strategies have been employed for releasing these larval particles: including randomly, consistently, or a number proportional to the location’s area or larval production, which causes ambiguous results. We demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and numerical simulations from Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) larvae in Lake Erie, that SR depends on larval production at each source location. This dependency suggests that SR may not be computed unambiguously in these models unless realistic larval production is released from all potential source locations. In contrast, parentage analysis studies typically computed SR by assessing the fraction of sampled juveniles that originate locally at a settlement location, instead of identifying larval production at all sources. Therefore, tracking larval particles backward from the settlement location is proposed as a straightforward approach for computing SR. Our findings demonstrate that SR is independent of the number of larval recruits at the settlement location, supporting the employment of backtracking models with randomly released larval particles. In this way, considerable effort and resources, that would otherwise be spent on identifying all potential sources and their larval output, in forward tracking can be saved. We believe this result will have important implications for studies on larval dispersal and recruitment in aquatic systems."

One barrier to the implementation of water recycling projects is the cost, for both the municipality and the consumers. This research uses a consumer choice survey of 1000 individuals in the United States to evaluate consumer willingness to pay for potable recycled water, considering the impact of terminology (“purified water,” “recycled water,” “reused water,” “reclaimed water,” and “treated wastewater”) and future outdoor watering restrictions. Analysis of survey responses calculated consumer willingness to pay using mixed logit models. Results demonstrate the importance of terminology on consumer willingness to pay and the consistency of preference for the term “purified water” across cities in the United States. Consumers were also willing to pay for potable recycled water to avoid or reduce water restrictions, although the magnitude was small. Shifting from the commonly used “recycled water,” a less preferred term, to “purified water” is expected to increase both consumer acceptance and willingness to pay for the exact same product. Our results demonstrate how important terminology can be in public communication and policy discussions in general and in the successful design and promotion of residential water management projects in particular."

In this study, we developed a nontargeted approach to analyze particulate electrophilic compounds in urban Beijing and identified 147 ones with significant diurnal variation, among which oxygenated aromatic compounds (OACs) are the predominant species. The discrepancy in hierarchical clustering analysis of atmospheric transformation markers, e.g., 9-nitroanthracene (9NANT) and citraconic anhydride (CA), and PAHs, e.g., fluoranthene (FLT), suggested a potential secondary formation pathway in the urban atmosphere. The isomeric ratio of acephenanthrylene (ACP) to FLT, and the product-to-precursor ratio of 11H-benzo[a]fluorene-11-one (BaFO) to FLT, further demonstrated the prevailing existence of atmospheric oxidation. The relationship between night-to-day variation and molecular characteristics, particularly the significant negative correlation with oxygen-related features such as the carbon oxidation state, confirmed that multigenerational oxidation processes during daytime predominantly drive diurnal/nocturnal differences. This study achieved a systematic identification of electrophilic compounds and their transformation in the atmosphere, revealing the pivotal role of oxidation on the fate of organic chemicals that resulted in their diurnal variation."

Bacterial culture, the gold standard for Salmonella detection, is time-consuming and cumbersome. Herein, a novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensing platform was constructed for Salmonella detection based on combining the electrochemical signals of a DNAzyme and metal–organic framework (MOF) and programmed DNA assembly amplification by target-specific cleavage of catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA). DNAzyme is used to identify and detect S. typhimurium (ST) due to its release of RNase H2 (STH2) which specifically cleaves the rA site in DNAzyme, causing a subsequent reaction. To achieve proportional dual signaling strategy, the electrochemical signaling tag, ferrocene (Fc), was modified onto the DNA sequence H1, and Fe-MOF, an electrochemical indicator with high redox potential separation, was selected as the signaling probe. The prepared ratiometric electrochemical biosensor was analyzed via alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Salmonella detection in urban water source samples using the novel biosensor yielded essentially the same results as commercial Salmonella test strips, with even higher sensitivity, confirming the accuracy and usefulness of this sensing strategy. This study describes a valuable platform for highly specific, ultrasensitive Salmonella detection in aqueous environments."

The 20th century, however, was bracketed by two extended pluvials that also had significant impacts in the region. We use a 1,224 years (800–2023 CE) record of observed and reconstructed soil moisture, in concert with a paleoclimate reanalysis product, to place the 20th‐century pluvials in a longer‐term context and investigate the occurrence and dynamics of similar events in the Common Era. Analyses of the soil moisture reconstruction demonstrate that pluvials and megapluvials are as ubiquitous as droughts and megadroughts over the last millennium. The early (19 years; 1905–1923) and late (22 years; 1978–1999) 20th‐century pluvials rank as the second and first wettest in the record, respectively, positioning these as events on par with the most extreme megadroughts. Pluvials show a strong association with tropical Pacific (warm) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the 20th century and over the prior millennium, though the role of the tropical Atlantic is much more uncertain and ambiguous. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach trained on the pre‐industrial period (800–1849 CE), we find that the record setting late 20th‐century megapluvial likely occurred as a consequence of anomalously strong Pacific sea surface temperature forcing. This work establishes pluvial and megapluvial events as intrinsic components of Common Era hydroclimate variability in SWNA, comparable in importance to droughts and megadroughts."

With three coordinated flight legs, airborne downward‐looking cloud radar and lidar and in situ microphysics and wind probes provided a comprehensive depiction of the cloud system over a one‐hour period. NASA Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) measurements suggest that the SLW layer was greater than several hundred meters thick and ∼100 km long within the sampling window. The in situ cloud probes measured a maximum liquid water content (LWC) of 0.58 g m−3. NASA Cloud Radar System (CRS) reflectivity and Doppler data revealed gravity waves within the nimbostratus below a strong temperature inversion that was caused by warm air advection near an occluded front in an extratropical cyclone. The enhanced CRS Doppler spectrum width indicated turbulence that was likely generated by gravity wave breaking while propagating upward. Analyses of the Brunt–Väisälä frequency and the Richardson number with NOAA High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model supported the observed gravity wave activity. The eddy dissipation rate (EDR) was calculated from both the CRS spectrum width and the in situ wind measured by the Turbulent Air Motion Measurement Systems (TAMMS) to quantify the magnitudes of turbulence and to provide a promising intercomparison between the remote‐sensing and in situ turbulence data. A moderate correlation between in situ EDR and LWC suggests that the turbulence likely contributed to the SLW cloud top."

However, the impacts of clouds on the surface radiation balance in high elevation snowy mountain terrain are poorly explored. In this study, we use data collected by the SAIL field campaign and partner organizations in the upper elevations (2,880 m.a.s.l) of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) over a 21‐month period from September 2021 to June 2023 to estimate Cloud Radiative Forcing (CRF) in the shortwave, longwave, and the net effect. Longwave warming effects dominate during the winter when snow albedos are high (0.8–0.9) and the background atmospheric precipitable water vapor is low (< ${< } $0.5 cm), yielding a maximum monthly average net CRF of +34.7 W·m−2, meaning that clouds increase the net radiation relative to clear skies during this time period. The sign of net CRF switches in the warm season as snow recedes, sun‐angles increase, and the North American monsoon arrives, yielding a minimum monthly average net CRF of −47.6 W·m−2 with hourly minima of −600 W·m−2. The sign of net CRF is typically positive, even at solar noon, when the surface is snow covered, except for a brief period over melting, low‐albedo snow (0.5–0.6) impacted by dust impurities. Sensitivity tests elucidate the role of the surface albedo on the net CRF. The results suggest that net CRF will increase in magnitude and lead to a more persistent cooling effect on the surface net radiation budget as the snow cover declines."

There is a wave component that is stationary with respect to the convective cells that is triggered by convection acting like a barrier to the background flow (moving mountain mechanism). Waves from this mechanism have only been observed in a few case studies and are not parameterized in climate models. However, the representation of the whole spectrum of gravity waves is crucial for the simulation of the QBO, especially in the lowermost stratosphere (below 50 hPa) where the QBO amplitudes are under‐estimated in current global circulation models. In this study, we present analysis of convective gravity wave observations from superpressure balloons in boreal winter 2019 and 2021, retrieving phase speeds, momentum fluxes, and drag. We also identify waves generated by the moving mountain mechanism using the theory of the Beres scheme as a basis. These waves do not have a specific period, but are of smaller horizontal scale, on average around 300 km, which is similar to the scale of convective systems. Our results show that gravity waves contribute up to 2/3 to the QBO forcing below 50 hPa and waves from the moving mountain mechanism are responsible for up to 10% of this forcing."

 The tumour-suppressor protein BRCA2 has a central role in homology-directed DNA repair by enhancing the formation of RAD51 filaments on resected single-stranded DNA generated at double-stranded DNA breaks and stimulating RAD51 activity1,2. Individuals with BRCA2 mutations are predisposed to cancer; however, BRCA2-deficient tumours are often responsive to targeted therapy with PARP inhibitors (PARPi)3–6. The mechanism by which BRCA2 deficiency renders cells sensitive to PARPi but with minimal toxicity in cells heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations remains unclear. Here we identify a previously unknown role of BRCA2 that is directly linked to the effect of PARP1 inhibition. Using biochemical and single-molecule approaches, we demonstrate that PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention on a resected DNA substrate interferes with RAD51 filament stability and impairs RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange. Full-length BRCA2 protects RAD51 filaments and counteracts the instability conferred by PARPi-mediated retention by preventing the binding of PARP1 to DNA. Extending these findings to a cellular context, we use quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy to show that BRCA2 prevents PARPi-induced PARP1 retention at homologous-recombination repair sites. By contrast, BRCA2-deficient cells exhibit increased PARP1 retention at these lesions in response to PARPi. These results provide mechanistic insights into the role of BRCA2 in maintaining RAD51 stability and protecting homologous-recombination repair sites by mitigating PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention.

 Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most excitatory neurotransmission1. iGluRs are gated by glutamate, where on glutamate binding, they open their ion channels to enable cation influx into postsynaptic neurons, initiating signal transduction1,2. The structural mechanics of how glutamate gating occurs in full-length iGluRs is not well understood. Here, using the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid subtype iGluR (AMPAR), we identify the glutamate-gating mechanism. AMPAR activation by glutamate is augmented at physiological temperatures. By preparing AMPARs for cryogenic-electron microscopy at these temperatures, we captured the glutamate-gating mechanism. Activation by glutamate initiates ion channel opening that involves all ion channel helices hinging away from the pore axis in a motif that is conserved across all iGluRs. Desensitization occurs when the local dimer pairs decouple and enables closure of the ion channel below through restoring the channel hinges and refolding the channel gate. Our findings define how glutamate gates iGluRs, provide foundations for therapeutic design and demonstrate how physiological temperatures can alter iGluR function.

 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) underlie human pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration1,2. However, the proteins that sense ROS levels and regulate their production through their cysteine residues remain ill defined. Here, using systematic base-editing and computational screens, we identify cysteines in VPS35, a member of the retromer trafficking complex3, that phenocopy inhibition of mitochondrial translation when mutated. We find that VPS35 underlies a reactive metabolite-sensing pathway that lowers mitochondrial translation to decrease ROS levels. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide oxidizes cysteine residues in VPS35, resulting in retromer dissociation from endosomal membranes and subsequent plasma membrane remodelling. We demonstrate that plasma membrane localization of the retromer substrate SLC7A1 is required to sustain mitochondrial translation. Furthermore, decreasing VPS35 levels or oxidation of its ROS-sensing cysteines confers resistance to ROS-generating chemotherapies, including cisplatin, in ovarian cancer models. Thus, we identify that intracellular ROS levels are communicated to the plasma membrane through VPS35 to regulate mitochondrial translation, connecting cytosolic ROS sensing to mitochondrial ROS production.

 Meningomyelocele (also known as spina bifida) is considered to be a genetically complex disease resulting from a failure of the neural tube to close. Individuals with meningomyelocele display neuromotor disability and frequent hydrocephalus, requiring ventricular shunting. A few genes have been proposed to contribute to disease susceptibility, but beyond that it remains unexplained1. We postulated that de novo mutations under purifying selection contribute to the risk of developing meningomyelocele2. Here we recruited a cohort of 851 meningomyelocele trios who required shunting at birth and 732 control trios, and found that de novo likely gene disruption or damaging missense mutations occurred in approximately 22.3% of subjects, with 28% of such variants estimated to contribute to disease risk. The 187 genes with damaging de novo mutations collectively define networks including actin cytoskeleton and microtubule-based processes, Netrin-1 signalling and chromatin-modifying enzymes. Gene validation demonstrated partial or complete loss of function, impaired signalling and defective closure of the neural tube in Xenopus embryos.

 The shortage of donors is a major challenge for transplantation; however, organs from genetically modified pigs can serve as ideal supplements1,2. Until now, porcine hearts and kidneys have been successively transplanted into humans3–7. In this study, heterotopic auxiliary transplantation was used to donate a six-gene-edited pig liver to a brain-dead recipient. The graft function, haemodynamics, and immune and inflammatory responses of the recipient were monitored over the subsequent 10 days. Two hours after portal vein reperfusion of the xenograft, goldish bile was produced, increasing to 66.5 ml by postoperative day 10. Porcine liver-derived albumin also increased after surgery. Alanine aminotransferase levels remained in the normal range, while aspartate aminotransferase levels increased on postoperative day 1 and then rapidly declined. Blood flow velocity in the porcine hepatic artery and portal and hepatic veins remained at an acceptable level. Although platelet numbers decreased early after surgery, they ultimately returned to normal levels. Histological analyses showed that the porcine liver regenerated capably with no signs of rejection. T cell activity was inhibited by anti-thymocyte globulin administration, and B cell activation increased 3 days after surgery and was then inhibited by rituximab. There were no significant peri-operative changes in immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M levels. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were initially elevated and then quickly declined. The xenograft remained functional until study completion.

 Limited strategies exist for chemical recycling of commodity diene polymers, like those found in tyres1–3. Here we apply C–H amination and backbone rearrangement of polymers to deconstruct these materials into precursors for epoxy resins. Specifically, we develop a sulfur diimide reagent4,5 that enables up to about 35% allylic amination of diene polymers and rubber. Then, we apply the cationic 2-aza-Cope rearrangement to deconstruct aminated diene polymers. In a model system, we see molecular weight reduction from 58,100 to approximately 400 g mol−1, and aminated post-consumer rubber is deconstructed over 6 hours into soluble amine-functionalized polymers, which can be utilized to prepare epoxy thermosets with similar stiffnesses to commercial bisphenol A-derived resins6. Altogether, this work demonstrates the power of C–H amination and backbone rearrangement to enable chemical recycling of post-consumer materials.

 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control varied processes, including RNA splicing, stability, transport and translation1–3. Dysfunctional RNA–RBP interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of human disease1,4,5; however, characterizing the nature and dynamics of multiprotein assemblies on RNA has been challenging. Here, to address this, non-isotopic ligation-based ultraviolet-light-induced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation6 was combined with mass spectrometry (irCLIP-RNP) to identify RNA-dependent associated proteins (RDAPs) co-bound to RNA with any RBP of interest. irCLIP-RNP defined landscapes of multimeric protein assemblies on RNA, revealing patterns of RBP–RNA associations, including cell-type-selective combinatorial relationships between RDAPs and primary RBPs. irCLIP-RNP also defined dynamic RDAP remodelling in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), revealing that EGF-induced recruitment of UPF1 adjacent to HNRNPC promotes splicing surveillance of cell proliferation mRNAs. To identify the RNAs simultaneously co-bound by multiple studied RBPs, a sequential immunoprecipitation irCLIP (Re-CLIP) method was also developed. Re-CLIP confirmed binding relationships observed in irCLIP-RNP and identified HNRNPC and UPF1 RBP co-binding on RND3 and DDX3X mRNAs. irCLIP-RNP and Re-CLIP provide a framework to identify and characterize dynamic RNA–protein assemblies in living cells.

 Lasso peptides (biologically active molecules with a distinct structurally constrained knotted fold) are natural products that belong to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides1–3. Lasso peptides act on several bacterial targets4,5, but none have been reported to inhibit the ribosome, one of the main targets of antibiotics in the bacterial cell6,7. Here we report the identification and characterization of the lasso peptide antibiotic lariocidin and its internally cyclized derivative lariocidin B, produced by Paenibacillus sp. M2, which has broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial pathogens. We show that lariocidins inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with protein synthesis. Structural, genetic and biochemical data show that lariocidins bind at a unique site in the small ribosomal subunit, where they interact with the 16S ribosomal RNA and aminoacyl-tRNA, inhibiting translocation and inducing miscoding. Lariocidin is unaffected by common resistance mechanisms, has a low propensity for generating spontaneous resistance, shows no toxicity to human cells, and has potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Our identification of ribosome-targeting lasso peptides uncovers new routes towards the discovery of alternative protein-synthesis inhibitors and offers a novel chemical scaffold for the development of much-needed antibacterial drugs.

 Hardware implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs)—the most advanced of which are made of millions of electronic neurons interconnected by hundreds of millions of electronic synapses—have achieved higher energy efficiency than classical computers in some small-scale data-intensive computing tasks1. State-of-the-art neuromorphic computers, such as Intel’s Loihi2 or IBM’s NorthPole3, implement ANNs using bio-inspired neuron- and synapse-mimicking circuits made of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, at least 18 per neuron and six per synapse. Simplifying the structure and size of these two building blocks would enable the construction of more sophisticated, larger and more energy-efficient ANNs. Here we show that a single CMOS transistor can exhibit neural and synaptic behaviours if biased in a specific (unconventional) manner. By connecting one additional CMOS transistor in series, we build a versatile 2-transistor-cell that exhibits adjustable neuro-synaptic response (which we named neuro-synaptic random access memory cell, or NS-RAM cell). This electronic performance comes with a yield of 100% and an ultra-low device-to-device variability, owing to the maturity of the silicon CMOS platform used—no materials or devices alien to the CMOS process are required. These results represent a short-term solution for the implementation of efficient ANNs and an opportunity in terms of CMOS circuit design and optimization for artificial intelligence applications.

 Carbohydrates are an abundant, inexpensive and renewable biomass feedstock that could be a cornerstone for sustainable chemical manufacturing, but scalable and environmentally friendly methods that leverage these feedstocks are lacking. For example, 1-allyl sorbitol is the foundational building block for the polypropylene clarifying agent Millad NX 8000, which is produced on the multi-metric ton scale annually, but the manufacturing process at present requires superstoichiometric amounts of tin1,2. The NX 8000 additives dominate about 80% of the global clarified polypropylene market3 and are used in concentrations of 0.01–1% during polypropylene production to improve its transparency and resistance to high temperatures, translating to 300–30,000 metric tons annually. The market volume of polypropylene in 2022 was approximately 79.01 million metric tons (MMT), with demand expected to rise by nearly 33% to 105 MMT by 2030 (ref. 4). The cost and sustainability benefits of clarified polypropylene are driving this demand, necessitating more clarifying agents5. Here we report a high-yielding allylation of unprotected carbohydrates in water using a catalytic amount of indium metal and either allylboronic acid or the pinacol ester (allylBpin) as donors. Aldohexoses, aminohexoses, ketohexoses and aldopentoses are all allylated in high yield under mild conditions and the indium metal is recoverable and reusable with no loss of catalytic activity. Leveraging these features, this process was translated to a scalable continuous synthesis of 1-allyl sorbitol in flow6 with high yield and productivity through Bayesian optimization of reaction parameters.

 An increased level of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit-α (eIF2α, encoded by EIF2S1; eIF2α-p) coupled with decreased guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B is a hallmark of the ‘canonical’ integrated stress response (c-ISR)1. It is unclear whether impaired eIF2B activity in human diseases including leukodystrophies2, which occurs in the absence of eIF2α-p induction, is synonymous with the c-ISR. Here we describe a mechanism triggered by decreased eIF2B activity, distinct from the c-ISR, which we term the split ISR (s-ISR). The s-ISR is characterized by translational and transcriptional programs that are different from those observed in the c-ISR. Opposite to the c-ISR, the s-ISR requires eIF4E-dependent translation of the upstream open reading frame 1 and subsequent stabilization of ATF4 mRNA. This is followed by altered expression of a subset of metabolic genes (for example, PCK2), resulting in metabolic rewiring required to maintain cellular bioenergetics when eIF2B activity is attenuated. Overall, these data demonstrate a plasticity of the mammalian ISR, whereby the loss of eIF2B activity in the absence of eIF2α-p induction activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis to maintain energy homeostasis. A study describes the split integrated stress response, a cellular stress response mechanism characterized by reduced eIF2B activity without eIF2α phosphorylation, which activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis, enabling metabolic reprogramming."

 The coronavirus membrane protein (M) is the main organizer of coronavirus assembly1–3. Here, we report on an M-targeting molecule, CIM-834, that blocks the assembly of SARS-CoV-2. CIM-834 was obtained through high-throughput phenotypic antiviral screening followed by medicinal-chemistry efforts and target elucidation. CIM-834 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (including a broad panel of variants) and SARS-CoV. In SCID mice and Syrian hamsters intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, oral treatment reduced lung viral titres to nearly undetectable levels, even (as shown in mice) when treatment was delayed until 24 h before the end point. Treatment of infected hamsters prevented transmission to untreated sentinels. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that virion assembly is completely absent in cells treated with CIM-834. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals that CIM-834 binds and stabilizes the M protein in its short form, thereby preventing the conformational switch to the long form, which is required for successful particle assembly. In conclusion, we have discovered a new druggable target in the replication cycle of coronaviruses and a small molecule that potently inhibits it.

 Liver regeneration after hepatectomy follows accurate coordination with the body’s specific requirements1–3. However, the molecular mechanisms, factors and particular hepatocyte population influencing its efficiency remain unclear. Here we report on a unique regeneration mechanism involving unconventional RPB5 prefoldin interactor 1 (URI1), which exclusively colocalizes with, binds to and activates glutamine synthase (GS) in pericentral hepatocytes. Genetic GS or URI1 depletion in mouse pericentral hepatocytes increases circulating glutamate levels, accelerating liver regeneration after two-third hepatectomy. Conversely, mouse hepatocytic URI1 overexpression hinders liver restoration, which can be reversed by elevating glutamate through supplementation or genetic GS depletion. Glutamate metabolically reprograms bone-marrow-derived macrophages, stabilizing HIF1α, which transcriptionally activates WNT3 to promote YAP1-dependent hepatocyte proliferation, boosting liver regeneration. GS regulation by URI1 is a mechanism that maintains optimal glutamate levels, probably to spatiotemporally fine-tune liver growth in accordance with the body’s homeostasis and nutrient supply. Accordingly, in acute and chronic injury models, including in cirrhotic mice with low glutamate levels and in early mortality after liver resection, as well as in mice undergoing 90% hepatectomy, glutamate addition enhances hepatocyte proliferation and survival. Furthermore, URI1 and GS expression co-localize in human hepatocytes and correlate with WNT3 in immune cells across liver disease stages. Glutamate supplementation may therefore support liver regeneration, benefiting patients awaiting transplants or recovering from hepatectomy.

 The eukaryotic circadian clock keeps time by using a transcription–translation feedback loop, which exhibits an architecture that is conserved across a diverse range of organisms, including fungi, plants and animals1. Despite their mechanistic similarity, the molecular components of these clocks indicate a lack of common ancestry2. Our study reveals that RUVBL2, which is a P-loop NTPase enzyme previously shown to affect circadian phase and amplitude as part of mammalian clock super-complexes, influences the circadian period through its remarkably slow ATPase activity, resembling the well-characterized KaiC-based clock in cyanobacteria. A screen of RUVBL2 variants identified arrhythmic, short-period and long-period mutants that altered circadian locomotor activity rhythms following delivery by adeno-associated virus to the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus. Enzymatic assays showed that wild-type RUVBL2 hydrolyses only around 13 ATP molecules a day, a vastly reduced turnover compared with typical ATPases. Notably, physical interactions between RUVBL2 orthologues and core clock proteins in humans, Drosophila and the fungus Neurospora, along with consistent circadian phenotypes of RUVBL2-mutant orthologues across species, reinforce their clock-related function in eukaryotes. Thus, as well as establishing RUVBL2 as a common core component in eukaryotic clocks, our study supports the idea that slow ATPase activity, initially discovered in cyanobacteria, is a shared feature of eukaryotic clocks.

 Human activities drive a wide range of environmental pressures, including habitat change, pollution and climate change, resulting in unprecedented effects on biodiversity1,2. However, despite decades of research, generalizations on the dimensions and extent of human impacts on biodiversity remain ambiguous. Mixed views persist on the trajectory of biodiversity at the local scale3 and even more so on the biotic homogenization of biodiversity across space4,5. We compiled 2,133 publications covering 97,783 impacted and reference sites, creating an unparallelled dataset of 3,667 independent comparisons of biodiversity impacts across all main organismal groups, habitats and the five most predominant human pressures1,6. For all comparisons, we quantified three key measures of biodiversity to assess how these human pressures drive homogenization and shifts in composition of biological communities across space and changes in local diversity, respectively. We show that human pressures distinctly shift community composition and decrease local diversity across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Yet, contrary to long-standing expectations, there is no clear general homogenization of communities. Critically, the direction and magnitude of biodiversity changes vary across pressures, organisms and scales at which they are studied. Our exhaustive global analysis reveals the general impact and key mediating factors of human pressures on biodiversity and can benchmark conservation strategies.

 Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) powers brain activity1,2, and mitochondrial defects are linked to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders3,4. To understand the basis of brain activity and behaviour, there is a need to define the molecular energetic landscape of the brain5–10. Here, to bridge the scale gap between cognitive neuroscience and cell biology, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes, including OXPHOS enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains diverse mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared with white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. Moreover, the mitochondria in grey matter are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backwards linear regression model that integrates several neuroimaging modalities11 to generate a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization. This model predicted mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain function. This resource also relates to neuroimaging data and defines the subcellular basis for regionalized brain processes relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

 Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which specifically express the master transcription factor FOXP3, have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis and have the potential to revolutionize cell therapies for autoimmune diseases1–3. Although stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-2 can induce FOXP3+ Treg cells in vitro (iTreg cells), the resulting cells are often unstable and have thus far hampered translational efforts4–6. A systematic approach towards understanding the regulatory networks that dictate Treg differentiation could lead to more effective iTreg cell-based therapies. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to catalogue gene regulatory determinants of FOXP3 induction in primary human T cells and characterized their effects at single-cell resolution using Perturb-icCITE-seq. We identify the RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex as a novel, context-specific negative regulator of FOXP3 expression. RBPJ-targeted knockout enhanced iTreg differentiation and function, independent of canonical Notch signalling. Repeated cytokine and T cell receptor signalling stimulation in vitro revealed that RBPJ-deficient iTreg cells exhibit increased phenotypic stability compared with control cells through DNA demethylation of the FOXP3 enhancer CNS2, reinforcing FOXP3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of RBPJ potently suppressed FOXP3 induction through direct modulation of FOXP3 histone acetylation by HDAC3. Finally, RBPJ-ablated human iTreg cells more effectively suppressed xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease than control iTreg cells in a humanized mouse model. Together, our findings reveal novel regulators of FOXP3 and point towards new avenues to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for autoimmune disease. The RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex is identified as a negative regulator of FOXP3 expression through modulation of histone acetylation in induced regulatory T cells."

 Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals1. However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity2–4. Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting. This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously3–7, but its neurobiological basis remains unclear. We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity. Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour. Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding. Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity. In mice, prolonged consumption of a high-fat diet decreases interest in calorie-rich foods as a result of reduced neurotensin expression and signalling, which uncouples hedonic feeding behaviour linked to neurons projecting from lateral nucleus accumbens to ventral tegmental area."

 The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons to emotionally salient stimuli are a puzzle1. Existing theories centring on reward2, surprise3, salience4 and uncertainty5 individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory6 with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus7, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value. This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments3,4,8–13, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments3,9—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile. Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories.

 The membrane (M) protein of betacoronaviruses is well conserved and has a key role in viral assembly1,2. Here we describe the identification of JNJ-9676, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the coronavirus M protein. JNJ-9676 demonstrates in vitro nanomolar antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and sarbecovirus strains from bat and pangolin zoonotic origin. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a binding pocket of JNJ-9676 formed by the transmembrane domains of the M protein dimer. Compound binding stabilized the M protein dimer in an altered conformational state between its long and short forms, preventing the release of infectious virus. In a pre-exposure Syrian golden hamster model, JNJ-9676 (25 mg per kg twice per day) showed excellent efficacy, illustrated by a significant reduction in viral load and infectious virus in the lung by 3.5 and 4 log10-transformed RNA copies and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per mg lung, respectively. Histopathology scores at this dose were reduced to the baseline. In a post-exposure hamster model, JNJ-9676 was efficacious at 75 mg per kg twice per day even when added at 48 h after infection, when peak viral loads were observed. The M protein is an attractive antiviral target to block coronavirus replication, and JNJ-9676 represents an interesting chemical series towards identifying clinical candidates addressing the current and future coronavirus pandemics.

Reiser,Connectome-driven neural inventory of a complete visual system,"A connectome of the right optic lobe from a male fruitfly is presented together with an extensive collection of genetic drivers matched to a comprehensive neuron-type catalogue. 
 Vision provides animals with detailed information about their surroundings and conveys diverse features such as colour, form and movement across the visual scene. Computing these parallel spatial features requires a large and diverse network of neurons. Consequently, from flies to humans, visual regions in the brain constitute half its volume. These visual regions often have marked structure–function relationships, with neurons organized along spatial maps and with shapes that directly relate to their roles in visual processing. More than a century of anatomical studies have catalogued in detail cell types in fly visual systems1–3, and parallel behavioural and physiological experiments have examined the visual capabilities of flies. To unravel the diversity of a complex visual system, careful mapping of the neural architecture matched to tools for targeted exploration of this circuitry is essential. Here we present a connectome of the right optic lobe from a male Drosophila melanogaster acquired using focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy. We established a comprehensive inventory of the visual neurons and developed a computational framework to quantify their anatomy. Together, these data establish a basis for interpreting how the shapes of visual neurons relate to spatial vision. By integrating this analysis with connectivity information, neurotransmitter identity and expert curation, we classified the approximately 53,000 neurons into 732 types. These types are systematically described and about half are newly named. Finally, we share an extensive collection of split-GAL4 lines matched to our neuron-type catalogue. Overall, this comprehensive set of tools and data unlocks new possibilities for systematic investigations of vision in Drosophila and provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of sensory processing.

 Accurately interpreting medical images and generating insightful narrative reports is indispensable for patient care but places heavy burdens on clinical experts. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in an area that we refer to as multimodal generative medical image interpretation (GenMI), create opportunities to automate parts of this complex process. In this Perspective, we synthesize progress and challenges in developing AI systems for generation of medical reports from images. We focus extensively on radiology as a domain with enormous reporting needs and research efforts. In addition to analysing the strengths and applications of new models for medical report generation, we advocate for a novel paradigm to deploy GenMI in a manner that empowers clinicians and their patients. Initial research suggests that GenMI could one day match human expert performance in generating reports across disciplines, such as radiology, pathology and dermatology. However, formidable obstacles remain in validating model accuracy, ensuring transparency and eliciting nuanced impressions. If carefully implemented, GenMI could meaningfully assist clinicians in improving quality of care, enhancing medical education, reducing workloads, expanding specialty access and providing real-time expertise.

 Cosmic reionization began when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe1,2. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 Myr old3–5. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-α (Ly-α), the principal hydrogen transition6–9. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES10) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveals a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly-α, as well as a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EWLy-α > 40 Å (rest frame), previously only seen at z < 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium becomes increasingly ionized11. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly-α emission indicates that the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionizing photons. This suggests that massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus have created an early reionized region to prevent complete extinction of Ly-α, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang.

 CD8+ T cell immune responses are critical for combating infectious diseases and tumours1–3. Antigen cross-presentation, primarily occurring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of dendritic cells, is essential for protein-based vaccines to induce CD8+ T cell responses4. Current efforts have focused on antigen delivery at the tissue and cellular levels, whereas subcellular delivery has been limited to facilitating antigen escape from lysosomes into the cytosol. In the absence of a small-sized high-affinity ER-targeting molecule, the importance of the ‘last mile’ from the cytosol to the ER remains elusive. Here we developed stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist-based ER-targeting molecules (SABER), which effectively deliver antigens to the ER and cluster key machinery in cross-presentation to form microreactors by folding the ER membrane. Conjugation of SABER to various antigens substantially enhances the induction of CD8+ T cell immune responses to tumour neoantigens and conserved viral epitopes, far exceeding that achieved by mixtures of antigens with STING agonists or conventional adjuvants. SABER also retains a potent adjuvant effect, effectively enhancing the ability of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. This study provides a high-affinity ER-targeting delivery system and vaccine adjuvant, demonstrating that precise subcellular delivery targeting the last mile of cross-presentation can lead to a qualitative leap.

 As Earth warms, regional climate signals are accumulating. Some signals, for example, land warming more than the ocean and the Arctic warming the most, were expected and successfully predicted. Underlying this success was the application of physical laws under the assumption that large and small spatial scales are well separated. This established what we call the standard approach, climate science’s dominant paradigm. With additional warming, however, discrepancies between real-world signals and expectations based on this standard approach are piling up, especially at regional scales. At the same time, disruptive computational approaches are advancing new paradigms. Philosophers of science characterize situations where accumulating discrepancies (anomalies) and disruptions lead to a loss of confidence in the dominant paradigm as a ‘crisis’. Here we articulate what we consider to be the dominant paradigm, or standard approach, and the discrepancies and disruptions that have emerged in recent years. The policy implications of a purported crisis are discussed, as well as paths forward, crisis or no crisis. These paths include using signals to test assumptions and processes driving a warming Earth for the first time, developing testable hypotheses, and revitalizing conceptual thinking by filling gaps across climate-system components and spatial scales.

Here, the authors report lanthanide single atom catalysts with the transition ability from bridge to linear adsorption that exhibit efficient CO production. 
 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO2 utilization, but achieving facile CO2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. As a result, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency of ~130,000 h−1 at 500 mA cm−2. Moreover, 34.7% full-cell energy efficiency and 70.4% single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency are obtained at 200 mA cm−2 with acidic electrolyte. This catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO2-to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.

 The coexistence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and depression is a prominent example of multimorbidity. In previous work, we reported the results of a completed cluster-randomized controlled trial that was conducted in eight community health centers in China. We enrolled adults (≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes and depressive symptoms. In the intervention group, a comprehensive care plan was developed based on the Integrated Care Model for Patients with Diabetes and Depression (CIC-PDD). In this study, we explore the cost-effectiveness of the CIC-PDD by conducting a one-year within-trial economic evaluation from the health system, multipayer and societal perspectives. Health outcomes are quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and depression-free days (DFDs), and we calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness probability. Among 630 participants (275 intervention, 355 usual care), the cost per QALY gained is $7,922.82, $7,823.85, and $7,409.46, with cost-effectiveness probabilities of 66.41%- 94.45%. The cost per DFD is $2.63–$2.82, requiring a willingness-to-pay of $9.00–$10.50 for >95% probability of cost-effectiveness.

 In order to advance the silicon integrated circuit technology, researchers have been searching for memory and logic devices with new physical state variables other than charge. Spin logic device that adds one degree of freedom-electron spin to charge has been considered as a promising candidate due to its low power consumption, built-in memory, and high scalability. Here, we demonstrate that a new variable – current direction on the sample can be introduced into the spin logic operation. The current direction of the sample is considered as a vector. For the various input currents along different directions, the direction of vector sum (vector adder) determines the output and therefore can enable complex logic functions. We have realized the basic Boolean logic gates including AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and even complicated IMPLY in a single device and further constructed a full adder with only 2 devices.

Keenan,A pronounced decline in northern vegetation resistance to flash droughts from 2001 to 2022,"More frequent rapid-onset droughts, “flash droughts”, threaten ecosystem stability in a warming climate. This study shows that northern hemisphere vegetation has been increasingly sensitive to flash droughts with faster declining rates since the early 2000s. 
 Climate change has led to the transition of droughts into rapid and intensified phenomena known as flash droughts, presenting considerable challenges for risk management, particularly concerning their impact on ecosystem productivity. Quantifying the ecosystem’s capacity to maintain productivity during flash droughts, referred to as ecosystem resistance, is crucial to assess drought impacts. However, it remains uncertain how the resistance of ecosystem productivity to flash drought changes over time. Here we show that vegetation resistance to flash droughts declines by up to 27% (±5%) over the Northern Hemisphere hotspots during 2001-2022, including eastern Asia, western North America, and northern Europe. The notable decline in vegetation resistance is mainly attributed to increased vapour pressure deficit and temperature, and enhanced vegetation structural sensitivity to water availability. Flash droughts pose higher ecological risks than slowly-developing droughts during the growing seasons, where ecosystem productivity experiences faster decline rates with a shorter response time. Our results underscore the limited ecosystem capacity to resist flash droughts under climate change. More frequent rapid-onset droughts, “flash droughts”, threaten ecosystem stability in a warming climate. This study shows that northern hemisphere vegetation has been increasingly sensitive to flash droughts with faster declining rates since the early 2000s."

The authors identify drug & substrate binding sites, and explain substrate diversity and the fitness cost of resistance. 
 The Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) is a key protein contributing to resistance against the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ). Mutations such as K76T enable PfCRT to transport CQ away from its target in the parasite’s digestive vacuole, but this comes at a cost to its natural peptide transport function. This creates fitness costs which can drive changes to drug susceptibility in parasite populations, but the molecular basis of this is not well understood. To investigate, here we run 130 μs of molecular dynamics simulations of CQ-sensitive and CQ-resistant PfCRT isoforms with CQ and peptide substrates. We identify the CQ binding site and characterized diverse peptide binding modes. The K76T mutation allows CQ to access the binding site but disrupts peptide binding, highlighting the importance of cavity charge in determining substrate specificity. This study provides insight into PfCRT polyspecific peptide transport and will aid in rational, structure-based inhibitor design.

Cryo-EM analysis of the actinoporin Fav pore reveals octameric structure binding 112 lipids and clusters of cholesterols. Molecular simulations highlight complex protein-lipid interactions crucial for structure. 
 The structure and function of membrane proteins depend on their interactions with lipids that constitute membranes. Actinoporins are α-pore-forming proteins that bind preferentially to sphingomyelin-containing membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane, reveal the roles of lipids, and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms a cluster of four molecules associated with each protomer.

Here, the authors propose and demonstrate a way to embed noise characterisation in classical shadow estimation of nonlocal properties, enabling an efficient way to extract information from noisy quantum systems. 
 Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is crucial for quantum information processing. Classical shadows enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Introducing a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements improves sample efficiency for high-weight Pauli observables and low-rank properties. However, in practice, these circuits can be noisy and bias the measurement results. Here, we propose the robust shallow shadows, which employs Bayesian inference to learn and mitigate noise in postprocessing. We analyze noise effects on sample complexity and the optimal circuit depth. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of error mitigation under a wide class of noise processes. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum processor confirms the advantage of our method, even in the presence of realistic noise, over single-qubit measurements for predicting diverse state properties, such as fidelity and entanglement entropy. Our protocol thus offers a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient method for quantum state characterization on near-term quantum devices.

 Energy level mismatches between semiconductors and cocatalysts often induce carrier recombination, limiting photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) efficiency. Here, we integrate Pt nanocluster-Fe single-atom pairs with CuO to regulate both solid-solid and solid-liquid interfaces in PEC systems. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that an Ohmic contact at the CuO/Pt interface accelerates electron extraction, while Pt-to-Fe charge transfer enhances oxygen reduction at Fe sites, collectively boosting reaction kinetics.

Here the authors introduce catalytic hydrogen isotope exchange to water distillation, realizing excellent detritiation performance. 
 Tritiated water emissions from nuclear facilities pose significant environmental risks and threaten the sustainability of nuclear energy. However, deep detritiation remains a major challenge due to the nearly indistinguishable physicochemical properties among water isotopologues. Here we present an efficient hydrogen isotope separation process based on catalytic proton exchange. The unique catalysis-promoted proton-transfer pathway found in a metal–organic framework (MIL-101(Cr)) significantly lowers the isotope exchange energy barrier to a previously unachieved level. Incorporating MIL-101(Cr) into a water distillation (WD) system enables a solid–liquid–gas triphasic mass transfer that overcomes the thermodynamic constraints of traditional WD, which relies on a liquid–gas biphasic isotope exchange. The height equivalent to the theoretical plate of the established WD prototype fell by half compared to the existing WD systems, thus increasing the separation efficiency by over four orders of magnitude in a 10-m distillation tower. This work offers an industrially viable and scalable option for cleaning up tritiated water. It is extremely difficult to separate tritium from radioactively contaminated water.

 The Sustainable Development Goals Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), equipped with the Glimmer Imager (GLI), provides high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data across multiple spectral bands. Thus, it can notably monitor human dynamics and light pollution with enhanced spectral and spatial resolution. However, cloud cover and low-quality observations often contaminate the SDGSAT-1 GLI NTL data, limiting its effectiveness. This challenge is addressed by the development of a novel method, namely the SpatioTemporal And spectRal gap-filling method for Sdgsat-1 (STARS) GLI NTL images, which combines spatiotemporal and spectral information to generate cloud-free NTL images with satisfactory pixel brightness and continuity. STARS is the first method to effectively address gap-filling in multiband NTL data using RGB spectral information, even with irregular time intervals and limited image inputs. Compared with traditional methods such as the temporal gap-filling method and the mean-weighted gap-filling method, the Cloud Removing bY Synergizing spatioTemporAL information (CRYSTAL) method, and the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), which do not specifically account for the differences in light source variations in multi-band NTL data, STARS demonstrates superior performance (higher R-squared (R2) and lower root-mean-square error (RMSE)) in simulations across seven global cities, demonstrating its effectiveness in filling cloud-induced gaps in multi-band NTL data. On average, STARS achieves R2 values for the gap-filling results compared to the actual values of 0.79, 0.78, and 0.70 in the RGB bands, respectively. The cloud-free images produced by STARS extend the time series of the SDGSAT-1 GLI NTL data, supporting multitemporal quantitative analysis. In cloudy regions like Tianjin, China, STARS effectively captures dynamic changes in NTL before and after the Spring Festival, closely matching human activity patterns from Baidu Maps, both spatially and temporally. Overall, STARS offers an innovative and effective approach for gap-filling multiband NTL data, with potential applications in similar datasets."

 Dust is one of the key factors influencing photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The ability to accurately capture PV dust information is essential for PV operation and sustainable utilization. This study employs uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging to monitor PV dust deposition. To address the problems of information redundancy in hyperspectral data and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) easily falling into local optimum, a high-precision UAV hyperspectral PV dust estimation method is proposed.

 High-quality, full-coverage topographic bathymetric data is crucial for marine economic development and ecological environment protection. Due to the complex environment of land-sea transition zone, it is challenging to acquire comprehensive bathymetric topography using a single sensor. Multiplatform topographic bathymetric technology, such as airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) and multibeam echo sounding (MBES), whose point clouds can be integrated to construct a complete model of land-sea transition zone. However, point cloud data from different sources may have certain differences in the digital description of the same target. Meanwhile, affected by factors such as registration error and sensor system error, there are data gaps in the registered point cloud, which hinders the subsequent reconstruction. To overcome these problems, a fusion method combining a pseudo-grid model is proposed to construct a high-quality, seamless topographic-bathymetric map. This paper’s contribution identifies non-overlapping ALB regions and generates anti-noise MBES simulated points (SPs) by constructing a pseudo-grid. Moreover, this paper focuses on establishing a point-to-SP model to eliminate the gaps and reduce the impact of registration errors on the fusion accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, four typical samples along with six reference samples exhibiting diverse features collected from Ganquan Island in the South China Sea are utilized in the experiment. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve ideal results in terms of the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the six reference samples, which is reduced from 0.41 m to 0.19 m.

 Water depth (H), bottom reflectance (Rbλ), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) and seawater transparency (SDD) are key parameters in assessing shallow benthic habitats. However, due to limited in-situ data, restricted hyperspectral imagery or dynamic water quality, it is challenging to develop a generalized remote sensing model for decoupling water column and benthic signals across diverse regions and time periods. In this study, a Modified Log rotation Ratio and Semi-analytical (MLR-S) model is proposed for diffuse attenuation coefficient Kdλ retrieval by adjusting inherent optical properties (P, G, X), from widely used four-band multispectral images without relying on truth data. A new Binary Quadratic Polynomial Relationship (BQPR) between P and the logarithmic values of blue-green bands was developed upon a sparse set of self-inferred points (SIPs). Then, large-scale and optimal Kdλ was determined. Finally, using the monthly mean water column reflectance dataset MMCRwλ constructed from 23-year MODIS data, Rbλ, Chl and SDD can be efficiently derived. Synchronous validation at Dazhou Island confirmed the effectiveness of the MLR-S model, with mean relative errors of 23.77%, 15.26% and 9.91% for blue, green and red Rb, respectively, and 36.69% for Chl. Further validation of Rbλ in Heron Reef, Aitutaki Island and Buck Island demonstrated the model’s robustness across diverse habitats. Compared to the ICESat-2 Along Track Benthic Reflectance (ATBR) model, the MLR-S model yielded more reasonable and reliable Rbλ in deeper waters. Additionally, it outperformed the traditional semi-analytical model, achieving greater accuracy while being over 100 times more computationally efficient.

 Mapping environmental variables is crucial for natural resource management. Researchers and scholars have continually advanced this field with modern techniques such as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), Deep Learning (DL), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) models. While effective, these models often present a significant challenge due to their black nature, which obscures the process of generating final maps from raw data. Recent theoretical breakthroughs have shown that white/grey-box models can achieve the same level of accuracy as these advanced techniques, debunking the belief that complex models are necessarily the most accurate. Based on these findings, we have developed a methodology that employs a series of statistical tests and data analytics to identify essential features hidden in spatial data in order to assess the predictive model (of white/grey kind) that best approximates underlying spatial processes. This methodology profiles the model that better adapts to the data, aiding in the selection of the simplest model that achieves the desired accuracy, functioning similarly to a recommender system for model selection. Furthermore, the set of permissible models includes only regressive-like ones to clarify the data’s contribution to map construction and can be applied to a wide range of datasets. By reducing complexity, this approach enhances the transparency of the model’s results. Real-world dataset demonstrates this methodology’s remarkable ability to produce highly accurate results."

 Mapping forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for monitoring forest ecosystems and assessing the success of conservation initiatives such as the REDD + carbon projects. Traditional field-based approaches to measuring AGB, however, face significant challenges, due to high financial costs and logistical constraints. Remote sensing, including both active and passive sensors, presents a promising and cost-effective alternative, yet its practical utility and accuracy for capturing forest AGB in diverse and complex ecosystems remains largely unexplored. This research used an extensive national forest inventory (NFI) dataset to evaluate the ability to map the AGB of the Miombo woodlands in Zambia across four agro-ecological zones using both multi-seasonal SAR (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8 OLI) imagery. A multi-level experiment was designed to (i) compare the accuracy of AGB estimation using SAR and optical data when used independently, and in combination, using a Random Forest regression model, (ii) assess the effect of seasonality on the accuracy of AGB estimation when using SAR and optical datasets, and (iii) evaluate the effect of variation in climatic and environmental conditions on AGB estimation. Experimental results show that multi-seasonal images (across the rainy, hot and dry seasons) outperformed single-season and annual images. Combining SAR backscatter in the hot season, optical bands in the dry season, and vegetation indices in the hot season produced the most accurate AGB model (R = 0.69, MAE = 14.01 Mg ha−1 and RMSE = 18.23 Mg ha−1). The models performed distinctly across different agro-ecological zones (R = 0.44 – 0.79), suggesting that fitting local models could be beneficial. These results based on the extensive NFI of Zambia demonstrate that seasonal effects and fitting local models can lead to more accurate AGB estimation within the Miombo woodlands, which is of significance for ongoing REDD + carbon projects in Zambia and other African countries."

 Validating forest cover maps is essential for evidence-based conservation and sustaining ecosystem services. However, complex spatial patterns in fragmented tropical forest landscapes—often comprising non-contiguous forest patches, interspersed with agricultural lands and other land cover types—pose considerable difficulties for accuracy assessment using conventional techniques. To address this, we developed an integrated object-based sampling (IOBS) method that combines stratified random sampling, proportional allocation, and sample distance optimization. The IOBS method was applied to assess the accuracy of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) global 25 m PALSAR-2/PALSAR forest/non-forest (FNF) 2020 map across 14 ecoregions in Nigeria. Its performance was compared to simple random, systematic, and stratified random sampling using the coefficient of variation (CV), heterogeneity index (HI), and true accuracy metrics. IOBS demonstrated substantially higher spatial variability (CV = 109.37) and heterogeneity (HI = 0.21) compared to other methods (CV = 28.84–53.93, HI = 0.05–0.11). The IOBS estimated an accuracy of 81.1 %, closely aligning with the true accuracy of 82.4 % and outperforming other methods (75.3 %–79.7 %). The higher performance of IOBS stems from its ability to capture a broad range of forest conditions—from extensive contiguous cover to small, fragmented patches—while minimizing spatial autocorrelation through distance optimization. By better representing local heterogeneity, IOBS offers a robust and precise framework for validating categorical forest cover maps in complex tropical landscapes, advancing accuracy assessment practices for remote sensing applications."

Here, we conducted an in vivo screen for vulnerabilities of brain metastasis and identifiedN-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) as a driver of brain metastasis. Knockdown of NAT10 restrains cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. The poorly characterized RNA helicase domain of NAT10 is critical for cell growth in vitro, while both RNA helicase and NAT domains are essential for primary tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NAT10 promotes the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), two enzymes for serine biosynthesis implicated in brain metastasis.

We performed a comprehensive survey of ac4C using metabolic labeling, sodium cyanoborohydride chemical treatment coupled to next-generation sequencing (NGS), and ac4C antibody–based cell and molecular biology techniques. Our analysis shows that NAT10-dependent ac4C-acetylation is robust in rRNA and specific tRNAs but low/spurious in mRNA. It also revealed an inflammatory signature and mutagenesis at transcriptionally active sites in NAT10-KO cells. This finding led us to explore the role of NAT10 in R-loops, which were recently linked to APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis. Our analysis showed that R-loops are ac4C-acetylated in a NAT10-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAT10 restrains the levels of R-loops at a subset of differentially expressed genes in a catalytic activity–dependent manner. Together with cellular biology data showing ac4C-modified RNA in endosomal structures, we propose that increased levels of ac4C-unmodified RNAs, likely derived from R-loops, in endosomal structures induce inflammatory responses."

Here, we found that Ca2+leakage after Mtb phagosome damage in human macrophages is the signal that triggers autophagy-related protein 8/microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (ATG8/LC3) lipidation. Unexpectedly, ATG8/LC3 lipidation did not target Mtb to lysosomes, excluding the canonical xenophagy. Upon Mtb phagosome damage, the Ca2+leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation occurred on multiple membranes instead of single or double membranes excluding the noncanonical autophagy pathways. Mechanistically, Ca2+leakage from the phagosome triggered the recruitment of the V-ATPase–ATG16L1 complex independently of FIP200, ATG13, and proton gradient disruption. Furthermore, the Ca2+leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation limited Mtb phagosome damage and restricted Mtb replication. Together, we uncovered Ca2+leakage as the key signal that triggers ATG8/LC3 lipidation on multiple membranes to mitigate Mtb phagosome damage."

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling and targeted in situ detection to identifyReln(encoding the secreted glycoprotein, Reelin) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal populations within the rat NAc. A CRISPR interference approach enabling selectiveRelnknockdown in the adult NAc altered expression of calcium signaling genes, promoted a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and decreased MSN excitability. Behaviorally,Relnknockdown prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior.

One aspect of this debate is how Hadean zircons fit into an ultramafic environment.

On the basis of the hafnium isotopic evolution of Hadean detrital zircons worldwide, we infer that these interactions allowed for the formation of extensive Hadean felsic crust (4.4 to 4.5 billion years ago), which, in turn, would account for up to 50% of the present continental crustal mass. A similar process may have occurred on Mars.

At templated AP sites, cross-links between the DNA and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell–specific (HMCES) regulate replication fork speed, avoiding cytotoxic double-strand breaks. While the role of HMCES at the template DNA strand is well studied, its effects on nascent DNA are not. We provide evidence that HMCES–DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are detrimental to the BER-mediated removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)–derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine from replication forks. HRD cells have heightened HMCES-DPCs, which increase further upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP sites. HMCES depletion substantially suppresses 5hmdC-mediated replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death in HRD cells. This reveals that HMCES-DPCs are a source of BER-initiated single-stranded DNA gaps, which indicates that endogenous DPCs contribute to genomic instability in HRD tumors."

Here, we systematically evaluate FrCas9, a variant fromFaecalibaculum rodentium, for cell and gene therapy (CGT) applications and compare its performance to SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. OpenCRISPR-1 is a CRISPR system synthesized de novo using large language models (LLMs) but has not yet undergone systematic characterization. Using AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq, we assessed the on-target activity and off-target profiles of these systems across multiple genomic loci. FrCas9 demonstrated higher on-target efficiency and substantially fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. Furthermore, TREX2 fusion with FrCas9 reduced large deletions and translocations, enhancing genomic stability. Through screening of 1903 sgRNAs targeting 21 CGT-relevant genes using sequential AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq analysis, we identified optimal sgRNAs for each gene.

M2 macrophages within the lesion are crucial for SCI recovery. Our previous research revealed that M2 macrophages transfected with magnetotactic bacteria–derivedMms6gene can resist ferroptosis and enhance SCI recovery. To address the limitations of M2 macrophage transplantation, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulatingMms6mRNA targeting macrophages (Mms6mRNA-PS/LNPs). The targeting efficiency and therapeutic effect of these LNPs in SCI mice were evaluated. Intravenous administration ofMms6mRNA-PS/LNPs delivered moreMms6mRNAs to lesion-site macrophages than those in theMms6mRNA-LNP group, which resulted in enhancing motor function recovery, reducing lesion area and scar formation, and promoting neuronal survival and nerve fiber repair. These effects were nullified when macrophages were depleted. These findings suggest that macrophage-targeted delivery ofMms6mRNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting spinal cord repair and motor function recovery in patients with traumatic SCI."

We report RBness as a pan-cancer phenomenon, associated with patient outcome and chemotherapy response in multiple cancer types, and predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor response in estrogen-positive breast cancer. Using RNA interference and a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in isogenic models, we find that RBness cancers also phenocopy synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cells withRB1genomic defects.

Cross-[4+2] cycloadditions offer greater product diversity than traditional diene-dienophile reactions due to multiple possible pathways. However, precise control over regio- and stereoselectivity for various isomers remains a great challenge. This study reports catalyst-controlled regiodivergent formal cross-cycloadditions of acyclic dienes and enones, significantly enhancing access to diverse pyrazole-fused spirooxindoles. Chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis enables endoselective [4+2] cycloadditions, while Bi(III) with a CPA ligand yields [2+4] products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. A Claisen rearrangement of the [2+4] adduct produces the exo-selective [4+2] product, further increasing stereochemical diversity and enabling the synthesis of six regio- and stereo-isomers from a single substrate set. DFT calculations reveal that Bi(III) reverses regioselectivity by repositioning reactants in the CPA pocket and stabilizing the enone oxygen’s negative charge.

Here, we demonstrate that the PWWP (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain within DNMT3B exhibits remarkable dynamics that enhances the enzyme’s methyltransferase activity upon interactions with a modified histone H3 peptide (H3K4me0K36me3). In the presence of H3K4me0K36me3, both the PWWP and ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domains transition from autoinhibitory to active conformations. In this active state, the PWWP domain most often aligns closely with the catalytic domain, allowing for simultaneous interactions with H3 and DNA to stimulate DNA methylation. The prostate cancer–associated DNMT3B R545C mutant is even more dynamic and susceptible to adopting the active conformation, resulting in aberrant DNA hypermethylation.

The height of this layer is strongly influenced by a local shallow wind. The study also provides information on the pollution chemical composition at different altitudes, including pollution signatures from power plants. 
 Vertical in situ measurements of aerosols and trace gases were conducted in Fairbanks, Alaska, during winter 2022 as part of the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis campaign (ALPACA). Using a tethered balloon, the study explores the dispersion of pollutants in the continental high-latitude stable boundary layer (SBL). Analysis of 24 flights revealed a stratified SBL structure with different pollution layers in the lowest tens of meters of the atmosphere, offering unprecedented detail. Surface emissions generally accumulated in a surface mixing layer (ML) extending to an average of 51 m, with a well-mixed sublayer (MsL) reaching 22 m. The height and concentrations within the ML were strongly influenced by a local wind driven by nearby topography under anticyclonic conditions. During strong radiative cooling, a drainage flow increased turbulence near the surface, altering the temperature profile and deepening the ML. Above the ML, pollution concentrations decreased but showed clear signs of freshly released anthropogenic emissions. Higher in the atmosphere, above elevated inversions, pollution levels were similar to previously reported Arctic haze concentrations, even though Fairbanks' outflow concentrations below elevated inversions were up to 6 times higher, likely due to power plant emissions. In situ measurements indicated that gas and particle tracer ratios in elevated power plant plumes differed significantly from those near the surface. Overall, pollution layers were strongly correlated with the temperature stratification and emission heights, emphasizing the need for improved representation of temperature inversions and emission sources in air quality models to enhance pollution forecasts."

 The risk of water erosion in mainland China is intensifying due to climate change. A high-precision rainfall erosivity dataset is crucial for understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall erosivity and identifying key areas of water erosion. However, due to the limited spatiotemporal resolution of historical precipitation data, there are significant biases in the estimation of rainfall erosivity in China, particularly in regions with complex terrain and climatic conditions. Over the past decade, the China Meteorological Administration has continuously strengthened its ground-based meteorological observation capabilities, establishing a dense network of observation stations. These high-precision precipitation data provide a reliable basis for quantifying rainfall erosivity pattern in China. In this study, rigorous quality control was performed on the 1 min ground observation precipitation data from nearly 70 000 stations nationwide between 2014 and 2022, ultimately selecting data from 60 129 stations. Using the data from these stations, event rainfall erosivity was calculated, producing a national dataset of mean annual rainfall erosivity with a spatial resolution of 0.25°.

DBMI collects macroseismic intensity data from approximately 5,000 Italian earthquakes. However, for the same events, numerous studies have been independently carried out over the years in the literature whose data have not been incorporated into the DBMI. By consolidating all available data for each event, it is possible to significantly enhance the dataset used for hazard assessments and the reconstruction of local seismic histories. This approach would make studies of individual events much more robust and comprehensive.

To help predict how wildfires will change in future, global fire models are being developed. We analyze and further develop one such model, SPITFIRE. Our work identifies and corrects sources of substantial bias in the model that are important to the global fire modelling field. With this analysis and these developments, we help to provide a basis for future improvements. 
 Since its development in 2010, the SPITFIRE global fire model has had a substantial impact on the field of fire modelling using dynamic global vegetation models. It includes process-based representations of fire dynamics, including ignitions, fire spread, and fire effects, resulting in a holistic representation of fire on a global scale. Previously, work had been undertaken to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SPITFIRE and similar models by comparing their outputs against remotely sensed data. We seek to augment this work with new validation methods and extend it by completing a thorough review of the theory underlying the SPITFIRE model to better identify and understand sources of modelling uncertainty. We find several points of improvement in the model, the most impactful being an incorrect implementation of the Rothermel fire spread model that results in large positive biases in fire rate of spread and a live grass moisture parametrization that results in unrealistically dry grasses. The combination of these issues leads to excessively large and intense fires, particularly on the dry modelled grasslands. Because of the tall flames present in these intense fires, which can cause substantial damage to tree crowns, these issues bias SPITFIRE toward high tree mortality. We resolve these issues by correcting the implementation of the Rothermel model and implementing a new live grass moisture parametrization, in addition to several other improvements, including a multi-day fire spread algorithm, and evaluate these changes in the European domain. Our model developments allow SPITFIRE to incorporate more realistic live grass moisture content and result in more accurate burnt area on grasslands and reduced tree mortality. This work provides a crucial improvement to the theoretical basis of the SPITFIRE model and a foundation upon which future model improvements may be built. In addition, this work further supports these model developments by  highlighting areas in the model where high amounts of uncertainty remain, based on new analysis and existing knowledge about the SPITFIRE model, and by identifying potential means of mitigating them to a greater extent."

In this work, we propose a statistical model to describe the most likely background level and the associated uncertainty in a network of dose rate detectors. We train, verify, and validate the model using real environmental data. Using the model, we show that we can correctly predict the background level in a subset of the detector network during a known anomalous event. 
 Detector networks that measure environmental radiation serve as radiological surveillance and early warning networks in many countries across Europe and beyond. Their goal is to detect anomalous radioactive signatures that indicate the release of radionuclides into the environment. Often, the background ambient dose equivalent rate H˙*(10) is predicted using meteorological information. However, in dense detector networks, the correlation between different detectors is expected to contain markedly more information. In this work, we investigate how the joint observations by neighbouring detectors can be leveraged to predict the background H˙*(10). Treating it as a stochastic vector, we show that its distribution can be approximated as multivariate normal. We reframe the question of background prediction as a Bayesian inference problem including priors and likelihood. Finally, we show that the conditional distribution can be used to make predictions. To perform the inferences we use PyMC. All inferences are performed using real data for the nuclear sites in Doel and Mol, Belgium. We validate our calibrated model on previously unseen data. Application of the model to a case with known anomalous behaviour – observations during the operation of Belgian Reactor 1 (BR1) in Mol – highlights the relevance of our method for anomaly detection and quantification."

 The quality of river runoff determines the quality of regional climate projections for coastal oceans or other estuaries. This study presents a novel approach to river runoff forecasting using convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) networks. Our method accurately predicts daily runoff for 97 rivers within the Baltic Sea catchment by modeling runoff as a spatiotemporal sequence defined by atmospheric forcing. The ConvLSTM model predicts river runoff with an accuracy of ±5 % when compared to the hydrological model.

 We have developed an open source ray-tracing tool for space geodetic techniques. The software uses the geometric optics approximation to calculate the signal travel time delay induced by the atmosphere between two given points. The software is written in Fortran and uses OpenMP to speed up computation. The input to the ray-tracing tool are 3D pressure-, temperature- and humidity fields. The Earths magnetic- and electron density field are optional. For the neutral atmosphere (troposphere) the software accepts the NetCDF files from the atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 and the mesoscale model WRF. For the ionosphere the software accepts electron density fields derived from IRI and Ne-quick. We review the current status of the software and test its performance. For example, the one-to-one comparison with the open source software RADIATE shows the high speed and precision of our ray-tracing tool. We also show how our tool can be used to study higher order ionospheric effects (L-band frequencies).

Although N2O consumption activities by diverse heterotrophic N2ORB have been detected, knowledge gaps remain about the phylogenies, physiologies, and activities of N2ORB. Here, we successfully enriched a methylotrophic N2ORB consortium under intermittent oxygen and N2O supplies. 15N tracer analysis showed that the N2O consumption activity of the enriched consortium was higher than its N2O production activity in the presence of either a single or multiple electron acceptors (i.e., nitrogen oxides). The observed maximum N2O consumption was 80.7 μmol·g-biomass–1·h–1. Quantitative PCR results showed that clade I nosZ bacteria overwhelmed clade II nosZ bacteria at high (0.41 mmol·min–1) and low (0.08 mmol·min–1) N2O loading rates. The dilution rate and N2O loading rate affected the microbial community composition and activity. A higher N2O loading rate stimulated active and oxygen-tolerant N2ORB that boosted N2O consumption by approximately 50% in the presence of oxygen. Metagenomic analysis unraveled the predominance of a novel methylotrophic N2ORB, possessing entire denitrifying genes and high-affinity terminal oxidase genes, from the reactor with a high N2O loading rate. The unique physiological traits of the consortium enriched by methanol shed light on a novel function─aerobic N2O consumption by N2ORB─and pave the way for innovative N2O mitigation strategies applying powerful N2O sinks in engineered systems."

This multiomics study investigates the adaptive responses of bacterium–phage interactions under varying oxidative and hydraulic stress during membrane backwashing and their biological contributions to biofouling. Oxidative and hydraulic stress distinctly shaped bacteria and phage diversity and community composition. Under moderate oxidative backwashing (300 ppm of NaClO), diversity was maintained, with increased antioxidant enzyme activities, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production, and quorum sensing (QS) signaling, promoting bacterial resilience and biofilm formation. In contrast, excessive oxidative stress (600 ppm of NaClO) reduced bacteria and phage diversity, disrupted antioxidant responses, and increased microbial sensitivity. Hydraulic stress predominantly influenced viral diversity and co-occurrence network topology, favoring the expansion of broad host-range phages and lysogenic lifestyles under combined stresses. Phage–bacterium interaction analyses highlighted phages’ adaptive preferences for hosts with high network centrality and broad ecological niches, which enhanced microbial interactions and resilience. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated the early enrichment of genes associated with energy metabolism, ROS detoxification, and biofilm formation, followed by stabilization as biofilms matured. Phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes were involved in DNA repair, QS, and EPS biosynthesis, contributing to microbial adaptation through oxidative stress resistance and biofilm stabilization. Overall, these findings provide mechanistic insights into biofouling dynamics and highlight the need to optimize chlorine dosing to prevent suboptimal levels of microbial adaptation and biofouling."

While adult rainbow trout are known to be sensitive, there is limited research on the response of early life stages to 6PPD-Q exposure. Given that early life stages of fish are often more sensitive than adults, the aim of these studies was to assess the acute and subchronic toxicity of 6PPD-Q in early life stage rainbow trout. Rainbow trout alevins were exposed from hatch until 28 days post-hatch to time-weighted average 6PPD-Q concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 2.35 μg/L, which determined a 28-day median lethal dose (LC50) of 0.56 μg/L, as well as morphological deformities, including pooling of blood in the caudal fin. A follow-up acute study with exogenously feeding rainbow trout fry revealed a 96-h LC50 of 0.47 μg/L.

Although much effort has been made on organic chloramines in chlorination, great discrepancies exist in occurrence, decomposition kinetics, and molecular-level mechanisms of N-chloroaldimines. Herein, we propose a high-throughput method integrating directional reduction to distinguish organic chloramines from the nontarget-analyzed CHNOCl compounds and identify 86.6% of the CHNOCl compounds as N,N-dichloramines, N-monochloramines, and N-chloroaldimines. N,N-dichloramines show higher instability than N-monochloramines and can decompose to N-chloroaldimines. Furthermore, we quantitatively demonstrate the slower decomposition of N-chloroaldimines (10–6 s–1) than N,N-dichloramines (10–5 s–1) with 1 order of magnitude, and both of them are sensitive to engineering conditions, e.g., pH and residual disinfectants. We find that residual disinfectants can accelerate the decomposition of N-chloroaldimines. Meanwhile, we unravel the significant roles of NH2-linked R groups on the decomposition pathways of N-chloroaldimines through experimental and theoretical perspectives. Alkyl chains linked to NH2 groups lead to only the formation of nitriles in N-chloroaldimine decomposition, whereas carbocycles or benzene rings could result in the formation of aldehydes. These key insights will enable the effective control of N-chloroaldimine-derived disinfection byproducts and future optimization of the disinfection process."

To meet this demand, the raw materials sector must increase current capacities and develop new capacities at untapped deposits. Understanding life cycle impacts is crucial to avoid severe environmental burden shifts in the future. Although site-specific life cycle inventories exist, they do not allow for a comprehensive global assessment of the Li sector, particularly in capturing technological developments. To address this, our study presents a life cycle inventory model for brines that maintains essential site-specific parameters while providing a global perspective. We define core parameters for site-specific modeling of Li carbonate (Li2CO3) production and develop a systematic approach to addressing data gaps. Our model employs a class-based structure for 30 mapped processes from the literature and quantifies environmental and technical flows. Overall, we cover 25 sites, representing 300 kilotonnes (90%) of current Li2CO3 production from brines and an additional 315 kilotonnes of potential future production. One key finding is that sites using direct Li extraction have 7-fold higher climate change impacts than sites using conventional technologies on average, while water scarcity impacts are doubled on average. The difference is a result of the larger brine mass required to be treated due to lower Li grades. Furthermore, our model allows the implications for Li-ion battery production to be analyzed."

Germicidal UV-C irradiation effectively inactivates spores suspended in water, yet information on surface spore mitigation is surprisingly absent. We show the effectiveness of 265–275 nm UV-C light to mitigateAspergillus nigeron nutrient-rich surfaces. UV-C mitigation of surface molds differs from inactivating spores suspended in water due to the unique characteristics of mycelial structures. Complete preinactivation of all viable cells during UV-C exposure is crucial to prevent mycelia formation; otherwise, even a single spore can gradually spread, covering surfaces by producing a progressive mycelial structure. A UV-C dose of 144 mJ/cm2 from 265 nm LEDs achieved complete preinactivation at lower concentrations (100–1000 CFU/plate), while higher concentrations required increased UV-C doses. Intermittent duty cycling of light delivery (10 min ON then 50 min OFF) at 275 nm delivered from side-emitting optical fibers achieved comparable mitigation to continuous irradiation. Insufficient UV-C exposure induced more resistant mycelial structures that shielded live spores beneath.

In this study, we address this question by comparing the variance of two tracers, chlorophyll concentration (Chl) and sea surface temperature (SST), resolved by two satellites—MODIS Aqua, with a resolution of 1.5 km, and Landsat 8/9, with a resolution of 30 m. We quantify tracer variance resolved by both satellites on the submesoscale using spatial variance spectral slopes. We find that MODIS measures significantly higher variance compared to Landsat, in both Chl and SST. This is because, despite higher signal‐to‐noise ratio for MODIS per pixel, Landsat signal‐to‐noise ratio increases considerably when aggregating pixels. Furthermore, by comparing Chl to SST variance for each satellite we find Landsat to be better match to theory for resolving submesoscale physical‐biological interactions."

Smith,Deformation Controlled Fluid Mass‐Transfer Processes in Ancient Orogens,"Despite abundant empirical evidence, the details of coupled deformation and mass transfer processes within a framework of the crustal architecture of ancient orogens remains enigmatic. Geophysical imaging of the Larder Lake‐Cadillac deformation zone, a well‐endowed crustal‐scale fault system in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield, characterizes the crustal architecture and fault geometry of the system through the lower crust. By comparing the geophysically determined structure of the Larder Lake‐Cadillac deformation zone to stress changes induced by Archean (peak orogeny) rupture of the fault system, we show domains of earthquake‐triggered deformation coincide with the geophysically imaged low resistivity zones. These low resistivity zones likely formed due to Archean mineral bearing fluid migration from underlying fertile source zones to downstream (shallower) crustal reservoirs and, ultimately, near surface traps. The multi‐disciplinary approach identifies the syntectonic mass‐transfer processes and mineral bearing fluid pathways, providing an interpretive framework for unraveling the geophysical manifestation of the deformation controlled processes responsible for upflow of metalliferous fluids that may result in ore deposit formation in collisional orogens."

Interactions among motions of different scales complicate its structural evolution, making prediction challenging. This study focuses on two typical processes in the SBL: low‐level jet (LLJ) and internal gravity waves (IGWs), investigating how their interactions influence the evolution of turbulence structures. Utilizing a full boundary layer turbulence observation network and data processing system at Zhongchuan International Airport, this study includes eddy covariance system, Doppler Lidar, and wind profiling radar. In strongly SBL, turbulence energy accumulates in higher layers and, during downward transfer, generates local LLJ and IGWs, triggering intermittent turbulence events. Internal factors of turbulence intermittency dominated the process. The interaction between LLJ and IGWs maintains intermittent turbulence bursts, accompanied by the conversion of sub‐mesoscale energy to turbulent energy. In weakly SBL, the conversion of sub‐mesoscale motion energy drives intermittent turbulence events, along with energy transfers between different scales of IGWs, resulting in weaker turbulence intermittency. External factors of turbulence intermittency dominated the process. In both cases, the interaction between LLJ and IGWs alters turbulence structure and atmospheric stability. Turbulent mixing changes the mean gradient field, further influencing the LLJ height. This study elucidates the mechanisms of interaction between internal and external factors in turbulence intermittency. It outlines energy transfer among different scales of motion and clarifies the mechanisms behind state transitions and structural evolution in strongly and weakly SBL. These findings are significant for advancing theoretical research and simulation developments of the SBL."

However, different entrainment‐mixing scenarios can occur in real clouds. To address this deficiency, a unifying parameterization that represents different entrainment‐mixing processes is implemented and evaluated in CESM1.2. The results indicate that the homogeneous mixing degree values simulated by the new parameterization in CESM1.2 are predominantly greater than 50%, suggesting a tendency toward homogeneous mixing. Compared to the extremely inhomogeneous mixing mechanism, the new parameterization increases the cloud droplet number concentration (Nc). More importantly, the new parameterization improves low‐cloud fraction (CLDLOW) simulation in Northwest Pacific (NWP) and Southeast Pacific (SEP) regions, with relative improvements of 2.95% and 4.17%, respectively. Furthermore, the improvements reach up to 44.6% and 16.2% in the NWP and SEP regions, respectively, when considering the relationship between Nc and CLDLOW. Further analysis reveals that the new parameterization enhances cloud optical depth, longwave radiative cooling effect, net condensation rate, cloud water mixing ratio, lower‐troposphere stability, and CLDLOW by increasing Nc.

 Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent, bioaccumulative and anthropogenic pollutants that have attracted the attention of the public and private sectors because of their adverse impact on human health1. Although various technologies have been deployed to degrade PFASs with a focus on non-polymeric functionalized compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid)2–4, a general PFAS destruction method coupled with fluorine recovery for upcycling is highly desirable. Here we disclose a protocol that converts multiple classes of PFAS, including the fluoroplastics polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride, into high-value fluorochemicals. To achieve this, PFASs were reacted with potassium phosphate salts under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, a mineralization process enabling fluorine recovery as KF and K2PO3F for fluorination chemistry. The phosphate salts can be recovered for reuse, implying no detrimental impact on the phosphorus cycle. Therefore, PFASs are not only destructible but can now contribute to a sustainable circular fluorine economy.

 One of the main interpretations of deep-rooted geophysical structures in the mantle1 is that they stem from the top-down solidification of the primitive basal magma ocean of Earth above the core2–6. However, it remains debated whether solids first formed at the bottom of the mantle, solidifying upward, or above the melts, solidifying downward. Here we show that gravitational segregation of dense, iron-rich melts from lighter, iron-poor solids drives mantle evolution, regardless of where melting curves and geotherms intersect. This process results in the accumulation of iron-oxide-rich melts above the core, forming a basal magma ocean. We numerically model mantle solidification using a new multiphase fluid dynamics approach that integrates melting phase relations and geochemical models. This enables estimating the compositional signature and spatial distribution of primordial geochemical reservoirs, which may be directly linked to the isotopic anomalies measured in Archean rocks7–11. We find that a substantial amount of solids is produced at the surface of the planet, not at depth, injecting geochemical signatures of shallow silicate fractionation in the deep mantle. This work could serve as a foundation for re-examining the intricate interplay between mantle dynamics, petrology and geochemistry during the first thousand million years of the evolution of rocky planets.

 Diesel vehicles are an important emission source of intermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs). Previous studies rarely reported the impacts of loading mass on diesel I/SVOC emissions. Here, we applied a non-targeted screening characterization method to characterize detailed I/SVOC emissions of two diesel trucks by using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToF-MS), and explored the impact from various loading mass conditions. The results indicated that higher loading mass could reduce total I/SVOC emissions of tested trucks, which was consistent with the trend in organic carbon (OC) but opposite to that of elemental carbon (EC). The chemical composition was also affected by loading mass. Saturated hydrocarbon compounds tend to account for a higher fraction of the total I/SVOCs under empty loading mass conditions, which were probably emitted due to incomplete combustion, compared with the chemical composition of diesel fuels. The fractions of unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) increased with higher loading mass, suggesting that thermal decomposition and oxidation processes become more important. Furthermore, we mapped the I/SVOCs into the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) according to loading mass conditions, which served as the input profiles for further atmospheric modeling of secondary organic aerosol (SOA)."

 Under the context of climate change, the climatic conditions for maize during different growth stages in Northeast China (NEC) exert a markedly varying influence on the final yield. We define nine Climate-Year Types (CYTs) based on the probability density functions of temperature and precipitation, aiming to explore the underlying drivers of climatic factors contributing to yield shocks. By incorporating a panel regression model, we quantitatively analyze the key compound climate conditions that influence maize yield across different growth stages. The results indicate that the main CYTs are biased towards drier conditions (Cold-Dry, Rainless, Warm-Dry) from 1992 to 2021, while the probability of warmer conditions (Normal-Warm, Warm-Wet, Warm-Dry) is expected to increase throughout the whole growth stage in the future. The overall yield shock is approximately 20 % in the historical period, with projected exacerbation under the future warming scenarios. At present, the dominant CYTs that determines the final yield of maize is changing from colder and wetter conditions in the growing stage to drier and warmer conditions in the reproductive stage. Moreover, the Warm-Dry CYT emerges as the most significant climatic factor influencing maize yield, with each occurrence associated with a 3.70 % decrease in yield throughout the whole growth stage in the historical period. Notably, the frequency of Warm-Dry CYT is expected to increase in most cities of NEC, which remains a major contributor to yield shocks, with the magnitude of its impact likely to intensify in the future. In summary, these studies identify the key climate types affecting maize yield at different growth stages in NEC, emphasizing the impact of compound heat and drought. This will provide a scientific basis for targeted measures to enhance yield and mitigate risks."

 Much of the Earth's surface lacks long-term in-situ measurement of essential meteorological variables. Climate reanalysis datasets provide an alternative in data-sparse regions, sometimes replacing gauge-based observations for climatological studies, however, they have inherent biases. Reanalysis is now available at finer spatial and temporal resolutions, that can be considered for hydrological and climatological studies. Although the assessment of reanalysis datasets is common at a daily, monthly, or seasonal scale, how the recent generation reanalysis captures the spatial pattern of extreme temperature events, and their trends remains an open question.In this study, two regional (IMDAA and EARS) and five global (ERA5-Land, ERA5, MERRA2, CFSR, and JRA3Q) reanalysis datasets are evaluated with a gauge-based gridded temperature dataset from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to assess their suitability for studying extreme temperature events and their trends over India. Fifteen hot and cold extremes indices are identified to characterize extremes covering frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme temperature events.The study finds that no single reanalysis outperforms others for all the extreme indices when compared to the IMD gridded data, however, a select few (e.g., ERA5, ERA5L, MERRA2, and JRA3Q) better perform in reproducing the observed spatial pattern of extreme events and their changes across different regions of India. It is also noted that in response to global warming, the frequency, duration, and magnitude of extreme hot events are rising, and cold events are decreasing in India which is also captured by most of these reanalyses. Overall, the increase in hot extremes is more prominent in the south of the tropics and the decline in cold extremes is more evident in the north. However, the trend areas and magnitudes of the reanalysis datasets were not similar in comparison to trends from a regional station-based gridded dataset. Thus, care should be taken when selecting datasets for such applications and interpreting their trends."

 This study attempts to correct the attenuation of the radar reflectivity factor from two X-band radars in Cyprus, using a constrained attenuation correction method. This research was implemented under the assumption that the difference between the reflectivity measured by each of the ground radars, on the one hand, and the reflectivity measured by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, on the other hand, equals the path integrated attenuation (PIA). This is because solely the reflectivity data at horizontal polarization have been used so far. Various parameter combinations of linear coefficients for the constrained correction were tested empirically, using GPM DPR data as a reference. The results showed that no single parameter combination can be consistently effective, and highlighted the need for event- and radar-specific attenuation correction."

We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria andStreptomyces. Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes."

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters).

Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates."

However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTADA) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTADAneuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTADAneuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTADAneuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTADAneurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide."
