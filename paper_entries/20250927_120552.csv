10.1088/1748-9326/ae04ff,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注水资源项目的经济评估，尤其是在不确定性因素（如气候变化）影响下的成本效益分析。它探讨了水利基础设施项目的评估方法、不确定性管理以及社会经济因素的纳入。虽然提到了气候变化，但其重点在于经济影响和决策，而不是大气环境遥感技术本身。因此，与空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等大气环境遥感技术没有直接关联。,[],Tolulope Odunola;Paul Kirshen;John Kucharski;Petrina Rowcroft;Drew McAvoy;Casey Brown;Garima Mandavya;Koen Verbist;Patrick Ray,Economic evaluation of water resources projects under uncertainty: from theory to practice,"Economic evaluation using cost benefit analysis (CBA) focuses on the allocation of scarce resources to competing needs and often requires a multi-objective approach for accurate analysis. However, known and unforeseen project uncertainties hinder the monetary quantification of all project objectives. Future cost and benefit projections of civil infrastructure such as water resources projects are influenced by uncertainties in societal preferences and behavioral patterns, policies and their implementation, as well as distribution and sustainability of benefits under changing climate. It is especially difficult to measure the projected benefits of public goods like water infrastructure because they have no direct or standard valuation approach. With advancement in technology, improvement to analytical tools and methods, and the science of decision making under uncertainty, there has been more research interest in CBA under uncertainty. This paper: (1) reviews the historical evolution of analytical approaches for water infrastructure evaluation; (2) explains the limitations on CBA imposed by uncertainties such as climate change; (3) describes analytical techniques applied to manage uncertainty in CBA; and (4) proposes methods for improved incorporation of socio-economic factors into economic evaluation. Our review of 302 manuscripts showed that standard practice differs from academic assumptions. For instance, there is limited uptake of analytical techniques that support robust characterization of deep uncertainties such as climate change (e.g. the climate stress test) and the incorporation of socio-economic factors such as equity. The paper suggests ways to reconcile academia and practice, provides direction for future work, and presents recommendations for improving current approaches to CBA. To strengthen water resource management efforts and improve policy making, we recommend more collaborative partnerships that identify opportunities to integrate academic recommendations into standard practice. Better documentation of systematic approaches to water project evaluation under uncertainty and holistic consideration of equity at the various stages of water project planning are also required."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae05b3,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化对法国经济成本的影响评估，对比了国际宏观经济研究和法国国家政策文件中对气候变化经济成本的估算。论文旨在探讨两种评估方法之间的差异，并分析造成差异的原因，例如方法滞后、行业覆盖范围有限、缺乏货币化以及忽略跨境效应等。虽然气候变化与大气环境密切相关，但该论文的核心在于经济影响评估和政策分析，而不是大气环境遥感技术的应用，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的直接关联性较低。,[],Adrien Delahais;Vincent Viguié,When climate impact costs do not add up: do local policy assessments align with global macroeconomic insights? A case study of France,"Climate change is expected to cause increasingly severe economic and social disruptions, making adaptation a key pillar of climate policy. Assessing the economic costs of climate impacts is essential to inform adaptation strategies, especially when these costs are used to calibrate the scale of adaptation investments and to weigh adaptation needs against other policy priorities. Yet, estimates of these costs vary widely across studies. Here we compare the estimated economic cost of climate change for France across two lines of evidence: international macroeconomic studies and national policy documents. We find that recent macroeconomic literature, especially econometric studies, produces much higher cost estimates than those that can be inferred from aggregating national policy assessments. This discrepancy could be attributed to methodological lag, limited sectoral coverage, lack of monetization, and the omission of cross-border effects. It could also be attributed to an overestimation of climate impacts in the latest econometric studies. Besides, we also show that while the national institutional literature is extensive, many broad impact categories lack comprehensive quantification, and even fewer are monetized."

Being surrounded by water, the use of marine energy within Puerto Rico and the USVI represents an opportunity to increase renewable energy usage. Marine energy includes wave, tidal, and current energy as well as thermal and salinity gradient energy, and has a large potential to provide reliable and efficient power. While marine energy is usually perceived to bring power to the grid, it can also be used to power activities at sea, particularly offshore aquaculture. In the US Caribbean islands, the development of co-located offshore aquaculture and marine energy could help boost the ocean economy. This study highlights a real-world assessment of the suitability to co-locate offshore integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and wave energy off Puerto Rico and the USVI. The feasibility for co-location was determined through a spatial analysis to identify suitable areas for co-location, field work to collect environmental data, and a readiness analysis of wave energy devices. Combining key environmental, regulatory, and logistical parameters, the spatial analysis identified potential suitable areas for co-location off the coast in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico, northwest of Culebra, east of Vieques, and north of St. Thomas in the USVI. Wave energy was identified as the most limiting parameter for co-location in the study area. The wave energy data collected were comparable to the model predictions, showing the usefulness of fine-scale environmental conditions from wave models to assess the feasibility for co-location. Through the combination of spatial analysis, environmental monitoring, and information on wave energy device readiness, several key components for the technical feasibility of co-locating offshore IMTA and wave energy have been demonstrated in the US Caribbean islands."

However, existing research lacks a unified quantitative framework to describe the multivariate processes of flood regulation. In this study, we introduce the FRAMES framework (i.e., Flood Regulation Assessment as a MultivariatE System), in which we conceptualize the flood regulation as the responses of water infrastructures to keep floodplain settlement under certain flood exposure levels (ELs) under diverse hydroclimatic conditions. To explicitly model the interactions, we introduce (i) ELs of floodplain settlements, calculated using the cumulative distribution of the height above nearest drainage for urban pixels, (ii) flood return periods to represent hydroclimatic factors, and (iii) operational load (OL) of water infrastructures to describe the capacity allocated for flood control. Additionally, a flood regulation surface is introduced to synthesize the three-variable interactions in a continuous manner. To demonstrate our method, we apply it to the Ganjiang River Basin in China to study the interactions of Ji’An city and the upstream Wan’An Dam under various flood levels. We find a general intensification of the OL of Wan’An Dam (e.g., from 14.1% to 26.6% at a 10% EL under 100-year floods) due to the urban expansion of Ji’An city between 1985 and 2015. Moreover, the flood regulation surface reveals that due to the sparsely distributed settlements closest to the river, there is a disproportionate increase in the OL per unit decrease in EL. This indicates diminishing returns from dam-centered flood regulation strategies and suggests a critical threshold where alternative measures (e.g. local embankments, floodplain restoration) may be needed. Our study establishes a quantitative and extensible framework to describe the multivariate flood regulation processes, offering a promising tool to inform flood management tailored to the regional interplay of flood regulation."

The frequency of dry heatwave in Asia has been observed to increase by 0.9 d per decade, whereas the wet HTs have demonstrated a considerably more pronounced trend of 1.9 d per decade. Furthermore, the growth percentage in excess of 50% is evident in the majority of regions across Asia, including West Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia, which collectively account for 99% of the continent’s elderly population. Relative to the period 2001–2020, the exposure to wet heatwave is projected to increase from 1.4 times to 3.2 times in EA, from 1.6 to 13 times in WA, from 1.3 to 9 times in CA, from 1.3 to 8.4 times in SA and from 2.2 to 15.7 times in SEA from 2030 to 2100. This represents a rate of increase which is more than twice that of the dry heatwave in 2100 across most regions of Asia. The rise in temperature and the growth in the population aged 65+ are responsible for the increase in exposure to wet heatwaves, and the population effect has more contribution than the climate effect across all regions."

Field;Thara Prabhakaran;Mahen Konwar;Vijayapurapu Srinivasa Prasad,Analysis of raindrop size distribution from the  double moment cloud microphysics scheme for monsoon over a tropical station,"Science has made significant strides in weather prediction, especially for intense tropical rainfall that can lead to floods and landslides. Our study aims to improve monsoon rainfall forecasts by analyzing raindrop sizes. Using a new approach to model raindrop growth, we achieved a more accurate depiction of large rainfall events. These improvements can be generalized to enhance early warning systems, offering reliable predictions that help reduce risks from severe tropical weather events. 
 Accurate precipitation forecasting hinges on the representation of microphysical processes within numerical models. A key approach to understanding these processes is through the analysis of hydrometeor drop size distribution (DSD). The characteristics of DSD bulk parameters – Mass Weighted Mean Diameter (Dm) and the Normalized Intercept Parameter (Nw), are estimated from the double moment cloud microphysical scheme (CASIM: Cloud-Aerosol Interacting Microphysics) employed in the operational convection permitted model of National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCUM-R). The observations from the Joss-Valdvogel Disdrometer (JWD) and the Global Precipitation Mission – Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM-DPR) are analyzed for providing essential validation. An algorithm for separating the monsoon precipitation into convective and stratiform types in NCUM-R and a new parameter estimation module to obtain DSD parameters from the CASIM are established in the study. The model exhibits agreement with the characteristics of the DSD of raindrops with Dm ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mm marking the majority of the monsoon precipitation events. However, the underestimation when it comes to the larger drops (with Dm > 3.25 mm and Rainrate ≥ 8 mm h−1) demands a reassessment in microphysical parameterizations. The advanced autoconversion parameterization scheme applied in CASIM favored the growth of large drops compared to the existing scheme. The enhanced growth of larger drops is reflected in the increased accuracy in the prediction of extreme precipitation associated with a convective event. The current study underscores the importance of refining microphysical parameterizations to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts offering a pathway for enhanced model performance in future operational forecasting systems."

Field;Benjamin J. Murray;Daniel P. Grosvenor;Floortje van den Heuvel;Kenneth S. Carslaw,Different responses of cold-air outbreak clouds to aerosol and ice production depending on cloud temperature,"Cold-air outbreak (CAO) clouds play a vital role in climate prediction. This study explores the responses of CAO clouds to aerosols and ice production under different environmental conditions. We found that CAO cloud responses vary with cloud temperature and are strongly controlled by the liquid–ice partitioning in these clouds, suggesting the importance of good representations of cloud microphysics properties to predict the behaviours of CAO clouds in a warming climate. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions and ice production processes are important factors that influence mixed-phase cold-air outbreak (CAO) clouds and their contribution to cloud-phase feedback. Recent case studies of CAO events suggest that increases in ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations cause a reduction in cloud total water content and albedo at the top of the atmosphere. However, no study has compared the sensitivities of CAO clouds to these processes under different environmental conditions. Here, we use a high-resolution nested model to quantify and compare the responses of cloud microphysics and dynamics to cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), INP concentration, and efficiency of the Hallett–Mossop (HM) secondary ice production process in two CAO events over the Labrador Sea, representing intense (cold, March) and weaker (warmer, October) mixed-phase conditions. Our results show that variations in INP concentrations strongly influence both cases, while changing Nd and the HM process efficiency affects only the warmer October case. With a higher INP concentration, cloud cover and albedo at the top of the atmosphere increase in the cold March case, while the opposite responses are found in the warm October case. We suggest that the CAO cloud response to the parameters is different in ice-dominated and liquid-dominated regimes and that the determination of the regime is strongly controlled by the cloud temperature and the characteristics of ambient INP, which both control the glaciation of clouds. This study provides an instructive perspective to understand how these cloud microphysics affect CAO clouds under different environmental conditions and serves as an important basis for future exploration of the cloud microphysics parameter space."

The results show similar predictions for 8 h O3 but significant variability for SIA and radicals, with differences up to 30 % for SIA and 200 % for radicals across chemical mechanisms and inventories. The findings highlight that evaluating control strategies for SIA and atmospheric oxidation capacity requires an ensemble approach. 
 In this study, three photochemical mechanisms of varying complexity from the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) family and two widely used anthropogenic emission inventories are employed to quantify the discrepancies in the predicted effectiveness of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission controls on ozone (O3), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs), and hydroxyl (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. For maximum daily average 8 h O3 (O3-8 h), relative reductions predicted using different emission inventory and mechanism combinations are consistent for up to 80 % NOx or VOC reductions, with maximum differences of approximately 15 %. For SIA, while the predicted relative changes in their daily average concentrations due to NOx reductions are quite similar, very large differences of up to 30 % occur for VOC reductions. Sometimes even the direction of change (i.e., increase or decrease) is different. For the oxidants OH and NO3 radicals, the uncertainties in the relative changes due to emission changes are even larger among different inventory–mechanism combinations, sometimes by as much as 200 %. Our results suggest that while the O3-8 h responses to emission changes are not sensitive to the choice of chemical mechanism and emission inventories, using a single model and mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of emission controls on SIA and atmospheric oxidation capacity may have large errors. For these species, the evaluation of the control strategies may require an ensemble approach with multiple inventories and mechanisms."

Based on a novel isotope method to trace methane sources, we identified that the methane emission from the oil and gas sites makes the major contribution to changes in atmospheric methane isotope signals. 
 Current evaluation of methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere from global oil and gas (ONG) sector is subject to considerable uncertainty. Particularly for China, few measurements have been conducted, making it difficult to quantify emissions and conduct mitigation measures. Recently, the isotopic composition of CH4 (δ13C) has been used for evaluating the contributions of fossil fuel sources to global budgets, providing a more effective approach across both regional and global scales. Here, we present a field study of CH4 mixing ratios and δ13C based on UAV sampling and ground monitoring across 11 ONG sites located in southwestern China. We found that the values of δ13C-CH4 provide a solid basis for identifying the CH4 leakage and characterizing source distributions at the ONG site-levels, despite that the meteorological and site conditions as well as the surrounding environment could exert influence on the signal strengths. With the Keeling plot approach, we determined that the mean δ13C source isotopic signatures of CH4 emission from these ONG sites were −25.66 ‰, heavier than previously found for other sites globally. This also indicates that they were mainly thermogenic sources. Finally, by incorporating the updated source isotopic signatures determined for China, we conducted a back-of-envelope assessment to qualitatively infer the global CH4 emission from the fossil fuel sources. The result suggests an overestimation of global CH4 emission from the fossil fuel inventory by 2.86 Tg CH4 yr−1, and an underestimation from the microbial sources. This study highlights the necessity of determining CH4 isotopes on ONG site-levels, providing an indirect but important reference to quantifying CH4 inventories among global industrial sectors."

Krieger,Initiation of linoleic acid autoxidation with ozone exposure in levitated aerosol particles,"The initiation of autoxidation by ozonolysis was investigated on levitated linoleic acid droplets using electrodynamic balance–mass spectrometry. Exposing the droplets to ozone for 1 h before switching the gas phase to air without ozone led to a shortening of the autoxidation initiation phase in comparison to experiments without ozone exposure. Results were compared to a bulk reaction model to investigate the synergistic effects of ozonolysis and autoxidation. 
 When atmospheric aerosol particles undergo oxidation, their physico-chemical properties are altered, influencing their environmental impact. Recent work has revealed that ozonolysis and autoxidation both contribute to the decay of linoleic acid. However, the observed linoleic acid decay rates could only be explained if the autoxidation induction period was shorter in experiments with ozone than without ozone. In this study, we investigate whether linoleic acid autoxidation in levitated aerosol particles can be initiated by ozonolysis. Linoleic acid droplets were levitated in an electrodynamic balance, exposed to air with and without ozone, and subsequently analysed by mass spectrometry. Specifically, droplets were first exposed to air containing 39 ppb or 619 ppb ozone for 1 h and thereafter, the gas phase was switched to air without ozone. The observed autoxidation rates were compared with reference experiments without the initial ozonolysis phase, the latter showing an extended induction period. These findings indicate that ozonolysis produces considerable radical concentrations, leading to the observed shortening of the induction period. A comparison of the measurements to a simple one-compartment bulk reaction model was used to estimate the radical contribution from ozonolysis. To explain the observed shortening of the induction period, assuming that radicals are formed from the decomposition of linoleic acid oxidation products, a reaction rate constant for the decay of 5.1×10−8 s−1 is obtained. Studies under extreme conditions, such as highly elevated ozone concentrations, may overlook the role of the synergistic effects discussed here, which are only of importance at atmospherically relevant oxidant concentrations."

Using a set of model experiments, we found that some parameters have a strong effect on humidity and ice, especially during fast ascents. These findings could help improve weather and climate models and may also be relevant for future climate engineering studies. 
 Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) play a crucial role in Earth's climate by transporting water vapor and hydrometeors into the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS), where they influence radiative forcing. However, a major source of uncertainty in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and climate projections stems from the parameterization of microphysical processes and their impact on cloud radiative properties as well as the vertical re-distribution of water. In this study, we use Lagrangian data from a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of a WCB case study to investigate how variations in microphysical parameterizations influence water transport into the UTLS and the outflow cirrus properties. We find that the thermodynamic conditions (pressure, temperature, specific humidity) at the end of the WCB ascent show little sensitivity to the explored parameter perturbations. In contrast, ice content and relative humidity exhibit substantial variability, primarily driven by the capacitance of ice (CAP) and the scaling of ice formation processes directly influenced by ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations. Different combinations of CAP and INP scaling yield vastly different ice and relative humidity distributions at the end of the ascent and in the subsequent hours. These differences are particularly pronounced in fast-ascending air parcels, where modifications to the saturation adjustment scheme (SAT) introduce small variations in pressure and temperature at the end of ascent. Our findings have potential implications for parameter choices in cloud models and considerations for geoengineering strategies. Future comparisons with high-quality observational data could help constrain the most realistic parameter choices, ultimately improving weather and climate forecasts."

This study developed a hybrid ship clutter identification algorithm based on artificial intelligence and heuristic criteria, effectively mitigating the issue. The successful reproduction of ship tracks in the Gulf of Finland supports this conclusion. 
 With the rapid development of active-phased arrays and solid-state transmitters, pulse compression technology has become increasingly important. Currently, pulse compression waveforms with peak sidelobe levels better than −50 dB have been developed, enabling the broader application of pulse compression technology in weather radar systems. However, existing sidelobe suppression levels are still insufficient to ensure that radar data quality is unaffected by range sidelobes for ship clutter, which have a high echo intensity and cannot be removed by conventional quality control methods. In this study, we introduce a hybrid ship clutter identification (HSCI) algorithm to address this issue in pulse compression polarimetric radar observations. The HSCI algorithm comprises two parts: mainlobe and sidelobe identification (including the range and antenna sidelobes). Mainlobe identification uses a random forest model that integrates multiple features to identify the mainlobe of ship clutter. Sidelobe identification uses a series of heuristic criteria derived from the statistical characteristics of ship clutter to distinguish them from precipitation echoes. The analysis results of two typical cases indicate that after implementing the HSCI algorithm, the impact of ship clutter on radar data is visually imperceptible. The statistical results show that the HSCI algorithm achieves a promising performance in ship clutter mainlobe identification on a test dataset comprising 400 ship clutter gates and 2500 range gates of precipitation echoes, with the precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 97 %. Application of this algorithm to the University of Helsinki C-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar data successfully reproduced ship tracks in the Gulf of Finland."

By collecting 3 years of data in the Indian Ocean, we demonstrate that high-quality measurements can be made, even on a moving platform. These results open new possibilities for observing aerosols over the ocean and improving satellite data and climate studies. 
 The Earth's oceans play a critical role in regulating the global climate and atmospheric processes, with marine aerosols significantly influencing weather patterns, air quality, and climate dynamics. Despite extensive land-based aerosol monitoring through networks like AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork), marine aerosol characterization remains a critical gap, due in part to the logistical challenges of conducting measurements in remote oceanic environments. To address this, robust, automated, and precise monitoring systems adapted for research vessels are essential.This study reports on the first 3 years (July 2021–June 2024) of continuous aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements collected aboard the research vessel Marion Dufresne using a ship-adapted CIMEL CE318-T automatic photometer in the frame of the MAP-IO (Marion Dufresne Atmospheric Program  –  Indian Ocean) program. The dataset comprises over 25 000 quality-assured AOD measurements, primarily from the southwest Indian Ocean region, revealing mid-range AOD and Ångström exponent values consistent with previous studies. The reliability and precision of the system were validated through dual-instrument comparisons conducted during the Amaryllis-Amagas/Transama campaign, yielding strong correlations (R>0.96 for different wavelengths) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE<0.01), within the expected error margins for AERONET ground-based sites and benefiting from the continue tracking system implemented for ship-adapted version. Additionally, recurrent comparisons with the ground-based AERONET site at Saint-Denis (La Réunion) further confirm the system's accuracy, presenting good correlations despite differences in altitude and the greater influence of local urban aerosols in Saint-Denis.Retrievals from spectral AOD and sky radiance data collected over the Indian Ocean during a biomass burning event (October 2023) demonstrate the feasibility of deriving detailed aerosol properties, including size distribution and optical characteristics, from shipborne platforms adapted for marine conditions, following the protocols of the AERONET standard algorithm. Observed single scattering albedo (SSA) values, ranging from 0.88 to 0.95 with higher absorption at longer wavelengths, align with those recorded at the Saint-Denis site during the event and are consistent with expectations for a mixture of biomass burning (at the end of the dry season) and sea salt aerosols. These preliminary results underscore the potential of shipborne systems to provide comprehensive aerosol characterization in remote marine environments."

Air masses isolated from land for 72+ hours are systematically selected as essentially oceanic. Among the 11 global regions, they show daytime decreases of 11–16 % in the tropics, while near-zero depletions are rare, unlike in the Arctic, implying different mechanisms. 
 Studying tropospheric ozone over the remote areas of the planet, such as the open oceans and the polar regions, is crucial to understand the role of ozone as a global climate forcer and regulator of atmospheric oxidative capacity. A focus on the pristine oceanic and polar regions complements the available land-based datasets and provides insights into key photochemical and depositional loss processes that control the concentrations and spatiotemporal variability in ozone as well as the physicochemical mechanisms driving these patterns. However, an assessment of the role of ozone over the oceanic and polar regions has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive observational datasets. Here, we present the first comprehensive collection of ozone data over the oceans and the polar regions. The overall dataset consists of 77 ship cruises/buoy-based observations and 48 aircraft-based campaigns. The dataset, consisting of more than 630 000 independent ozone measurement data points covering the period from 1977 to 2022 and an altitude range from the surface to 5000 m (with a focus on the lowest 2000 m), allows systematic analyses of the spatiotemporal distribution and long-term trends over the 11 defined ocean/polar regions. The datasets from ships, buoys, and aircraft are complemented by ozonesonde data from 29 launch sites or field campaigns and by 21 non-polar and 17 polar ground-based station datasets. The datasets contain information on how long the observed air masses were isolated from land, as estimated by backward trajectories from the individual observation points. To extract observations representative of oceanic conditions, we recommend using a subset of the data with an isolation time of 72 h or longer, from the analysis with coincident radon observations. These filtered oceanic and polar data showed typically flat diurnal cycles at high latitudes, whereas daytime decreases in ozone (11 %–16 %) were observed at lower latitudes. The ship/buoy- and aircraft-based datasets presented here will supplement the land-based ones in the TOAR-II (Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase II) database to provide a fully global assessment of tropospheric ozone.

It is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model and the Delft3D hydrodynamic model. The dataset includes detailed information on weather and ocean conditions, helping to improve understanding of Antarctic coastal changes and their links to climate change. 
 Marine spatial planning and environmental management in Antarctica require reliable data to address challenges such as climate change impacts, sea level changes, and the dynamics of fragile ecosystems. Deception Island, a volcanic caldera in the South Shetland Islands, presents unique hydrodynamic conditions influenced by extreme weather, glacial melt, and its complex geomorphology. To improve understanding of these processes, we present an open-access, integrated dataset spanning 16 years, from 2005 until 2020, combining high-resolution atmospheric and hydrodynamic variables. Atmospheric modelling was done with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model leading to data in a 1 km grid and 35 vertical levels covering the island. The atmospheric dataset includes a total of 161 variables including wind fields, precipitation, and pressure among others, at hourly resolution that  have been validated against data provided by an in situ weather station.Hydrodynamical and wave propagation modelling was performed with Delft3D (2DH) on different grids with a maximum resolution of 15×25 m2 for hydrodynamic and 220×160 m2 for wave propagation results. This dataset provides high-resolution temporal and spatial data including sea surface elevation, current velocities, significant wave height, wave direction, and wind pressure, at daily intervals across the grid and hourly at five observation points. In addition to standard conditions, the dataset captures spatial, seasonal, and temporal variability as well as extreme events, providing unprecedented insight into the island's dynamics.By incorporating long-term high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis and hydrodynamic simulations, this dataset fills critical knowledge gaps in the hydrodynamic behaviour of Deception Island and provides a valuable tool for stakeholders in research, environmental monitoring, and climate change adaptation. Applications range from analysing glacial melt contributions and nutrient transport to modelling ecosystem interactions and assessing the effects of extreme weather events.

CHN-CH4, a map of anthropogenic methane emissions was created by combining satellite data, national statistics, and climate guidelines. Over 30 years, China emitted about 1157 Tg of methane, peaking in the 2010s. Shanxi province had the highest emissions. CHN-CH4 helps improve tracking, informs global climate models, and strengthens collaboration between science and policy to combat climate change. 
 China is the largest emitter of global methane emissions, contributing about 10 % to anthropogenic climate change based on existing methane inventories. However, significant uncertainties in these statistics limit the accuracy at both national and sub-national scales. The lack of continuous gridded emissions inventories also constrains the inverse analysis of atmospheric observations. To address these, we present CHN-CH4, a spatially aggregated 0.1°×0.1° anthropogenic methane emission inventory for mainland China from 1990 to 2020 annually. CHN-CH4 offers the country with new temporal coverage and details, by means of national statistical yearbooks and remote sensing products. Over the three decades, mainland China emitted 37.3 [28.1-46.4 Tg of methane annually, with the highest emission occurred in the last decade. But this decade also marked the beginning of a decreasing trend, from 45.0 [32.8–56.5] Tg in 2010 to 43.4 [31.6–53.4] Tg in 2020. As important priors, CHN-CH4 enables robust comparisons between estimated emissions and atmospheric observations, thereby improving the accuracy of inverse modelling, which is crucial for effective tracking of methane emissions. By providing a reliable and detailed emissions inventory, CHN-CH4 would be a valuable tool in accelerating the global effort to achieve equitable methane emission reduction goals, as well as supporting China's climate policy.

It covers eight agricultural regions across four seasons in China, offering extensive spatiotemporal coverage and fine-grained annotations. This dataset fills the gap in remote sensing image–text datasets for farmland, alleviates the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in farmland segmentation, and provides valuable data to support large-scale farmland monitoring and mapping. 
 Understanding and mastering the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland are essential for accurate farmland segmentation. The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment. It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language, as a structured knowledge carrier, can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution, and surrounding environmental information. Therefore, a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland. However, in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland, there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction. To fill this gap, we introduced language-based descriptions of farmland and developed the FarmSeg-VL dataset – the first fine-grained image–text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation. Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign captions to each image, ensuring a high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction. Secondly, FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics. In terms of the temporal dimension, it covers all four seasons. In terms of the spatial dimension, it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China, with a total area of approximately 4300 km2. In addition, in terms of captions, FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, including its inherent properties, its phenological characteristics, its spatial distribution, its topographic and geomorphic features, and the distribution of surrounding environments. Finally, we perform a performance analysis of the vision language model and a deep learning model that relies only on labels trained on FarmSeg-VL. Models trained on the vision language model outperform deep learning models that rely only on labels by 10 %–20 %, demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation. The FarmSeg-VL dataset will be publicly released at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15860191 (Tao et al., 2025)."

These ratios vary depending on local geology and are useful for tracing the origins of people, animals, and food. By combining new data from across Australia with global datasets and a machine learning model, we produced a national prediction that supports research in archaeology, ecology, and forensic science. 
 Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) at the Earth's surface offer powerful tools for geological, environmental, and archaeological applications. In minerals and biological materials, 87Sr/86Sr reflects the isoztopic composition of the local bedrock and derived soils. In Australia, however, large regional-scale surveys of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr remain scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios from 278 catchment outlet (floodplain) sediment samples, spanning inland southeastern Australia (South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria), northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland (north of 21.5° S), and the Yilgarn Craton in southern Western Australia. Combined with more than 20 000 global Sr isotope measurements, this dataset was used to generate a high-resolution isoscape of Australia using a well-established random forest spatial regression framework (Bataille et al., 2020).Australian bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr values span a narrower range (0.70501–0.78121) compared to co-located bulk sediment values (0.70480–1.09089) (de Caritat et al., 2022, 2023, 2025b), reflecting the influence of soluble and exchangeable mineral phases and atmospheric inputs such as rain and dust/seaspray. The predicted isoscape reproduces major geological patterns, with higher values over ancient crustal provinces like the Yilgarn Craton and eastern Palaeozoic orogens, and lower values across younger sedimentary basins and coastal margins. Model uncertainty, assessed via quantile random forest regression, is lowest across well-sampled, geologically stable regions where the model is well-trained and highest in poorly-sampled regions and lithologically complex zones. Despite remaining spatial gaps and areas of high prediction uncertainty, our model offers significantly improved coverage and resolution for Australia compared to other global or regional isoscapes. It also provides a scalable framework for updating the Australian isoscape as sampling density increases. This isoscape establishes a robust baseline for applications in provenance research, palaeoecology, and environmental geochemistry.

MOSAIC includes metal cation reactions and is a non-equilibrium, double-moment scheme that conserves aerosol number. Compared to the current aerosol sub-model, MOSAIC produces a more accurate size distribution and aerosol number concentration. It also improves the simulated nitrate and ammonium distribution. This work serves to expand the capacity of GEM-MACH for chemistry and weather coupling. 
 The Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) aerosol thermodynamics and sectional framework has been implemented into the Canadian operational air quality model GEM-MACH. The original aerosol sub-model in GEM-MACH is based on the Canadian Aerosol Module (CAM), which uses a single-moment (mass) sectional scheme, and inorganic thermodynamics derived from the equilibrium ISORROPIA model without base metal cations. MOSAIC features non-equilibrium inorganic thermodynamics and a double-moment (mass and number) sectional scheme. For evaluation we conduct four 1-year simulations with the same emissions and meteorology over the North America domain. A reference run (REF) with the Zhang et al. (2001) aerosol dry deposition scheme and a sensitivity run (EMR) with updated parameters from Emerson et al. (2020) are conducted for each aerosol model option. The results are compared to station observations and surface monthly-mean model–observation synthesis data. MOSAIC exhibits a shift in the accumulation-mode mass and number distribution compared to CAM that results in more aerosol dry deposition in the REF run and a surface PM2.5 sulfate low bias of about 15 % relative to CAM. This bias is essentially removed in the MOSAIC EMR run, resulting in a better fit to aggregated urban and rural stations compared to CAM over the North America domain. Comparison with the AERONET volume size distribution inversion product shows that MOSAIC gives a much higher level of agreement in terms of location of the accumulation-mode peak diameter and separation of the accumulation and coarse modes. PM2.5 nitrate and ammonium for the MOSAIC EMR run shows overall better agreement with observation station data compared to both REF and EMR CAM runs at rural stations. At urban stations, MOSAIC has a high bias for nitrate relative to CAM and observations during summer, but it is reduced in the EMR run compared to the REF run. The high bias in ammonium seen with CAM for both REF and EMR runs relative to aggregated rural and urban station observations is reduced with MOSAIC by about 25 % between April and November."

Validation of this new coupled model is demonstrated through a suite of experiments, including idealized hurricane simulations and a realistic North Atlantic case study featuring Hurricane Helene of 2024. By analyzing the storm intensity, its structure, and its effects on the ocean phenomena such as the upwelling and sea-level changes, the results reveal that air–sea interactions are effectively captured. Scalability tests further confirm the model's computational efficiency.

ICESat-2 provides accurate freeboard data, but its short observational record requires careful consideration of natural variability. 
 This study evaluates sea ice simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) using modern-era satellite measurements of sea ice area, total freeboard and thickness. Current global climate models exhibit substantial uncertainties in simulating sea ice, with significant contributions from both model uncertainty and internal variability. In our study, simulated Arctic and Southern Ocean total freeboard and Arctic winter sea ice thickness are assessed with data from NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, providing an additional constraint beyond traditional passive microwave sea ice area comparisons used extensively in previous studies. Freeboard comparisons benefit from accurate observations from satellite laser altimetry but motivate increased focus on bulk sea ice density estimates across models and observations. The short observational time period also increases the role of internal variability. We undertake a plausibility assessment where we account for both observational uncertainty and internal variability across our different metrics for both hemispheres. In general, we see more plausible metrics in the Arctic compared to the Southern Ocean, with important differences when analyzing annual means vs. March and September means. We provide an example of this plausibility assessment by producing constrained estimates of 2015–2035 seasonal sea ice volume, using model subsets constrained using either area metrics or the combined area, freeboard and thickness metrics, with freeboard and thickness providing important additional impacts in terms of the mean seasonal cycle and spread.

While previous work focused on transient prediction, lacking future prediction capability, we propose a method and evaluate on data from laboratory experiments with different slip behaviours. It shows stable predictions in modelling slip moments, intervals, and predictions beyond trained horizons, especially for challenging slip scenarios, which is crucial for cyclic geophysical process such as seismicity. 
 Fault activity modelling is vital for earthquake monitoring, risk management, and early warning. Studies on laboratory earthquakes are instrumental for modelling natural fault ruptures and enhancing our understanding of natural earthquake dynamics. Recently, machine learning methods have proven effective in predicting instantaneous fault stress in laboratory settings and fault activities on Earth. However, these methods have struggled to obtain steady future predictions because of the lack of understanding of the complex dynamics of highly non-linear laboratory fault slip systems. To address this, we introduce the Hankel–Koopman autoencoder (HKAE), a novel method inspired by dynamic system theories. The HKAE performs dynamic modelling of laboratory fault systems and provides a continuous estimation of the future state of the system. It has been used in experiments with different slip behaviours and has the ability to predict shear stress variation during a slip cycle and slip activity during long-term seismic cycles. The HKAE outperforms traditional statistical methods while achieving results comparable to cutting-edge deep-learning methods across multiple prediction scales. This is particularly evident in its accurate prediction of the stress release phase and precise estimation of the slip interval. More importantly, through dynamic theory and operator analysis in latent space, the HKAE provides insights into the stability of laboratory slip systems rather than full end-to-end black-box predictions. The ability of the HKAE to decompose, model, and reveal complex temporal dynamics highlights its potential in the monitoring of sparsely observed geophysical systems with cyclic characteristics, such as natural faults."

Utilizing four experimental versions, Prototypes 5–8, the study finds that although the UFS generally captures the MJO's propagation characteristics near the initialization time, it encounters difficulty in accurately predicting the propagation speed and decay rate of the MJO beyond 15 days. Specifically, the phase transition rate of the MJO in the UFS is slower than observed, although this behavior is improved in Prototype 8. The UFS overestimates intraseasonal east Pacific genesis potential index anomalies as a function of the MJO phase. Analysis of the vertically integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget reveals that all four UFS prototypes underestimate the damping effect of vertical MSE advection and the amplifying effect of longwave radiative heating, indicating weaknesses in tropical convective parameterization and cloud radiative feedbacks, although these biases are somewhat improved in Prototype 8. These deficiencies result in less efficient vertical MSE export, weaker damping of MJO convection, slow MJO propagation, and delayed MJO's impacts on the EP. Thus, improving the UFS's ability to simulate MJO propagation and maintenance processes is crucial for better predicting the MJO's effects on EP TC genesis and enhancing S2S forecast capability for MJO‐modulated TC activity."

Using hourly meteorological data measured at Dome Argus (Dome A) and nearby Kunlun stations during a 3‐year period (2018–2020), we present the characteristics of the SEB components along with the frequency and intensity of the near‐surface temperature inversion. Due to the strong radiative imbalance at the surface, a quasi‐continuous temperature inversion persisted throughout the observational period (frequency 96%), with an average temperature gradient exceeding 1°C/m between the surface and 4 m height. The combination of relatively strong near‐surface winds and significant vertical temperature gradients resulted in monthly average surface turbulent sensible heat gains of up to 30W·m−2 $30\,\mathrm{W}\cdot {\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ in June, largely compensating for the concurrent net surface radiation loss. In contrast, the monthly average surface turbulent latent heat gains reached only 0.1W·m−2 $0.1\,\mathrm{W}\cdot {\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ due to the minimal atmospheric‐surface moisture gradients caused by the extremely low near‐surface air temperatures. Persistent surface‐based temperature inversions typically emerge under conditions of strong radiative cooling, characterized by reduced variability in surface temperature Ts $\left({T}_{s}\right)$ and subsurface heat fluxes, enhanced turbulent mixing and the sustained moisture.

This study proposes a new perspective in which the thermal contrast between the NCP and Mt. Taihang to its west can enhance the southerlies in planetary boundary layer (PBL) during SMS episodes and thus plays an important role in the production of ER. Based on reanalysis data, this study finds 145 SMS episodes in 30 warm seasons from 1988 to 2017, during which the NCP encountered 66% of the ER. These episodes feature strong poleward transport of moisture in the PBL. The diabatic heating over Mt. Taihang produces strong low‐level baroclinicity, which together with synoptic forcing in the free atmosphere drives the strong PBL southerlies. The south wind components in PBL and in low troposphere are only moderately correlated, whereas their difference is closely related to the zonal temperature gradient. Based on convection‐permitting numerical simulations, this study further investigates the impacts of mountain‐plain thermal contrast on the production of ER during a 20‐day SMS episode in the summer of 2024. A sensitivity experiment reveals significantly weakened PBL southerlies and moisture transport over NCP when the PBL over Mt. Taihang is cooled by ∼1 K. The simulated ER amount is 38.7% less than that in the control experiment. Additional experiments indicate that the low‐level temperature over mountain modulates the diurnal variation of the PBL wind over plain via the Holton mechanism."

Freezing Level Height as an Essential Indicator of Glacier‐Climate Regime Shifts,"Tropical glaciers are rapidly retreating under anthropogenic global warming, posing significant hydrological, ecological, and socio‐environmental risks. In this commentary, I show that the freezing level height (FLH) is a robust, yet underutilized, indicator of glacier regime change in the tropical Andes. Building on recent work by Turner et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd042963), I argue that the strong association between FLH and glaciers' equilibrium line altitude (ELA) offers a simplified and simultaneously physically meaningful tool to anticipate glacier responses to atmospheric warming. Turner et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd042963) used FLH data from reanalysis and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version model output to project 21st century ELA trajectories under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5), predicting a nearly unabated rise in the ELA across studied regions, regardless of the emission scenario. While some observational constraints remain, the findings are applicable to most existing tropical glacier regimes. Importantly, rising FLH reflects a transition from humidity‐ to temperature‐driven mass balance, activating a cascade of positive feedbacks that accelerate ice loss. By reformulating an energy balance equation to express snowfall as a compensatory term, I demonstrate how the FLH can help identify resilient glacier landscapes, thereby informing conservation and adaptation priorities."

Williams,The Sensitivity of Future Hydroclimate Projections to Topography and Large‐Scale Dust Forcing in the Luquillo Mountains of Eastern Puerto Rico,"Precipitation over Puerto Rico is expected to decline in coming decades, threatening an important source of surface water supply. However, earth system models neither resolve fine‐scale orographic impacts nor the radiative effects of Saharan dust aerosols on precipitation over the island's mountains. Here, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF‐Chem) to downscale global climate model projections to a convection‐resolving 4‐km resolution for both dust and no‐dust scenarios. We compare the regional hydroclimate during three periods: historical (2014–2018), mid‐ (2045–2049) and end‐21st century (2085–2089), using output from an RCP8.5 simulation of the Community Earth System Model, version 1. For each period, the coarsest parent domain is simulated both with and without dust emission, transport and radiative effects, and the ensuing thermodynamic perturbations passed to the 4‐km domain via nesting. The downscaled output indicates that precipitation over eastern Puerto Rico is expected to decline through the end of the century, leading to an increase in consecutive dry days and a depletion of soil moisture that is evident across all seasons. The inclusion of dust exacerbates the drying signal during late summer when Saharan air outbreaks are active but ameliorates drying in other seasons relative to its historical simulation. Rainfall decreases rapidly by the mid‐21st century, and the declines plateau through 2100 when dust is included, whereas there is a modest rebound to wetter conditions when dust is ignored. Although the highest elevations exhibit resilience to future drying, there is a clearer drying signal at low elevations."

The analysis is conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model through 1‐km high‐resolution simulation and terrain modification experiments. The results indicated that the MPRB formed through backbuilding processes, primarily over horizontal convective rolls (HCRs), elevated by low mountains along the coastline. The results showed that mountains from 200 m in valleys to 600 m at peaks did not disrupt HCR formation. Instead, mountains of these heights helped elevate HCRs, thereby facilitating convection initiation. However, after increasing the mountain heights above valley heights by 50%, the higher terrain and larger distance between valleys and peaks decreased boundary layer wind and 0−1 km vertical wind shear, preventing HCR formation and thereby suppressing the development of the MPRB. In contrast, lowering the terrain height reduced the HCR height, thereby weakening or even eliminating MPRB even though it enhanced the organization of HCRs. HCR formation in this case was attributed to convective instability with high vertical wind shear and rich moisture. Coastal mountains functioned as barriers, blocking the flow of moisture from the southern sea, which was also essential for HCR formation and convection initiation."

The turbulence energy spectrum characterizes the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) across different eddy scales, with the total energy affecting the diffusion coefficient and pollutant dispersion. Current methods for calculating TKE are sensitive to the temporal resolution of wind speed data, and the limited sampling frequency of instruments is much lower than the dissipation scale. Thus, the high‐frequency turbulence energy is missed, and the total TKE is underestimated. To address this issue, this study used high (∼10 Hz) and low (∼0.05 Hz) frequency wind observations from the Beijing 325‐m meteorological tower to assess how sampling frequencies impact TKE calculations. The −5/3 law of the turbulence spectrum was applied to estimate the relationship between observed and theoretical total TKE, and a parameterization scheme was completed. Results showed that the underestimation due to sampling frequency limitations ranges from 10% to 37%, with higher proportions during night and winter. Then a correction factor (HTMC) was incorporated into the BouLac PBL scheme in WRF‐Chem. Sensitivity simulations of a heavy haze event in Shenyang were set. The experimental group (EXP) showed lower concentrations of PM2.5 near the surface and higher in higher altitudes than those in control group (CTR) during night, indicating stronger vertical turbulent transport. The concentrations in EXP better match observations, with simulation bias reduced from 23.77% to 6.18%.

Reducing these emissions is crucial to mitigate climate change. Measurements of the isotopic composition of CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ (δ $\delta $13C and δ $\delta $2H) can be used to distinguish various sources of CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$. This study reports continuous measurements of CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$, δ $\delta $13C and δ $\delta $2H for 8 months in Cluj‐Napoca, Romania. An automated extraction and a purification system, coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer alternately measured δ $\delta $13C and δ $\delta $2H of CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ with 20‐min time resolution at the campus of the Babeş‐Bolyai University. In addition, point source samples were measured to isotopically characterize CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ sources in the region. The time series show regular CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ elevations during the night, occasionally superimposed on multiday events. From these elevations, we identified three main CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ emission categories: Transylvanian biogenic gas (75%); biogenic emissions from rivers and wastewater (38%), predominantly observed during the summer; and a third source emitting 13C‐enriched CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ in winter, likely of pyrogenic origin (5%). We simulated the CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ mole fraction at the measurement site using Lagrangian footprints generated from the FLEXPART‐COSMO model convolved with emissions from the TNO‐CoCO2 inventory. The simulations show that the emission inventory is not granular enough to represent the city center. The strong underestimation in winter suggests that the emission inventory did not include the pyrogenic winter source. When the model accurately estimated the CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ mole fraction, it also predicted the isotopic compositions well."

In this study, we put forward a model for the collision and fragmentation of snow particles with a rigid bed surface based on the discrete element method and investigate the intrinsic mechanism of snow particle fragmentation under various impact conditions. The results demonstrate that the fragmentation of snow particles is predominantly governed by the normal component of the impact velocity relative to the bed surface. After the collision, snow particles generally break into one major fragment and several small fragments. Among them, the size of the major fragment decreases power exponentially with the normal impact velocity. The number of effective fragments (i.e., equivalent diameter is greater than 0.1 times the initial diameter.) initially increases and subsequently decreases with the normal impact velocity, peaking at around 8 m/s, and the size of small fragments follows a lognormal distribution. Furthermore, the critical velocity for snow particle fragmentation decreases linearly with the increase of the impact angle. Moreover, a complete fragmentation scheme for snow particle‐snow bed collision is given, which can provide an effective fragmentation model for blowing snow and further deepen the understanding of the movement of the two‐phase flow of wind and snow."

Ogunrinde;Xian Xue,Climate Change Influence on Solar Photovoltaic Energy Production and Its Associated Drivers in CMIP6 Ensemble Projections,"Climate change poses a threat to the global solar energy potential, but the regional impacts remain poorly understood. Using an ensemble of 32 climate models across four emission scenarios, we project changes in solar photovoltaic potential for 2066–2100 relative to 1980–2014 across 46 global regions. Our analysis employs novel methodologies, including atmospheric forcing decomposition and extreme event attribution, to identify the physical drivers of changes in solar resources. Under high‐emission scenarios, tropical regions face severe solar potential losses of 10%–15%, particularly in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia, driven by increased cloud cover and temperature‐induced efficiency declines of 0.4%–0.5% per °C. Conversely, mid‐ and high‐latitude regions could see 5%–10% increases under low‐emission scenarios, primarily during summer. Aerosol effects consistently reduce solar potential (up to 10.24 W/m2), while cloud changes show mixed regional impacts. Extremely high‐productivity solar days decline drastically (16%–99%) across most seasons and scenarios, posing a threat to grid stability. These findings reveal a fundamental restructuring of global solar resources that could exacerbate energy inequalities. Tropical regions—critical for sustainable development—face the most significant losses, while high‐latitude areas may benefit. Substantial climate mitigation preserves solar potential in most regions, while high‐emission pathways pose significant risks. Our results suggest the need to integrate climate projections into solar energy planning and develop climate‐resilient photovoltaic technologies to ensure equitable energy access in a changing climate."

Most of the existing footprint models assume horizontal homogeneity. However, as more and more flux towers are established over complex terrain, it is necessary to advance our understanding of footprints over complex terrain. Here we use a Lagrangian particle model coupled into a large‐eddy simulation model to investigate footprints over an idealized 2‐dimensional forested hill. Coordinate rotation, which is similar to that performed in real eddy‐covariance measurement, is considered in the calculation of footprints. For detectors over the upwind slope, their footprints are generally larger than the footprints of the detectors over the upwind flat ground. For detectors over the separation point, which is slightly downwind of the hill crest, their footprints extend both in the upwind and downwind directions. For detectors over the downwind slope and away from the separation point, their footprints also extend to the downwind direction, provided that the sources are released at the lower half of the canopy. This substantial downwind extension is in contrast to the conventional viewpoint. It is found that the footprints for the whole soil‐canopy system can be calculated by assuming that the canopy source/sink occurs at the single layer with the strongest source/sink. Compared to the footprints calculated with coordinate rotation, footprints calculated without coordinate rotation extend much farther upwind for detectors over the upwind slope, and have opposite signs for detectors over the downwind slope."

In radar observations, a preexisting bright band experiences a descent and then rises back to its initial height after a little while over an hour. During the two transitions, a weak and a strong double bright band occurs, respectively. When the double bright band arises, hydrometeors undergo incomplete melting in the upper ML and subsequently refreeze before entering the lower ML. Reanalysis and radiosonde data show that there is no significant change in the zonal and meridional winds, but a strong updraft is induced due to the occurrence of atmospheric instability. Analysis indicated that the instability is caused by intense atmospheric convergence; in the meantime, there are lots of upward Doppler velocities for hydrometeors in the radar measurement, confirming the occurrence of convection due to the instability. Hence, the expansion effect of updrafts causes cooling, and then, the temperature gradually recovers from the high to low levels as the updrafts weaken and ultimately cease, leading to the thermal inversion layer associated with the double bright band."

In this work, we use the benefits of the high resolution climate model and apply it to model irrigation effects and feedbacks on the local and regional climate, focusing on the interaction of irrigation with soil, surface, atmosphere, and vegetation processes. We employ the RCM REMO2020 interactively coupled to its vegetation module iMOVE and incorporate our newly developed irrigation parameterization. We conduct two simulation sets with and without the irrigation parameterization. In the first set, we employ the hydrostatic model version at 0.11° horizontal resolution for Southwestern Europe. For the second set, we repeat the experiment employing the non‐hydrostatic model version at convection‐permitting resolution of 0.0275° for Northern Italy. Our results indicate that improved vegetation conditions due irrigation, such as an increased canopy conductance, lead to effects in the atmosphere. For the atmosphere, we find more distinct and localized irrigation effects for the simulations at convection‐permitting resolution with enhanced near‐surface cooling of up to −2 K compared to the simulations at 0.11°. In the boundary layer, irrigation effects are highly influenced by turbulence, transporting the irrigation effect to higher levels. The largest differences in representing irrigation effects on the two resolutions were found in precipitation. While at 0.11° horizontal resolution, precipitation increases due to favorable convection conditions, explicitly resolving convection leads to rather mixed effects with a decrease of precipitation above irrigated areas, where the convection inhibition increased."

The results indicate that AHR significantly enhanced southeastward moisture transport and weakened southwestward moisture transport in SWC. This shift results in increased vertical upward motion over the western Sichuan Basin and the western and southeastern parts of the Yunnan‐Guizhou Plateau, leading to increased precipitation with a regional average increase of 0.1 mm per day. AHR contributes to wetter summers in SWC and increased cloud cover, which further affects the surface energy balance. In the Sichuan Basin, AHR significantly raised summer temperatures, with a regional average increase of 0.04°C; in some areas, temperatures have risen by as much as 0.4°C. Compared to previous findings obtained from coarse‐resolution models, the high‐resolution VR‐CESM model provided a more accurate simulation of the climatic effects of AHR, as it better accommodates the unique terrain of SWC. In summary, this study uses the high‐resolution VR‐CESM2 to explore the impacting mechanisms of AHR on the climate in SWC, which is crucial for understanding climate change in this region."

However, there are large uncertainties related to the HONO budget due to a lack of field measurements to support mechanistic studies. Here, we performed flux measurements of HONO emissions from rice paddies in Shanghai and evaluated their potential impact on the atmospheric HONO budget. Our results show distinct roles of rice paddies between daytime and nighttime. Unfertilized rice paddies emit HONO during the daytime with an average flux of 0.68 ± 1.37 ng N m−2 s−1, which corresponds to ∼10% of the total atmospheric HONO production for a daytime mixing layer height of 100 m. However, rice paddies act as a sink for HONO at night due to deposition and the high solubility of HONO in paddy water with an average flux of −0.30 ± 0.73 ng N m−2 s−1. Our correlation analyses reveal that water evaporation is a crucial factor influencing HONO emissions from rice paddies. Furthermore, the average HONO flux in rice paddies after nitrogen fertilization increased up to 2.24 ng N m−2 s−1 and contributed ∼40% to atmospheric HONO production. HONO emissions from rice paddies were estimated to be 0.10 ± 0.25 kg N ha−1 over the entire cultivation cycle (∼150 days) with an emission factor of 1.3 × 10−3 relative to the applied nitrogen.

While switching to modern fuels/stoves could decrease HAP levels, they are not always available or affordable. Improved biomass cookstoves could provide an intermediate step supporting transitions from traditional biomass to clean burning fuels/stoves. We conducted two stove intervention trials in Lusaka, Zambia using targeted marketing/incentives to motivate participants to use improved biomass stoves, either the Mimi Moto (pellet) or the EcoZoom (charcoal). Before the intervention, 65% of participants exclusively used charcoal, while 27% relied on electricity to some extent for cooking. We measured 24‐hr personal exposure to CO (n = 747) and PM2.5 (n = 90) of primary cooks. We implemented several statistical approaches to estimate the effects of interventions on exposure: household‐specific endline minus baseline exposure, ranksum testing, difference‐in‐differences analyses, and cross‐sectional analyses. We found that switching from traditional charcoal stoves to either intervention stove was not associated with significantly reduced exposures. However, cooks using electric stoves independent of the intervention did have significantly lower CO exposures than those using traditional charcoal, with greater electric stove use corresponding to greater exposure reductions. Variability in exposure was dominated by seasonal, regional, and neighborhood differences rather than household stove/fuel choices. A focus on HAP exposure from cooking in urban settings is unlikely to yield expected exposure reductions. Policy makers should consider pollution reduction policies/interventions that target ambient air quality in tandem with HAP‐mitigating strategies to address air pollution health burden."

To develop effective air quality management and mitigation strategies, understanding PM2.5 source attribution and associated health risks is essential. This study investigates the source attribution and health burden of PM2.5 focusing on Mainland Thailand (MT), North Thailand (NT), and the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), using the WRF‐Chem model and a brute‐force method for source attribution. PM2.5 contributions from biomass burning including both crop and non‐crop burning are quantified, along with contributions from transportation, industry, energy, residential, and other anthropogenic sectors. This study focuses on the haze season (February–April) in 2019. Our research shows that in‐domain foreign country's biomass burning is a major contributor to PM2.5, accounting for 23%–38% of PM2.5 concentrations in MT. In NT, non‐crop burning within MT contributes the most (21%–36%) to PM2.5 levels, while crop burning within MT has a minimal impact (less than 6%). In the BMR, PM2.5 is strongly impacted by sources outside the model domain. Overall, industrial and transportation emissions are the most impactful anthropogenic sources. We further estimate the total health burden, associated with long‐term PM2.5 exposure during the haze season contributes to 46% of this PM2.5 health burden in MT in 2019, 66% in NT, and 37% in the BMR. These findings suggest that reducing biomass burning within MT and from in‐domain foreign countries during February–April could reduce the annual health burden in MT by up to 20%."

 Humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), causing major changes in global climate while concurrently increasing the supply of biologically limiting nutrients especially nitrogen (N). Despite myriad negative effects on ecosystems and human health, nutrient pollution can increase the storage of soil carbon (C) in grasslands and retired farmland, potentially reducing atmospheric CO2. However, the persistence of nutrient-induced soil carbon gains remains a knowledge gap at the heart of a potential policy dilemma: whether reducing nutrient pollution could lead to the release of soil carbon that accumulated under high nutrient supply. Here we use a four-decade experiment conducted on retired, marginal cropland to demonstrate that nutrient addition increased soil C storage after intensive tilling, and that these soil C gains persisted for at least three decades following fertilizer and tilling cessation. This occurred despite plant biomass rapidly returning to pre-fertilization levels and plant community composition recovering from the effects of fertilization. These results demonstrate that nutrient-induced increases in soil C can persist for decades following reduced nutrient pollution as long as the soil remains untilled.

 Drought impedes the lateral flux of carbon along continental river networks to the oceans due to reduction in water flow. Here we show that, in addition to lower flow, drought also exacerbates secondary carbonate formation and atmospheric CO2 emissions. We report sub-hourly field measurements of major ion chemistry in the upper Sangamon River in North America, revealing that drought accelerates the characteristically rapid pace of carbonate mineral formation at the watershed scale. Over 195 consecutive days of moderate hydrologic drought, we observe a 17% decrease in annual riverine lateral carbon flux due to secondary carbonate formation, in addition to the restrictions imposed by low flow rates, indicating a natural limit to the inorganic carbon carrying capacity of rivers. We use historical datasets and a compilation of global river geochemistry measurements to show that this phenomenon is reproducible and widespread during periods of drought.

 The elastic degree of freedom is widely exploited to mediate magnetoelectric coupling between ferromagnetic films and ferroelectric substrates. For epitaxial Fe films grown on clean BaTiO3 substrates, shear strain can determine the underlying magnetoelastic coupling. Here, we use PhotoEmission Electron Microscopy of ferroic Fe and BaTiO3 domains, combined with micromagnetic simulations, to directly reveal an inverted interfacial magnetoelastic coupling in the low-dimensional limit. We show that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy competes with the epitaxial shear strain to align the local magnetization of ultrathin Fe films close to the local polarization direction of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 in-plane domains. Poling the BaTiO3 substrate creates c-domains with no shear strain contribution with the local magnetization rotated by ~45°. Tuning shear strain magnetoelastic contributions suggests new routes for designing magnetoelectric devices.

 Random fluctuations can lead to cooperative effects in complex systems. We here report the observation of noise-induced quantum synchronization in a chain of superconducting transmon qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. The application of Gaussian white noise to a single site leads to synchronous oscillations in the entire chain. We show that the two synchronized end qubits are entangled, with nonzero concurrence, and that they belong to a class of generalized Bell states known as maximally entangled mixed states, whose entanglement cannot be increased by any global unitary. We further demonstrate the stability against frequency detuning of both synchronization and entanglement by determining the corresponding generalized Arnold tongue diagrams. Our results highlight the constructive influence of noise in a quantum many-body system, and initiate the exploration of collective synchronization effects with stronger than classical correlations.

Here, the authors show that these neurons have more mature dendritic spines than neighboring cells, this maturation requiring concurrent plasticity in the amygdala. 
 Flexible decision making is fundamental to day-to-day life. It often requires us to form expectations regarding the consequences of potential actions and to later retrieve those memories to guide choices. We used a task in which mice must develop, remember, and recall novel strategies to obtain rewards. Chemogenetically inactivating neurons within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that are active during memory encoding obstructed later memory retrieval, impeding action flexibility. Meanwhile, stimulating these same neurons induced action flexibility. Thus, OFC neurons form stable memory traces (MTs) that are necessary and sufficient for action flexibility. Long-term storage of action variables may require new experiences to trigger durable cellular changes. Accordingly, MT neurons had higher proportions of mature dendritic spine types than neighboring non-MT neurons, this profile closely associated with successful learning. Further, activity of excitatory neurons and neurotrophin signaling within the basolateral amygdala were necessary for new memory formation and concurrent dendritic spine plasticity on MT neurons in the OFC. Thus, amygdalo-OFC interactions encode new reward information, which is retained by specific structurally-plastic neurons within the OFC and utilized during choice behavior. Key neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex form memories for best action strategies when mice seek rewards. Here, the authors show that these neurons have more mature dendritic spines than neighboring cells, this maturation requiring concurrent plasticity in the amygdala."

Here, the authors use mathematical modelling to assess the potential impacts of broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines for a hypothetical “SARS-X” outbreak. 
 COVID-19 has underscored the need for more timely access to vaccines during future pandemics. This has motivated development of broad-spectrum vaccines providing protection against entire viral families, which could be stockpiled and deployed rapidly following detection. Using mathematical modelling, we assess the utility of a broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine during a hypothetical SARS-X outbreak, for a range of implementation strategies including ring-vaccination, spatial-targeting and mass vaccination of high-risk groups. Broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine ring- or spatial strategies alone are insufficient to contain epidemics driven by a SARS-CoV-2-like virus, but when paired with rapid isolation and quarantine, can achieve containment of a SARS-CoV-1-like virus. Where suppression fails, broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine utilisation still reduces the effective reproduction number and slows epidemic growth - buying valuable time for health-system response and virus-specific vaccine development. Vaccination of high-risk populations with the broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine ahead of virus-specific vaccine availability could reduce mortality and enable shorter and less stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions to be imposed; results are sensitive to vaccine properties (e.g., efficacy), health system capabilities (e.g. rollout speed) and timeline to virus-specific vaccine availability. Our modelling suggests that broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine delivery to those aged 60+ years could have averted 21-78 % of COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic’s first year, depending on the size of the stockpile. Realising this potential impact will require investment in manufacturing, delivery capacity and equitable access ahead of future pandemics.

Here, authors derive a field theory for such interactions, revealing nonreciprocal couplings that generate diverse collective behaviors through simple manipulations. 
 Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviours emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviours driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding problem from swarm robotics as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents, the herders, must coordinate to confine another group of agents, the targets, within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behaviour, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to traffic and crowd management systems. Decision-making in multi-agent systems often involves control goals that break reciprocity.

 Hydropower is vital for climate mitigation by enabling low-carbon energy systems, but hydropower dams also trap sediment, a crucial resource for ecosystems and climate adaptation along downstream coastlines. Here we present a multisectoral integrated water–sediment–energy planning framework that fully internalizes the impacts of hydropower expansion, both on energy system costs and on foregone ecosystem services from reduced sediment supply for the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis indicates that full development of large hydropower could reduce sediment flows to the Mekong Delta by 41.2 ± 6.6 megatonnes per year (75 ± 9%). However, strategically replacing 19 high-sediment-trapping hydropower plants with solar, wind and energy storage alternatives could preserve up to 98% of sediment supply, with only a 4–6% (US$15.7–26.0 billion) increase in energy system costs over 2020–2050. Crucially, when sediment-related benefits—valued at US$12–28 million per megatonne per year—are considered, the additional costs of preserving sediment supply are nearly offset. The proposed framework offers a transferable approach to support sustainable low-carbon energy transitions while safeguarding sediment-dependent ecosystems worldwide.

 Internal climate variability (ICV) remains a major source of uncertainty in climate projections, complicating impact assessments across critical sectors, especially at stakeholder-relevant scales. Given that ICV emerges from the nonlinear interactions of the climate system, we argue that nonlinear dynamical (NLD) approaches can improve its characterization, providing physically interpretable insights that strengthen adaptation strategies and support multisector decision-making. However, despite their suitability for such problems, NLD approaches remain largely underutilized in the analysis of initial condition large ensembles (LEs). We argue that a diverse suite of NLD approaches offers a promising pathway for systematically extracting robust insights from LEs. If effectively applied and systematically integrated, these methods could fully harness the potential of LEs, uncovering underlying patterns and variability across ensemble members to refine fundamental insights from climate projections. This will help bridge the gap between complex climate dynamics and practical resilience strategies, ensuring that decision-makers, resource managers, and infrastructure planners have a more reliable foundation for navigating irreducible uncertainty."

Abrupt warming occurred after 1970 at 93.6% of Eurasian grid points, with 78.0% concentrated between 1970 and 1990. This abrupt warming is driven largely by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), explaining 58% of the variation. Early warming hotspots appeared on the Mongolian Plateau and Central Asia, spreading outward. The most significant warming occurs in middle and high latitudes. Regional differences in hydrothermal conditions and cloud cover lead to varying warming timings across Eurasia. Additionally, the warming exhibits significant seasonal asymmetry, with winter warming predominantly driving the abrupt temperature increase, accounting for 45% of the variance. This is driven by the dominant positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) in winter."

 Aerosols affect radiation, cloud properties, convection, air temperature, and large-scale circulation, yet their influence on precipitation distribution over the Maritime Continent (MC), a complex tropical region composed of islands interspersed with shallow seas, remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution cloud-system resolving model simulations, satellite observations, and reanalysis data, we demonstrate that rising aerosol concentrations amplify oceanic precipitation more than they suppress land precipitation, thereby increasing the sea-to-land precipitation ratio over the MC. This shift is supported by observations and contrasts with the land-enhanced precipitation distribution seen in pristine simulations or those without aerosol radiative effects. Our results underscore that aerosol-induced radiative cooling stabilizes the lower troposphere more over land than over the ocean, enhancing low-level convergence and convection over the sea. Moreover, high aerosol concentrations delay the diurnal precipitation peak over land from late afternoon to midnight, driven by diminished daytime heating and subsequent nighttime increases in moist static energy—an interesting pattern evident in some observed high-aerosol days."

 Submillimeter-scale redox archives in organic-rich mudrocks elucidate dynamic environmental stress shaping early marine animal ecosystems. During the late Cambrian, benthic animals, including trilobites, thrived in intermittently oxygen-deficient (predominantly euxinic) outer shelf environment where the astronomically-tuned Scandinavian Alum Shale was deposited. We present ultrahigh-resolution (0.25 mm) molybdenum and uranium isotope (δ98Mo-δ238U) and concentration profiles, revealing millennial-scale redox fluctuations that intermittently disrupted bottom-water euxinia. Varying ocean circulation, redox buffer supplies, and/or reduced productivity likely created short-lived aerobic niches for opportunistic benthic animals. Distinct δ98Mo-δ238U patterns indicate recurrent chemocline shoaling with toxic hydrogen sulfide incursions into surface waters, resembling metal drawdown in modern restricted basins. These fluctuations punctuated a million-year-long global oceanic anoxic event linked to the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion. Following this excursion, local redox conditions oscillated around a globally more oxygenated baseline, coinciding with animal diversifications in Baltica and worldwide. These millennial-scale redox changes underscore the need for higher-resolution geochemical approaches in paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

Understanding where future power plant sitings are likely to take place and identifying potential conflicts and land-use tradeoffs will be key to identifying feasible and affordable investments and evaluating regional planning coordination needs.

Eight species of epifauna were found, with a mean density of 43,184 ind. m−2, mostly concentrated on the metal parts. Surrounding sediment had a significantly lower abundance of only 8213 ind. m−2. Chemical analysis of water sampled directly near several warheads showed high concentrations of explosive compounds, with, e.g., trinitrotoluene (TNT) levels of 2.73 mg/l. These concentrations approach toxicity thresholds for aquatic organisms. However, the epifauna develops on breached munitions in numbers comparable to natural hard substrata.

 The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is widely used in forest ecosystem research. Photon cloud classification is crucial for ICESat-2's application in sub-canopy topography and forest structure parameter estimation. However, steep topography, complex canopy structure, and dense canopy cover are important error factors affecting the results of photon cloud classification in forest areas. The existing basic photon cloud classification methods classify ground and canopy photons based on the spatial distribution of photons in the elevation direction. However, in areas of steep topography, it is difficult for the existing photon cloud classification methods to distinguish ground photons from canopy photons because ground photons and some canopy photons will have the same elevation, making their characteristics unclear. In addition, the complex canopy structure and dense canopy cover cause the distribution of photons in the elevation direction to have complex multi-peak characteristics, increasing the difficulty of distinguishing ground photons from canopy photons. In this paper, we propose a novel photon cloud classification method coupling slope and complex canopy structure to account for the abovementioned error factors in photon cloud classification. The proposed model describes the spatial distribution of photons under various slopes and canopy structures based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the photon cloud elevation. The proposed model generates PDFs with simple or complex canopy structures under every slope to characterize the photons' spatial distribution in the elevation direction. A slope lookup table is then introduced to find the most appropriate PDF based on the constructed essential criteria with physical meaning. Finally, the coupling of the proposed model is solved by the most appropriate PDF, and the slope and photon cloud classification results can be obtained. The proposed model was tested in 130 forest plots covering various topographies and canopy structures. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved slopes, the RMSE of the classified ground photons, and the F-value of the ground photons classified by the proposed model reach 1.95°, 1.4 m, and 0.82, respectively. These accuracy indicators illustrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing basic models in the case of steep topography and complex forest structure. This study will substantially improve the accuracy of ground elevation and forest structure parameter estimation through the use of ICESat-2 data worldwide."

 In 2024, China experiences frequent and severe hydrological extremes, including record-breaking rainfall and widespread droughts, reflecting the intensifying impacts of climate change. The significant changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) caused by these extreme precipitation events require more detailed analysis to assess short-term hydrological dynamics. Here, we first analyze precipitation anomalies (PA) and percentage of PA (PPA) across mainland China from April to August 2024. The results reveal that PA and PPA in most regions exhibit extreme values in different months, resulting in severe droughts, floods, and abrupt drought-to-flood transitions. To assess the associated water storage changes, we define and apply the terrestrial water flux (TWF), the differenceof GRACE/GRACE-FO-derived TWS anomalies in two adjacent months, as a diagnostic indicator of short-term hydrological variability. Relative to 2002–2024, the grids with TWF percentiles within the 0-10th and 90-100th ranges respectively account for 36.52%, 46.22%, 44.79%, and 46.48% of the total grids from April to August in China. Additionally, 19.89% of grids have the maximum TWF value in 2024. These extremes closely align with variations in precipitation, suggesting that intensified TWF is primarily driven by meteorological factors rather than GRACE-FO data uncertainties. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of TWF in capturing rapid hydrological changes under climate extremes. The findings provide critical insights into the impacts of climate change on regional hydrological processes and offer a valuable reference for future climate risk management and adaptation strategies at both national and global scales."

 Explosions in urban areas pose serious risks to human life and infrastructure, emphasizing the need for accurate vulnerability mapping.

 Snow and ice are among the most important components of the cryosphere; therefore, accurate identification of snow and ice is key to improve the understanding of the influence of various studies on global warming, e.g., studies on global water cycling, climate change and the radiation budget balance. The spectral information at single-view, e.g., the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) has been widely used in the recognition of snow cover at both local and global scales. However, special information sources related to the angular pattern of snow reflectance have rarely been considered in such applications. In this study, we proposed an angular index named the snow anisotropic reflectance index (SARI) based on the RossThick–LisparseReciprocal–Snow (RTLSRS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to achieve snow identification. The POLarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances (POLDER) database is one of the most widely-used multiangular database because of the abundant measurements and the pixels marked as “snow” are served as the data foundation in this study. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of multiangular information to differentiate these pixels over Arctic in various situations. First, we preprocess the POLDER snow database to select the pixels with a good BRDF sampling distribution. Then, the SARI is used to preliminarily classify these POLDER datasets as snow and nonsnow, together with the classification result derived by single-view reflectances as comparison in the red and NIR bands. Next, the classification result is validated by using the MODIS MOD10A2 product. Finally, further analysis of the BRDF variations, regarding the SARI, for the classification results is performed by using the ArcticDEM and the Arctic Vegetation Map, a more detailed snow BRDF database over Arctic is obtained. The main results are as follows: (1) The potential of multiangular information (SARI) in recognizing snow had been confirmed according to MOD10A2 product as indirect validation data, the overall accuracy can reach to 86.9%, higher than the conventional single-view method (81.7%). (2) Within–pixel variations in surface terrain and components have a significant influence on the variability in BRDF shapes in the forward and backward scattering directions; in turn, these variations can be easily captured by using several simple thresholds for subcategorization for this POLDER snow database in Arctic Circle. Finally, this study provides a detailed POLDER database over Arctic and explain BRDF variations in various situations, facilitates the future potential applications of the remote sensing community."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for understanding land–atmosphere interactions, hydrology, and ecological dynamics. While thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has traditionally been used for LST retrieval, its effectiveness is limited by cloud cover and atmospheric interference. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing offers a significant advantage by enabling all-weather LST retrieval, as microwave signals can penetrate clouds and precipitation. However, PMW-based LST observations from a single satellite platform suffer from significant orbital gaps, particularly in middle and low latitudes, due to the limited swath width of current sensors. Additionally, the intraday revisit frequency of PMW LST is constrained to a maximum of two times per day (ascending and descending modes), which is insufficient for capturing rapid diurnal temperature variations or supporting high-temporal-resolution applications.In this study, therefore, we address these limitations by proposing an innovative framework for intraday LST estimation with enhanced spatial coverage. This is achieved by fusing PMW data from two polar-orbiting satellites, Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) and Fengyun-3F (FY-3F), which operate at different equatorial crossing times. A sophisticated gap-filling algorithm is introduced, leveraging temporally adjacent LST estimates from intraday brightness temperature (TB) observations. Results demonstrate that the gap-filled LST from the optimal data fusion scheme exhibits a minimal positive bias of approximately 0.1–0.2 K compared to the original LST retrievals, while achieving an intraday revisit frequency of up to four times per day in middle latitudes. This represents a significant improvement over the pre-gap-filling frequency of 2.5 times per day. The framework not only enhances the spatial coverage of PMW-based LST but also provides a foundation for future satellite missions to further improve global LST monitoring. By enabling all-weather, high-frequency LST observations, this framework advances our understanding of land–atmosphere interactions, supports climate modeling, and enhances environmental monitoring capabilities."

Individual MPs were separated by the use of chemical digestion and density gradient centrifugation; these were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Overall, 129 MPs were identified in BALF, with a corrected mean of 3.2 particles/10 mL in BALF; however, the majority were white or transparent fibers ranging from a diameter of 20–100 μm, and were predominantly polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS).

 Rare earth elements (REEs) are commonly used to trace sources and geochemical processes due to their coherent chemical properties and systematic variations. However, with the rapid expansion of their industrial applications, REEs have increasingly become emerging atmospheric pollutants, while their anthropogenic sources and associated health risks remain poorly understood. In this study, a year-long observation (April 2021–March 2022) of total suspended particles (TSP) and size-segregated aerosol was conducted in Nanchang, a major Chinese REE industry city. We found the average annual concentration of total REEs (ΣREE) was in the order of spring > winter > autumn > summer. Most REEs showed low enrichment factors (EFs), suggesting a primarily crustal origin. However, the elevated Ce and Eu EFs, combined with positive Ce and Eu anomalies pattern, indicated anthropogenic influence. A significant positive correlation of Ce and Eu EFs across both TSP and size-segregated samples further suggests a common anthropogenic source. Photoelectric industry emissions were identified as the primary contributors to the observed anomalies, accounting for 39 % ± 18 % of Ce and 24 % ± 11 % of Eu annually. Notably, both Ce and Eu anomalies showed comparable degree across fine and coarse PM, demonstrating the unique particle size distribution characteristics of photoelectric Ce and Eu. While Ce inhalation showed no significant non-carcinogenic health risks in Nanchang, concerns should be raised for workers and residents near photoelectric industry sites due to high Ce exposure levels. Furthermore, the urgent establishment of threshold values for REEs, particularly Eu, is necessary given its notable enrichment."

 Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are important light-absorbing constituents of brown carbon (BrC), yet their seasonal characteristics, particle-size distributions, optical properties, and sources remain insufficiently resolved in highly polluted urban environments. This study presents a year-long field investigation of NACs in PM2.5 in urban Beijing, focusing on their seasonal variations, size distributions, optical properties, and sources. Eight NAC species were quantified across four seasons, with winter showing the highest concentrations due to enhanced emissions and unfavorable meteorology. Size-resolved analysis revealed fine-mode dominance (0.43–1.1 μm), reflecting secondary formation from aromatic precursors and implying strong radiative and health relevance, while coarse-mode occurrence suggested contributions from primary biomass burning and heterogeneous processes. NACs exhibited distinct light-absorbing properties, with laboratory-calibrated mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) confirming their role as contributors to methanol-soluble brown carbon (MSBrC). On annual average, NACs accounted for 2.7 ± 1.5 % (0.35–8.3 %) of MSBrC absorption at 365 nm, indicating that they are a non-negligible but limited contributor to BrC light absorption. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified biomass burning, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, dust, and secondary formation as major sources, with seasonal variations highlighting the importance of mixed combustion sources in summer and autumn. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive molecular- and size-resolved dataset that links NAC concentrations, optical properties, and source apportionment, offering new insights into the atmospheric role of NACs and their implications for urban air quality and radiative forcing."

 Contrails formed by aircraft in the upper troposphere contribute to anthropogenic climate forcing. However, the conditions driving their formation and persistence remain incompletely understood. This study combines a ACTRIS/EARLINET ground-based LIDAR, all-sky camera imagery, ADS-B aircraft tracking, and ECMWF-ERA5 reanalysis to analyse contrails formation and evolution over Clermont-Ferrand, France, on June 2, 2023. Twelve contrails are documented throughout the day, including five persistent and seven non-persistent contrails. Persistent contrails formed at 10.36 km altitude or lower are observed under ice-supersaturated conditions (relative humidity with respect to ice, RHi > 105 %) and at temperatures between 217 and 223 K. Non-persistent contrails produced by higher altitudes aircrafts, are associated with lower RHi mostly below 100 % and colder temperatures (214–217 K). The horizontal persistent contrail widths range from 0.53 ± 0.10 to 1.60 ± 0.44 km (all-sky camera estimation) and 0.35 ± 0.14 to 1.90 ± 0.32 km (LIDAR estimation), and vertical extents varied from 340 ± 10 to 440 ± 20 m. The optical properties of these contrails have also been estimated by LIDAR. Aerosol backscatter coefficient vary from 0.02 to 0.05 km−1 sr−1, scattering ratios from 8 to 20, volume linear depolarization from 0.13 to 0.24 and particle linear depolarization from 0.17 to 0.45. The maximum contrail observation duration by camera is 180 min. The study highlights the potential of ground-based remote sensing for contrail monitoring."
