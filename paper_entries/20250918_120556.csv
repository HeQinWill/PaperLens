10.5194/acp-25-10661-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用机载遥感技术（MethaneAIR）对美国主要油气产区的高排放甲烷点源进行了观测和量化，并分析了不同行业部门的排放贡献。研究结果揭示了油气设施是主要的排放源，但在某些盆地，非油气行业的排放占比也很高，例如阿巴拉契亚盆地的煤矿设施。这项研究强调了详细的源头识别对于制定有效的减排策略至关重要，并为甲烷卫星观测提供了参考。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['methane emissions', 'point source detection', 'airborne measurements', 'oil and gas sector', 'MethaneAIR', 'remote sensing', 'facility attribution', 'atmospheric composition']",Jack D.

We use observations of methane point sources from the MethaneAIR instrument from 2021–2023 that covered ~80 % of US onshore oil and gas production regions. We attribute these observations to facility types to explore how emissions vary by industrial sectors. Oil and gas facilities make up most point source emissions nationally, but in certain basins other sectors can make up the majority. 
 High-emitting methane point sources, quantified by remote sensing methods at individual facilities, have gained significant interest for enabling rapid monitoring and mitigation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Here, we present new methane point source quantifications from MethaneAIR, the airborne precursor to MethaneSAT, from campaigns in 2021–2023, which targeted major oil and gas basins covering ∼ 80 % of US onshore production. Flying at ∼ 12 km above ground, MethaneAIR provides wide-area methane mapping and high-resolution measurements of high-emitting methane point sources. Across 13 major basins, MethaneAIR detected over 400 point sources with emission rates >∼150kgh-1, for which we performed detailed attribution to facility categories within oil and gas and non-oil and gas sectors. In 2023, we quantified total point source methane emissions of 357 t h−1 (95 % confidence interval: 277–435 t h−1), with ∼ 80 % of the total attributable to oil and gas sources. Non-oil and gas sources made up 50 %–80 % of observed point source emissions in certain basins, with coal facilities in the Appalachian Basin being the largest source of non-oil and gas methane emissions (30–40 t h−1). We observe emission source intermittency and significant variation across facility types and basins, highlighting the complex characteristics of high-emitting point sources. Our results emphasize the importance of detailed source attribution for prioritizing mitigation efforts and provide the first analysis of methane point sources in several regions, which will be improved by the observational capabilities of a growing set of methane satellites."

Qomolangma,"This study reveals unexpectedly high levels of particulate nitrite at the Base Camp of Mt. Qomolangma, which overwhelmingly exists in coarse mode, and demonstrates that lofted surface soil and long-range transported pollutants contribute to the high levels of nitrite. The high particulate nitrite is likely to participate in atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycling through gas-particle partitioning or photolysis, leading to production of HONO, OH and NO and thereby influencing oxidation chemistry. 
 Atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycling, with nitrous acid (HONO) and particulate nitrite (NO2-) as important intermediates, is crucial for maintaining the atmospheric oxidation capacity of background atmosphere on the Tibetan Plateau. During an 11 d field campaign at the Base Camp of Mt. Qomolangma in spring of 2022, we observed significant enrichments of NO2- in total suspended particulate (TSP) with a mean concentration of 375±386 ng m−3, while NO2- was absent in fine particles (PM2.5). The comparison revealed that NO2- predominately exists in coarse particles. Local surface soil at the sampling site also exhibited high levels of NO2-, with δ15N value similar to NO2- in TSP. This isotopic similarity suggests that wind-blown soil is probably the primary source of NO2- in TSP, accounting for the background levels. While concentration changes of water-soluble inorganic ions in TSP and PM2.5 in response to shifts in air mass back-trajectories imply that atmospheric pollutants transported from South Asia may further elevate the NO2-, the specific mechanisms of long-range transport resulting in NO2- accumulation in TSP rather than PM2.5 remain unknown and need to be investigated. The elevated levels of TSP NO2- may readily participate in atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycling through gas-particle partitioning or photolysis, leading to the production of HONO, OH and NO and thereby influencing oxidation chemistry. Further efforts on the sources and atmospheric chemistry of particulate nitrite are warranted, particularly in the pristine Tibetan Plateau, where even small inputs of NOx or HONO can disproportionately affect oxidant budgets and reactive nitrogen cycling."

We evaluated the remote sensing column NO2 in relation to near-surface concentrations throughout the day and found that the prohibition of vertical transport in the morning and the mixing in the afternoon resulted in different relations between the near-surface (NS) and total column NO2 concentrations. These different relationships have consequences for the use of satellite remote sensing to estimate NS NO2 concentrations. 
 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a major pollutant that at high concentrations may affect human health. It is also a photochemically reactive gas that is important for the oxidation potential of the atmosphere and acts as a precursor for the formation of aerosol particles and ozone. However, monitoring of near-surface (NS) NO2 faces the challenge of spatial discontinuity due to large distances between ground-based monitoring stations, whereas satellite remote sensing provides total vertical column density (VCD) that is related to near-surface (NS) concentrations in a complicated manner. In this study, the relation between total VCD and NS concentrations of NO2 was analyzed based on total VCD from remote sensing observations using a ground-based Pandora spectrometer and NS NO2 concentrations from in situ observations. Both instruments were located at the Beijing-RADI site (Beijing, China) during January 2022. The ratio between total VCD and NS NO2 concentrations varies throughout the day with substantially different relations in the morning and afternoon. During the night and morning, the atmosphere was vertically stratified, with disconnected layers that prevented vertical mixing of atmospheric constituents. In the afternoon, these layers connected, allowing for vertical mixing and transport between the surface and the top of the boundary layer. Thus, the prohibition of vertical transport in the morning and the mixing in the afternoon resulted in different relations between the total VCD and NS NO2 concentrations. These different relationships have consequences for the use of satellite remote sensing to estimate NS NO2 concentrations."

Martinsson;Johan Friberg;Moa K. Sporre,Stratospheric aerosol formed by intense volcanism–sea interaction during the 2022 Hunga Ha'apai eruption,"Highly variable stratospheric aerosol bears great importance for Earth's climate. The 1-year average aerosol load from the 2022 volcanic eruption in Hunga Tonga is the highest since the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The usual volcanic aerosol precursor gas (SO2) mass was not sufficient to explain the aerosol load. Intense volcanism–sea interaction amplified the eruption, and sea salt emission forms a plausible explanation for the high aerosol loading. 
 The Hunga Tonga eruption on 15 January 2022 (HT-22) induced vigorous volcano–sea interaction. Here we study the stratospheric aerosol and water vapor resulting from the eruption using satellite-based instruments: the CALIOP lidar and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We investigate the stratospheric relative humidity following the record-breaking water vapor injections from the HT-22 eruption and the particle size of the aerosol. The HT-22 eruption injected its effluents into the deep Brewer–Dobson (BD) branch causing several years of stratospheric perturbation. The long duration and the aerosol concentration (among the highest) make the HT-22 eruption the strongest stratospheric aerosol event since the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption despite a modest SO2 injection explaining only ∼30 % of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the HT-22 eruption according to our estimates. The stratospheric AOD level was established after 2 weeks, or possibly even earlier, which is a short time compared with the usual 2–3 months required to reach the maximum AOD following volcanic eruptions. We discuss the sources of the aerosol from the HT-22 eruption in relation to the low emission of SO2, its e-folding time, and volcanological observations of strong interactions with the sea containing not only water but also high concentrations of dissolved substances."

Three sites around the Drygalski Ice Tongue record temperature, salinity, pressure, and currents. The data highlight seasonal cycles and variability, informing studies of water mass formation, ice–ocean interactions, glaciology, and regional ecosystems. 
 In this paper we describe a decade-long timeseries of hydrographic mooring observations around the Drygalski Ice Tongue in southern Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. Unique aspects of the data are that (i) the instruments were placed very close to the Ice Tongue due to its significant influence on the region’s ocean and sea ice, and (ii) the upper sensors were positioned relatively close (< 100 m) to the ocean surface compared to typical Antarctic moorings. Starting in December 2014, the mooring array included three locations – the Drygalski Basin, the edge of the Crary Bank and, on the southern side of the ice tongue, in Geikie Inlet. The instruments measure temperature, salinity, pressure, and current velocity. The “DITx” mooring locations were chosen in order to support questions regarding the influence of the Drygalski Ice Tongue on regional ocean processes. The observations are relevant to water mass formation, glaciology and ice melt, sea ice production and decay, ice shelf cavity processes – as well as regional marine ecosystem processes. The data from the instruments show the seasonal cycle along with interannual variability, as well as a range of singular events. All data can be downloaded from the SEANOE database."

 We present the results of downscaling CMIP6 global climate projections to local scales for the Mediterranean and Italian regions, aiming to produce high-resolution climate information for the assessment of climate change signals, with a focus on precipitation extreme events. We performed hindcast (i.e., ERA5-driven) and historical simulations (driven by the MPI-ESM1-2-HR model) to simulate the present (1980–2014) and future (2015–2100) climate under three different emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5).For each experiment, a double-nesting approach is adopted to dynamically downscale global data to the regional domain of interest, firstly over the Europe (EURO) COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) domain, at a spatial resolution of 15 km, and then further refined (second nesting) over Italy and the northwestern Mediterranean at a resolution of 5 km, i.e., in the so-called gray zone (5–10 km), close to the convection-permitting (CP) limit. Besides validating the experimental protocol, this work potentially questions the need for climate simulations to always resort to deep convection parameterizations when spatial refinement is increased up to the limit of the CP scale, yet convective processes are still not explicitly resolved. Analyses of air temperature and precipitation are presented, with a focus on the spatial distribution of precipitation, its probability density function, and the statistics of extreme events for both current climate and far-end scenarios. By the end of the century for all the scenarios and seasons there is a projected general warming along with an intensification of the hydrological cycle over most of continental Europe  and mean precipitation reduction over the Mediterranean region accompanied, over the Italian Peninsula, by a strong increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation events, particularly relevant for the SSP5-8.5 scenario during autumn."

 This study presents SanDyPALM, an innovative toolkit designed to streamline the generation of both static and dynamic input data for the PALM model, thereby facilitating urban microclimate simulations. SanDyPALM is capable of processing a diverse range of custom input data from raster and vector files, and it incorporates two novel methods – OSM2PALM and LCZ4PALM – that introduce the automated extraction of static input data from open data sources. To investigate the impact of static input data on simulation outcomes, we developed static drivers from four distinct data sources. Our analysis reveals not only variations in the generated static drivers but also differences in the simulation results. Importantly, all simulations correlate well with measurements from two different weather stations, underscoring the robustness of the overall modeling approach. However, we observed variations in temperature, humidity, and wind speed that are dependent on the static input data. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that automated processing methods can yield results comparable to those achieved through expert-driven approaches, significantly simplifying workflows."

However, critical gaps remain in identifying contamination thresholds and understanding how different microplastics affect CO2 emissions through interactions with soil and microbes. To address these gaps, we conducted a microcosm experiment to evaluate CO2 emissions and their key influencing factors in soil amended with four types of agricultural film-derived microplastics (PE, PP, PVC, and PBAT) at varying doses (0.01, 0.10, 1.00, and 5.00%). Findings reveal that at higher doses, PBAT and PVC significantly enhanced soil CO2 emissions and cumulative mineralization, whereas PE and PP exhibited no clear dose–response relationship. Microplastics exhibited a double-edged effect on CO2 emissions, transitioning from inhibition to promotion over time. The zero-point effect stabilized in a short time, with PVC and PBAT being more prone to disrupt soil processes compared to PE and PP, exhibiting dose threshold values of 0.07, 0.09, 2.38, and 2.16%, respectively. Microplastic characteristics, soil physicochemical properties, and microbial communities varied with the types and doses of microplastics added, contributing 34.7, 39.4, and 25.9%, respectively, to the double-edged effect. Furthermore, the type of microplastics (coefficient = 0.67) had a more substantial effect on the double-edged effect than dosage (coefficient = 0.39), highlighting the critical role of the microplastic type in modulating soil carbon dynamics. This study provides new mechanistic insights into how microplastics affect soil carbon cycling, helping predict their impact on climate change mitigation and sustainable soil management."

Herein, 24 commercial ozone catalysts (denoted as #1–#24) were screened for salt-resistant catalytic performance, among which four catalysts (#1, #15, #22, and #23) demonstrated exceptional catalytic ozonation activity for oxalate (OA) removal in the presence of 15 g L–1 NaCl. The active components of these four catalysts were identified as CuO (#1), CuO/MnO2 (#15), Mn2O3 (#22), and Fe3O4 (#23), respectively. Increasing the salinity from 15 to 200 g L–1 significantly inhibited OA removal in the CuO/O3 system, while no inhibitory effect was observed in the other three systems. Mechanistic studies revealed that Cl– inhibited OA removal in the CuO/O3 system by quenching the aqueous-phase hydroxyl radicals (HOaq•). Although HOaq• was also the dominant oxidant in both Mn2O3/O3 and Fe3O4/O3 systems, their negatively charged surfaces electrostatically repelled Cl–, preventing the depletion of HOaq• by Cl– and thus maintaining the catalytic activity. Differently, surface-adsorbed hydroxyl radicals were generated in the CuO/MnO2/O3 system, enabling the salt-resistance performance of this system. This work paves the way for both selecting and designing effective catalysts for catalytic ozonation of hypersaline wastewater."

This study aims to elucidate AMF’s impacts on PFAS removal and their role in mitigating the environmental risks posed by residual PFASs in the effluent. The results indicated that the primary removal pathways of PFASs in CWs were substrate adsorption and microbial degradation, while plant uptake contributed minimally (0.2–0.3%). AMF enhanced host plant absorption and translocation of PFASs, thereby increasing PFAS accumulation in plant tissues. Additionally, AMF promoted the enrichment of key microbes (e.g., Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria), which stabilized and enhanced the activity of the rhizosphere microbial network, facilitating PFAS biotransformation and degradation. Through the reinforcement of microbial degradation, substrate adsorption, and plant uptake pathways, AMF symbiosis significantly enhanced PFAS removal, increasing efficiency by 10.5–13.3% compared to treatments without AMF. Notably, long-chain (C > 7) PFASs pose higher ecological risks compared to short-chain (C ≤ 7) PFASs. AMF effectively reduced the ecological risks associated with residual PFASs and their metabolites in the effluent. The results highlight AMF’s potential to improve PFAS removal in CWs and offer valuable insights for developing sustainable, high-efficiency pollution control strategies."

This study shows that CN and Ncs interact through charge exchange, with electron transfer from Ncs to CN, leading to edge group bonding. Additionally, the humic acid component in Ncs forms heterostructure with CN via interfacial adhesion (C–O bonds). Toxicity to phytoplankton (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) was assessed based on CN and Ncs concentrations in natural aquatic ecosystems. The results showed that Ncs+CN severely damaged the photosynthetic system of algal, resulting in a 16.35% inhibition of algal growth (compared to the control group). Mechanistically, (1) Ncs+CN generates more 1O2 (69.75 vs 57.36 μmol L–1), resulting in more damage to the algal. (2) Compared to the control group, light-induced phototoxicity led to inhibition of chlorophyll a (chl-a) and rubisco enzymes (3.50–22.23%, 1.73–21.76%); (3) Metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed disruptions in energy metabolism and carbon/nitrogen assimilation within the algal cells. Notably, genes associated with photosynthesis and carbon sequestration (such as psbR, psbB, and rbcS) showed significant downregulation, consistent with reduced photosynthetic capacity (e.g., chl-a and rubisco enzyme activity).

To simulate these conditions, we investigated in laboratory-controlled conditions the effects of high-hydrostatic pressure [20 MPa] vs atmospheric pressure [0.1 MPa] on the leaching of 17 organic compounds from cryo-milled tire tread particles (μm sized) and crumb rubber particles (mm sized) into natural seawater. We monitored the abundance of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the leachates over the 14 day exposure period under biotic conditions. Abiotic controls were employed to delineate the influence of prokaryotes on the fate of leached chemicals. Our results showed leaching of dissolved organic carbon and target chemicals under all experimental conditions, with higher concentrations of certain target chemicals under high-hydrostatic pressure conditions (e.g., 1,3-diphenylguanidine [DPG]: max. 703 (20 MPa) vs 119 μg/L (0.1 MPa) from cryo-milled tire tread particles under biotic conditions). Under abiotic conditions leaching was weaker for DPG and other chemicals, with contrasting trends for chemicals prone to biotransformation. In crumb rubber leachates chemical concentrations increased with time, but showed no significant differences between biotic/abiotic or high-hydrostatic/atmospheric pressure conditions. Prokaryotic abundance increased in all samples containing tire particles compared to seawater controls, indicating the use of the rubber and/or leached chemicals as an energy source."

We integrate Lattice Boltzmann Method computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations , pore-scale imaging (micro-CT, optical microscopy, SEM), and transition state theory to investigate basalt multiphase flow dynamics and the influence of multiphase flow parameters (capillary number, Ca#, and water saturation) on the occurrence of small (<35 μm) and large (0.2–2 mm) postinjection carbonate nodules within, respectively, WBPD Zone 1 (connected vesicles) and Zone 2 (semi-isolated vesicles) end-members. Image analysis is augmented by pore size distribution measurements (N2 adsorption, low-field NMR) to establish the dual-porosity nature of the zones and subvoxel resolution fluid flow pathways to vesicles. In Zone 1, drainage simulations demonstrate how the distribution of  scCO2–water interfaces vary under different capillary and viscous flow regimes and may limit the size of precipitants. In Zone 2, 3D morphological analysis of simulated capillary-driven scCO2–water distributions and microCT-informed carbonate growth within vesicles reveals that the location and growth extent of large carbonate nodules are likely controlled by the distribution of scCO2–water  interfaces (acidity source) in relation to altered vesicle surfaces (alkalinity source). Toward augmenting geochemical/reactive transport models in basalt lithologies and beyond, we propose stepwise mechanisms describing how morphology-determined local water saturation and pH gradients lead to supersaturated “Goldilocks region” conditions favorable for carbonate growth.

Current phytoremediation efforts face challenges due to a limited understanding of Cr-tolerance mechanisms and the unclear role of anthocyanins in metal detoxification. This study investigates Cr-tolerance responses in two Brassica rapa varieties: the tolerant chinensis (BRC) and the sensitive purpuraria (BRP), using an integrated multiomics framework. BRC showed 30% less biomass reduction than BRP under Cr stress. Genomic analysis identified gene clusters specific to BRC associated with metabolic flexibility. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed regulatory networks driven by transcription factors that support tolerance. Mechanisms contributing to Cr-tolerance included improved root glutathione metabolism for Cr sequestration, suppressed glyoxylate pathways in the stem to reduce oxidative stress, and increased leaf cysteine and methionine metabolism to support antioxidant production. Notably, anthocyanin accumulation did not correlate with Cr-tolerance; BRP accumulated 15% more anthocyanins than BRC under stress. The findings indicate that Cr-tolerance in B. rapa relies on metabolic changes and transcriptional control of detoxification pathways, not anthocyanins. Identifying key targets in specific tissues, such as root glutathione synthase and leaf sulfur metabolism pathways, offers potential avenues for developing Cr-resistant crop varieties and enhancing agricultural sustainability in metal-contaminated soils."

As integrated metabolites are released throughout the algal growth, algal volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) may signal bloom onset earlier than conventional indicators. This study introduced a novel approach combining proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) and interpretable machine learning to predict algal density through AVOCs. By analyzing an AVOC data set of Microcystis aeruginosa (n = 814) and Chlorella vulgaris (n = 834), the extreme gradient boosting model demonstrated rapid and accurate prediction of algal density (R2: 0.95–0.98), outperforming most existing models (R2: 0.38–0.99) reliant on environmental parameters. Butanal and 2-octenal were identified as biomarkers, with species-specific concentration thresholds of butanal (158.41 ppbv for Microcystis aeruginosa; 165.61 ppbv for Chlorella vulgaris) and 2-octenal (9.02  and 6.99 ppbv, respectively), below which algal density rapidly increased. Transcriptomic and enzymatic analysis revealed that metabolic reprogramming during exponential growth, characterized by enhanced photosynthesis, suppressed carbohydrate catabolism, and inhibited fatty acid degradation, collectively contributed to decreased butanal and 2-octenal production. Field validation in a natural lake preliminarily demonstrated the model’s potential for HAB monitoring (67–81% bloom risk). This work established AVOCs as dynamic indicators of algal physiology and mechanistically linked metabolic shifts to bloom dynamics, offering a transformative tool for aquatic ecosystem management."

To better understand their composition and genetic and metabolic potential, we analyzed 207 samples from the Swiss Alps and Jura Mountains. We determined how key environmental factors shaped cyanobacterial abundance, assessed whether these communities harbor genes for toxin biosynthesis, characterized their taxonomic composition at the family and genus level, and evaluated the actual occurrence of cyanotoxins and other bioactive metabolites. Cyanobacterial abundance proved to be influenced by factors such as elevation, exposure, and their interaction with siliceous rock substrata. Targeted PCR and Sanger sequencing revealed the presence of toxin-encoding genes, particularly for ndaF/mcyE fragments, which may encode microcystin and/or nodularin biosynthesis, while specific genes for microcystins, anatoxins, and cylindrospermopsins were rather rare. Metabarcoding analysis identified 11 cyanobacterial families, with Chroococcaceae, Nostocaceae, and Leptolyngbyaceae being the most abundant. Complementary high-resolution mass spectrometry confirmed the occasional presence of nodularins and microcystins, alongside more frequent detection of other bioactive peptides such as anabaenopeptins and cyanopeptolins.

Here, using zebrafish larvae with TPhP as a benchmark, we systematically evaluated the developmental and neurobehavioral toxicity of HPCTP at environmentally relevant concentrations (50–5000 ng/L) from 6 to 120 h postfertilization. HPCTP showed greater bioaccumulation potential than TPhP, suggesting the risk of long-term ecological persistence. Despite lower acute toxicity, HPCTP induced pronounced developmental defects, including reduced body length and cardiac malformations. Strikingly, HPCTP and TPhP produced divergent neurobehavioral outcomes. HPCTP caused dose-dependent depression-like behaviors (hypoactivity, light-zone avoidance) through suppression of serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) signaling, supported by decreased htr1aa expression and serotonin levels and partially rescued by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. By contrast, TPhP elicited anxiety-like phenotypes (hyperactivity, thigmotaxis) via CD83-dependent neuroinflammation, evidenced by decreased cd83 expression and microglial activation, which were reversed by cd83 overexpression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that HPCTP, though marketed as a safer alternative, poses distinct developmental and neurobehavioral hazards, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive risk evaluation prior to its widespread application."

Site investigations included soil analyses, unsaturated zone porewater sampling at two depths using porous cup suction lysimeters, and continuous moisture sensing. Measurements of PFAS concentrations in collected field porewater samples facilitated evaluation of potential PFAS impacts to underlying groundwater. The most elevated PFAS soil and porewater concentrations were typically observed in the shallow (60 cm depth) zone with substantially lower PFAS soil and porewater concentrations at 120 cm. PFBS had the highest elevated PFAS porewater average concentration (124 ng/L) in the shallow lysimeters. Average PFOS and PFOA porewater concentrations were below 5 ng/L in both the shallow (60 cm depth) and deep (120 cm depth) lysimeters. Batch desorption testing revealed that a substantial fraction of the PFAS mass was not readily desorbed from the soil (e.g., 71% for PFOS). A mass balance model based on measured desorption isotherms, along with an estimate of the average PFAS accumulation at the air–water interface (AWI), generally predicted PFAS porewater concentrations reasonably well. Model simulations showed that PFAS adsorption to the AWI and to a lesser extent the desorption-resistant fractions in soil was primarily responsible for PFAS retention in unsaturated soils."

Ashes enriched in basic compounds (e.g., CaO) lend particularly well to REEs extraction but are prone to precipitate formation that hinders upscaled implementation. This study characterizes the secondary phase precipitation that occurs during mild acid leaching and develops an approach to circumvent their formation while maintaining effective REEs recovery. Notably, precipitate characteristics vary with leachant acidity: very acidic solutions (pH < 0) condense silica gels but achieve ∼ 90 % REEs recovery, whereas mild pH values (∼ 3.5) precipitate aluminosilicate flocs and are limited to low REEs recoverability (∼ 30 to 55 %). Gel precipitates, however, alter the rheology of the leachate via their transformation to a semicondensed phase, and are problematic in upscaled operations. To minimize gel formation, we evaluate alternative extraction methods, including an acid baking (i.e., dry digestion) approach that circumvents secondary precipitates while yielding high REEs extractability of ∼ 74 % and low co-extraction of secondary elements. Together, the results here provide key insights critical to controlling acid leaching of ash feedstocks and provide alternative methods for REEs extraction that bypass gel and floc precipitation to enable effective REEs recovery from coal ash wastes."

However, the increase of 8-isoprostane was significantly less in Wild-Aged compared to that in Wild and Rx, indicating loss of oxidative potential due to photochemical aging. Based on the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the cell media, the level of lipid peroxidation, and the magnitude of gene fold-changes, Rx PM extracts were more toxic than Wild.

Using streamflow observations and paleohydrological records, we reconstructed streamflow for 45 gauge stations on major Indian rivers, spanning 1200–2012 C.E., to examine the changes and drivers of streamflow drought synchronicity. Our reconstructed streamflow record for the past ∼800 years shows that streamflow drought frequency and synchronicity have increased during the recent period (1850–2012). While past major synchronous droughts in Indian rivers were associated with El Niño and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions, the recent increase in streamflow drought synchronicity is linked with anthropogenic climate warming.

Flores is an ideal case study as it experienced multiple magmatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions during the Holocene and Pleistocene. Our results show that at a broader scale (>10 ka), magmatic volcanism prevailed during dry/colder periods, whereas phreatomagmatism preferentially occurred during wet/warm periods. At a shorter timescale (<10 ka), however, water‐magma interactions were primarily controlled by variations in eruption rates, with rainfall variability having a secondary role, as phreatomagmatism occurred even during low precipitation periods. This study reinforces that on island volcanoes with perched aquifers and prone to monogenetic volcanism, eruption rates rather than short‐term hydroclimate changes control the triggering of phreatomagmatism."

Such hybrid profiles frequently occur in the equatorial Pacific, highlighting a large‐scale pattern rather than local island mass effect. In oligotrophic regions, seasonal variations of light availability and stratification dynamics below the mixed layer likely relate SCM to an increase in carbon biomass or photoacclimation.

Results reveal that distinct processes control CH4 accumulation across regions: both lateral transport and biological production (via zooplankton) contribute to shelf CH4 dynamics, with physical transport emerging as the dominant process, while zooplankton fecal pellet production and bacterial activity govern offshore CH4 accumulation. Seasonal variability is tightly linked to primary production, stratification, and vertical mixing.

We model this time‐dependent behavior as frictional slip in response to shear stress changes imparted by the earthquake. These faults, widely distributed in the hanging wall of the main rupture, are therefore very weak and capable of slipping under small stress changes. Therefore, they should also diffuse some of the tectonic loading between large earthquakes, reducing the amount of stress that accumulates at shallow crustal depths."

We present an integrated modeling framework to investigate future streamflow and hydropower generation in the Contiguous U.S. (1990–2075), leveraging an ensemble of six downscaled and bias‐corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the high‐end SSP585 scenario of the CMIP6. To achieve this, we develop a reservoir operations and parameterization scheme for 1,384 dams in a high‐resolution river network, including simulated hydropower generation for 326 dams. For the GCM ensemble mean, we simulate a widespread increase in regulated streamflow into the late‐century (11% annual and 17% in winter for the dam median) with region‐specific changes in summer streamflow that feature prominent declines in the Northwest (−7%). Mediation by reservoirs is shown to dampen intra‐annual streamflow changes, delivering additional summer releases that partially mitigate declining flows. Total hydropower generation is projected to increase modestly (+3%), with boosted generation in the winter (+9%) and spring (+5%) offsetting declined summer generation (−3.4%), suggesting strong adaptation potential for hydropower in the future energy portfolio.

However, how urbanization differentially modulates various precipitation categories—captured by indices based on all precipitation events and those representing extremes—has received limited attention. Key uncertainties remain regarding the direction of response (intensification or moderation) and potential thresholds for urbanization‐induced precipitation shifts. We assessed the urbanization effects on precipitation across 37 urbanized regions in China from 1980 to 2022, and found the urbanization effects have intensified in most cities since 2000. Urbanization generally reduced the number of wet days but increased the frequency of extreme precipitation. Moreover, urbanization induced an increase in total precipitation, the simple precipitation intensity index, and interannual variability nationally, with precipitation primarily being altered in the cold climate zone and in medium‐sized cities. Anthropogenic drivers (e.g., urban area trend) and climatic drivers (e.g., relative humidity) predominantly govern the spatial variability in urbanization effects on all precipitation events, while climatic drivers (e.g., convective available potential energy) primarily modulate the spatial variability of urbanization effects on extreme precipitation. Notably, the urbanization effect on precipitation has intensified in recent decades (2000–2022), with more pronounced effects in arid climate zones and megacities.

However, decreases in pollution have not been uniform, potentially exacerbating inequalities in air pollution exposure by race and ethnicity. These inequalities exist, in part, because of spatial differences in source(s), for example, power plants or roadways. Determining which sources are driving inequality across racial and ethnic groups is critical to determining which policies (e.g., targeting power plant vs. vehicle emissions) would reduce inequalities. Our study determines which pollutant sources should be decreased to address inequalities in four pollutants (NOx, SO2, VOCs, and PM2.5) in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We derived emissions from eight source categories for 134 Virginia counties from the National Emissions Inventory and the MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator mobile source emissions model. We used race and ethnicity data from the American Community Survey from 2011 to 2020. We applied the Atkinson Index to obtain a single summary of inequality for each source‐pollutant pair (e.g., NOx from electricity generation) across all race and ethnic groups. Most source category emissions were unequally distributed for at least once pollutant. Compared to other sources, electricity generation resulted in the largest inequalities across pollutants. Mobile sources increased in inequality from 2011 to 2020 even as emissions decreased.

Dengue risk assessment models currently leverage climate‐dengue statistical associations, yet what remain understudied are the mechanistic pathways that yield different statistical relationships in different locations. We hypothesize that elucidating the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal variability in climate influences dengue incidence will improve dengue dynamics predictions across climatically distinct locations and beyond dengue's well‐known seasonal cycles. We test this hypothesis by investigating a key pathway in the climate‐dengue process chain: climate impacts on Aedes breeding habitats. We have implemented a mechanistic modeling pipeline that simulates climatic influence on habitat water dynamics and thereby on relative population size of the vector. We use this modeling pipeline, driven by meteorological data, to simulate monthly Aedes populations for three climatically distinct cities in Sri Lanka. We find that simulated vector abundance is plausibly associated with climate conditions and that climate drivers of vector abundance vary among locations. Moreover, tercile‐tercile comparisons of dengue incidence against model variables indicate that risk assessments based on predicted vector abundance perform similarly to those based on meteorology alone—the signal of weather variability and its relationship to dengue propagates through the modeling pipeline. These results justify future testing of this modeling pipeline within a dengue risk assessment framework, where its process‐based structure may be leveraged to guide proactive dengue control efforts in high‐risk years and to simulate impacts of future climate conditions on dengue dynamics."

Here we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching near-software accuracy for the TI-46-Word1 and Google Speech Commands2 datasets. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit3,4 layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing chip5, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With submillisecond latency, reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit-based feature extraction consuming roughly 300 nJ per inference, and the analogue in-memory computing-based classifier using around 78 µJ (with potential for roughly 10 µJ)6, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in materia computing hardware. A temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing hardware platforms—reconfigurable nonlinear-processing units (RNPUs) and analogue in-memory computing (AIMC)—is used for both feature extraction and classification, advancing compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge devices."

Cherry,Repeated head trauma causes neuron loss and inflammation in young athletes,"Repetitive head impacts from contact sports are associated with brain inflammation, vascular damage and neuron loss that are independent of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology. 
 Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) sustained from contact sports are the largest risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)1–4. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after death and the events that trigger initial hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) deposition remain unclear2. Furthermore, the symptoms endorsed by young individuals are not fully explained by the extent of p-tau deposition2, severely hampering therapeutic interventions. Here we observed a multicellular response prior to the onset of CTE p-tau pathology that correlates with number of years of RHI exposure in young people (less than 51 years of age) with RHI exposure, the majority of whom played American football. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing of tissue from 8 control individuals, 9 RHI-exposed individuals and 11 individuals with low-stage CTE, we identify SPP1-expressing inflammatory microglia, angiogenic and inflamed endothelial cells, astrocytosis and altered synaptic gene expression in those exposed to RHI. We also observe a significant loss of cortical sulcus layer 2/3 neurons independent of p-tau pathology. Finally, we identify TGFβ1 as a potential signal that mediates microglia–endothelial cell cross talk. These results provide robust evidence that multiple years of RHI is sufficient to induce lasting cellular alterations that may underlie p-tau deposition and help explain the early pathogenesis in young former contact sport athletes. Furthermore, these data identify specific cellular responses to RHI that may direct future identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CTE. Repetitive head impacts from contact sports are associated with brain inflammation, vascular damage and neuron loss that are independent of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology."

 Prime editors make programmed genome modifications by writing new sequences into extensions of nicked DNA 3′ ends1. These edited 3′ new strands must displace competing 5′ strands to install edits, yet a bias towards retaining the competing 5′ strands hinders efficiency and can cause indel errors2. Here we discover that nicked end degradation, consistent with competing 5′ strand destabilization, can be promoted by Cas9-nickase mutations that relax nick positioning. We exploit this mechanism to engineer efficient prime editors with strikingly low indel errors. Combining this error-suppressing strategy with the latest efficiency-boosting architecture, we design a next-generation prime editor (vPE). Compared with previous editors, vPE features comparable efficiency yet up to 60-fold lower indel errors, enabling edit:indel ratios as high as 543:1.

 Owing to increasing demand for low-cost energy storage with secure material supply chains, the battery community is approaching a pivotal shift beyond conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) towards next-generation cells. Technologies that include alkali-metal anodes, solid electrolytes and earth-abundant materials such as sodium (Na) and sulfur (S) are reaching commercialization in cells. The abuse tolerance and thermal runaway hazards of such technologies diverge from conventional Li-ion cells. Consequently, designing safe batteries with next-generation materials requires a holistic approach to characterize cells and to understand their responses to abuse conditions from the beginning to the end of life. Here we provide a Perspective on how the safety and abuse tolerance of cells are likely to change for up-and-coming technologies; challenges and opportunities for reimagining safe cell and battery designs; gaps in our knowledge; capabilities for understanding the hazards of thermal runaway and how to address them; how standard abuse tests may need to adapt to new challenges; and how research needs to support affected professionals, from pack designers to first responders, to manage hazards and ensure safe roll-out of next-generation cells into applications like electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, given the large number of next-generation technologies being explored, we encourage giving priority to safety-focused research in proportion to the rate of manufacturing scale-up of each specific technology.

 Hole-selective self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)1,2 have played a key role in driving the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells3–5 to 26.7% (ref. 6). However, their instability often compromises the operational performance of devices, strongly hindering their practical applications7,8. Here we employ a cross-linkable co-SAM to enhance the conformational stability of hole-selective SAMs against external stresses, while suppressing the formation of defects and voids in SAM during self-assembly. The azide-containing SAM can be thermally activated to form a cross-linked and densely assembled co-SAM with a thermally stable conformation and preferred orientation. This effectively minimizes substrate surface exposure caused by wiggling of loose SAMs under thermal stress, preventing perovskite decomposition. This enables a certified PCE of 26.92% to be achieved for the best-performing cell, which also possesses excellent thermal stability with negligible decay under maximum-power-point tracking at 85 °C for 1,000 h. It also retains >98% of initial PCE after 700 repetitive thermal cycles between −40 °C and 85 °C, representing the state of the art of the field. This work offers an in-depth understanding of SAM degradation mechanisms to guide the design of a more robust buried interface for SAM-based devices adopting high-roughness substrates to realize highly efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.

 Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics1,2. However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated by autonomous dynamics, with the flow direction (that is, neural mode) largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that this transition marks the moment of decision commitment, that is, the time when the animal makes up its mind. To test this, we developed a simplified model of the dynamics to estimate a putative neurally inferred time of commitment (nTc) for each trial. This model captures diverse single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3,4. The estimated nTc values were not time locked to stimulus or response timing but instead varied broadly across trials. If nTc marks commitment, evidence before this point should affect the decision, whereas evidence afterwards should not. Behavioural analysis aligned to nTc confirmed this prediction. Our findings show that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode and suggest that nTc offers a useful neural marker for studying rapid changes in internal brain state. Simultaneous recordings were made of hundreds of neurons in the rat frontal cortex and striatum, showing that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode."

 Long-term implantable bioelectronics offer a powerful means to evaluate the function of the nervous system and serve as effective human–machine interfaces1–3. Here, inspired by earthworms, we introduce NeuroWorm—a soft, stretchable and movable fibre sensor designed for bioelectronic interface. Our approach involves rolling to transform 2D bioelectronic devices into 1D NeuroWorm, creating a multifunctional microfibre that houses longitudinally distributed electrode arrays for both bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring. NeuroWorm effectively records high-quality spatio-temporal signals in situ while steerably advancing within the brain or on the muscle as needed. This allows for the dynamic targeting and shifting of desired monitoring sites. Implanted in muscle through a tiny incision, NeuroWorm provides stable bioelectrical monitoring in rats for more than 43 weeks. Even after 54 weeks of implantation in muscle, fibroblast encapsulation around the fibre remains negligible. Our NeuroWorm represents a platform that promotes a substantial advance in bioelectronics—from an immobile probe fixed in place to active, intelligent and living devices for long-term, minimally invasive and mobile evaluation of the nervous system.

 Directly visualizing vibrational anisotropy in individual phonon modes is essential for understanding a wide range of intriguing optical, thermal and elastic phenomena in materials1–5. Although conventional optical and diffraction techniques have been used to estimate vibrational anisotropies, they fall short in achieving the spatial and energy resolution necessary to provide detailed information4–7. Here, we introduce a new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution. Vibrational anisotropies manifest in different norms of orthogonal atomic displacements, known as thermal ellipsoids. Using the centrosymmetric strontium titanate as a model system, we observed two distinct types of oxygen vibrations with contrasting anisotropies: oblate thermal ellipsoids below 60 meV and prolate ones above 60 meV. In non-centrosymmetric barium titanate, our approach can detect subtle distortions of the oxygen octahedra by observing the unexpected modulation of q-selective signals between apical and equatorial oxygen sites near 55 meV, which originates from reduced crystal symmetry and may also be linked to ferroelectric polarization. These observations are quantitatively supported by theoretical modelling, which demonstrates the reliability of our approach. The measured frequency-dependent vibrational anisotropies shed new light on the dielectric and thermal behaviours governed by acoustic and optical phonons. The ability to visualize phonon eigenvectors at specific crystallographic sites with unprecedented spatial and energy resolution opens new avenues for exploring dielectric, optical, thermal and superconducting properties.

 Accretion disks in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars)1–4 and supermassive black holes5. Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems in which radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disk (L ≳ LEdd). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies6. Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual (L ≳ LEdd). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disk than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disk. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast (v ~ 0.3c) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at a similarly high Eddington ratio7. The XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines."

 The regulation of metabolic processes by proteins is fundamental to biology and yet is incompletely understood. Here we develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach that leverages genetic diversity to nominate functional relationships between 285 metabolites and 11,868 proteins in living tissues. This method recapitulates protein–metabolite functional relationships mediated by direct physical interactions and local metabolic pathway regulation while nominating 3,542 previously undescribed relationships. With this foundation, we identify a mechanism of regulation over liver cysteine utilization and cholesterol handling, regulated by the poorly characterized protein LRRC58. We show that LRRC58 is the substrate adaptor of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates proteasomal degradation of CDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the catabolic shunt of cysteine to taurine1. Cysteine abundance regulates LRRC58-mediated CDO1 degradation, and depletion of LRRC58 is sufficient to stabilize CDO1 to drive consumption of cysteine to produce taurine. Taurine has a central role in cholesterol handling, promoting its excretion from the liver2, and we show that depletion of LRRC58 in hepatocytes increases cysteine flux to taurine and lowers hepatic cholesterol in mice. Uncovering the mechanism of LRRC58 control over cysteine catabolism exemplifies the utility of covariation MS to identify modes of protein regulation of metabolic processes. A mass spectrometry-based approach globally identifies protein regulators of metabolism and reveals the role of LRRC58 in controlling cysteine catabolism."

 Controlling arms and legs requires feedback from the proprioceptive sensory neurons that detect joint position and movement1,2. Proprioceptive feedback must be tuned for different behavioural contexts3–6, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across a range of behaviours, whereas the axons of movement-encoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics7–9, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons receive input from parallel excitatory and inhibitory descending pathways that are positioned to drive the interneurons in a context-specific and leg-specific manner. Calcium imaging from both the interneurons and their descending inputs confirms that their activity is correlated with self-generated but not passive leg movements. Taken together, our findings reveal a neural circuit that suppresses specific proprioceptive feedback signals during self-generated movements.

 Neutrophils, the most abundant and biotoxic immune cells, extrude nuclear DNA into the extracellular space to maintain homeostasis. Termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), these protein-modified and decondensed extracellular DNA scaffolds control infection and are involved in coagulation, autoimmunity and cancer1,2. Here we show how myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly expressed neutrophil protein, disassembles nucleosomes, thereby facilitating NET formation, yet also binds stably to NETs extracellularly. We describe how the oligomeric status of MPO governs both outcomes. MPO dimers interact with nucleosomal DNA using one protomer and concurrently dock into the nucleosome acidic patch with the other protomer. As a consequence, dimeric MPO displaces DNA from the core complex, culminating in nucleosome disassembly. On the other hand, MPO monomers stably interact with the nucleosome acidic patch without making concomitant DNA contacts, explaining how monomeric MPO binds to and licences NETs to confer hypohalous acid production in the extracellular space3. Our data demonstrate that the binding of MPO to chromatin is governed by specific molecular interactions that transform chromatin into a non-replicative, non-encoding state that offers new biological functions in a cell-free manner. We propose that MPO is, to our knowledge, the first member of a class of proteins that convert chromatin into an immune effector.

 There is an increasing demand for multimodal sensing and stimulation bioelectronic fibres for both research and clinical applications1,2. However, existing fibres suffer from high rigidity, low component layout precision, limited functionality and low density of active components. These limitations arise from the challenge of integrating many components into one-dimensional fibre devices, especially owing to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (for example, photolithography) with curved, thin and long fibre structures2. As a result, limited applications have been demonstrated so far. Here we use ‘spiral transformation’ to convert two-dimensional thin films containing microfabricated devices into one-dimensional soft fibres. This approach allows for the fabrication of high-density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibres, termed Spiral-NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control on the longitudinal, angular and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. Taking advantage of the biocompatibility of our soft fibres with the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal system, we proceed to show the feasibility of our S-NeuroString for post-operative multimodal continuous motility mapping and tissue stimulation in awake pigs. We further demonstrate multi-channel single-unit electrical recording in mouse brain for up to 4 months, and a fabrication capability to produce 1,280 channels within a 230-μm-diameter soft fibre. Our soft bioelectronic fibres offer a powerful platform for minimally invasive implantable electronics, where diverse sensing and stimulation functionalities can be effectively integrated.

 Coral reefs form complex physical structures that can help to mitigate coastal flooding risk1,2. This function will be reduced by sea-level rise (SLR) and impaired reef growth caused by climate change and local anthropogenic stressors3. Water depths above reef surfaces are projected to increase as a result, but the magnitudes and timescales of this increase are poorly constrained, which limits modelling of coastal vulnerability4,5. Here we analyse fossil reef deposits to constrain links between reef ecology and growth potential across more than 400 tropical western Atlantic sites, and assess the magnitudes of resultant above-reef increases in water depth through to 2100 under various shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios. Our analysis predicts that more than 70% of tropical western Atlantic reefs will transition into net erosional states by 2040, but that if warming exceeds 2 °C (SSP2–4.5 and higher), nearly all reefs (at least 99%) will be eroding by 2100. The divergent trajectories of reef growth and SLR will thus magnify the effects of SLR; increases in water depth of around 0.3–0.5 m above the present are projected under all warming scenarios by 2060, but depth increases of 0.7–1.2 m are predicted by 2100 under scenarios in which warming surpasses 2 °C. This would increase the risk of flooding along vulnerable reef-fronted coasts and modify nearshore hydrodynamics and ecosystems. Reef restoration offers one pathway back to higher reef growth6,7, but would dampen the effects of SLR in 2100 only by around 0.3–0.4 m, and only when combined with aggressive climate mitigation.

 General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs)1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting3, have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. A new artificial intelligence model, DeepSeek-R1, is introduced, demonstrating that the reasoning abilities of large language models can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning, removing the need for human-annotated demonstrations."

 The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates growth factor (GF) and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic processes connected to cell growth and inhibit catabolic processes such as autophagy1,2. GF signalling through the tuberous sclerosis complex regulates the lysosomally localized small GTPase RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB)3. Direct binding of RHEB–GTP to the mTOR kinase subunit of mTORC1 allosterically activates the kinase by inducing a large-scale conformational change4. Here we reconstituted mTORC1 activation on membranes by RHEB, RAGs and Ragulator. Cryo-electron microscopy showed that RAPTOR and mTOR interact directly with the membrane. Full engagement of the membrane anchors is required for optimal alignment of the catalytic residues in the mTOR kinase active site. Converging signals from GFs and nutrients drive mTORC1 recruitment to and activation on lysosomal membrane in a four-step process, consisting of (1) RAG–Ragulator-driven recruitment to within ~100 Å of the lysosomal membrane; (2) RHEB-driven recruitment to within ~40 Å; (3) RAPTOR–membrane engagement and intermediate enzyme activation; and (4) mTOR–membrane engagement and full enzyme activation. RHEB and membrane engagement combined leads to full catalytic activation and structurally explains GF and nutrient signal integration at the lysosome.

 Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines1, it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour2. This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems3,4. Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models5. Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them. People cheat more when they delegate tasks to artificial intelligence, and large language models are more likely than humans to comply with unethical instructions—a risk that can be minimized by introducing prohibitive, task-specific guardrails."

 Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients’ past and current health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course1–3. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records4,5. However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods7 provide insights into Delphi-2M’s predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.

 The fin-to-limb transition in vertebrate evolution has been central to the study of how development underlies evolutionary change. In this context, the functional analysis of Hox gene regulation to infer evolutionary trajectories has been critical to explain the origin of new features. In tetrapods, the transcription of Hoxd genes in developing digits depends on a set of enhancers forming a large regulatory landscape1,2. The presence of a syntenic counterpart in zebrafish, which lacks digits, suggests deep homology3 or shared developmental foundations underlying distal fin and limbs. However, how this regulatory program evolved has remained unresolved. We genetically evaluated the function of the zebrafish Hoxd regulatory landscapes by comparatively assessing the effects of their full deletions. We show that, unlike in mice, deletion of these regions in fish does not disrupt hoxd gene transcription during distal fin development. By contrast, we found that this deficiency leads to the loss of expression within the cloaca, a structure related by ancestry to the mammalian urogenital sinus, and that distal hox13 genes are essential for correct cloacal formation. Because Hoxd gene regulation in the mouse urogenital sinus relies on enhancers located in this same chromatin domain that controls digit development, we propose that the current regulatory landscape active in distal limbs was co-opted as a whole in tetrapods from a pre-existing cloacal regulatory machinery. The regulatory landscape controlling Hoxd gene expression in tetrapod digit development was probably co-opted from a pre-existing cloacal regulatory mechanism, as evidenced by the effects of genetic deletion experiments in zebrafish fin, cloaca and mouse urogenital development."

 Brown and beige adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein that dissociates respiration from ATP synthesis and promotes heat production and energy expenditure. However, UCP1−/− mice are not obese1–5, consistent with the existence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis6–8. Here we describe a UCP1-independent mechanism of thermogenesis involving ATP-consuming metabolism of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) in peroxisomes. These fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid synthase using precursors derived from catabolism of branched-chain amino acids9 and our results indicate that β-oxidation of mmBCFAs is mediated by the peroxisomal protein acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Notably, cold exposure upregulated proteins involved in both biosynthesis and β-oxidation of mmBCFA in thermogenic fat. Acute thermogenic stimuli promoted translocation of fatty acid synthase to peroxisomes. Brown-adipose-tissue-specific fatty acid synthase knockout decreased cold tolerance. Adipose-specific ACOX2 knockout also impaired cold tolerance and promoted diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Conversely, ACOX2 overexpression in adipose tissue enhanced thermogenesis independently of UCP1 and improved metabolic homeostasis. Using a peroxisome-localized temperature sensor named Pexo-TEMP, we found that ACOX2-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation raised intracellular temperature in brown adipocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized role for peroxisomes in adipose tissue thermogenesis characterized by an mmBCFA synthesis and catabolism cycle.

 The dome-headed pachycephalosaurians are among the most enigmatic dinosaurs. Bearing a hypertrophied skull roof and elaborate cranial ornamentation, members of the clade are considered to have evolved complex sociosexual systems1–3. Despite their importance in understanding behavioural ecology in Dinosauria, the absence of uncontested early diverging taxa has hindered our ability to reconstruct the origin and early evolution of the clade4–7. Here we describe Zavacephale rinpoche gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower Cretaceous Khuren Dukh Formation of Mongolia, the most skeletally complete and geologically oldest pachycephalosaurian discovered globally. Z. rinpoche exhibits a well-developed frontoparietal dome and preserves the clade’s first record of manual elements and gastroliths. Phylogenetic analysis recovered Z. rinpoche as one of the earliest diverging pachycephalosaurians, pushing back fossil evidence of the frontoparietal dome by at least 14 Myr and clarifying macroevolutionary trends in its assembly. We found that the earliest stage of dome evolution occurred by means of a frontal-first developmental pattern with retention of open supratemporal fenestra, mirroring proposed ontogenetic trajectories in some Late Cretaceous taxa. Finally, intraskeletal osteohistology of the frontoparietal dome and hindlimb demonstrate decoupling of sociosexual and somatic maturity in early pachycephalosaurians, with advanced dome development preceding terminal body size.

 Aerosols substantially influence the climate by modifying Earth’s radiative balance and marine biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate quantification of aerosol deposition onto ocean surfaces remains challenging due to the limited direct observations over oceanic regions. Here, to address this observational gap, we use the cosmogenic radionuclide beryllium-7, measured simultaneously in the atmosphere and seawater. Beryllium-7 is naturally produced in the atmosphere and rapidly attaches to submicrometre aerosol particles before being deposited onto the ocean surface through wet and dry processes, making it a direct tracer for quantifying aerosol deposition. We combine previous measurements from cruises in the North Pacific, equatorial Pacific, North Atlantic and Arctic oceans with measurements from the South Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans to derive a revised aerosol deposition parameterization across the global ocean. Compared with the parameterizations used in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we find that aerosol deposition rates over the global ocean have been underestimated by 39 ± 23%, consequently overestimating aerosol lifetimes over the oceans by an average of 69 ± 92%. Our observationally constrained results suggest that aerosol processes are more dynamic than previously estimated, with important implications for our understanding of aerosol-driven climate effects and marine biogeochemical processes globally.

Here, the authors develop a transcriptomic and epigenetic map of indisulam (RBM39 degrader) resistant neuroblastoma, demonstrating bidirectional cell state switching accompanied by increased NK cell activity, which they therapeutically enhance by the addition of an anti-GD2 antibody. 
 The cellular plasticity of neuroblastoma is defined by a mixture of two major cell states, adrenergic and mesenchymal, which may contribute to therapy resistance. However, how neuroblastoma cells switch cellular states during therapy remains largely unknown, and how to eradicate neuroblastoma regardless of its cell state is a clinical challenge. To better understand the cellular plasticity of neuroblastoma in chemoresistance, we define the transcriptomic and epigenetic map of adrenergic and mesenchymal types of neuroblastomas using human and murine models treated with indisulam, a selective RBM39 degrader. We show that cancer cells not only undergo a bidirectional switch between adrenergic and mesenchymal states, but also acquire additional cellular states, reminiscent of the developmental pliancy of neural crest cells. These cell state alterations are coupled with epigenetic reprogramming and dependency switching of cell state–specific transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and targetable kinases. Through targeting RNA splicing, indisulam induces an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and enhances the anticancer activity of natural killer cells. The combination of indisulam with anti-GD2 immunotherapy results in a durable, complete response in high-risk transgenic neuroblastoma models, providing an innovative, rational therapeutic approach to eradicate tumor cells regardless of their potential to switch cell states. Cell state plasticity of neuroblastoma cells is linked to therapy resistance.

 Battery development pivots around understanding the complex processes governing battery operation and degradation. Most degradation pathways link structural and chemical inhomogeneities with strongly heterogeneous carrier transport at the nano- and microscale, which remains challenging to resolve with current operando imaging techniques. Here, we provide a data-driven perspective on using operando magnetic microscopy to examine the charge and discharge cycles in lithium and post-lithium batteries. Through quantitatively imaging ionic and electronic current distributions and probing the associated chemical reactions at the nanoscale, valuable insights into battery inhomogeneities and degradations can be gained. The approach facilitates spatially resolving heterogeneous redox reactions, buried current distributions, and mechanistic contributions to short-circuit endurance in batteries.

 Southern Ocean biogeochemistry impacts global nutrient distributions, carbon cycling, and climate, motivating study of its underlying controls across different climate states. Today, poorly-ventilated North Pacific waters supply the majority of carbon and nutrients upwelling in the Southern Ocean, outpacing biological carbon uptake and fueling CO2 outgassing. Reducing this supply is both central to glacial CO2 theories involving reduced outgassing and well-supported by paleo-proxy reconstructions. While past studies emphasize physical processes (reduced upwelling, enhanced stratification), we propose a complementary mechanism where the carbon/nutrient load of waters feeding the Southern Ocean surface is reduced remotely, prior to being upwelled. Comparing glacial North Pacific and Southern Ocean proxy records, alongside Earth System Model simulations, we show that ventilating the glacial North Pacific reduces the carbon/nutrient content of waters supplying the Southern Ocean surface and Subantarctic CO2 outgassing. This highlights an interhemispheric influence on Southern Ocean biogeochemical conditions that could modulate glacial-interglacial CO2 variability. A better-ventilated North Pacific could have reduced the carbon of water upwelled in the Southern Ocean, reducing outgassing and revealing a remote influence on Southern Ocean biogeochemistry in glacial times."

 Numerous studies have shown that viruses are present in a variety of environments on Earth, acting as drivers of biogeochemical cycles and powerful selective forces. Among them, giant viruses of amoebae have garnered attention from the scientific community due to their large particles and extensive genomes. Here, we describe the discovery of one of the largest tailed viruses in the known virosphere (averaging 1350 nm), named Naiavirus. This virus, isolated from a swamp biome in Brazil, has particles with a never-before-seen morphology and composition, and represents the first giant amoeba virus with an external envelope covering the capsid and extending over a flexible tail region.

Here the authors identify sperm expressed GALNTL5 as a GalNAc binding factor required for migration though the UTJ and attachment to the ZP. 
 More than 20 genes expressed in the male reproductive tract have been identified as essential factors for sperm migration to and through the utero-tubal junction (UTJ), and they are divided into ADAM3-dependent and ADAM3-independent pathways. In parallel, sperm having UTJ migration defects also show impaired binding to the zona pellucida (ZP). Herein, we demonstrate that knockout of Galntl5, encoding a sperm surface protein, causes impaired sperm binding with the UTJ and ZP, and null males have severe infertility. GALNTL5 appreciably disappears in sperm lacking Adam3 or Lypd4, required for ADAM3-dependent and ADAM3-independent pathways, and GALNTL5 binds to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) distributed on the UTJ and ZP. Blockage of GalNAc decreases the number of sperm binding to the UTJ and ZP. Thus, we unveil that GALNTL5 is a responsible factor for UTJ migration and sperm-ZP binding, and that sperm bind to the UTJ and ZP through interaction of GALNTL5 and GalNAc.

 Sewage sludge, an unavoidable by-product of biological sewage treatment processes, is a growing environmental burden. If handled properly, it can also be a crucial secondary resource, as it contains many functional microbiomes and useful nutrients. Here we propose an in situ nitrate-driven oxidation approach to upcycle sewage sludge into valuable (>US$4,000 m−3) anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) seeds, which are a key ingredient to achieve a fast start-up of the anammox process—a low-carbon nitrogen removal process—in biological sewage treatment facilities. The approach can effectively upcycle sewage sludge rich in endogenous reductants, such as organics and sulfur-based compounds, but poor in oxidative substances. Specifically, this approach employs nitrate-containing wastewater as an oxidant source and utilizes nitrate to oxidize reductants in sewage sludge to provide nitrite for anammox bacterial growth. This approach can initiate anammox seeds within 45 days and form anammox seeds with biomarkers within 90 days. This work reveals the potential of sewage sludge as a source of functional microbiomes and opens a new avenue to sustainable sewage management.

 Blooming effect, a phenomenon that actual lit areas appear enlarged in nighttime light images acquired by satellites, has been widely studied in remote sensing community. However, the physical mechanisms behind its formation have not been quantitatively explored. In this study, we first reported a new and interesting phenomenon that the blooming effect exhibits an east-west elliptical shape at point light sources in VIIRS nighttime light images. Based on this observation we hypothesize that the blooming shape is influenced by the observation geometry (i.e., viewing zenith angle (VZA)) and atmospheric scattering. To test this hypothesis, the physical mechanism behind the formation of the blooming shape through numerical simulations using the Method of Successive Orders of Scattering (MSOS) model was revealed. More than 1000 numerical simulations were conducted using MSOS model under various aerosol conditions, observation geometries, and wavelengths, revealing a positive correlation between the eccentricity of the blooming shape and VZA, with R2 values exceeding 0.9. To validate these findings with satellite observations, we analyzed VNP46A1 data of Black Marble product from 10 gas flaring regions worldwide. The results reconfirmed the positive correlation between the eccentricity of the blooming shape and VZA across all the selected regions, with R2 values exceeding 0.5.

 Timely and reliable building damage assessment is essential for effective disaster response and humanitarian assistance. However, the diversity of disaster types, geographic regions, and data distributions poses significant challenges to transferring building damage assessment models to new disaster scenarios (i.e., target domains). In addition, limited availability of post-disaster training imagery in target domains further hinders progress. Recent approaches, such as single-temporal change adaptation, enable adaptation using only target pre-disaster images by constructing pseudo bitemporal damage samples at an unexplainable embedding level. While effective, these methods produce representations that are difficult for human experts to interpret, inspect for errors, or adjust categorical distributions to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we propose Neural Disaster Simulation (NeDS), a deep disaster generative model that synthesizes realistic post-disaster image from pre-event image and customizable disaster information (i.e., disaster types and disaster intensity). Thanks to damage data generation based solely on pre-event imagery, NeDS enables adaptation at any time, effectively bypassing the limitation of post-disaster training image availability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling disaster effects at the image level, NeDS mitigates distribution shifts between historical training data and unseen disaster events, enhancing both model transferability and visual interpretability. Extensive experiments conducted on both global-scale and local-scale study areas demonstrate that NeDS adaptation outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving a 4.3% improvement in average performance on a global dataset, as well as 3.6%, 7.9%, and 18.5% gains in damage classification performance for the 2025 Eaton fire, the 2025 Palisades fire in Los Angeles, and the 2025 Nigeria flooding, respectively."

 Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide, and given its potential threats to health and the environment, it is necessary to monitor its actual use. Currently there is no publicly available remote sensing method for detecting glyphosate use on a large scale. This study developed two glyphosate detection methods based on Sentinel-2 data and compared them in a case study over the entire Netherlands. The NDVI-method detects glyphosate use based on parcel-level NDVI variation, employing multiple constraints. The Color-method detects glyphosate use by analyzing parcel-level changes in spectral values, combining a random forest classifier with multi-temporal constraints. Training and validation data consisted of citizen-science observations from waarneming.nl platform and random parcels, both manually validated. Validation showed that the NDVI-method achieved median precision 0.51 and recall 0.52, and was more sensitive to phenomena gradually reducing NDVI in actual detection (e.g., multiple shallow tillage). The Color-method demonstrated better overall performance, with median precision 0.84 and recall 0.77. The areas of glyphosate use detected by the two methods were 52,682 and 38,923 ha, respectively.

 Coastal aquaculture ponds (CAPs) play a key role in ensuring global food security. However, their rapid expansion and seasonal drainage have triggered severe offshore water quality deterioration, posing substantial challenges to coastal sustainability in China. Therefore, accurately characterizing CAPs drainage dynamics and analyzing their impacts on offshore water quality are practically significant. In this study, we conducted the first national-scale assessment of CAPs drainage dynamics from 2017 to 2022 by utilizing time-series Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery combined with Sentinel-1 SAR data. We further quantitatively assessed the impacts of CAPs distribution and drainage periods on offshore water quality characterized by six parameters.

Interannual analysis of drainage patterns (2017–2022) exhibited significant delays, with an average of 12 and 29 days at the start and end of drainage periods, respectively. These temporal shifts were accompanied by a 19-day mean increase in drainage duration. Moreover, regions with degraded offshore water quality exhibited a high density of CAPs distribution. CAPs area and Chlorophyll-a concentration exhibited a significant positive correlation, which gradually increased as offshore distance decreased. Moreover, offshore water quality parameters exhibited notable peaks during the drainage periods, with the peak timing synchronized with interannual drainage dynamics, while water quality showed minimal fluctuations near the non-drained aquaculture ponds.

 Understanding the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from chemical reactions requires detailed knowledge of reaction products and their formation pathways. In this study, we investigated the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of chlorine-initiated trans-2-pentenal (T2P) reactions, including the decomposition of key intermediates and complexes, using the M06-2X/6-311+G(2df,2p) and CBS-QB3 computational methods. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were computed at the M06-2X level of theory, enabling the prediction of thermochemical properties for T2P, chlorine atoms, and the reaction products. For selected pathways, rate constants were determined over a temperature range of 300–3000 K at atmospheric pressure using conventional transition-state theory (CTST) and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory. At room temperature, the P2, P3, and P6 adducts emerged as the dominant kinetic products, with calculated rate constants aligning well with experimental data. At room temperature (300 K), the main kinetic products identified were P2 (CH3CH2CH(Cl)CHCHO), P3 (CH3CHCHCHCHO + HCl), and P6 (CH2CH2CHCHCHO + HCl). The calculated rate constants for these products were 2.91 × 10−10, 1.71 × 10−10, and 2.78 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for P2, P3, and P6, respectively, which agree well with experimental observations. Dynamic modeling showed that these adducts contribute significantly to SOA formation, with particle growth up to 50 μg m−3 within 1 h at 300 K. Additionally, volatility trends of the products were analyzed to understand their atmospheric persistence and contribution to aerosol mass. Finally, leveraging insights from dynamic studies, we examined SOA formation from the relevant adducts, observing growth within 1 h at 300 K.

Using EEM-PARAFAC, 2D-FTIR-COS, and hetero-2DCOS, under environmentally relevant pH conditions (pH = 6.5), this study systematically investigates complexation mechanisms of six metals (Cu(II), Hg(II), Pb(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), Zn(II)) with HULIS extracted from cloud water. EEM-PARAFAC resolves HULIS into three fluorescent fractions: low-oxygen (C1), high-oxygen (C2), and protein-like (C3). Fe(III) exhibits the strongest binding (logK ≈ 4.89–5.01), preferentially quenching C3, while Pb(II)/Hg(II) interact with C1 and Cu(II) with C2. Mn(II)/Zn(II) enhance fluorescence via alternative mechanisms. 2D-FTIR-COS reveals Fe(III)/Pb(II) target carboxyl/carbonyl groups, Cu(II)/Hg(II) aromatic moieties, and Zn(II) hydroxyl/polysaccharide functionalities.

 The present study performed classification global aerosols based on particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR) and single scattering albedo (SSA) provided from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Version 3.0 and Level 2.0 inversion products of 171 AERONET sites located in six continents. Current methodology could distinguish effectively between dust and non-dust aerosols using PLDR and SSA. These selected sites include dominant aerosol types such as, pure dust (PD), dust dominated mixture (DDM), pollution dominated mixture (PDM), very weakly absorbing (VWA), strongly absorbing (SA), moderately absorbing(MA), and weakly absorbing (WA). Biomass-burning aerosols which are associated with black carbon are assigned as combinations of WA, MA and SA. The key important findings show the sites in the Northern African region are predominantly influenced by PD, while south Asian sites are characterized by DDM as well as mixture of dust and pollution aerosols. Urban and industrialized regions located in Europe and North American sites are characterized by VWA, WA, and MA aerosols. Tropical regions, including South America, South-east-Asia and southern African sites which prone to forest and biomass-burning, are dominated by SA aerosols. The study further examined the impacts by radiative forcing for different aerosol types. Among the aerosol types, SA and VWA contribute with the highest (30.14 ± 8.04 Wm−2) and lowest (7.83 ± 4.12 Wm−2) atmospheric forcing, respectively. Consequently, atmospheric heating rates are found to be highest by SA (0.85 K day−1) and lowest by VWA aerosols (0.22 Kday−1). The current study provides a comprehensive report on aerosol optical, micro-physical and radiative properties for different aerosol types across six continents."

 Accurately capturing drought change is particularly important in the face of climate change, especially given the need to understand the influence of temperature changes on drought under different climatic conditions. In this study, we compared two drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based only on precipitation and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) based on precipitation and temperature, across global arid and humid regions for the period from 1991 to 2020. Through multi-scale analysis of gridded climate data spanning 1- to 24-month timescales, we systematically investigated how temperature influences drought characterization across arid and humid regions. Key findings reveal fundamental divergences in drought detection: while SPI and SPEI show strong agreement in humid regions (R2 > 0.80), their correlation declines sharply along the aridity gradient, reaching complete divergence (Δ = −100 %) in hyper-arid zones. The SPEI identifies 22–35 % more drought events than the SPI in arid/semi-arid regions, with differences magnifying at longer timescales (24-month, r = 0.58). Moreover, trend analysis demonstrates that SPEI-detected drought intensification occurs twice as rapidly as SPI trends in critical agricultural zones (−0.14 vs. −0.07), implicating rising temperatures in accelerated aridification. Notably, most semi-arid regions show significantly stronger drying trends in the SPEI, highlighting the index's enhanced sensitivity to climate change impacts. These results challenge the use of precipitation-only indices in water-limited ecosystems, demonstrating that SPI underestimates drought frequency by 18–27 % and severity by 1.2–2.3 standardized units in drylands. Our study highlights the critical need of weighting temperature effects according to regional climatic conditions, with immediate implications for early warning systems in a changing climate."

 Atmospheric Wind Profile (AWP) retrieval is essential for applications in meteorology, aerospace, and renewable energy. This study introduces MWR-WINet, a novel framework for passive AWP retrieval using ground-based Microwave Radiometer (MWR) data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply passive MWR observations for wind profile estimation. The proposed approach incorporates a multi-district observation network to enhance spatial representation and introduces a composite loss function that combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) with Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) to improve model performance. Applied to three districts in Xi'an—Weiyang, Chang'an, and Lintong—the model achieves retrieval errors of 1.63, 1.70, and 1.87 m/s, respectively. A joint three-district model further reduces the error to 1.27 m/s and enhances wind direction accuracy by 19.56 %, with a correlation gain of 0.08. These results demonstrate that a networked observational strategy significantly improves retrieval accuracy.

After footshock and fear extinction, these mutants chronically develop occluded neuronal activation in the basal amygdala (BA) detectable at remote fear memory retrieval, which involves suppressed spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.

Here, we synthesized the response of growing season carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to experimentally manipulated warming of ~2°C for permafrost in alpine and Arctic regions. Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO2sink weakened but the CH4sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO2sink and CH4source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N2O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost. Although keeping additional warming below 2°C in permafrost regions can avoid the positive permafrost-climate feedback, measures are needed to maintain fragile carbon sink of alpine permafrost ecosystems."

Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming.

The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases."

However, the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics of Br-rich species lead to reduced grain sizes and high defect densities in WBG perovskite films.

The TFBZ demonstrates superior passivation capability compared to benzamide, effectively mitigating both iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb2+defects via fluorine-enhanced interactions. In addition, the fluorine substituents in TFBZ could form N–H···F hydrogen bonds with formamidinium iodide to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite.

However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes (HoipA-KO) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD inHoipA-KOobese mice.

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides inPhtheirospermum japonicumas endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression ofPjYUC3, a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism."

However, exploration of tunable nonlinearity of ion transport is formidable due to the challenge in fabrication of nanochannel devices of exquisite nanoconfined architectures. Here, we report a hierarchical metal-organic framework (MOF)–based nanofluidic device of multiscale heterogeneous channel junctions to achieve unprecedented triode-like nonlinear proton transport, in contrast with diode-like rectifying transport for metal ions. Through experiments and theoretical simulations, we unveil the underlying mechanism for this unique nonlinear proton transport property, i.e., the gating effect from the built-in electric potential across the MOF phase junctions enabled by voltage bias above a threshold. As a proof-of-concept application demonstration, the nanofluidic device exhibits an ionic memory property as a nanofluidic memristor.

GM1 supplementation restores EV secretion in Huntington’s disease (HD) fibroblasts and cell models with ganglioside deficiency, including models of neurodegenerative diseases caused by a genetic block of ganglioside synthesis. Notably, GM1 enhances EV-mediated secretion of pathogenic misfolded proteins, including mutant huntingtin (mHTT), α-synuclein, and tau, reducing intracellular burden and providing mechanistic insight into the mHTT-lowering effects of GM1 in HD models.

Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions.

A substantial challenge in neuroscience is identifying specific neural signals corresponding to each sound and analyzing them separately. Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time.

Consequently, the ultrathin hydrogel electrode exhibits high biocompatibility, superior wear comfort, and minimized motion and sweat artifacts, enabling reliable, uninterrupted, wireless health monitoring over eight consecutive days across various real-life activities and adaptation to cold environments."

Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm."

Despite its extensive importance in both nonlinear physics and innovative technologies, their dynamics in laboratory experiments is restricted to a nearly static regime governed by fixed device and system structures. Here, we explore multistable and dynamically tunable synchronization using Floquet engineering technique. Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us to not only explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic phase-space trajectory, which has a nontrivial winding number and giant nonreciprocity. This optomechanical Floquet engineering opens up the study of unexplored dynamics in complicated oscillator networks such as biological systems and innovative technology by mimicking their highly efficient information processing."

However, current hologram configurations are based on space-only modulation and can merely record the amplitude and phase information of object lights. Here, we advance the holography concept by transitioning it from a space-only, homodyne, and single-tone approach to a spatiotemporal, heterodyne, and multifrequency methodology. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a space-time holographic metasurface antenna (HMA) capable of encoding and reconstructing the full amplitude, phase, and frequency contents of object waves. We demonstrate the HMA for frequency conversion and holographic beamforming in the far field, as well as multifrequency two-dimensional (2D) and 3D holographic imaging in the near field. The proposed integrative and multifunctional space-time HMA goes beyond the existing holography technology, with the potential to enable a plethora of applications such as augmented/virtual reality, data storage, metrology, and wireless communications."
