To simultaneously achieve climate and health goals, the health-centred climate solutions are of great interest to policymakers. Here, we provide an overview of a unique set of 27 papers published in the focus collection on ‘health-centred climate solutions’. We also take stock of recent literature on the health impacts of climate change, the effectiveness of adaptation actions, and the health co-benefits of mitigation actions. First, we summarise the evidence-based climate and health interactions and the quantitative projections of future climate-induced health burdens. Second, we focus on adaptation actions, in particular early warning systems, and how they influence health risks. Third, we synthesise the health co-benefits of mitigation actions through improving not only air quality but also physical activity level, and their distributional effects across regions and population groups. Finally, we point out important gaps in data, modelling frameworks, and topics to be tackled in future research. Through this synthesis, we aim to catalyse a paradigm shift toward health-centred climate solutions that prioritise health benefits while addressing climate change challenges."
10.5194/acp-25-13975-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过在休斯顿附近的一个乡村沿海地区进行测量，量化了不同气团中的气溶胶，并识别了休斯顿地区有机物的主要来源。研究结果表明，以往的研究可能高估了烹饪气溶胶的含量。此外，高氧化有机物的日变化主要由气团变化驱动，而不是光化学反应。这项研究强调了排放、大气化学和气象对沿海乡村环境气溶胶特性的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶的成分分析、来源识别以及大气过程对气溶胶的影响，这些都与空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['aerosols', 'organic aerosol (OA)', 'PM1', 'air mass', 'sulfate', 'photochemistry', 'meteorology', 'air quality monitoring']",Jing Li;Jiaoshi Zhang;Xianda Gong;Steven Spielman;Chongai Kuang;Ashish Singh;Maria A. Zawadowicz;Lu Xu;Jian Wang,"The sources and diurnal variations of  submicron aerosols in a coastal–rural  environment near Houston, US","Using measurements at a rural coastal site, we quantified aerosols in representative air masses and identified major sources of organics in the Houston area. Our results show cooking aerosol is likely overestimated by earlier studies. Additionally, diurnal variation of highly oxidized organics is mostly driven by air mass changes instead of photochemistry. This study highlights the impacts of emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorology on aerosol properties in the coastal–rural environment. 
 Aerosol properties were characterized at a rural site southwest of Houston from May to September 2022 during the intensive operation periods (IOPs) of the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER). Backward trajectory analysis reveals three major air mass types: marine air mass from the Gulf, urban air mass influenced by urban emissions, and regional air mass. Marine aerosols typically show a bimodal size distribution and have the lowest particle number and mass concentrations of PM1 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1 µm), while aerosols from air masses strongly influenced by urban emissions exhibit the highest concentrations. Organic aerosol (OA) accounts for more than 50 % of PM1 for urban and regional air masses, whereas sulfate is comparable to OA in marine air masses. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of aerosol mass spectra identifies 6 OA factors: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), OA from the oxidation of monoterpenes (MT-SOA), OA from the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiols by acidic sulfate particles (isoprene-SOA), oxygenated OA arising from shipping emissions (shipping-OOA), and two oxygenated OA factors with high O : C ratios (OOA1 and OOA2). OOA2 has the highest O : C ratio and exhibits elevated mass concentration in the afternoon. Similar diurnal variation of highly oxidized OA factors was commonly observed in the Houston area during previous studies and attributed to the SOA formation by photochemistry and mixing from aloft. Here, using air mass backward trajectories and a 1-D box model, we show the diurnal trend of OOA2 mass concentration is instead driven by changes in air mass arriving at the rural site. The air mass changes are likely caused by the shift between land breezes and sea/bay breezes. Within the same air mass type (e.g., either urban or marine air mass), OOA2 mass concentration is largely independent of wind direction and shows essentially no diurnal variation, suggesting OOA2 is related to aged OA with minimal influence by local emissions. This study helps identify the major sources of OA in the Houston region and highlights the impacts of both atmospheric chemistry and meteorology on aerosol properties in the coastal–rural environment."
10.5194/acp-25-13831-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了大气湍流对使用卫星图像估算点源排放物（特别是二氧化碳）准确性的影响。研究使用高分辨率大气模型，模拟了波兰Bełchatów褐煤发电厂的二氧化碳排放情况，并发现大气湍流形成的持续羽流结构会导致排放量估算产生约10%的不可避免的误差。该研究强调了在利用遥感技术监测温室气体排放时，考虑大气湍流影响的重要性，并对传统的横截面质量通量（CSF）方法的应用提出了挑战。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['Greenhouse gas emissions', 'CO2', 'Satellite imagery', 'Atmospheric turbulence', 'Point source emission estimates', 'Remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Michał Gałkowski;Julia Marshall;Blanca Fuentes Andrade;Christoph Gerbig,Impact of atmospheric turbulence on the accuracy of point source emission estimates using satellite imagery,"Observations of greenhouse gas emissions are needed to monitor the progress towards Paris Agreement goals. Remote sensing instruments have been used to estimate emissions from the strongest anthropogenic sources. Here, we study the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the estimation of CO₂ with a realistic atmospheric model, and we show that the formation of persistent plume structures causes uncertainty on the order of 10 % of total emission that cannot be avoided. 
 Observation-based monitoring of the status of greenhouse gas emissions goals set at the 2015 Paris Climate Summit is critical to provide timely, accurate and precise information on the progress towards these goals. Observations also permit the identification of potential deviations from the adopted policies that could compromise the efforts to reduce the future impact of pollutants on the climate.Current remote sensing capabilities of atmospheric CO2 have demonstrated the ability to estimate emissions from the strongest sources of CO2 based on imagery of individual plumes in conjunction with wind speed estimates. However, a realistic evaluation of the accuracy of the obtained estimates is essential. Here, we examine how the stochastic nature of daytime atmospheric turbulence affects the estimation of CO2 emissions from a lignite coal power plant in Bełchatów, Poland. For this investigation, we use a high-resolution (400 m × 400 m × 85 levels) atmospheric model set up in a realistic configuration. We demonstrate that persistent structures in the downwind concentration fields of emitted plumes can cause significant uncertainties in the retrieved fluxes, on the order of 10 % of the total source strength, when the commonly used cross-sectional mass-flux (CSF) method is applied with short distances between individual estimates. These form a significant contribution to the overall uncertainty which remains unavoidable in the presence of atmospheric turbulence.Furthermore, we applied temporally tagged tracers for the decomposition of the plume variability into its constituent parts. These tracers helped us to explain why spatial scales of variability in plume intensity are far larger than the size of turbulent eddies – a finding that challenges previous assumptions."
10.5194/acp-25-13769-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了热带对流如何产生重力波，以及这些重力波在大气中能量传输中所起的作用。它利用了欧洲航天局的Aeolus卫星数据（该卫星搭载了ALADIN仪器，可以提供风廓线数据）、ERA5再分析数据以及全球导航卫星系统无线电掩星（GNSS-RO）测量数据。研究发现，Aeolus卫星能够识别出ERA5再分析数据低估的显著重力波活动，尤其是在印度洋上空。通过多仪器分析，该研究验证了动能与势能比率的经验基础，并揭示了再分析产品与观测结果之间的差异，这有助于改进未来的模型参数化。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来研究大气动力学和能量传输过程，并评估了现有大气再分析数据的准确性。,"['Gravity Waves', 'Aeolus satellite', 'ALADIN instrument', 'Wind profiling', 'GNSS-RO', 'ERA5 reanalysis', 'Atmospheric dynamics', 'Upper troposphere', 'Lower stratosphere', 'Convection', 'Energy transport']",Mathieu Ratynski;Sergey Khaykin;Alain Hauchecorne;M. Joan Alexander;Alexis Mariaccia;Philippe Keckhut;Antoine Mangin,"Convection-generated gravity waves in the  tropical lower stratosphere from Aeolus wind  profiling, GNSS-RO, and ERA5 reanalysis","This study investigates how tropical convection generates gravity waves, which play a key role in transporting energy across the atmosphere. By combining Aeolus satellite data with ERA5 reanalysis data and radio occultation measurements, we identified significant wave activity overlooked by ERA5, particularly over the Indian Ocean. Aeolus fills major gaps in wind data, offering a clearer picture of wave dynamics and challenging assumptions about their behavior, thereby improving climate models. 
 The European Space Agency's Aeolus satellite, equipped with the Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument (ALADIN), provides near-global wind profiles from the surface to about 30 km altitude. These wind measurements enable the investigation of atmospheric dynamics, including gravity waves (GWs) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This study analyzes ALADIN wind observations and ERA5 reanalysis by deriving GW kinetic energy (Ek) distributions and examining their temporal and spatial variability throughout the tropical UTLS. A prominent hotspot of enhanced GW activity is identified by Aeolus, migrating from the Indian Ocean in boreal summer to the Maritime Continent in boreal winter, closely matching outgoing longwave radiation minima and, thus, highlighting convective origins. Results show that ERA5 consistently underestimates Ek in convective regions, especially over the Indian Ocean, where conventional wind measurements are sparse. Additional comparisons with Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements of GW potential energy (Ep) corroborate these findings and suggest a significant underrepresentation of convection-driven wave activity in reanalyses. A multi-instrumental exploratory analysis also allows one to verify the empirical grounding of the established Ek/Ep ratio. By providing direct wind measurements in otherwise data-sparse regions, Aeolus offers a valuable dataset for evaluating and potentially improving the representation of GWs in reanalyses, particularly in remote tropical areas. The combination of Aeolus and GNSS-RO data allows for an observationally based examination of the partitioning between kinetic and potential energy, highlighting discrepancies with reanalysis products that could inform future model parameterization development."

Uncertainties of meteorology-driven ozone trends in China were examined. Multi-dataset analysis shows the largest meteorology-driven ozone trend with the best consistency occurs in spring. Multi-method analysis shows the best (worst) consistency occurs in winter (summer). Overall, meteorology boosts ozone growth in all seasons, with uncertainty from multi-method larger than that from multi-dataset. 
 China has witnessed notable increases in surface ozone (O3) concentrations since 2013, with meteorology identified as a critical driver. However, meteorological contributions vary with different meteorological datasets and analytical methods, and their uncertainties remain unassessed. This study leveraged decadal observational maximum daily 8-hour average O3 records (2013–2022) across China, revealing intensified nationwide O3 pollution with increasing O3 trends of 0.79–1.31 ppb yr−1 during four seasons. We gave special focus on uncertainties of meteorology-driven O3 trends by using diverse meteorological datasets (ERA5, MERRA2, FNL) and diverse analytical methods (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, GEOS-Chem model). A useful statistic (coefficient of variation, CV) was adopted as an uncertainty quantification metric. For multi-dataset analysis, models driven by different meteorological datasets exhibited the maximum meteorology-driven O3 trend (+0.55 ppb yr−1, multi-dataset mean) with the highest consistency (CV = 0.25) in spring. The FNL-driven model always obtained larger trends compared to ERA5 and MERRA2, which could be attributed to inability to accurately evaluate planetary boundary layer height in FNL dataset. For multi-method analysis, three methods demonstrated optimal consistency in winter (CV = 0.40) and the worst consistency in summer (CV = 2.00). The meteorology-driven O3 trends obtained from GEOS-Chem model were almost smaller than those obtained by other two methods, partly resulting from higher simulated O3 values before 2018. Overall, all analyses driven by diverse meteorological datasets and analytical methods drew a robust conclusion that meteorological conditions almost boosted O3 increases during all seasons; the uncertainties caused by different analytical methods were larger than those caused by diverse meteorological datasets."

Using air sensors and data analysis, researchers identified cargo ships as key polluters and created a cost-effective monitoring method for global ports. Findings warn that shipping expansion risks air quality progress, urging smarter policies while supporting trade. 
 The expansion of maritime trade has made ship emissions a significant target for SO2 reduction policies. However, there is still a lack of observational data to reflect the long-term changes in SO2 emission from ships. This study conducted continuous observational experiments using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) from 2018 to 2023 in a shipping channel in Shanghai, China. By employing machine learning for gap filling and meteorological normalization, the trends of ambient SO2 related to ship emissions (Ship_related_SO2) over the 6-year period were revealed. Furthermore, whether ships in the channel were using low-sulfur fuels was determined by a decomposition of SO2-rich plume signals (which reflect high-emission ships) and baseline variations. The findings indicate that ship activities increased ambient SO2 concentrations in the channel by 0.48±0.25 ppbv (43.24 % of urban background levels). During the policy adjustment phase (2018 to 2020), Ship_related_SO2 levels declined steadily due to low-sulfur fuel regulations. Meanwhile, from 2021 to 2023 (the policy stabilization phase), increased ship activity became the dominant driver of rising Ship_related_SO2 levels. Despite policy effectiveness, excessive emissions from cargo ships persisted throughout the study period. This study quantified the contribution of ship emissions to ambient SO2 during 2018–2023 based on observations, evaluating the effectiveness of low-sulfur policies and supporting ongoing efforts to mitigate SO2 pollution from maritime activities. The methodology developed here can be adapted to other global shipping channels, providing a framework for monitoring and regulating ship emissions worldwide."

Hostetler;Richard A. Ferrare;Sharon P. Burton;Richard H. Moore;Luke D. Ziemba;Ewan Crosbie;Armin Sorooshian;Cassidy Soloff;Jens Redemann,Aerosol effective radius governs the relationship between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and aerosol backscatter,"Small particles that form cloud droplets greatly impact Earth's climate but are very difficult to measure. If we can measure them using satellite-based instruments, we greatly increase the amount of available data on their concentrations. In this study, we find that including information about particle size is most important to measure them accurately from such satellite-based instruments. This can inform future studies on how to obtain more accurate information about small particles. 
 Understanding the vertical distribution of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations is crucial for reducing uncertainty associated with aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) and their effective radiative forcing. Many studies take advantage of widely available remote sensing observations to develop proxies, parameterizations, and relationships between CCN concentration and aerosol optical properties (AOPs). Such methods generally provide a good constraint for CCN concentration, but many uncertainties and limitations exist, generally related to high relative humidity (RH), environments with internal or external mixtures of several different aerosol types, and differences in parts of the aerosol size distribution relevant to both CCN and AOPs. In this study, we use in situ observations of the aerosol size distribution and chemical composition in a recent airborne field campaign to inform theoretical calculations of CCN concentration (CCNtheory) and aerosol backscatter at 532 nm (BSCtheory) with the purpose of understanding the dominant governing factors of the CCNtheory–BSCtheory relationship. Estimates from random forest models indicate that, for smoke, marine, and urban aerosols, the aerosol size distribution, as parameterized by the effective radius (Reff), is the most important predictor of the CCNtheory–BSCtheory relationship. We further investigate how Reff impacts CCNtheory : BSCtheory and find an exponential relationship between the parameters. We find that modeling CCNtheory : BSCtheory using this exponential Reff relationship can explain about 68 %–79 % of the variance in the CCNtheory–BSCtheory relationship. These findings suggest that including information about aerosol size is critical for future studies in constraining CCN concentration from AOPs."

The forward operator uses the new InDEpendent column local halF-sphere ApproXimation (IDEFAX). Polarized radiances simulated with IDEFAX and the forward operator were validated against full 3D radiative transfer simulations with MYSTIC and show a significantly improved representation of 3D radiative effects compared to the plane-parallel independent column approximation at comparable computation times. 
 Clouds generally have a complex three-dimensional geometry. However, realistic three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations of clouds are computationally expensive, so most retrievals of cloud properties assume one-dimensional clouds, which introduces retrieval biases. In this work, a fast forward operator for polarized 3D radiative transfer in the visible wavelength range is presented. To this end, a new approximation for 3D radiative transfer, the InDEpendent column local halF-sphere ApproXimation (IDEFAX), is introduced. The basic idea behind this approximation is similar to the independent column approximation assuming plane-parallel clouds. However, every column is approximated by an independent field of 3D half-spherical clouds instead of a plane-parallel homogeneous cloud. This field of half-spherical clouds is defined by the local cloud surface orientation angles and the cloud fraction. Thus, the IDEFAX has only three more parameters compared to the plane-parallel approximation. To obtain a fast forward operator, artificial neural networks are trained for both the plane-parallel and the half-spherical cloud assumptions. The IDEFAX and the neural network forward operators are validated against polarized 3D radiative transfer simulations with MYSTIC for low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds using a realistic cloud field simulated with the WRF model. The use of the IDEFAX significantly improves the representation of 3D radiative effects in the simulated radiance fields compared to the plane-parallel independent column approximation. Due to the implementation of the forward operator with neural networks, the computation time for both approximations is comparable and about 5 orders of magnitude faster than full 3D radiative transfer simulations for the shown example. The introduced neural network forward operators are constructed to be used in retrievals of cloud properties with the specMACS instrument. However, the methods are also applicable to other measurements in the visible wavelength range and to model data."

The addition of geomagnetic forcing led to significant ozone losses in the polar upper stratosphere of both hemispheres due to the catalytic cycles involving NOy. In addition to the particle precipitation effect, accounting for solar UV variability in the ICON-ART model leads to the changes in ozone in the tropical stratosphere. 
 We extended the Linearized ozone scheme – LINOZ in the ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) – ART (the extension for Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) model system to include NOy formed by auroral and medium-energy electrons in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and the corresponding ozone loss, as well as changes in the rate of ozone formation due to the variability of the solar radiation in the ultraviolet wavelength range. This extension allows us to realistically represent variable solar and geomagnetic forcing in the middle atmosphere using a very simple ozone scheme. The LINOZ scheme is computationally very cheap compared to a full middle atmosphere chemistry scheme, yet provides realistic ozone fields consistent with the stratospheric circulation and temperatures, and can thus be used in climate models instead of prescribed ozone climatologies. To include the reactive nitrogen (NOy) produced by auroral and radiation belt electron precipitation in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere during polar winter, the so-called energetic particle precipitation indirect effect, an upper boundary condition for NOy has been implemented into the simplified parameterization scheme of the N2O/NOy reactions. This parameterization, which uses the geomagnetic Ap index, is also recommended for chemistry-climate models in the CMIP6 experiments. With this extension, the model simulates realistic “tongues” of NOy propagating downward in polar witner from the model top in the upper mesosphere into the mid-stratosphere with an amplitude that is modulated by geomagnetic activity. We then expanded the simplified ozone description used in the model by applying LINOZ version 3. The additional ozone tendency from NOy is included by applying the corresponding terms of the version 3 of LINOZ. This NOy, coupled as an additional term in the linearized ozone chemistry, led to significant ozone losses in the polar upper stratosphere in both hemispheres which is qualitatively in good agreement with ozone observations and model simulations with EPP-NOy and full stratospheric chemistry. In a subsequent step, the tabulated coefficients forming the basis of the LINOZ scheme were provided separately for solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. These coefficients were then interpolated to ICON-ART using the F10.7 index as a proxy for daily solar spectra (UV) variability to account for solar UV forcing. This solar UV forcing in the model led to changes in ozone in the tropical and mid-latitude stratosphere consistent with observed solar signals in stratospheric ozone."

However, the scarcity of long‐term observations limits insights into its source variations that may reflect emission controls. From September 2016 to December 2019, Fe in atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) was measured in Beijing. Positive Matrix Factorization was used to apportion Fe sources. Results showed nearly 50% of Fe originated from anthropogenic sources, primarily industrial processes (30%) and coal combustion (17%). Although PM2.5 concentrations decreased significantly, the Fe component of PM2.5 did not show a significant decline. Instead, annual source contributions changed with dust source rising from 45% to 61%, while combustion sources decreased from 27% to 12%. Dust Fe aligned better with monthly MERRA‐2 dust extinction coefficients than hourly data, suggesting the limitations of MERRA‐2 in resolving hourly changes in dust. Anthropogenic Fe correlated with labile Fe, indicating anthropogenic emission reductions in Asia could decrease labile Fe supply to downwind oceans."

This study assesses future RTV changes under carbon neutrality using multi‐model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1‐1.9 (SSP1‐1.9) scenario. We further perform attribution experiments with the fully coupled Community Earth System Model to quantify the role of greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols (AER), and tropospheric ozone (O3) in driving projected RTV changes. Our results reveal a substantial decline in RTV across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) under carbon neutrality, especially at mid‐to‐high latitudes in winter and summer. This decline in RTV is primarily attributed to reduced temperature advection variability and changes in daily net surface radiative forcing.

We performed theoretical analyses and regional model simulations to evaluate how different sets of reaction rate coefficients affect the formation of sulfate and organic acids from SCI reactions. Our results reveal that both summer and winter conditions result in high organic acid yields and low sulfate yields, leading to increases in hourly formic acid and higher organic acids by as much as 1–3 ppb regardless of the set of reaction rate coefficient used, which can contribute to significant increases in water‐soluble secondary organic aerosol under typical ambient conditions in forested areas in China and Southeast Asia. Comparison of modeled SCI concentrations with estimated ambient SCI concentrations in forested areas in northern Europe provides the first regional modeling evidence that larger SCIs may react more slowly with H2O than small SCIs such as HCHO2, implying that reactions of larger SCIs with SO2 may also lead to increased sulfate concentrations, especially in highly polluted areas."

Knowledge of contrail cirrus lifetimes is required to estimate their lifecycle‐average radiative effect, but lifetime statistics inferred from observations are incomplete, hampering model validation. Contrail cirrus ice crystal size distributions are mainly impacted by entrainment and plume dilution, ice deposition growth and sublimation, and gravitational settling. Changes in the size distributions are due to synoptic and mesoscale air motions that affect sign and magnitude of ice supersaturation experienced by contrail particles. Driven by internal gravity waves, rapid growth/sublimation cycles and sedimentation lead to a selection of ice crystal sizes enabling long lifetimes for persistent contrails whose evolution is not limited by synoptic warming. Wave‐induced mesoscale supersaturation fluctuations lead to a wide spectrum of lifetimes with mean values of 24 $24$ hr and maxima up to 16 hr in large‐scale ice‐saturated conditions. Even longer maximum lifetimes as seen in some observations are possible within deep ice‐supersaturated layers, enhanced microscale turbulent temperature fluctuations, and new ice formation at the top of contrail cirrus. We conceptualize lifetime statistics and define initial adjustment, intermediate stabilization, and final dissipation regimes. Our analysis of contrail cirrus lifetimes and ice crystal size distributions will aid future satellite analyses and model development."

Methane has a warming potential 28 times that of carbon dioxide on a 100‐year timescale, and carbon monoxide is a precursor to ozone in the troposphere. Modeling trace gas concentrations in the Arctic atmosphere can be challenging due to Arctic conditions and sensitivity to long‐range transport, and comparing model outputs to remote sensing measurements is essential for ensuring that models are performing well. Ground‐based Arctic measurements are spatially sparse, so it is important to make use of all such available data sets. In this study, we assess eight atmospheric models, comparing their simulations of atmospheric CO and CH4 column‐averaged dry‐air mole fractions for 2014 and 2015 with ground‐based retrievals of these species at three Arctic stations in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON).

However, the maximum height of its temperature profile product is only 125 km. To improve the spatial coverage, this study proposes a machine learning (ML) method called Bayesian genetic backpropagation neural network (BGBN) to achieve high‐precision and large spatial‐coverage of the temperature profile retrieval through combing O2b1Σg+ ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}\left({\mathrm{b}}^{1}{{\Sigma }}_{g}^{+}\right)$ airglow data observed by the instrument with its existing temperature products. By comparing and analyzing with the official temperature product (MIGHTI v05) and other ML/deep learning models, the reliability and scientificity of the BGBN model were verified. The accuracy of the BGBN was analyzed by comparing independent results of two vertical fields of view. With the help of the interpretability analysis method, the relative variation characteristics consistent with the theory of molecular energy level in the model results were further revealed. On this basis, the model was optimized to improve the spatial coverage of its temperature retrieval results. The results indicate that the average deviation between BGBN retrieval results and MIGHTI‐v05 temperature is less than 5 K, and the self‐consistency is improved by 6.31%. The optimized model extends temperature profiles to 140 km, as validated against MIGHTI v06 data, and provides effective temperature data to some extent for nighttime observations and in extreme regions (like South Atlantic Anomaly). This methodology is expected to establish an effective paradigm for synergistic fusion of machine learning with MLT retrieval."

For this study, we quantify radiation variations through obscuration, which is defined as the fraction of the solar disk obscured by the Moon during SEs. Using Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations, we analyze the changes in the average ozone mixing ratio at the upper stratosphere and the lower mesosphere during multiple SEs since July 2004. The results show that during SEs, ozone at the upper stratosphere and the lower mesosphere is sensitive to short‐term solar radiation changes and increases to about twice the normal daytime ozone mixing ratio. The ozone increase tends to level off with increasing obscuration during SEs, especially near the totality. We estimate that the effect of water vapor photolysis, the primary photochemical process of mesospheric ozone depletion, is greatly suppressed during SEs. Furthermore, we detect O3 changes at 0.46 hPa, which cannot be explained solely by changes in temperature or solar radiation. However, CO observation, a long‐lived tracer, did not reveal any common characteristics in dynamical behavior related to O3 changes near the stratopause."

Given its nascent status, it is unknown how TEMPO V03 column NO2 compares to surface‐level monitoring across long‐term timescales. In this study, we explore how temporally averaged hourly TEMPO column NO2 observations compare to surface‐level concentrations from monitors in the US EPA Air Quality System (AQS). Monthly averaged hourly TEMPO vertical column densities (VCDs) correlate to surface‐level NO2 moderately (R2 = 0.42); however, there is notably stronger correlation for monitors that are not defined as “near road” across hourly annual‐average equivalent timescales (R2 = 0.61). During the TROPOMI overpass (approximately 13:30 LT), annual‐average TEMPO slant column densities (SCDs) at “not near road” sites are better correlated with surface‐level NO2 (R2 = 0.72) than tropospheric VCDs from TROPOMI (R2 = 0.65) and TEMPO (R2 = 0.66) due to added uncertainty with a priori inputs in the AMF. In the future, a more accurate AMF could improve TEMPO VCDs correlation to the level of the TEMPO SCDs. TEMPO column NO2 are most poorly correlated in the early morning at 6:00 (R2 = 0.23) and 7:00 (R2 = 0.35) LT when TEMPO is less sensitive to near‐surface pollution due to a longer sunlight path through the atmosphere and the subsequent increased sensitivity to retrieval assumptions. Ultimately, this analysis identifies conditions and characteristics that affect the correlation between TEMPO and ground‐level monitoring that has implications for applying TEMPO remote sensing data to derive or interpret surface‐level NO2."

 Earth science data exhibit inherent complexity characterized by heterogeneous spatiotemporal attributes, high collinearity among variables, and diverse input formats. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, geographic modeling lacks unified frameworks for integrating heterogeneous spatiotemporal data and diverse factor types. While Mamba architecture has demonstrated efficiency in large language models, computer vision and remote sensing, its applicability to geographic modeling remains unexplored. This study introduces Geo-Mamba, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three key innovations. First, we propose a systematic geographical factor classification method that categorizes elements into dynamic, static, and categorical factors, enabling standardized integration of heterogeneous data within a unified paradigm. Second, we design a selective encoder module based on Mamba architecture that leverages its linear complexity and scanning mechanism to establish selective state spaces for geographical inputs, revealing intricate associations between diverse feature types. Third, we incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers as intermediate components replacing multilayer perceptron linear layers, enhancing numerical regression accuracy in geographical applications. Experimental validation across three tasks demonstrates Geo-Mamba’s effectiveness: in net ecosystem exchange modeling (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.37 μmol·m–2·s–1), groundwater storage anomaly downscaling (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.916 cm), and land cover classification (accuracy = 88.12 %, F1-Score = 84.27 %).

These retrievals tested favorably when compared against corresponding aircraft measurements and were found to depend on the visual opacity of the cloud. 
 In this study, we describe an improved Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite retrieval which uses the CALIPSO Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) and the CALIPSO lidar for retrievals of ice particle number concentration Ni, effective diameter De and ice water content (IWC). By exploiting two IIR channels, this approach is fundamentally different from another satellite retrieval based on cloud radar and lidar that retrieves all three properties. A global retrieval scheme was developed using in situ observations from several field campaigns. The Ni retrieval is formulated in terms of Ni/APSD ratios, where APSD is the directly measured area concentration of the ice particle size distribution (PSD), along with the absorption optical depth in two IIR channels and the equivalent cloud thickness seen by IIR. It is sensitive to the shape of the PSD, which is accounted for, and uses a more accurate mass-dimension relationship relative to earlier work. The new retrieval is tested against corresponding cloud properties from the field campaigns used to develop this retrieval, as well as a recent cirrus cloud property climatology based on numerous field campaigns from around the world. In all cases, favorable agreement was found. This analysis indicated that Ni varies as a function of τ. By providing near closure to the ice PSD, the natural atmosphere may be used more like a laboratory for studying key processes responsible for the evolution and life cycle of cirrus clouds and their impact on climate."

Since this depends on temperature, latitude, season and topography, a satellite remote sensing method was developed to measure cirrus cloud properties. It was found that cirrus clouds strongly affected by homogeneous ice nucleation may account for over half of the overall cirrus cloud radiative effect during winter outside the tropics. 
 Cirrus clouds can form through two ice nucleation pathways (homo- and heterogeneous ice nucleation; henceforth hom and het, respectively) that result in very different cloud physical and radiative properties. While important to the climate system, they are poorly understood due to lack of knowledge on the relative roles of hom and het. This study differs from earlier relevant studies by estimating the relative radiative contribution of hom-affected cirrus clouds. Here, we employ new global retrievals (described in Part 1: Mitchell et al., 2025; henceforth M2025) of cirrus cloud ice particle number concentration, effective diameter (De), ice water content (IWC), shortwave extinction coefficient (αext), optical depth (τ) and cloud radiative temperature based on Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) and Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) co-located observations onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). Transition from het dominated to hom-affected regimes are identified using αext and De. Over oceans outside the tropics in winter, the zonal fraction of hom-affected cirrus generally ranges between 20 % and 35 %, with comparable contributions from in situ and warm base cirrus. Using τ distributions to establish a proxy for net cloud radiative effect (CRE), the τ-weighted fraction for hom-affected cirrus over oceans outside the tropics during winter was > 50 %, indicating that hom cirrus play an important role in climate. Using these retrievals (including those relating to the cloud geometric thickness), a conceptual model of cirrus cloud characterization is proposed."

Applied in Warsaw, it shows fires from North America contribute over sixty-five percent, surpassing Europe's share, highlighting the importance of intercontinental transport, which may be generalized across Europe. This is an important step in understanding how smoke particles from distant fires impact climate and atmosphere locally. 
 Biomass burning (BB) aerosol significantly affects climate by altering the radiation budget and atmospheric chemistry. Accurate source estimation is vital for climate modeling, yet global observations remain scarce. This study introduces a novel framework for assessing the contribution of transported BB aerosol to smoke-associated aerosol optical depth (BB AOD) at selected locations. The approach integrates satellite fire data (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Active Fire Product) with air parcel trajectory models (HYSPLIT), aerosol transport models (NAAPS), BB emissions (FLAMBE), and plume rise (CAMS GFAS).Tested in Warsaw (Poland, Central Europe) over 2006–2022, the methodology reveals a prominent influence of long-range BB aerosol transport from North America. Analysis indicates that USA (without Alaska) (37.3 %±3.4 %), Canada (25.4 %±6.7 %) and the Alaska (2.6 %±2.1 %) together contribute approximately 65 % of BB AOD during the BB season in the Northern Hemisphere, surpassing nearer European sources. Among European regions, Eastern Europe accounts for 16.6 %±5.3 % of BB AOD, followed by the Iberian Peninsula (10.6 %±1.5 %) and Southern Europe (7.5 %±2.1 %). Incorporating vertical plume dynamics is crucial: a planetary boundary layer plume-top threshold underestimates Canadian contribution while overestimating European sources, whereas removing altitude constraints overestimates Canadian influence.

The balance between solar and terrestrial radiation is delicate to calculate, and factors such as cloud optical depth, shape, and Sun position are crucial to estimate the effect of those clouds on radiation. Also, often neglected three-dimensional paths of radiation, or 3D effects, may be important to account for at the climatic scale. 
 The radiative effect of cirrus, contrails, and contrail cirrus affects the energy budget of the Earth and climate change. Those clouds, and especially contrails, are heterogeneous and their holes and sides exert three-dimensional radiative effects. This study uses the htrdr Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to investigate the sensitivity of the cloud radiative effect (CRE) to the geometrical dimensions and optical depth of optically thin ice clouds (cloud optical depth <4), with particular emphasis on three-dimensional radiative effects. When the Sun is at zenith, an increase in cloud optical depth causes a linear increase in shortwave (SW) CRE but a saturation of longwave (LW) CRE, causing the net CRE to change sign from positive to negative. The optical depth at which this change in sign occurs depends on the cloud geometry. 3D effects make the one-dimensional SW and LW CREs more positive for the  Sun at zenith, reaching the same order of magnitude as the 1D CRE itself for clouds with high aspect ratios. The angular dependence of ice crystal scattering strongly increases shortwave CRE when solar zenith angle increases. 3D effects change sign from positive at zenith to negative at large zenith angles as the Sun's rays interact more with the cloud sides. Integrating instantaneous CRE and 3D effects over selected days of the year indicates compensation of SW with LW 3D effects for some cloud orientations, but 3D effects remain important in some cases. These results suggest that the 3D structure of cirrus and contrails needs to be considered to finely quantify their CRE and radiative forcing."

We then stratify plumes by land cover type and infer the dominant aerosol aging mechanisms among different plume types. 
 The physical and chemical properties of biomass burning (BB) smoke particles vary with fuel type and burning conditions, greatly affecting their impact on climate and air quality. However, the factors affecting smoke particle properties are not well characterized on a global scale, and the factors controlling their evolution during transport are not well constrained. From observations of the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectrometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite, smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be retrieved, along with constraints on near-source plume vertical extent, smoke age, and particle size, shape, light-absorption, and absorption spectral dependence. Previous work demonstrated the robust, statistical characterization of BB particles across Canada and Alaska using MISR and other remote sensing data. Here we expand upon this work, studying over 3600 wildfire plumes across Siberia. We leverage the MISR Research Aerosol (RA) algorithm to retrieve smoke particle properties and the MISR Interactive Explorer (MINX) tool to retrieve plume heights and the associated wind vectors. These results are compared statistically to available observations of fire radiative power (FRP), land cover characteristics, and meteorological information. Correlations appear between the retrieved smoke particle properties, smoke age, local ambient conditions, and fuel type, allowing us in many cases to infer the dominant aging mechanisms and the timescales over which they occur. Specifically, we find that plumes located in areas with higher peat content are subject to less oxidation and condensation/hydration compared with other plume types (e.g., forest and grassland), and are predominantly affected by dilution instead."

By correcting for humidity, which causes aerosols to grow and intensify the lidar signal, the method provides more accurate aerosol vertical profiles. Our results show that aerosol profiles can vary significantly over short distances. This technique can help improve understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. 
 Accurately characterizing the vertical distribution of aerosols and their cloud-forming properties is crucial for understanding aerosol-cloud interactions and their impact on climate. This study presents a novel technique for retrieving vertical profiles of aerosols, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and ice nucleating particles (INP) by combining micropulse lidar, radiosonde, and ground-based aerosol measurements. Herein, the technique is applied to data collected by our team at Texas A&M University during the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) campaign. Ground-based aerosol size distribution and CCN counter data are used to estimate the value of the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, κ. The derived κ, together with Mie scattering theory and the relative humidity profile from the radiosonde, is used to estimate aerosol size growth and the associated increase in backscatter at each altitude. We then correct the lidar backscatter to dry conditions to produce the dry aerosol backscatter coefficient profile. The dry aerosol backscatter coefficient profile is linearly scaled to collocated surface measurements of aerosols, CCN, and INP to produce corresponding vertical profiles. Combining lidar backscatter profiles with aerosol and cloud nucleation measurements leads to a more realistic representation of vertical distributions of aerosol properties. The method could be readily applied to lidar measurements in future field campaigns."

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), emitted primarily from terrestrial plants, significantly influence atmospheric chemistry and climate change. Conifers are major sources of BVOCs in temperate regions. However, their unique physiology, particularly the storage of terpenes within their tissues, makes accurate measurements of BVOC emissions challenging owing to contact-induced release. We developed a portable dynamic branch enclosure system specifically optimized for BVOC measurement in conifers, which enables measurements of multiple trees in a single day. The system uses filtered ambient air as a purge gas to reduce logistical challenges and features a foldable bag design to minimize excessive BVOC release induced by physical contact. It provides BVOC- and ozone-free air, maintains stable internal temperature and humidity conditions closely approximating those of natural environments, and ensures repeatable measurements of BVOC emissions. Field testing with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) demonstrated the system's robust field performance, successfully capturing both significant inter-individual variability and the dynamic diurnal patterns of BVOC emissions. The system's ability to reliably resolve these differences under field conditions demonstrates its applicability for advancing our understanding of BVOC dynamics in diverse ecosystems."

 Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) is a major carbonaceous component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with significant implications for air quality, climate change, and the global carbon cycle. However, limited observational data under regional background condition has hindered a comprehensive understanding of its seasonal variability, sources, and formation pathways, especially in North China. To address this gap, we carried out a year-long observation of WSOC at Beihuangcheng Island, a representative regional background site in North China. The results revealed an annual average WSOC concentration of 2.96 ± 1.99 μg m−3, with marked seasonal variability—higher levels during the cold season and lower levels during the warm season. Strong positive correlations between WSOC and several chemical tracers in PM2.5 (e.g., K+, SO42−) as well as secondary organic carbon (SOC) indicate that WSOC is predominantly of secondary origin, mainly derived from anthropogenic emissions such as coal combustion and biomass burning. Source apportionment using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model identified secondary aerosol formation as the dominant contributor, accounting for 47.3 % of WSOC annually. This source is characterized by high loads of NO3−, SO42−, and a low organic carbon to elemental carbon (OC/EC) ratio, implicating fossil fuel-related emissions—especially from vehicles and coal combustion—in the secondary formation of WSOC. Biomass burning emerged as the second-largest contributor, responsible for 33.2 % of annual WSOC, with a notable rise to 40.0 % in winter. This seasonal increase highlights the substantial influence of residential heating and agricultural residue burning on WSOC levels during the cold season."

 Most of Earth's surface energy is from the Sun, and changes in surface solar radiation (SSR) profoundly affect the global climate. However, SSR exhibits serious simulation biases in climate models, severely hindering their projections and renewable energy resource assessments. Our analysis reveals that Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models systematically underestimate amplitudes of annual mean land SSR variations across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), exhibiting standard deviations of merely 0.7–1.2 W/m2 and underestimation rates reaching 20 %–50 % in annual mean SSR over the NH. Moreover, the Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) fail to reproduce the “dimming-brightening” transition seen in observational SSR records in the late 20th century. To resolve this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Emergent Constraint (HEC) framework based on the globally-benchmarked SSR dataset (SSRIH20CR) to systematically quantify model biases over the NH. Globally, the application of the HEC framework substantially reduces the magnitude of projected SSR increases and decreases across multiple emission scenarios. The projected uncertainty range accounts for approximately 85 % of the uncertainty from unconstrained SSR simulations. Regionally, although moderate SSR declines are projected to occur in Central Africa, the North American west coast, Asian Russia, and central China, more severe reductions dominate in South Asia, Europe, and most African regions. The HEC-corrected MME demonstrates a significant reduction in absolute bias relative to unconstrained SSR simulations (up to 0.26 W/m2), effectively constraining the propagation of such biases. Importantly, by applying the HEC, we enhance projection reliability through both a ∼ 15 % reduction in SSR projection uncertainty and a curbed declining trend that mitigates the “hot model” bias. This enhancement in SSR projections provides more reliable inputs for estimating solar energy yield. Consequently, it significantly improves the reliability of photovoltaic infrastructure planning for both site selection and capacity."

By improving the quality and interpretation of rainfall data, this work contributes to better-informed decision-making processes and supports the formulation of mitigation strategies for urban centers like Mumbai, which are increasingly vulnerable to severe weather events. Overall, the findings emphasize the critical role of accurate and timely rainfall data in addressing urban challenges posed by extreme weather, enhancing resilience, and fostering sustainable urban planning. The methodological framework leverages established approaches but adapts them to the unique operational challenges of Mumbai's high-density urban rain gauge network. The novelty lies in customizing and implementing these methods for near real-time integration across multi-agency datasets, ensuring spatial and temporal coherence in one of the world's most complex urban rainfall environments. This operational adaptation, coupled with rigorous multi-source validation, offers a transferable model for other megacities facing similar hydrometeorological risks."

 Accurate representation of nitrous acid (HONO) chemistry is critical for modeling atmospheric oxidation capacity and secondary pollutants like ozone (O3) in China, yet current air quality models systematically underestimate HONO. To address this deficiency in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we integrated five additional heterogeneous reactions: heterogeneous NO2 reactions on ground/aerosol surfaces, particulate nitrate photolysis, NOx oxidation, and acid displacement reactions. These updates were evaluated against wintertime HONO observations from the Lin'an Regional Atmospheric Background Station (LABS) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). The revised model reduced HONO underestimation dramatically, improving normalized mean bias from −90.0 % to −34.4 %. The simulation results demonstrated that ground-surface heterogeneous reactions dominated overall HONO production (45.4 %), peaking at night (65.3 %), while daytime formation was primarily driven by acid displacement (53.3 %). The enhanced HONO simulation amplified atmospheric oxidation capacity, increasing hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical concentrations by 87.6 % and 172.6 %, respectively. Consequently, O3 peak simulations improved by 6.0–17.0 %, significantly reducing model bias (NMB: −8.9 % to −2.0 %) and better capturing pollution episodes. The model's enhanced representation of HONO formation significantly reduced the discrepancy between simulated and observed data, underscoring the critical importance of comprehending and accurately modeling HONO in the study of secondary pollution."

Even though it is mainly targeted at station operators who want to analyze recent, not yet published measurements, it allows anybody to verify the quality of already published measurements using various anomaly detection algorithms as well as visual comparisons. 
 In-situ measurements of trace gases are crucial for monitoring changes in the atmosphere's composition and understanding the underlying processes that drive them. For over three decades, the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has coordinated a network of surface monitoring stations and facilities with the goal of providing high-quality atmospheric composition measurements worldwide. One of the critical challenges towards this goal is the spatially unbalanced availability of high-quality time series, and the lack of near-realtime quality control (QC) procedures that would allow the prompt detection of unreliable data. Here, we describe an interactive dashboard designed for GAW station operators, but which may be of much wider use, that is able to flag anomalous values in near-realtime or historical data. The dashboard combines three distinct algorithms that identify anomalous measurements: (i) an outlier detection based on the Subsequence Local Outlier Factor (Sub-LOF) method, (ii) a comparison with numerical forecasts coupled with a machine learning model, and (iii) a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) regression model. The application, called GAW-QC, can process measurements of methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3) at hourly resolution, offering multiple statistical and visual aids to help users to identify problematic data. By enhancing QC capabilities, GAW-QC contributes to the GAW programme's goal of providing reliable atmospheric measurements worldwide."

We find a good complementarity between the two approaches, with the combined product leading to the overall best fit to observations, and arguably most realistic wetland CH4 emission estimate. 
 Atmospheric inverse modelling and ecosystem data assimilation are two complementary approaches to estimate CH4 emissions. The inverse approach infers emission estimates from observed atmospheric CH4 mixing ratio, which provide robust large scale constraints on total methane emissions, but with poor spatial and process resolution. On the other hand, in the ecosystem data assimilation approach, the fit of an ecosystem model (e.g. a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, DGVM) to eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements is used to optimize model parameters, leading to more realistic emission estimates.Coupled data assimilation frameworks capable of assimilating both atmospheric and ecosystem observations have been shown to work for estimating CO2 emissions, however ecosystem data assimilation for estimation CH4 emissions is relatively new. Kallingal et al. (2024a) developed the GRaB-AM data assimilation system, which performs a parameter optimization of the LPJ-GUESS against eddy-covariance estimation of CH4 emissions. The optimization improves the fit to EC data, but the validity of the estimate at large scale remained to be tested.In this study, we confronted CH4 emissions optimized using the GRaB-AM system to atmospheric CH4 observations and to emission estimates from the LUMIA regional atmospheric inversion system (Monteil and Scholze, 2021). We  found that the two approaches lead to very consistent corrections to the prior emission estimate from natural wetlands, with roughly a halving of the annual total compared to the LPJ-GUESS prior. Our findings confirm the interest of the GRaB-AM approach to constrain the contribution of natural ecosystems to the total methane budget, which is difficult to achieve for atmospheric inversions outside regions where emissions from natural ecosystems clearly dominate the emission budget."

Using TROPOMI data, we found a 15% drop in 2022 and 8% in 2023, with Eastern Ukraine (frontline) seeing declines of 29% and 17%. Industry emissions fell most (34% in 2022), while war-related NOx partially offset reductions (8-10%). Emissions closely tracked military actions, revealing conflict’s disruptive effects on socio-economic activity and air pollution. 
 The outbreak of the Russia–Ukraine war in 2022 brought a huge impact on the Ukrainian society. We utilized TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations to constrain the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory and inverted daily anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in Ukraine from 2019 to 2023. Our results reveal a 15 % reduction in NOx emissions during the 2022 war and an 8 % reduction in 2023, both substantially exceeding the decrease caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emission anomalies closely tracked the timing and location of major military actions, highlighting the sensitivity of NOx emissions to conflict-related disruptions. Regionally, Eastern Ukraine experienced larger reductions in NOx emissions in both 2022 and 2023 by 29 % and 17 %, respectively, due to direct damage from frontline military operations. In contrast, Western Ukraine experienced a relatively modest emission reduction of only 8 % in 2022 with emissions increasing in some regions. In 2023, the emissions increased in most western regions. After the outbreak of the war, the industrial sector experienced the largest reductions in NOx emissions, with decreases of 34 % and 24 % in 2022 and 2023, respectively, followed by the residential sector, which declined by 23 % and 18 % respectively. War activities also emitted large amounts of NOx, and such emissions partially offset the emission reduction caused by the impact of war on socio-economic. By filtering out high-frequency emission fluctuations induced by wartime activities through Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing, our results indicate that war-related emissions may have offset approximately 8 % and 10 % of the anthropogenic NOx reductions in 2022 and 2023, respectively. After removing the war-related emissions, the inverted emission declines exhibit strong agreement with bottom-up emission inventories and reported economic performance metrics. These findings provide new insights into the environmental and socio-economic impacts of armed conflict."

The uncertainties of these measurements are rarely evaluated even though they are essential to determine the quality of these measurements. In this work, the uncertainty of 10 Brewers is estimated using the Monte Carlo method, showing that Brewers’ relative uncertainty is less than 5 % for wavelengths above 310 nm. 
 Brewer instruments are robust, widely used instruments that have been monitoring global solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiance since the 1990s, playing a key role in UV research. Unfortunately, the uncertainties of these measurements are rarely evaluated due to the difficulties involved in characterising the instruments. This evaluation is essential to determine the quality of the measurements as well as their comparability to other datasets. In this study, eight double- and two single-monochromator Brewers are characterised, and the uncertainty of their global UV measurements is estimated using the Monte Carlo method. This methodology is selected because it provides reliable uncertainty estimations and considers the nonlinearity of certain steps in the UV processing algorithm. The combined standard uncertainty depends on the Brewer instrument, varying between 2.5 % and 4 % between 310 and 350 nm. These uncertainties arise primarily from radiometric stability, cosine correction, and the uncertainty of the lamp used during calibration. At shorter wavelengths, the differences between single- and double-monochromator Brewers increase. For example, at 296 nm and a solar zenith angle (SZA) of 40°, the relative uncertainties of single Brewers range between 11 % and 23 %, whereas double Brewers have uncertainties of 3 %–5 %. As the measured wavelength decreases, the correction of stray light (for single Brewers), dark counts, and noise become the dominant sources of uncertainty. These results indicate that the accuracy of fully characterised double Brewers is sufficient for biological studies and trend detection, whereas single Brewers might be limited to wavelengths and SZAs below 305 nm and 70°, respectively."

Flux measurements of CO2 alone cannot be attributed to specific emission sectors, such as road transport or residential heating. We present a model which uses the measured ratios of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as sector-specific reference ratios, to attribute measured fluxes to their emission sectors. 
 Eddy covariance measurement of species that are co-emitted with carbon dioxide (CO2), such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 (NOx), provides an opportunity to attribute a net flux to individual source or sink categories. We present eight months of continuous simultaneous measurements of fluxes (F) of CO2, CO, NOx, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a tall tower (112 m a.g.l.) in Zurich, Switzerland. Median daily fluxes of FCO2 were 1.47 times larger in the winter (November–March) as opposed to summer (August–October) months (10.9 vs. 7.4 µmol m−2 s−1); 1.08 times greater for FCO (30 vs. 28 nmol m−2 s−1); 1.08 times greater for FNOx (14 vs. 13 nmol m−2 s−1); 1.01 times greater for FCH4 (13.5 vs. 13.3 nmol m−2 s−1); and not statistically significantly different for FN2O. Flux ratios of FCO/FCO2 and FNOx/FCO2 are well characterised by inventory emission ratios of stationary combustion and road transport in cold months. In warm months both FCO/FCO2 and FNOx/FCO2 systematically exceed expected inventory ratios during the day, while no statistically significant seasonal difference is observed in FNOx/FCO, indicating biospheric photosynthetic activity. A linear mixing model is proposed and applied to attribute half-hourly FCO2, FCO, and FNOx to stationary combustion and road transport emission categories as well as determine the biospheric FCO2. Flux attribution is reasonable at certain times and from certain wind directions, but over-attributes CO and NOx fluxes to road traffic and CO2 fluxes to stationary combustion, and overestimates photosynthetic CO2 uptake."

Nitric acid (NA) and ammonia (NH3) are key nucleation precursors in the UTLS. This study investigates the IA–NA–NH3 system using a theoretical approach. Our proposed nucleation mechanism highlights the crucial role of NA in IA nucleation, providing molecular-level evidence for the missing sources of IA particles in the UTLS. 
 In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), new particles frequently form to seed cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thereby affecting radiative forcing and global climate. Iodic acid (IA) particles have been widely detected in the UTLS; however, how they form is still largely unknown. Given the abundance of nitric acid (NA) and ammonia (NH3) in the UTLS and their nucleation potential, we explore the influence of NA and NH3 on IA nucleation by quantum chemical calculations and cluster dynamics simulations. The structural analysis indicates that NA and NH3 can cluster with IA via hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and electrostatic attractions between ions. The small-sized IA–NA–NH3 clusters have lower free energies than typical sulfuric acid (SA)–NA–NH3 clusters in the upper troposphere, exhibiting greater stability and higher nucleation efficiency. Moreover, the NA-enhanced effect on the established efficient IA–NH3 nucleation is more evident at lower temperatures, especially with richer NA and NH3. In the extremely low-temperature UTLS, the proposed IA–NA–NH3 ternary pathway dominates nucleation, while in the mid-troposphere with higher temperatures, the role of NA is minor due to its rapid evaporation. These findings underscore the important role of NA in iodine particle formation in the UTLS, offering mechanistic insights into the missing secondary particle sources."

POA averages 51 % of marine organic aerosols annually, peaking at 63 % in summer. A support vector regression model, validated via fuzzy clustering and Monte Carlo simulations, identifies seasonal patterns of POA linked to biological activity. We found diverse impacts of marine POA and SOA on the aerosol hygroscopicity and mixing state. 
 Marine primary organic aerosols (POAs) are important components of the marine climate system, regulating solar radiation budget and cloud dynamics. Despite their importance, there is a lack of extensive long-term observations of POA properties, introducing great uncertainty in their parameterization in models. This lack of information originates from the complexity of POA chemical composition, very few long-term high-resolution measurements of clean marine air, and the difficulty in performing source apportionment techniques over a long-term period. In this study, we utilize a comprehensive high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) dataset spanning 1 decade (2009–2018) and introduce a machine learning (ML) approach to distinguish between marine POA and marine secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Results indicate that marine POA concentrations peak during summer months and reach their lowest levels in winter. On average, marine POA constitutes 51 % (ranging from 21 % to 76 %) of the marine organic aerosol (OA) annually and up to 63 % (48 % to 75 %) in summer. With the differentiated POA and SOA, we found diverse impacts of POA and SOA on aerosol hygroscopicity and mixing state. An increase in POA reduces the hygroscopicity and leads to an external state of mixing, while an increase in SOA sustains the relatively high hygroscopicity and leads to internal mixing. This study provides an observational dataset for marine POA and SOA and their diverse impacts on aerosol hygroscopicity, emphasizing a better appreciation of marine POA and SOA to improve the climate projections."

Schuck,The extratropical tropopause – trace gas perspective on tropopause definition choice,"We compared different ways to define the upper barrier of the troposphere in the extra-tropics, the “tropopause”. By analysing ozone distributions sorted by different definitions, we found that the traditional temperature-based tropopause works less well than dynamic or tracer-based definitions. We saw a sharper transition of ozone across the tropopause using a higher value of potential vorticity than often used and recommend this value for future studies of exchange processes in this region. 
 Aircraft measurement campaigns such as IAGOS-CARIBIC and HALO missions are invaluable sources of trace gas observations in the extratropical Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (exUTLS), providing simultaneous measurements of multiple substances. To contextualise these observations, the use of dynamic coordinate systems such as tropopause-relative coordinates is highly beneficial. Different approaches to define the tropopause are commonly used in studies, based on either differences in chemical composition, dynamical parameters, or temperature gradients between the troposphere and stratosphere. We examine how different tropopause definitions influence the climatology and seasonality of trace gas observations. Meteorological parameters used in this analysis are obtained from ERA5 reanalysis data interpolated to the flight tracks. Our findings indicate that the thermal tropopause results in larger composition variability near the tropopause but shows the sharpest overall transition. Potential-vorticity thresholds of 1.5 or 2.0 PVU result in vertically displaced distributions. The 3.5 PVU threshold best represents the transport barrier as indicated by low variability and strong curvature around the tropopause. Tracer-based tropopauses using O3 or N2O can be used effectively to differentiate between the troposphere and stratosphere without the use of additional model data. A chemical tropopause tied to a mid-latitude ozone climatology was shown to return a meaningful tropopause-relative coordinate. An investigation of individual flights showed that the tropopauses calculated from model data did not represent small-scale structures well, while the “in-situ” chemical tropopauses provided more meaningful results. For the calculations of an N2O-based statistical tropopause, however, the case studies highlighted the importance of carefully setting initial parameters."

Loeb,The Component Summation Technique for Measuring Upwelling Longwave Irradiance in the Presence of an Obstruction,"We present a new upwelling longwave (LW) measurement technique that eliminates obstruction influences on pyrgeometers by using an infrared thermometer, downwelling LW pyrgeometer, and air temperature probe. This approach can be implemented at locations with obstruction challenges and verify existing upwelling LW pyrgeometer measurements. Satellite projects like the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System depend on accurate surface measurements to validate their models. 
 The CERES Ocean Validation Experiment (COVE) was an instrument suite  located at the Chesapeake Light Station approximately 25 km east of Virginia Beach, Virginia (36.9° N, 75.7° W). COVE provided surface verification for the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System  (CERES) satellite measurements for 16 years.  However, the large light station occupied approximately 15 % of the field of view of the upwelling longwave flux measurement (LW↑),  so radiation from the structure artificially perturbed the measurements. Hence, we use data from multiple instruments that are not influenced by the structure to accurately obtain LW↑; we call this the longwave component summation technique. The instruments required for the component summation are an infrared radiation thermometer to measure sea surface temperature, a pyrgeometer to measure downwelling longwave irradiance,  and an air temperature probe. We find a strong negative bias between the obstructed upwelling pyrgeometer measurements and the component summation LW↑ in the colder months, less so in the warmer months. The bias ranged from −6 % to +5 % over COVE from 2004–2013.

Longer-lived gases are compared to external measurements to assess the quality of the GLORIA-B observations. Diurnal changes of photochemically active species are compared to model simulations. GLORIA-B demonstrates the capability of balloon-borne limb imaging to provide high-resolution vertical profiles of trace gases up to the middle stratosphere. 
 Accurate observations of the vertical distribution and variability of atmospheric trace gases are essential for understanding chemical processes, validating atmospheric models, and monitoring the impact of anthropogenic emissions on climate and ozone. The Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA) is a limb-imaging Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (iFTS) designed to provide high-resolution mid-infrared spectra in the 780–1400 cm−1 wavenumber range. Originally developed for aircraft, the instrument has now been adapted for stratospheric balloon deployment (GLORIA-B) to extend its observational range from the middle troposphere to the middle stratosphere. GLORIA-B completed its first flight from Kiruna (Sweden) in August 2021 and a second from Timmins (Canada) in August 2022 as part of the EU Research Infrastructure HEMERA (Integrated access to balloon-borne platforms for innovative research and technology). The main objectives of these flights were technical qualification and the provision of a first imaging hyperspectral limb-emission dataset from 5 to 36 km altitude. Here, we present a characterization and validation of GLORIA-B performance using vertical volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles retrieved from the August 2021 flight. Comparisons with in-situ measurements (ozonesonde, MegaAirCore, and cryosampler) show agreement within 10 % for O3, CH4, SF6, and CFC-12, and within 10 %–20 % for CFC-11, HCFC-22, and CFC-113 up to 18 km, with larger deviations above this altitude. Another objective is analyzing diurnal changes in photochemically active species (N2O5, NO2, ClONO2, BrONO2). Observed VMR variations align well with simulations from the EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) chemistry-climate model, though absolute concentrations differ to a certain extent. Nighttime BrONO2 measurements allowed an estimate of lower stratospheric Bry (20.4 ± 2.5 pptv). These results demonstrate the suitability of balloon-borne limb-imaging spectroscopy for providing high-quality vertical trace gas profiles, offering valuable new data to improve our understanding of stratospheric composition and to support the validation of atmospheric models."

 Natural hydrocarbon seepages constitute a substantial influx of oil and gas into hydrosphere and atmosphere, impacting the environment and greenhouse gas budgets. The Lusi seepage system (Indonesia) is one of the Earth’s largest surface hydrocarbon manifestations, and is intrinsically associated with the interaction of organic-rich sedimentary rocks and recent magmatism. Previous ground-based and satellite measurements revealed that Lusi is a mega emitter of thermogenic methane, releasing ~0.1 Mt methane per year. Here, linking the quantification of mud flow rates with oil concentration data, we estimate that Lusi released ~0.22-0.28 Mt of oil over 13 years of continuous fluid discharge. This emission is of the same order of magnitude as the Deepwater Horizon spill. The oil discharge into the Porong River and Madura Strait poses an environmental threat to aquatic ecosystems of north-east Java. Combining flux and concentration data, we have also estimated a release into the atmosphere of ~8-10 kt of ethane and ~6-8 kt of propane per year. Over 18 years, Lusi has already injected into the atmosphere more than 20 times the amount of ethane released by the 2015 Aliso Canyon gas storage accident (California), considered as one of the largest gas leaks in U.S. history. The Lusi mega seepage system in Indonesia released around 0.3 Mt of oil over 13 years of continuous fluid discharge, emitting 10 Kt of ethane and 8 Kt of propane annually, according to geochemical analysis of mud and gas samples collected at the site since 2006."

Our results highlight performance differences among models, revealing strengths and weaknesses of different modelling techniques. We also found that wetland emission inventories overestimated emissions in regional simulations. This work helps to refine methane emission predictions, essential for understanding climate change. 
 High latitude wetland emissions of methane (CH4) remain a significant source of uncertainty in global methane budgets. At these latitudes, flux estimation approaches, such as atmospheric inversions, are challenged by complex meteorological conditions, limited observational coverage, and uncertainties in atmospheric transport modelling. This study evaluates the performance of various atmospheric transport models and reanalysis datasets using meteorological and CH4 in-situ measurements collected during the MAGIC2021 campaign near Kiruna, Sweden. Over six days of measurements in August 2021, the ERA5 reanalysis, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and providing global atmospheric data, showed better agreement with observations compared to the meso-scale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, though WRF provided valuable insights into local atmospheric dynamics. Among global simulations of CH4 mixing ratios, inversion-optimised models which adjust emissions to match observations, achieved the best performance overall particularly when constrained by surface measurements. Regional simulations from WRF coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) revealed biases in CH4 mixing ratios in the boundary layer, suggesting an overestimation of emissions by wetland models. All chemistry-transport models exhibited a positive bias in the stratosphere. Simulations with higher vertical resolution demonstrated an improved representation of vertical CH4 profiles in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Despite the limited spatio-temporal coverage of the observations, we were able to identify the best performing transport models and to evaluate fluxes from different biogeochemical model parameterisations using the MAGIC2021 high-resolution dataset, demonstrating the utility of in-situ vertical profile datasets for transport and flux model evaluation."

 As the Arctic warms, winter clouds are known and expected to change. Yet the extent to which these cloud changes amplify or dampen warming (cloud feedback) remains uncertain. This uncertainty results from systemic difficulties in modeling and observing Arctic low clouds. Surface-based observations avoid many of these difficulties. Here, we use two decades of surface-based observations (1998–2023) to constrain and explain longwave flux change during winter. We find that longwave flux into the surface is increasing and that this increase cannot be explained by direct impacts of temperature and greenhouse gases alone. Only when increasing cloud radiative effect (0.96 ± 0.64 W/m2/K) is considered can increasing longwave flux be explained. Cloud radiative effect increases due to increasing cloud opacity, which is driven equally by ice-only and mixed-phase clouds. The direct observational constraint from this work suggests that increasing cloud opacity drives increasing net surface radiation on Alaska’s North Slope during winter. Two decades of measurements at an Arctic research station reveal increasing wintertime radiative flux into the surface due to increasing cloud opacity, which is due to both ice-only and liquid-containing clouds."

 Our climate is undergoing significant changes with higher CO2 concentrations and rising temperatures. These changes are expected to increase the duration, intensity and frequency of extreme events by both individual and multiple co-occurring types of extremes - including weather, air quality and biotic factors - in the future. Such anticipated alterations will impact the release of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in turn will affect the formation of new small particles in the atmosphere. Models to predict the emissions of VOCs, as well as the formation of new particles, do not, however, account for such effects, possibly posing a significant limitation for accurate climate predictions. Thus, this study presents quantitative modelling estimates of the atmospheric impacts of active herbivory, drought, air pollution, elevated temperature and CO2 concentration, as well as multiple co-occurring stresses and perturbations on pure boreal Scots pine forests using the model developed by Taipale et al. (2021). It explores the potential scale and direction of plant stress impacts on atmospheric new particle formation. The results indicate that nearly all investigated plant stresses can substantially affect both the number and size of aerosol particles under atmospherically relevant conditions with increases in the number of newly formed particles by up to about one to two orders of magnitude when realistic stress frequency and severity is considered. This study illustrates that various plant stresses can be highly atmospherically relevant. However, field measurements - particularly on canopy and landscape scales - of VOC emissions and concentrations, as well as aerosol properties, are essential to validate the role of stress emissions in atmospheric aerosol processes. Such data is crucial for making the integration of plant stress emission responses into models robust and possible."

 Global ozone profiles at different diurnal overpass times from synergistic satellite retrievals offer unprecedented insights into the signatures of ozone photochemical mechanisms and atmospheric oxidation capacity. However, due to differences in instrument performance and retrieval algorithms, cross-satellite biases existed among different ozone retrievals, complicating the derivation of ozone diurnal variations. Here, we first present global twice-daily ozone profiles and ozone diurnal variations derived through synergistic calibration and retrievals from twin Chinese Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instruments (EMIs) with varying overpass times, onboard Gaofen-5B (GF-5B) and Daqi-1 (DQ-1) satellites. By correcting systematic reflectance biases and instrument degradation errors while estimating the measurement errors in GF-5B and DQ-1 EMI observations, we successfully enhanced the synergistic retrievals of GF-5B and DQ-1 EMI and addressed their cross-satellite biases. With correction for instrument degradation, the relative bias of DQ-1 EMI profiles around 16 km was significantly reduced from −72.5 % to within ±20 %. In addition, the validation standard deviations for both GF-5B and DQ-1 EMI profiles were notably improved, and their vertical patterns became more consistent, facilitating reliable assessment of diurnal variations in ozone profiles. The synergistic retrievals of GF-5B and DQ-1 EMI have unveiled the spatiotemporal characteristics of the diurnal variations in global ozone profiles. These variations were significant below 100 hPa, exhibiting seasonal and latitudinal dependencies and geographical patterns. We have also identified more accurate ozone formation sensitivities using ozone diurnal variations and the formaldehyde-to‑nitrogen dioxide ratio (HCHO/NO2, FNR), compared to relying on daily single-temporal ozone concentrations. This synergistic method provides ideas for future multi-satellite joint monitoring of atmospheric environments, which can contribute to the understanding of diurnal variations in atmospheric chemistry and further refinement of pollution control."

When the sun is low on the horizon, sunlight-based measures increasingly decline relative to lidar (but only in certain cases), driving lower average winter values even beyond the Arctic. These seasonality biases are important for user guidance, while this new insight may help reduce particulate measurement uncertainties in complex scenes. 
 Station observations of surface Arctic aerosol have long shown a pronounced seasonal cycle, with burdens characteristically peaking in the late winter/early spring. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products replicate this seasonality, but passive sensor and reanalysis data products do not. We find that the sub- and low-Arctic seasonality of gridded AOD products from six passive sensors diverges from that of CALIOP data products during the months of September–April, even when controlling for sampling biases. Using colocated CALIOP and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Aqua) retrievals, we find that for colocations characterized by low-quality MODIS retrievals, the bias between MODIS and CALIOP strongly depends on the solar zenith angle (SZA), with MODIS AODs showing a 132 % reduction relative to the instrument-mean over a theoretical 0–90° SZA domain. As the fraction of MODIS retrievals flagged as “low-quality” increases with higher SZAs, retrieval quality mediates the relationship between the SZA and dataset biases in gridded products. The dependency may be the result of cloud adjacency effects, and likely also affects midlatitude AOD seasonality. Though additional sources of uncertainty in high latitude retrievals remain, the observed dependency impacts passive sensor data products' representations of (sub-)Arctic aerosol burdens in boreal spring and autumn, which are important for understanding aerosol processes in a highly sensitive yet understudied region. This work also contributes to improved understanding and quantification of the effects of viewing geometry on satellite AOD retrievals, which can help constrain aerosol observations and associated forcings, globally."

Partridge,Towards an improved understanding of the impact of clouds and precipitation on the representation of aerosols over the Boreal Forest in GCMs,"Climate models struggle to predict how clouds and aerosols interact, affecting Earth’s energy balance. This study compares models to observations to see how they describe effects of clouds and rain on aerosols. While both models show similar overall trends, seasonal differences emerged. These, however, align with differences in key variables participating in cloud formation. The study provides insights on how to improve the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. 
 Global climate models (GCMs) face uncertainties in estimating Earth's radiative budget due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Accurate particle number size distributions (PNSDs) are crucial for improving ACI representation, requiring precise modelling of aerosol sources and sinks. Using a Lagrangian trajectory framework, we examine how clouds and precipitation influence aerosols during transport, and thereby influence aerosol–cloud relationships in the boreal forest. Two GCMs, the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1) and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0 with the SALSA2.0 aerosol module (ECHAM-SALSA), are complemented with model-derived trajectories and evaluated against in-situ observations, which are accompanied by reanalysis trajectories. Overall aerosol–precipitation trends are similar between GCMs and observations. However, seasonal differences emerge: in summer, UKESM1 exhibits more efficient aerosol removal via precipitation than ECHAM-SALSA and observations, whereas in winter, the opposite is observed. These differences coincide with key variables controlling aerosol activation, such as sub-grid scale updraught velocities and PNSDs. For example, in winter, removal of total aerosol mass in ECHAM-SALSA was stronger than in UKESM1, coinciding with higher activated fractions and larger sub-grid scale updraught velocities in ECHAM-SALSA. For both GCMs, cloud processing along trajectories increased SO4 mass, mainly in the accumulation mode, consistent with observations and model parametrizations. Discrepancies arise more from differences in PNSDs and updraught velocities than from wet removal parametrizations, an example being the underrepresentation of small particles in UKESM1. While our findings are representative of boreal region with predominantly stratiform precipitation, further work is needed to evaluate their applicability to other regions."

Wetland models underestimate emissions in that region, which has led some previous work to incorrectly attribute the African surge in methane emissions to livestock. 
 We use 2019–2023 TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane to quantify global methane emissions at monthly 2° × 2.5° resolution with a localized ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) inversion, deriving monthly posterior estimates of emissions and year-to-year evolution. We apply two alternative wetland inventories (WetCHARTs and LPJ-wsl) as prior estimates. Our best posterior estimate of global emissions shows a surge from 560 Tg a−1 in 2019 to 587–592 Tg a−1 in 2020–2021 before declining to 572–570 Tg a−1 in 2022–2023. Posterior emissions reproduce the observed 2019–2023 trends in methane concentrations at NOAA surface sites and from TROPOMI with minimal regional bias. Consistent with previous studies, we attribute the 2020–2021 methane surge to a 14 Tg a−1 increase in emissions from sub-Saharan Africa but find that previous attribution of this surge to anthropogenic sources (livestock) reflects errors in the assumed wetland spatial distribution. Correlation with GRACE-FO inundation data suggests that wetlands in South Sudan played a major role in the 2020–2021 surge but are poorly represented in wetland models. By contrast, boreal wetland emissions decreased over 2020–2023 consistent with drying measured by GRACE-FO. We find that the global seasonality of methane emissions is driven by northern tropical wetlands and peaks in September, later than the July wetland model peak and consistent with GRACE-FO. We find no global seasonality in oil/gas emissions, but US fields show elevated cold season emissions that could reflect increased leakage."
10.5194/acp-25-14411-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了COVID-19封锁对全球21个城市PM2.5空气质量的影响。研究结合地面观测数据和全球气溶胶模型，评估了封锁期间人为排放减少对PM2.5的影响。研究结果表明，全球范围内封锁并未系统性地降低PM2.5浓度，部分地区PM2.5浓度降低与封锁政策相关，但其他地区受到气象条件、沙尘和野火等因素的影响。此外，研究还指出，目前的卫星气溶胶光学厚度遥感技术无法可靠地识别COVID-19封锁对地面PM2.5的影响。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了地面观测和卫星遥感数据来监测空气质量，并分析了大气成分的变化。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite remote sensing', 'aerosol optical depth', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'urban air quality']",Claire M.

 The regional lockdowns, implemented around the world over 2020–2022 to contain the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), inadvertently created a natural laboratory for investigating the effect of reducing anthropogenic emissions on urban air quality at unprecedentedly large temporal and spatial scales. In this study, we analyze multi-year surface PM2.5 observations in 21 cities around the globe to examine an anomaly of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 µm) concentrations during major COVID-19 lockdowns with respect to that measured in the pre-pandemic years. We then use a set of Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) global aerosol transport modeling experiments to disentangle the effect of the lockdown emission reductions from other non-lockdown effects. Our analysis shows that no systematic reductions in PM2.5 are found in response to the lockdowns globally. In some locations, we find the coincidences of an increasing stringency index and decreasing surface PM2.5, which often lead to the record low of PM2.5 over extensive periods. These observations clearly suggest the positive impacts of COVID-19-lockdown-induced anthropogenic emission reductions on air quality. In other stations, however, the lockdowns' impacts could be masked by differing meteorology and the occurrence of dust and wildfire events. We also found that current satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth cannot be used to reliably discern the change of surface PM2.5 due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. The results of this study provide a preview of potential mixed effects on urban air quality when implementing air pollution control regulations such as transitioning from gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles."

Preston,Surface tension and hygroscopicity analysis of aerosols containing organosulfate surfactants,"This research explores how organosulfate surfactants affect aerosol particles and their response to changes in relative humidity in the atmosphere. Using optical trapping and strong electric fields to investigate single particles, it is found that these surfactants can significantly lower surface tension, even in very small amounts. These findings are important for understanding how such particles influence cloud formation and properties like brightness. 
 Organosulfate (OS) surfactants can influence cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and hygroscopic growth by reducing the surface tension of aerosol particles. We investigate the surface tension and hygroscopicity of aerosols containing short- and long-chain OSs in supersaturated aqueous droplets using an electrodeformation method coupled with Raman spectroscopy. For droplets containing short-chain OSs, the surface tension decreases as relative humidity (RH) decreases, even under dry and highly viscous conditions. Sodium ethyl sulfate (SES) lowered surface tension to approximately 30 mN m−1, a value lower than that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at its critical micelle concentration. We also studied ternary systems containing OSs with citric acid (CA) or sodium chloride (NaCl). Even small amounts of SDS, with a molar ratio of 10−3 relative to CA, reduce surface tension by up to 40 % at low RH compared to CA alone. Despite strong surface tension reduction, ternary OS–CA–water systems show hygroscopicity nearly identical to binary CA–water systems, suggesting that surface tension does not influence water uptake under subsaturated conditions. Ternary systems containing NaCl and OS undergo efflorescence at 47 % RH, but the crystallized NaCl becomes partially engulfed. If the RH is subsequently increased, the particle takes up water. At the deliquescence point (72 % RH), the particle becomes homogeneous again. These findings improve our understanding of particle growth and cloud drop formation processes, which influence cloud properties like albedo and lifetime."

The well-mixed planetary boundary layer serves as a convenient environment for such studies, since the fluorescence backscattering coefficient should remain constant in the absence of water uptake effects. However, during some episodes, we observed a systematic decrease in fluorescence backscattering, which likely indicates fluorescence quenching. 
 This study investigates the impact of water uptake by particles during hygroscopic growth on aerosol fluorescence properties, using multiwavelength Mie–Raman–fluorescence lidar measurements conducted at the ATmospheric Observation at LiLLe (ATOLL) observatory (Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosphérique, University of Lille) between 2021 and 2024. During certain episodes, we observed a systematic height-dependent decrease in the fluorescence backscattering coefficient within the well-mixed planetary boundary layer. This phenomenon begins at relatively low relative humidity (RH ∼ 50 %) simultaneously with a decrease in the particle depolarization ratio. However, the rapid growth of the aerosol backscattering coefficient at high RH is not mirrored by the same rate of fluorescence reduction. This distinct behavior suggests a nonlinear relationship between water uptake and fluorescence suppression, likely indicating that water-induced quenching effects operate independently of bulk hygroscopic growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability to retrieve particle volume and surface area density from single-wavelength extinction coefficients during strong hygroscopic growth episodes, validated against full 3β+2α lidar measurements. The values of the conversion factors for urban aerosol and smoke at 355 and 532 nm, together with associated uncertainties, are presented."

We also show the results of its validation campaign in a challenging urban setting in Rome, showing very good agreement with two reference instruments. Having an imaging instrument rather than the currently state-of-the-art unidirectional spectrometers brings promising capability in the context of satellite product validation. 
 Elevated surface concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are associated with poor air quality, making its detection and monitoring important for human health and the environment. Existing instruments such as the TROPOMI satellite currently deliver daily global maps of NO2 tropospheric columns, and the future Sentinel-4 instrument will return hourly maps. While areas of strong concentrations (cities, large industries) can be detected in these satellite observations, their spatiotemporal resolution remains too coarse to capture local hot spots and quick variations.In the context of urban air quality monitoring, we present a new type of remote sensing instrument capable of observing spatial and temporal gradients in the NO2 field, which is not currently possible with either space instruments or from the routine operations of conventional diffraction grating and other ground-based remote sensing instruments. This novel instrument is based on an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF) located at the heart of a telecentric imaging system. The instrument acquires spectral images in the region 430–455 nm, where NO2 exhibits strong absorption features. A dense spectral sampling was commanded in order to enable the application of the DOAS (differential optical absorption spectroscopy) method in the processing of the spectra measured by each detector pixel.In March 2024, the instrument was deployed at the BAQUNIN supersite for atmospheric research, located in the center of Rome. In order to validate the NO2 camera measurements, coincident acquisitions by a MAX-DOAS and a Pandora spectrometer were performed. The results show very good agreement among the three instruments. They also illustrate the additional capabilities of the NO2 camera in observing the spatial and temporal variability of the urban NO2 field."

This study presents a long-term (2011–2021), high spatiotemporal resolution aerosol optical depth dataset retrieved from a geostationary satellite over East Asia. The high-resolution data capture subtle aerosol gradients and land-ocean boundaries, providing valuable input for various fields such as aerosol-cloud interaction, climate change, ocean optics, and air quality studies. 
 Formerly known as one of the most polluted regions of the globe, East Asia underwent a dramatic improvement of air quality, especially for aerosols, starting in the 2010s. Numerous satellites have observed East Asia for a long time duration, but often with a low spatial or temporal resolution, limiting their ability to capture small-scale variabilities or provide continuous observations of long-range transport of aerosols. In this study, we provide an hourly aerosol optical property (AOP) dataset retrieved from the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), with a high spatial resolution of 2 km at nadir, covering the entire operational period from March 2011–March 2021. The dataset is retrieved using the Yonsei Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm, providing aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm as the primary product, along with fine mode fraction, single scattering albedo, Ångström exponent, and aerosol type as ancillary products. Seasonal validation of AOD against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) showed that the fraction of data points within the expected error range of 0.05+15 % varied from 56.4 % in June–July–August to 64.5 % in September–October–November, with the mean bias generally within ±0.05. Compared to the operational version, the high-resolution product demonstrated improved retrieval capability in the presence of broken clouds, along complex coastlines, and in capturing AOD variability at the sub-district level. The decadal AOD exhibited a decreasing trend over four major cities within the observation domain. We expect this data to be widely used in climate modelling, reanalysis, atmospheric chemistry, marine optics, environmental health studies, variability and trend analysis, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between climate change, trace gases, human health, and AOPs.

 An appropriate representation of the NOx/NO2 ratio and NOx lifetime is essential for estimating NOx emissions from satellite NO2 observations. We introduce a satellite-based, data-driven approach that applies variable NOx/NO2 ratio and derives a nonlinear chemical lifetime using a piecewise fitting method based on the directional derivative approach (DDA). This method enables the estimation of both regional and point-source NOx emissions across China, representing the first application of a lightweight, satellite-driven method to directly capture nonlinear NOx lifetime for emission estimation over large, topographically complex region. The incorporation of a variable NOx/NO2 ratio enhances the accuracy of source divergence and emission estimates and the improved fitting scheme captures the nonlinear behavior of NOx chemistry. Anthropogenic contributions are isolated by subtracting natural sources from satellite-derived total emissions, with natural NOx identified using a seasonal criterion and further constrained by Nighttime Light (NTL) data. Estimated anthropogenic NOx emissions in China from 2019 to 2024 are 20.2 Tg, 18.5 Tg, 19.4 Tg, 18.9 Tg, 20.7 Tg and 18.8 Tg, respectively, with annual uncertainties of 27 %–30 %. These values show good agreement with both bottom-up inventories and top-down inversions, with national scale discrepancies ranging from −11.8 % to 0.8 %. The DDA captures key spatial and temporal emission patterns, including consistent decline in NOx emissions in megacities and provincial disparities linked to urbanization and economic development. The DDA estimates are consistent with previous studies on coal-fired power plant emissions, and emissions from 124 plants vary between 0.02–2.13 kg s−1 for 2019–2024, with uncertainties spanning 4 %–78 %, averaging 16 %. This satellite-based, lightweight method enables low-latency, timely long-term monitoring of NOx emissions and offers a promising alternative to bottom-up inventories and resource-intensive top-down models.

We also present an application of TROPOMI CO column data assimilation in UFS-RAQMS with the NOAA Grid Point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) analysis system to constrain UFS-RAQMS CO. We validate UFS-RAQMS control and TROPOMI CO data assimilation CO analyses for the period 15 July–30 September 2019 against independent satellite, ground-based, and airborne observations. We show that the largest impacts of the TROPOMI CO data assimilation are in the lower troposphere over Siberia and Indonesia. We find that UFS-RAQMS biomass burning signatures in CO column are not consistent with those in aerosol optical depth (AOD) near the Siberian and Indonesian biomass burning source regions within our control experiment. Assimilation of TROPOMI CO improves the representation of the biomass burning AOD/CO relationship in UFS-RAQMS by increasing the CO column, which suggests that the biomass burning CO emissions from the Blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product (GBBEPx) used in UFS-RAQMS are too low for boreal wildfires."

We combine top‐down and bottom‐up approaches to evaluate the N2O and CH4 emission inventory for Rotterdam based on high‐precision measurements made using an aircraft and a mobile vehicle. We divided the Rotterdam area into two sub‐areas: (a) west industrial area (WIA) and (b) Rotterdam urban area (RUA). For the top‐down estimate, the total emissions from Rotterdam are calculated as the sum of quantified emissions from both the WIA and the RUA based on aircraft observations. We further quantified emissions from key source categories including Wastewater Treatment Plants, Traffic and Transportation, Chemical Industry, Energy, and Refineries based on mobile vehicle and aircraft measurements. These measurements revealed that N2O and CH4 emissions were 2–4 and 4–16 times higher than inventory estimates, respectively. We revised the inventory after which the discrepancy between top‐down estimates and Rotterdam's emission inventory decreased from approximately a factor of 4 to about 2 for N2O, whereas CH4 emissions between top‐down and inventory showed no significant difference within the uncertainty. The persistent gap between top‐down and bottom‐up estimates implies the underestimation of N2O emissions from other sources (such as sewerage and landfills) and/or the existence of missing sources that are not fully accounted for in the inventory. Our findings highlight the need for further comprehensive quantification across additional source categories and temporal scales."

While satellite instruments provide extensive geographic coverage for monitoring tropospheric ozone (O3) precursors, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO), these space-based measurements cannot replace ground-based observations for an accurate assessment of air quality conditions near the surface. Attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for tropospheric O3 is determined using surface measurements rather than satellite-derived column values. Using the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping demographic and health variables, we identify underserved counties, those that lack adequate ambient air quality monitoring. We present a comprehensive method for optimizing AQS site placement by integrating satellite data from NASA’s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution instrument, demographic indicators, and population density. We introduce the Integrated AQS Placement Index (IIAP), which combines normalized demographic overlap, satellite-measured HCHO or NO2 column values, and population density to prioritize future monitoring locations. Our analysis reveals significant monitoring gaps in the Eastern and Southeastern United States, notably in the ‘isoprene volcano’ region, as well as clusters along the I-95 corridor in the Northeast. These areas are characterized by high population, high concentrations of HCHO, which is an under-monitored carcinogen, and vulnerable demographic profiles.

Furthermore, the ozone simulated by them are also obviously less sensitive to natural precursors than to anthropogenic sources. 
 Ozone (O3) is a Short-lived Climate Forcer (SLCF) that contributes to radiative forcing and indirectly affects the atmospheric lifetime of methane, a major greenhouse gas. This study investigates the sensitivity of global O3 to precursor gases in a clean atmosphere, where hydroxyl (OH) radical characteristics are more spatially uniform than in present-day conditions, using data from the PiClim experiments of the Aerosols and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) within the CMIP6 framework. We also evaluate the O3 simulation capabilities of four Earth system models (CESM2-WACCM, GFDL-ESM4, GISS-E2-1-G, and UKESM1-0-LL). Our analysis reveals that the CESM and GFDL models effectively capture seasonal O3 cycles and consistently simulate vertical O3 distribution. While all models successfully simulate O3 responses to anthropogenic precursor emissions, CESM and GFDL show limited sensitivity to enhanced natural NOx emissions (e.g., from lightning) compared to GISS and UKESM.The sensitivities of O3 to its natural precursors (NOx and VOCs) in GISS and UKESM models are substantially lower than their responses to anthropogenic emissions, particularly for lightning NOx sources. These findings refine our understanding of O3 sensitivity to natural precursors in clean atmospheres and provide insights for improving O3 predictions in Earth system models."

New petrological estimations are consistent with our emission budgets. These findings highlight the feasibility of using existing atmospheric monitoring networks to study the atmospheric impact of volcanic degassing and support monitoring during eruptive crises. 
 In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and natural hazards, atmospheric monitoring networks are essential for informed decision-making. During the 2021 La Palma eruption, we integrated surface and ground-based remote sensing measurements from global atmospheric network instruments, complemented by rapidly deployed sensors, to monitor volcanic gas emissions up to 140 km from the source. We used direct-sun measurements from low-resolution (EM27/SUN) and high-resolution (IFS-125HR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers. On La Palma, the EM27/SUN was combined with a differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument. We present new FTIR retrieval methods to derive the SO2, CO2, CO, HF, and HCl relative abundance in the plume from both low- and high-resolution solar absorption spectra. Using Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data, we derived SO2 fluxes and estimated total emissions of 1.8 ± 0.2 Mt SO2, 19.4 ± 1.8 Mt CO2, 0.123 ± 0.005 Mt CO, 0.05 ± 0.01 Mt HCl, and 0.013 ± 0.002 Mt HF over the course of the eruption. These results are consistent with the mass balance derived from petrologic degassing estimates. This study demonstrates that high- and low-resolution FTIR and DOAS spectrometers, integrated within global monitoring networks, can provide quantitative constraints on volcanic gas composition and fluxes over large distances. Such capabilities are directly applicable to volcanic crisis monitoring, complementing dedicated networks, satellite observations and supporting improved assessments of volcanic impacts on the atmospheric composition at regional scales."

However, the crop production losses (CPL) caused by O3 exposure reached the highest values in China. The emission control measures largely decreased the O3 damage to crop in China instead of SS and SA. 
 Wildfire smoke often aggravates the ozone (O3) pollution and negatively affect crop yields. To date, the global impact of fire-sourced O3 exposure on crop yields still remained unknown. To address this issue, a multi-stage model was developed to quantify the global wildfire-induced ambient O3 concentrations in the future scenarios. The results suggested that the relationship between observed K+ and levoglucosan levels with simulated fire-sourced maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) O3 concentration reached 0.67 and 0.73, respectively, indicating the robustness of fire-sourced O3 estimate. In both of historical and future scenarios, Sub-Sahara Africa (SS: 14.9±8.4 (historical) and 18.3±9.6 (mean of the future scenarios) µg m−3) and South America (SA: 4.0±2.5 and 4.7±3.2 µg m−3) showed the highest fire-sourced MDA8 O3 concentrations among all of the regions. However, the crop production losses (CPL) caused by O3 exposure reached the highest values in China due to very high total crop yields and relatively high wildfire-induced MDA8 O3 levels. Moreover, CPL in China was sensitive to emission scenario, indicating the effective emission control could largely decrease fire-sourced O3 damage to crop. In contrast, both of SS and SA even showed the higher CPL in low-carbon scenario (SSP1-2.6), suggesting more stringent control measures are required to offset the wildfire contribution. Our findings call for attention on the threat to future global food security from the absence of pollution mitigation and the persistence of global warming."

We have studied the impact and future trends of climate change in the Yangtze River Delta region and found that the intensification of climate change will exacerbate the impact of TCs on O3 in the Yangtze River Delta, requiring strengthened monitoring and early warning. 
 Tropical cyclones (TCs) have a significant impact on ozone (O3) in coastal regions by affecting atmospheric circulation and meteorological conditions. This paper investigates the impact and its future changing trends in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. It was found that regional O3 pollution usually occurred before TCs made landfall and after they dissipated in 2018–2022. We classified the weather patterns (SWPs) from June to September during 2018–2022 into four main categories. As pollution levels increase within the TCs weather pattern, regional temperatures rise, relative humidity decreases, and wind speeds weaken, creating a favorable environment for O3 formation and accumulation. The annual O3 concentration series is reconstructed based on changes in SWP frequency and intensity, quantifying the impact of various SWPs on future O3 variations. The analysis focuses on the number of days with the TCs weather pattern and their contribution to O3 variation. Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, future YRD O3 concentrations from June to September will increase to varying degrees relative to historical average O3 concentrations, with average increases of approximately 1.88 and 6.86 µg m−3, respectively. Under all future scenarios, the number of days with TC weather pattern increases to varying degrees, and the frequency of TCs increases significantly. The contribution of TCs weather pattern to O3 changes is increasing compared to the historical period. This shows that the intensification of climate change will intensify the impact of TCs on O3 in the YRD, and monitoring and early warning need to be strengthened."

Surprisingly, despite their intensity, the smoke did not rise very high but lingered at flight cruising altitudes, causing widespread pollution. This study shows how two different pathways lifted smoke into the lower stratosphere and reveals new insights into how wildfires affect air quality and climate, challenging what we thought we knew about fire and atmospheric impacts. 
 The climate-altering potential of wildfires through their emissions into the stratosphere has only recently been realized following the major wildfire outbreaks in Canada and Australia. The 2023 Canadian wildfire season stood out for its extended burned area and duration, by far exceeded the previous record-breaking events, including the Australian “Black Summer” in terms of the emitted power and pyroCb count with a total number of 142 Canadian pyroCb events over the season. The incessant fire activity all across Canada produced a succession of smoke injections into the lower stratosphere. Here, we use various satellite data sets, airborne and ground-based observations together with chemistry-transport model simulations to show that despite the exceptional vigor of the 2023 Canadian wildfires, the depth of their stratospheric impact was surprisingly shallow and limited to the lowermost stratosphere. Conversely, the incessant fire activity featuring a long succession of moderate-strength pyroCb events, combined with numerous episodes of synoptic-scale smoke uplift through the warm conveyor belt, led to unparalleled levels of pollution at commercial aircraft cruising altitudes throughout the season."

This study presents the setup of the model together with its numerous inputs and evaluates its performance in comparison with observations from the CO2 sensor network. 
 Urban areas are significant contributors to global CO2 emissions, requiring detailed monitoring to support climate neutrality goals. This study presents a high-resolution modeling framework using GRAMM/GRAL, adapted for simulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic and biospheric sources and sinks in Zurich, Switzerland. The framework resolves atmospheric concentrations at the building scale, and it employs a detailed inventory of anthropogenic emissions as well as biospheric fluxes, which were calculated using the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM). Instead of simulating the full dynamics of meteorology and atmospheric transport, the dispersion of CO2 is precomputed for more than 1000 static weather situations, from which the best match is selected for any point in time based on the simulated and measured meteorology in and around the city. In this way, time series over multiple years can be produced with minimal computational cost. Measurements from a dense network of mid-cost CO2 sensors are used to validate the model, demonstrating its capability to capture spatial and temporal CO2 variability. Applications to other cities are discussed, emphasizing the need for high-quality input data and tailored solutions for diverse urban environments. The work contributes to advancing urban CO2 monitoring strategies and their integration with policy frameworks."

Since its launch, the increase of CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is clear. The datasets obtained from GOSAT-2 are used in the Copernicus atmospheric services to monitor the climate, in light of the Paris Agreement. Here we present robust datasets of these gases from GOSAT-2, including a novel machine learning approach to data quality filtering. 
 Accurately measuring greenhouse gas concentrations to identify regional sources and sinks is essential for effectively monitoring and mitigating their impact on the Earth's changing climate. In this article we present the scientific data products of XCO2 and XCH4, retrieved with RemoTeC, from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite-2 (GOSAT-2), which span a time range of 5 years. GOSAT-2 has the capability to measure total columns of CO2 and CH4 to the necessary requirements set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), who define said requirements as accuracy<10 ppb and <0.5 ppm for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively, and stability of <3ppbyr-1 and <0.5ppmyr-1 for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively.Central to the quality of the XCO2 and XCH4 datasets is the post-retrieval quality flagging step. Previous versions of RemoTeC products have relied on threshold filtering, flagging data using boundary conditions from a list of retrieval parameters. We present a novel quality filtering approach utilising a machine learning technique known as Random Forest Classifier (RFC) models. This method is developed under the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative+ (CCI+) program and applied to data from GOSAT-2.  Data from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are employed to train the RFC models, where retrievals are categorized as good or bad quality based on the bias between GOSAT-2 and TCCON measurements. TCCON is a global network of Fourier transform spectrometers that measure telluric absorption spectra at infrared wavelengths. It serves as the scientific community's standard for validating satellite-derived XCO2 and XCH4 data.  Our results demonstrate that the machine learning-based quality filtering achieves a significant improvement, with data yield increasing by up to 85 % and RMSE improving by up to 30 %, compared to traditional threshold-based filtering. Furthermore, inter-comparison with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) indicates that the quality filtering RFC models generalise well to the full dataset, as the expected behaviour is reproduced on a global scale.Low systematic biases are essential for extracting meaningful fluxes from satellite data products. Through TCCON validation we find that all data products are within the breakthrough bias requirements set, with RMSE for XCH4 < 15 ppb and XCO2 < 2 ppm. We derive station-to-station biases of 4.2 ppb and 0.5 ppm for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively, and linear drift of 0.6 ppb yr−1 and 0.2 ppm yr−1 for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively.For XCH4, GOSAT-2 and TROPOMI are highly correlated with standard deviations less than 18 ppb and globally averaged biases close to 0 ppb. The inter-satellite bias between GOSAT and GOSAT-2 is significant, with an average global bias of −15 ppb. This is comparable to that seen between GOSAT and TROPOMI, consistent with our findings that GOSAT-2 and TROPOMI are in close agreement."

An aerosol-based method and a thermodynamic method were tested using a lidar system that can measure vertical profiles of aerosols, humidity, and temperature. Each method performed best under different conditions. Together, they provide a path toward more reliable mixed layer height monitoring with a single instrument. 
 Accurate measurement of the mixed layer height (MLH) is a key observational capability necessary for many studies in weather forecasting, air quality assessment, and surface-atmosphere exchange. However, continuous MLH monitoring with backscatter lidars remains challenging under complex atmospheric conditions, including cloudy conditions and in the presence of residual layers. This study evaluates two complementary MLH retrieval algorithms using a single MicroPulse Differential Absorption Lidar (MPD): an aerosol-based approach that analyzes aerosol backscatter gradients with a wavelet technique and a thermodynamic technique based on the vertical structure of virtual potential temperature profiles. Both techniques were compared against MLH estimates from radiosondes, a Doppler wind lidar, and a high-resolution weather model using data from the M2HATS field campaign in Tonopah, NV, USA, supplemented by a smaller dataset from Boulder, CO, USA. The aerosol method achieved high temporal resolution and agreement with radiosonde MLH estimates under convective conditions (R2= 0.819–0.919), but its MLH estimates deviated from other methods during morning and evening transitions due to residual layer interference. The thermodynamic method avoided these problems but had coarser resolution and degraded instrument performance beneath clouds (R2= 0.661–0.845). Because lidar generally cannot penetrate clouds, conditions with clouds at or below the MLH are not considered, while those with clouds above the MLH are retained. The study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Together, they offer a path toward more reliable automatic MLH monitoring with a single instrument by capturing when different MLH definitions converge."

This result suggests that the deviation in the CO2 value in the cylinder is caused not only by the adsorption and desorption effects but also by the thermal diffusion fractionation effect. 
 The CO2 molar fraction in standard gas mixtures is known to deviate as a result of adsorption/desorption to/from the inner surface of a high-pressure cylinder and thermal diffusion fractionation caused by the temperature distribution in the cylinder. This deviation reduces the consistency of atmospheric CO2 observations, because the standard gas mixtures are used to calibrate all measurement systems for precise CO2 observations. To maintain the consistency of CO2 values over the long term, a quantitative understanding of the deviations in the CO2 molar fraction in a standard gas mixture is needed. Thus far, this understanding has not been achieved sufficiently well, because the contribution of thermal diffusion fractionation is less well understood than that of adsorption/desorption. In this study, offsets of 0.013 ± 0.015 and −0.014 ± 0.011 µmol mol−1 were observed in the outflowing gas from horizontally and vertically positioned cylinders, respectively, at a flow rate of 0.080 L min−1. These offsets are attributed to thermal diffusion effects, which diluted and enriched the CO2 molar fraction by −0.045 µmol mol−1 (horizontal cylinder) and 0.048 µmol mol−1 (vertical cylinder) as the relative pressure dropped to 0.03. In the experiments at same flow rate, the adsorption/desorption effect enriched the CO2 molar fraction by 0.06 µmol mol−1 (horizontal cylinder) and 0.10 µmol mol−1 (vertical cylinder). Therefore, attention should be paid to both thermal diffusion fractionation and adsorption/desorption effects for precise calibration of long-term observations of CO2 molar fractions, although past studies have ignored the contribution of thermal diffusion fractionation at the low flow rates (< 0.3 L min−1) examined in this study. Furthermore, the deviation of the CO2 molar fraction depends only on the pressure relative to the initial pressure of the cylinder. This result suggests that the recommendation by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to replace the standard gas mixture once the cylinder pressure drops to 2 MPa needs to be revised."

PWV retrievals utilized weighted mean temperature (Tm) and zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) derived from fifth-generation European Reanalysis (ERA5) data. After rigorous quality control, the dataset achieved an average completeness rate of 70 %. Validation against ERA5 PWV products showed strong agreement (mean bias: 0.88 mm; RMS error: 2.59 mm), while comparisons with radiosonde profiles yielded a mean bias of 0.90 mm and an RMS error of 3.06 mm, confirming its accuracy and reliability. Spatial analysis of China coastal PWV showed that minimum values decrease with increasing latitude, while maximum values are concentrated in the subtropical and tropical monsoon climate zones. Temporal patterns exhibited prominent annual and semi-annual cycles, particularly in higher latitudes. PWV showed a strong positive correlation with sea surface temperature (SST; r= 0.76), with a 1 K SST increase leading to a 2.4 mm (7 %) PWV rise.

This study investigates the impact of the cold‐pole bias on Southern Hemisphere springtime stratosphere‐troposphere coupling and how this impact is affected by interactive ozone using a pair of Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) simulations with and without interactive chemistry. The cold‐pole bias in the GEOS simulations delays the poleward and downward progression of the ASPV and stratosphere‐troposphere coupling in spring by 1–2 months, causing severe underestimation of stratosphere‐troposphere coupling in October–November. Consequently, the simulations poorly capture or completely miss the observed springtime tropospheric predictability from ASPV conditions in late winter/early spring. Compared to the prescribed ozone simulation, interactive ozone exacerbates the cold‐pole bias by overpredicting Antarctic ozone loss, leading to degradation of springtime stratosphere‐troposphere coupling and loss of tropospheric predictability."

However, as a key forcing driver on meteorological changes in downstream eastern China (EC), the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is seldom analyzed in connection with O3 pollution over EC. In the present study, based on the observational O3 and meteorological data over 2015–2021, the role of the TP thermal forcing in shaping the intra‐seasonal oscillation (ISO) of O3 pollution in EC is investigated for the season of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The ISO of O3 pollution during EASM is identified with the maximum daily 8‐hr averaged (MDA8) O3 concentrations in a bimodal pattern in South China (SC), the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), and the North China Plain (NCP), and a unimodal pattern in northeastern China. The first O3 peak in SC, MLYR, and NCP coincides with the northward advance of EASM, whereas the second peak occurs in reverse order with the southward retreat of EASM. The TP thermal forcing with the location and intensity shifts regulates the ISO of O3 pollution through the impact on the advance and retreat of the EASM, which alters the regional cloud cover and downward solar radiation in EC, affecting the O3 production change in the ISO of EASM. The simulation experiments of the global climate model CESM2 further verify the role of TP thermal forcing in shaping the ISO pattern of O3 pollution in EC. This study revealing the TP's modulation on the ISO of O3 pollution in EC provides a new perspective for understanding the environment and climate changes over the downstream region."

However, the source‐resolved contributions to such events, particularly under varying weather patterns, are not well understood. In this study, we apply the GEOS‐Chem adjoint model to quantify the long‐term (2014–2020) sensitivities of PM2.5 and ozone to precursor emissions by chemical species, sector, and region across 88 PM2.5 and 197 ozone heavy pollution episodes in the central Yangtze River Delta (YRDC), eastern China. We find agricultural NH3, residential organic carbon (OC), industrial primary particles, and industrial SO2 were major contributors to heavy PM2.5 pollution, while local industrial aromatics, ≥C4 alkanes, and ≥C3 alkenes were important for ozone. Coordinated NOX emission reductions between regions are essential for mitigating both PM2.5 and ozone heavy pollution. Heavy PM2.5 pollution was highly sensitive to meteorological factors. Strong winds transported PM2.5 from upwind areas with poor air quality into YRDC, elevating the PM2.5 sensitivity to regional emission sources. Using T‐mode principal component analysis with K‐means clustering, we classified the dominant synoptic circulation patterns associated with heavy pollution episodes and assessed emission sensitivities under each regime. Specific emission controls under various synoptic circulations should be tailored for effectively eliminating heavy air pollution. This study advances our knowledge of heavy air pollution formation and provides a scientific basis for designing more targeted and weather‐adaptive mitigation policies to safeguard air quality and public health."

 Lightning plays a crucial role in the Earth’s biogeochemical cycle. Frequent lightning activity over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has been attributed to shipping emissions through aerosol–cloud interactions in modeling studies but lacks observational confirmation. Here, we present observational evidence linking frequent lightning to the response of deep clouds to ship-emitted sulfate aerosols. These aerosols cause higher cloud tops in mid-to-high clouds, smaller cloud droplet sizes at the bases of low clouds, and increased ice water content with smaller ice particles in deep clouds along shipping lanes, resulting in more lightning strikes than in surrounding areas. The 2020 fuel regulation, which reduced SO₂ emissions by 66% over the BoB, led to lower cloud tops, reduced ice water content, larger cloud droplets, and consequently an 11% decline in lightning frequency during the period of 2020–2023 relative to its climatology. Our findings indicate that shipping emissions contribute at least 17% to the lightning frequency in the BoB region. This study provides observational evidence that changes in shipping emissions—particularly those driven by recent regulations—can significantly influence lightning frequency by altering the microphysical properties of deep clouds. It underscores the broader atmospheric impact of maritime policies, extending beyond local radiative effects to influence convective processes and natural hazards."

 Estimation of surface longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCRF) is crucial for understanding cloud-climate interactions but remains challenging due to the complexity of radiative transfer simulations and the difficulty in accuracy evaluation. Using only five readily available parameters: digital elevation model, column water vapor, cloud top temperature, cloud optical thickness, and cloud fraction ratio, this study develops a lightweight algorithm to estimate LWCRF, defined as the contribution of clouds to surface downward longwave radiation. The algorithm achieves a theoretical RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 5.47 W/m2 under rigorous radiative transfer-based testing. When applied to the CERES CRS (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System, Clouds and Radiative Swath) data which is based on pixel-level Langley Fu-Liou radiative transfer simulations, it exhibits an RMSE of 12.03 W/m2 across 812 million global samples, demonstrating strong consistency in spatial patterns. This work provides a practical and efficient alternative when numerous inputs required by radiative transfer model are unavailable. This advancement allows for easy assessment of the impact of clouds on the global radiation balance, thereby advancing the understanding of how much clouds warm or cool the Earth."

 Light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols, comprising black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC), significantly influence air quality and radiative forcing. Unlike traditional approaches that use a fixed value of absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), this study investigated the absorption and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols in Beijing for both local emission and regional transport events during a wintertime pollution event by using improved AAE results that employs wavelength-dependent AAE (WDA). By calculating the difference of BC AAE at different wavelengths using Mie theory and comparing the calculated results to actual measurements from an Aethalometer (AE31), a more accurate absorption coefficient of BrC can be derived. Through the analysis of air mass sources, local emission was found dominated the pollution events during this study, accounting for 81 % of all cases, while regional transport played a minor role. Carbonaceous aerosols exhibited a continuous increasing trend during midday, which may be attributed to the re-entrainment of nighttime-accumulated carbonaceous aerosols to the surface during the early planetary boundary layer (PBL) development phase, as the mixed layer rises, combined with the variation of PBL and anthropogenic activity. At night, variations in the PBL height, in addition to anthropogenic activities, effectively contributed to surface aerosol concentrations, leading to peak surface aerosol values during local pollution episodes. The diurnal variation of AAE470/880 exhibited a decreasing trend, with a total decrease of approximately 12 %. Furthermore, the BrC fraction showed a constant diurnal variation, suggesting that the declining AAE470/880 was primarily influenced by BC, possibly due to enhanced traffic contributions."

 Tibetan Plateau sensible heating (TPSH) effect is recognized as a key driver of the South Asian climate; however its role in regulating the regional dust burdens over South Asia during the pre-monsoon season remains unclear. Using long-term reanalysis and/or observational dust and TPSH data, we show that the dust optical depth at 550 nm (DOD550) over South Asia is significantly positively correlated with TPSH at the interannual scale. DOD550 over South Asia increases (decreases) by 20 % (12 %) in the strongest (weakest) TPSH years. The phenomenon of TPSH-dust relationships is reinforced by sensitivity experiments by altering TPSH from global climate models. Further mechanism analysis reveals that TPSH perturbation induces regional circulation anomalies over South Asia, which features a low-tropospheric cyclonic response around the Tibetan Plateau. This cyclonic anomaly strengthens the prevailing northwesterly winds, increasing regional dust emissions and transportation over South Asia. This novel mechanism helps understand the South Asian dust change."

 Sea-land breezes (SLB), as a typical boundary layer circulation, significantly impact the transportation and diffusion of pollutants in coastal regions. This study utilizes observational data and reanalysis dataset to explore the primary variation trend of tropical and subtropical SLB events and its impact on air pollutant recirculation in recent two decades, as well as the key influencing factors for the variation trend of tropical and subtropical SLB events. Results show that there is a significant increasing trend for the SLB events in most tropical and subtropical regions (63.3 % of stations) over past two decades, in terms of both frequency and intensity. The increasing trend in the SLB events was primarily attributed to a dramatic strengthening of sea breeze rather than land breeze. The combination of the increasing SLB frequency and the strengthening sea breeze significantly weakened air pollutant recirculation (−0.0293 per decade), thereby deteriorating the transportation and diffusion conditions of pollutants in the tropical and subtropical coastal regions over past two decades. In addition, the increase in the frequency of SLB events and the intensification of sea breeze strength are highly correlated with the reduction in strong wind days, the weakening of background winds, and the growing daytime land-sea thermal contrast. Among them, the growing daytime thermal contrast stemmed from a greater rise of temperature near the land surface than that near the sea surface."

Our investigations of these waste facilities, using passive and active airborne remote sensing measurements, confirm these high emission rates with values of up to 13 th−1 during the overflight and show excellent agreement between the two techniques. A large fraction of the emissions is attributed to active landfill sites. 
 Methane (CH4), alongside carbon dioxide (CO2), is a key driver of anthropogenic climate change. Reducing CH4 is crucial for short-term climate mitigation. Waste-related activities, such as landfills, are a major CH4 source, even in developed countries. Atmospheric concentration measurements using remote sensing (RS) offer a powerful way to quantify these emissions. We study waste facilities near Madrid, Spain, where satellite data indicated high CH4 emissions. For the first time, we combine passive imaging (Methane Airborne Mapper 2D – Light, MAMAP2DL) and active lidar (CO2 and CH4 Atmospheric Remote Monitoring – Flugzeug, CHARM-F) remote sensing aboard the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), supported by in situ instruments, to quantify CH4 emissions. Using the CH4 column data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis v5 (ERA5) model wind information validated by airborne measurements, we estimate landfill emissions through a cross-sectional mass balance approach. Strong emission plumes are traced up to 20 km downwind on 4 August 2022, with the highest CH4 column anomalies observed over active landfill areas in the vicinity of Madrid, Spain. Total emissions are estimated to be up to ∼ 13 t h−1. Single co-located plume crossings from both instruments agree well within 1.2 t h−1 (or 13 %). Flux errors range from ∼ 25 % to 40 %, mainly due to boundary layer (BL) and wind speed variability. This case study not only showcases the capabilities of applying a simple but fast cross-sectional mass balance approach, along with its limitations due to challenging atmospheric boundary layer conditions, but also demonstrates, to our knowledge, the first successful use of both active and passive airborne remote sensing to quantify methane emissions from hotspots and independently verify their emissions."

Our results show that the Asian monsoon is mainly controlled by large-scale temperature, whereas the North American monsoon may be more influenced by convective moistening. These differences point to distinct mechanisms shaping moisture transport in the two monsoon systems. 
 Water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere plays a crucial role for climate, affecting radiation, chemistry, and atmospheric dynamics. This study applies a simplified Lagrangian method to reconstruct stratospheric water vapor based on satellite observations from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS) and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The objective is to improve understanding of moisture enhancements in the Asian and North American monsoons and to identify the key factors contributing to reconstruction biases. The performance of Lagrangian reconstructions significantly improves with the size of trajectory ensembles but exhibits a general dry bias. The reconstruction represents the summertime local water vapor maximum well in the Asian monsoon, particularly above the tropopause, but not in the North American monsoon. The main dehydration region diagnosed from trajectories indicates that water vapor in the Asian monsoon is predominantly controlled by local tropopause temperatures. The dry bias in reconstructions below the tropopause over the Asian monsoon shows a positive correlation with convection intensity, particularly in the western part of the monsoon region, suggesting that underestimated moistening from convection may contribute to this bias. Water vapor mixing ratios in the North American monsoon are largely influenced by long-range transport from dehydrated regions over southern Asia and additional local moistening. The limited performance of reconstructions in the North American monsoon is therefore likely linked to underestimation of local convection or uncertainties in long-range transport."

Researchers quantify the heating and cooling effects of this interaction using climate models. However, the use of different historical weather matching methods has produced a large variation in results. Here, we test method variations commonly used today and conclude with new guidelines for achieving the most accurate results. 
 Biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) from African fires may strongly impact Earth’s radiation budget in the southeast Atlantic (SEA), but the sign and magnitude of the overall radiative effect (RE) remain uncertain.  Aerosol–climate models are needed to separately quantify direct, indirect, and semi-direct REs. Here, we evaluate improved simulations with the UK Met Office's Unified Model and explore REs resulting from various methods used to match observed meteorology (nudging or running forecasts reinitialized at different frequencies). REs are calculated as differences in radiative fluxes between simulations with and without smoke emissions and with and without aerosol absorption. All model setups agree on net warming for the SEA dominated by the direct effect. Simulated smoke, clouds, and the direct effect agree better with observations than previous studies using the same model, though biases in aerosol extinction and liquid water path remain. Changes in cloud droplet number concentration due to BBA self-lofting influence how cleanly we can separate cloud effects into semi-direct and indirect effects. Total RE, which remains unaffected, ranges from +3.0 to +7.9 W m−2. The 4.9 W m−2 spread arises mainly from simulated semi-direct effects. Forecasts three days long or less probably do not allow time for plausible differences in boundary layer properties due to semi-direct effects to accumulate. Free running simulations with and without smoke accumulate differences in meteorology that are likely spurious “butterfly effects”. We recommend future research quantifying BBA REs over weeks to months to use meteorological forcing techniques that allow aerosol absorption to affect the boundary layer."

The findings refine the fundamental understanding of stratospheric ozone intrusion and its contribution to surface ozone pollution in China. 
 Understanding stratospheric intrusion (SI) is crucial for elucidating atmospheric complexities and improving strategies to mitigate surface ozone (O3) pollution. This study investigates a deep trough-induced SI event in China from 10 to 13 June 2013, based on ozonesondes from Beijing, Changchun, and Hong Kong, and validated O3 reanalysis products. Ozonesondes from Beijing indicated notable upper-level secondary O3 peaks (> 400 ppbv) since 11 June. Tropospheric sub-high O3 layers were observed in Changchun on 12 June (> 120 ppbv) and Hong Kong on 13 June (> 80 ppbv). Nationwide surface measurements recorded severe O3 pollution (> 100 ppbv) from western plateaus to eastern plains over China. Together, these observations suggest a widespread influence of stratospheric O3 intrusion. Further, the ozonesonde-validated EAC4 reanalysis reproduced the fine-scale SI structure (O3-rich “tongue”), in turn well explaining the secondary O3 peaks and sub-high O3 layers in ozonesonde observations. The O3-rich “tongue” swept through the Tibetan Plateau on 10 June, triggering extreme O3 pollution with a stratospheric contribution up to 30 ppbv (> 30 %). With the trough's eastward movement, the O3-rich “tongue” penetrated into the lower troposphere of eastern China, and then entrained into the surface layer, exacerbating surface O3 pollution occurred in eastern China on 13 June, with a stratospheric O3 contribution of 3–15 ppbv (2 %–10 %).

 Ammonia (NH3) is a key precursor of PM2.5, contributing to the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols and playing a crucial role in haze events. However, current bottom-up emission inventories in China often underestimate NH3 emissions, particularly with significant uncertainties in urban areas. This study developed a “top-down” iterative algorithm that integrates the IASI satellite observations with the WRF-Chem model to optimize bottom-up NH3 emissions, and further quantified the impacts of source-specific emission reductions on PM2.5 pollution. The result reveals that the updated NH3 emissions in Eastern China for 2016 amounted to 4.2 Tg yr−1, 27.3 % higher than prior estimations. The optimized NH3 emissions peak in summer at 463.1 Gg month−1, with agricultural sources accounting for 85 %, while winter emissions drop to 217 Gg month−1 when the contribution from non-agricultural sources (e.g., industry, vehicle) significantly increases. The optimized NH3 emission significantly improved the simulation of both total column and surface NH3 concentrations, with improvements in magnitude (31 %–42 %) and variations (17 %–55 %). Sensitivity simulations show that a 30 %–60 % reduction in NH3 emission led to decreases of 1.5–8.8 µg m−3 in city-level PM2.5 concentrations and the potential effect of reducing non-agricultural emissions is comparable with that from agricultural sources. Furthermore, the NH3 reduction positively impacts public health, resulting in a 6.5 %–10.3 % decrease in premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 exposure. Our study evaluated NH3 emissions from various sources in Eastern China, emphasizing the impact of reducing non-agricultural ammonia emissions on air quality and public health benefits."

Petrakis;Vassilis Amiridis,Atmospheric dust and air quality over large-cities and megacities of the world,"Based on Earth observations of dust the study addresses the questions: To what extent have the fine and coarse modes of atmospheric dust within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) changed over major cities worldwide? Which areas experience fine-mode and coarse-mode dust mass concentrations within the PBL that exceed World Health Organization air quality guidelines, and which areas are projected to exceed these guidelines in the near future? Can we quantify associated impacts on human health? 
 According to the United Nations (UN) more than 55 % of the global population resided in urban areas in 2018, a number projected to increase to an estimated 60 % of the world's population by 2030. As urbanization accelerates, degradation of air quality becomes an increasing environmental pressure to human welfare and health. To date, epidemiological studies reveal a strong connection between airborne dust and adverse health effects. This study investigates the fine-mode and coarse-mode dust particulate matter levels within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over major cities and megacities of the world (population > 5 million), leveraging on the European Space Agency (ESA) – “LIdar climatology of Vertical Aerosol Structure” (LIVAS) multiyear satellite-based dust climate data record. Results show that current dust levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) annual-mean air quality guidelines (AQGs) for PM2.5 and PM10 in 49.4 % and 87.7 % of the cities considered, respectively, exposing ∼ 700 million people to hazardous dust concentrations. Moreover, according to the outcomes of the study, this number is expected to increase to ∼ 850 million individuals (∼ 22 % increase) by 2030s, though due to the general declining dust tendencies the health hazard is projected to be diminished in severity. Particularly affected are cities in the regions of Middle East, Indian subcontinent, East Asia, North Africa, and the Sahel. Epidemiological models are employed to estimate associated health risks. The study provides an informative mitigation and adaptation tool to support observational-based policymaking, air quality management, and public health planning to protect human health in the context of accelerating urbanization."

Moritz Menken;Thomas Birner,Adiabatic versus diabatic transport contributions to the ozone budget in the northern hemispheric upper troposphere and lower stratosphere,"We study ozone transport in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere using potential temperature as vertical coordinate, thereby distinguishing adiabatic and diabatic processes. We find that on top of known dominant transport processes (quasi-horizontal mixing, slow diabatic descent) vertical mixing plays an important role near the tropopause. Our findings are relevant for understanding ozone's role in climate including its imprint on tropospheric ozone via stratosphere-troposphere air exchange. 
 Ozone in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere (LMS) is important for the local radiative balance and contributes to the tropospheric and near-surface ozone burden via stratosphere–troposphere exchange. Here, we aim to deepen our understanding of the transport contributions to LMS ozone in the Northern Hemisphere by studying the ozone budget in isentropic coordinates, which allows for a clean distinction of adiabatic and diabatic transport contributions. This is done by analyzing 20 years of ERA5 reanalysis output on model levels and a free-running simulation using the EMAC chemistry–climate model. Our analysis confirms that the ozone tendencies in the extratropical LMS at high latitudes are dominated by diabatic mean flow advection (associated with downwelling within the Brewer–Dobson circulation) and quasi-horizontal adiabatic eddy mixing due to planetary- and medium-scale Rossby waves. These transport contributions are somewhat weaker during summer compared to winter, although seasonality is found to be weaker in the LMS compared to higher altitudes. Horizontal mean flow advection is found to be relevant near the tropopause and just above the subtropical jet core. Notably, vertical (i.e., diabatic) eddy ozone transport is found to be important near the tropopause. While the adiabatic eddy ozone fluxes in the LMS are consistent with diffusive, down-gradient eddy transport, the vertical eddy ozone transport also features up-gradient regions, which by itself would act to reinforce the background ozone gradients near the tropopause. Closer analysis reveals that this is due to long-wave radiative damping of planetary waves, which acts to dampen the down-gradient horizontal eddy transport."

During the storm on 4 November 2021, the mesospheric metal layer depletion was recorded by three lidars for different metal components at mid-latitudes. The storm induced oxygen density enhancement is considered to consume more metal atoms in the metal layer. It implies that the effects of storm have reached mesosphere, and the influence of storm on metal layer is achieved through chemical processes. 
 Metal layer forms as a result of meteoric ablation and exist as a layer of metal elements between approximately 80 and 105 km altitude, and it provides information about the physics and chemistry of the boundary between the atmosphere and space. There are some studies about the wind field disturbances in Mesosphere and Low Thermosphere (MLT) region and the plasma variations in ionospheric E-region during magnetic storms, but no study on the impact of storms on the metal atom layers in mesosphere. During the super substorm on 4 November 2021, the atmospheric metal layers were observed to decrease by observations from three lidars at the mid-latitudes of China. The Na, Ca and Ni densities on the storm day were significantly lower than in other days in October and November. The O/N2 column density ratio observed by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) on the storm day was much higher than on quiet days, and the numerical simulation results demonstrate a substantial increase in atomic oxygen density at the heights of the metal layer. The increase in oxygen density may lead to the formation of more metal compounds, thus more metal atoms are consumed. This is an interesting phenomenon that magnetic storm can perturb the atmospheric metal layer through chemical reactions."

Kumjian;Mariko Oue;Pavlos Kollias,Detection of multi-modal Doppler spectra – Part 1: Establishing characteristic signals in radar moment data,"Doppler spectral data inform on how particles of varying vertical velocities contribute to total backscattered power observed. Through examining three case studies, consistent features in radar moment data were found to be characteristic of multi-modal spectra. We quantified how spectrum width and mean Doppler velocity can be used to determine whether or not a layer is multi-modal. The identification criteria and methods are described in Part 1 and assessed in Part 2. 
 Vertically pointing millimeter-wavelength radars provide a wealth of information about cloud and precipitation particle properties. Doppler spectral data can inform on how particles of varying vertical velocities contribute to the total backscattered power observed. It is more computationally cost effective to process moment data instead of spectra data, but doing so leaves valuable information on the cutting room floor. To confidently identify a multi-modal spectra event, in which two or more modes are present within a layer, Doppler spectral data are essential. This means long-term identification of layers featuring multi-modal spectra can be cost prohibitive. To address this, we explore three multi-modal spectra cases from winter precipitation events to determine characteristic signatures of these layers in the moment data averaged over short time periods (∼ 145 s) and explore how these layers differ from the rest of the vertical profiles. We find that the mean spectrum width and the standard deviation of mean Doppler velocity can be used to determine whether or not a layer is multi-modal. In particular, multi-modal layers in mixed-phase and ice clouds feature larger mean spectrum width (exceeding 0.17 m s−1) and smaller standard deviation of the mean Doppler velocity (below 0.1 m s−1). In Part 1 of this study, the identification criteria and methods are described. In Part 2 (Wugofski and Kumjian, 2025), we perform a verification of the method for three years of vertically pointing radar data, and explore the meteorological conditions associated with identified multi-modal spectral events."

Lee,Mitigating impacts of low energy laser pulses on CALIOP data products,"The spaceborne atmospheric lidar CALIOP experienced an increasing number of intermittent low energy laser pulses in the final seven years of the 17-year long CALIPSO mission. Low energy pulses degraded the quality of retrievals in affected profiles. This paper describes low energy mitigation (LEM) algorithms that remove affected data and minimize data loss. LEM is demonstrated to correct calibration biases, reduce false feature detections, and restore the integrity of the CALIOP data record. 
 The spaceborne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) experienced an increasing number of intermittent low energy laser pulses in the final 7 years of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Observations (CALIPSO) mission due to coronal arcing within the laser canister as internal pressure levels decreased. Degraded data quality was initially observed primarily over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region, with impacts eventually spreading globally at lower rates. To preserve the integrity of the CALIOP data record, a suite of low energy mitigation (LEM) procedures was developed to reject data that is substantially impacted by low energy pulses on small, targeted scales to minimize data loss. LEM corrects level 1B calibration biases of −3 % to −4 % and reduces calibration uncertainties by 20 %–40 % at SAA-latitudes (0–50° S) for the 532 nm daytime and 1064 nm channels. LEM rejection in level 2 processing substantially reduces the occurrence of false feature detections. Horizontally averaged data segments that are LEM-affected (i.e., some low energy shots are present, but LEM determines the filtered profile is still acceptable) experience a signal-to-noise ratio reduction of 6 %–9 % which increases the probability of false detections, though this is mitigated somewhat by a slight increase in feature detection thresholds. Features identified in LEM-affected data are similar to unaffected features in terms of measured layer-averaged properties that are important for classification and subtyping. Overall, this evidence suggests that LEM has eliminated the major impacts of low energy pulses on data quality. LEM procedures were implemented in the version 4.51 level 1B data release and are implemented in all data levels of the final version 5 CALIOP data release."

These aerosols are of interest to atmospheric science as they have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. ALI has the ability to measure the polarization of atmospheric light over a wide spectral range, which is a novel ability for the measurement ALI uses. We demonstrate and discuss ALI capability and how the polarized information may improve aerosol information for this type of measurement. 
 The Aerosol Limb Imager (ALI) is designed to measure stratospheric aerosol by imaging limb-scattered sunlight. Each image taken by ALI is spectrally filtered at a tunable wavelength and refined to consist of either horizontally or vertically polarized light. Novel to limb imaging, these polarized observations of ALI provide a means to isolate tangent altitudes which have signal contaminated by clouds as identified by the depolarization of the scattered radiance. This avoids the ambiguity caused by clouds to be interpreted as aerosol in a retrieval. We present a polarized aerosol retrieval methodology which retrieves vertically resolved aerosol number density and median radius of a unimodal log-normal distribution, in addition to a scalar (uniform in altitude) width of the log-normal distribution. We explore the cloud discrimination and aerosol retrieval of ALI in simulation as validation of the efficacy and the limits to the technique. We then apply the retrieval to three example sets of observations taken from the most recent high-altitude balloon flight of ALI. One set provides a nominal exemplar, while the other two represent more difficult retrieval conditions of an increasingly polarized atmosphere. We compare the aerosol extinction of ALI in all three exemplar cases to the best coincident extinctions of three space based instruments: the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III/ISS), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP), and the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS). We provide discussion on the agreement of all three cases against the comparison instruments with respect to the efficacy of our approach. However, we find the retrieved aerosol extinction of ALI in the nominal case (considering the limitations of ballooning) is in good agreement (a median absolute percent difference < 29 %) to the extinction reported by SAGE III/ISS, OMPS-LP, and OSIRIS while also yielding aerosol particle size information. In the case of SAGE III/ISS, the comparison with ALI results is extended into the aerosol size parameters. In a nominal case SAGE III/ISS and ALI aerosol effective radius agree within uncertainty for the majority of altitudes."

 Long-term and high-precision measurements of the mole fraction of greenhouse gases (GHG), together with their isotopic composition, are of fundamental importance to understand land–atmosphere interactions. Current flask monitoring programs have important information gaps in large regions of the Earth, particularly in the southern hemisphere and in continental tropical regions. Here, we report on the initiation of a monitoring program and the resulting dataset of high-precision GHG measurements at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), located in the central Amazon region of Brazil. In September 2021, we installed an automated flask sampler designed and built by the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to collect air samples in 3 L flasks at a height of 324 m above ground level (ma.g.l.).  Samples are collected weekly, during a one-hour integration time between 13:00 and 14:00 h LT (17:00–18:00 UTC). The flasks are shipped to Jena, Germany, for analyses of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, H2, SF6, δ13C−CO2, Δ14C−CO2, δ18O−CO2, δ13C−CH4, δ2H−CH4, O2/N2, and Ar/N2 at the laboratories of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC).  Measurements from this monitoring program provide reference information for this site and act as an additional independent quality control for other measurements in the region.  The record of SF6 and simulations based on a regional atmospheric transport model suggest that the footprint of the measurements is predominantly from the southeasterly and northeasterly directions.  The time series of the different gas species measured in this monitoring program are being made publicly available through the ATTO data portal (https://doi.org/10.17871/ATTO.574.13.2365, Sierra et al., 2025)."

This data‐driven approach effectively characterizes the time‐variant and complex multivariate relationships, thereby nonlinearly projecting the innovation onto the ensemble subspace. This significant improvement enables the ML‐based approach to increase the analysis accuracy for extreme phenomena by up to 66% over EnKF, and its ensemble increment distribution is well‐aligned with that of the target increments, showing the potential of data‐driven assimilation approach for advancing the capabilities of capturing and triggering the extreme events."

 Methane is a potent but short-lived greenhouse gas and rapid reductions of its anthropogenic emissions could help decrease near-term warming1. Solid waste emits methane through the decay of organic material, which amounts to about 10% of total anthropogenic methane emissions2. Satellite instruments3 enable monitoring of strong methane hotspots4, including many strongly emitting urban areas that include solid waste disposal sites as most prominent sources5. Here we present a survey of methane emissions from 151 individual waste disposal sites across six continents using high-resolution satellite observations that can detect localized methane emissions above 100 kg h–1. Within this dataset, we find that our satellite-based estimates generally show no correlation with reported or modelled emission estimates at facility scale. This reveals major uncertainties in the current understanding of methane emissions from waste disposal sites, warranting further investigations to reconcile bottom-up and top-down approaches. We also observe that managed landfills show lower emission per area than dumping sites, and that detected emission sources often align with the open non-covered parts of the facility where waste is added.

10.1038/s41612-025-01167-w,True,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science,该研究论文关注于提高识别吸收性气溶胶类型及其辐射影响的准确性。它提出了一种新的分类方法，该方法利用气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）和单次散射反照率（SSA）的光谱特征来区分不同的吸收性气溶胶，从而显著减少了未识别气溶胶的比例。研究结果表明，在全球范围内，黑碳（BC）及其相关的吸收性类型占主导地位，而沙尘和混合沙尘则贡献了剩余部分。该研究强调了改进的气溶胶类型分类方法在气候建模、卫星反演和气溶胶监测应用中的潜力，并有助于减少气溶胶辐射和气候影响的不确定性。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['aerosol radiative forcing', 'absorbing aerosol types', 'aerosol optical depth (AOD)', 'single scattering albedo (SSA)', 'black carbon (BC)', 'Dust', 'Mixed-Dust', 'climate modeling', 'satellite retrieval', 'aerosol-monitoring applications']",Kamran Ansari;S. Ramachandran,Enhancing accuracy in identifying absorbing aerosol types and their radiative impacts,"Enhancing accuracy in identifying absorbing aerosol types and their radiative impacts 
 Aerosol radiative forcing is highly uncertain due to an imprecise quantification of absorbing aerosol type which is most critical. Lack of accurate measurements and characterization of aerosol absorption results in this aerosol parameter being poorly constrained and highly underestimated in climate models. In the methods used earlier to classify aerosol absorption a large fraction remained unidentified. A new classification method, that overcomes these limitations, is developed by leveraging the spectral characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) of different absorbing aerosols, which remarkably reduces the contribution of unidentified aerosol type to almost nil globally, demonstrating the robustness and enhanced accuracy of this new method. On a global scale, black carbon (BC) and the associated absorbing types dominate contributing >70% annually, Dust and Mixed-Dust contributing the rest. The absorbing aerosol types exhibit quite distinct spatial and seasonal variations. This improved and innovative classification of absorbing aerosol types offers significant potential for advancing research in climate modeling, satellite retrieval, and aerosol-monitoring applications, and will be key to reduce the uncertainty in radiative and climate impact of aerosols."

 The light scattering properties of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were investigated in a megacity on the North China Plain during periods of substantial PM2.5 variation. The results revealed a non-linear reduction in the scattering efficient (σsp) relative to decreases in PM2.5 concentrations. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was the primary contributor to σsp, accounting for 34.7 %–43.3 % at both high and low PM2.5 levels. However, primary organic aerosol (POA) became the largest contributor to σsp (31.5 %) at medium PM2.5 levels, with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) rising sharply by 13.9 %, collectively sustaining σsp and limiting its reduction. The scattering Ångström exponent (SAE) decreased from 2.1 ± 0.9 (high PM2.5 levels) by 31.1 %–50.5 % at medium and low levels, indicating a shift towards larger particle sizes as pollution levels declined. Strong negative correlations between SAE and the organic carbon/elemental carbon (OC/EC) ratio (r = −0.193, p < 0.01) at medium PM2.5 levels, as well as the mass scattering efficient (MSE) (r = −0.656, p < 0.01), testified the critical role of SOA formation in enhancing particle size and σsp under improved air quality conditions. Regression models based solely on aerosol components underestimated σsp, likely due to the exclusion of particle growth and SOA formation. Incorporating POA, SOA and SAE into σsp calculations significantly improved predictive accuracy by 7 %–21 %. These findings demonstrate that enhanced SOA formation and particle size growth increase MSE and effectively counteract reductions in σsp despite declining PM2.5 levels, thereby further hindering improvements in atmospheric visibility."

This study showed that ocean ventilation and terrestrial inputs jointly controlled VCHCs levels in the Western Pacific, with the region acting as a source for some VCHCs but a sink for carbon tetrachloride. These findings highlighted the ocean's regulatory role and provided essential data to refine global VCHCs' budget estimates. 
 Volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (VCHCs), key ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases, depend on oceanic emission and uptake for their atmospheric budget. However, data on VCHCs in the Western Pacific remain limited. This study investigated the distribution and sources of VCHCs (CHCl3, C2HCl3, CCl4, and CH3CCl3) in the Western Pacific during 2019-2020. Elevated seawater concentrations of CHCl3 and C2HCl3 in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension were driven by mesoscale eddies, enhancing primary productivity, while CCl4 and CH3CCl3 concentrations were mainly influenced by atmospheric inputs. Atmospheric concentrations of VCHCs decreased from coastal to open ocean areas, with terrestrial air masses contributing significantly. Additionally, positive saturation anomalies and correlations with chlorophyll a indicated the marine biological source for atmospheric CHCl3 and C2HCl3. However, the atmospheric concentration variability of these gases was not fully consistent with oceanic emissions indicators (saturation anomalies and sea–air fluxes) and showed strong correlations with terrestrial tracers, indicating that land-derived atmospheric transport primarily influenced atmospheric CHCl3 and C2HCl3. The estimated sea–air flux indicated that the Western Pacific acted as a source for CHCl3 and C2HCl3 but a sink for CCl4 and CH3CCl3, with the potential to absorb 14.3 ± 6.8 % of CCl4 emissions from Eastern China, 5.6 ± 2.5 % from Eastern Asia, and 2.1 ± 1.1 % of global emissions. Additionally, this region accounted for 6.3 ± 2.8 % of the global oceanic absorption of CCl4. These findings underscore the Western Pacific's key role in regulating atmospheric CCl4 concentrations and mitigating its accumulation in Eastern Asia, providing essential data for global VCHCs emission and uptake estimates."

Andreae;Ulrich Pöschl;Christopher Pöhlker;Paulo Artaxo,Distinct aerosol populations and their vertical gradients in central Amazonia revealed by optical properties and cluster analysis,"This study highlights the different aerosol populations that are commonly observed in the central Amazon. Vertical gradients of aerosol optical and chemical properties were evaluated on different atmospheric conditions, and showed distinct characteristics of these particles. Intercontinental transport events bring to the region particles with a contrasting chemical composition, while vertical transport processes influence the aerosol properties by promoting the development of coating and aging. 
 In central Amazonia, aerosol sources, weather, and chemical processes create a highly variable aerosol population. The aerosols' optical properties, shaped by composition and size, determine sunlight interaction and the regional radiation budget. Previous studies observed differences in the particles' physical properties during smoke events and described their vertical gradients during clean periods. However, a complete characterization of these properties at two height levels considering both seasons is still missing. This study connects aerosol optical measurements from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), at 60 and 325 m heights, to particle composition and sources, characterizing different aerosol populations, assessing their vertical gradients, and associating them with the influence of various emission sources and atmospheric processes. A seasonally segregated clustering method was applied to five years of optical data (2018–2023), allowing for the identification of periods with low biomass-burning impact, long-range transport (LRT) events, and regional pollution episodes. Aerosols from Saharan dust events showed the highest real and imaginary refractive index, along with a large inorganic mass fraction (around 26 %), which differs from typical Amazonian conditions. Furthermore, regional biomass-burning emissions during the dry season promoted elevated fine-mode particle concentrations (median 2250 cm−3), dominated by absorbing carbonaceous material. These particles also showed the maximum mass scattering efficiency, which was consistently higher at the 60 m height, underscoring the importance of vertical transport and aerosol aging processes. These results indicate that the clustering method can discriminate between aerosol populations and elucidate differences between particles of different sources and processes influencing the Amazonian atmosphere."

Ryerson;Chelsea R. Thompson;Jeff Peischl;Róisín Commane;Bruce Daube;Ilann Bourgeois;Jos Lelieveld;Horst Fischer,Enhancement of O3–CO ratios at tropospheric subtropical latitudes: Photochemistry and stratospheric influence,"This study investigates the role of lightning emissions on the O3–CO ratio in the northern subtropics. We used in situ observations and a global circulation model to show an effect of up to 40 % onto the subtropical O3–CO ratio by tropical air masses transported via the Hadley cell. This influence of lightning emissions and its photochemistry has a global effect on trace and greenhouse gases and needs to be considered for global chemical distributions. 
 The subtropics are influenced by stratosphere-troposphere exchange processes through the subtropical jet streams and tropopause folding events, which are commonly identified by the opposing gradients of ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) and thus their ratio. Here, we used airborne observations of CO and O3, as well as the global three-dimensional ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, to investigate whether there is another important mechanism that conditions the subtropics. We show that high O3–CO ratios extend deeply into the troposphere in the subtropics, which is evident in both in situ observations and model results. Tropospheric photochemistry leads to similar O3–CO ratios as those for stratospheric air diluted into the troposphere. In the upper tropical troposphere, frequent deep convective events produce lightning that leads to high concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO+NO2), which drive O3 production and which further catalyze the recycling of hydroxyl (OH) radicals, which reduces CO. These lightning-affected air masses can be transported from the tropics into the subtropics via the Hadley circulation. We have excluded NO production through lightning in a sensitivity run of the EMAC model and see an annual relative reduction of the O3–CO ratio of up to almost 50 % in the tropics and up to 40 % in the northern subtropics, with even larger seasonal variability and major effects on the vertical profiles of O3 and CO. We therefore show that photochemistry is an additional key factor alongside stratosphere-troposphere mixing in determining O3-rich and CO-poor air masses in the troposphere."

Szelag;Jan Maik Wissing,Thermospheric nitric oxide is modulated by the ratio of atomic to molecular oxygen and thermospheric dynamics during solar minimum,"Nitric oxide in the upper atmosphere varies with solar activity. Observations show that this starts a chain of processes affecting the ozone layer and climate system. This is often underestimated in models. We compare five models which show large differences in simulated NO. Analysis of these discrepancies identify two processes which interact with each other: the balance between atomic and molecular oxygen in the thermosphere, and a poleward - downward transport in the winter thermosphere. 
 The formation of nitric oxide (NO) by geomagnetic activity and EUV photoionization in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and its subsequent impact on ozone, contributes to the natural forcing of the climate system, and has been recommended to be included in chemistry-climate model experiments since CMIP6. We compare NO concentrations in the mesosphere and thermosphere simulated by five high-top chemistry-climate models  – WACCM-X, EMAC, HAMMONIA, WACCM-D and KASIMA – with satellite observations during a period of low geomagnetic and solar forcing in January 2010. We find disagreements ranging from several orders of magnitude in the high-latitude winter lower thermosphere to about one order of magnitude in the low-latitude thermosphere. Possible reasons for this are explored by analyzing formation and loss reactions of NO at 12:00 UT on 9 January 2010. Two processes that interact with each other are identified as likely sources of these discrepancies, quenching of N(2D) by atomic oxygen in the mid-thermosphere, and meridional transport and mixing from the mid-thermosphere to the lower thermosphere. In the mid-thermosphere, the amount of atomic oxygen available from dissociation of molecular oxygen balances N(4S) and N(2D) via quenching of N(2D). N(4S) can then be transported or mixed into the lower thermosphere, where it efficiently destroys NO, leading to lower values of NO there. In winter, downward and poleward transport of N(4S) from the low and mid-latitude middle thermosphere into the high-latitude lower thermosphere modulates the NO lifetime. This transport is affected by gravity waves, and therefore depends on each models' gravity wave drag scheme and their resolved gravity wave spectra."

We identified different types of small but important measurement error inherent to the instruments. Understanding these issues helps improve data quality and supports better short-term weather forecasts using sensor networks across Europe. 
 To enhance observations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the European Meteorological Network (EUMETNET), and the Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS) are currently collaborating to establish networks of microwave radiometers (MWRs). MWRs can be used to derive thermodynamic profiles within the ABL. Understanding and assessing instrument uncertainties of state-of-the-art MWRs are therefore crucial for accurate observations and also data assimilation purposes. Some national weather services are currently exploring the potential of MWR networks to improve short-term weather forecasts. In this paper, we discuss uncertainties inherent to the MWR instrument itself, namely (1) radiometric noise, (2) long-term drifts and jumps, (3) calibration repeatability, (4) biases/systematic differences between instruments, and (5) radome degradation. These uncertainties are expressed in brightness temperatures. For state-of-the-art MWRs (here, the Generation 5 Humidity and Temperature Profiler, HATPRO-Gen5), radiometric noise at ambient temperatures is a maximum of 0.32 K in the V-band but usually lower, especially near cold load temperature ranges in the K-band (≤0.11 K). Long-term drifts or jumps between calibrations, which are at least 2 months apart, are usually below 0.4 K in the K-band and 1.0 K in the V-band but can also be higher. Drifts do not follow a discernable timely pattern and are therefore not easily quantifiable in a meaningful way. Calibrating at least every 6 months is thus advised. Calibration repeatability is shown to be well under 0.16 K. Mean brightness temperature differences between two HATPRO-Gen5 instruments are shown to be as high as 0.15 K in the K-band and 0.58 K in the V-band in the zenith viewing direction. The radome has significantly degraded due to weathering and needs to be replaced if, 10 min after a rain event, residual water on its surface still causes a temperature deviation of more than 2 K, compared with a dry radome."

In this study, we address this ambiguity by introducing a physically constrained classification framework that applies advanced computer vision techniques to CloudSat‐CALIPSO observations. By tracking the complete physical evolution of cloud systems from their convective origins, this method enables a robust global separation of anvil and in situ cirrus. Our results illuminate stark contrasts in their macro‐ and micro‐properties, governed by fundamentally different mechanisms. Anvil cirrus extent is tightly coupled to dynamic factors, whereas in situ cirrus, while linked to local tropopause thermodynamics, exhibits strong modulation by remote atmospheric influences from the opposite hemisphere. This identified linkage shows a previously unrecognized interhemispheric teleconnection: wherein large‐scale deep convective systems in one hemisphere rapidly influence in situ cirrus formation in the other. We hypothesize that this coupling is mediated by planetary‐scale waves—likely fast‐propagating Kelvin waves that transmit energy across the equator, cooling the remote tropical tropopause layer, with subsequent interactions with the subtropical jet fostering mid‐latitude in situ development. This newly quantified atmospheric coupling provides a pathway for improving representation of cirrus in climate models and suggests a mechanism by which regional shifts in convection under global warming could reshape global cirrus distributions and their radiative impact."

Auroral resonance scattering of an N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ 1NG (0, 1) (427.8 nm) emission starts to increase from the east, and then the increase of this resonance scattering emission extends to the magnetic zenith. The volume emission rate is evaluated from the rise in resonance scattering emission (time derivative of emission intensity). The volume emission rate of N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ (427.8 nm) reaches its maximum when the sunlight shadow height reaches 200 km, although the GLOW model predicted a peak altitude of N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ (427.8 nm) of 120 km. The higher altitude of the resonance scattering emission peak observed with HySCAI supports the idea that N2+ ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}^{+}$ is produced by the charge exchange between N2 ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ and O+ ${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$ existing at high altitudes.

Surface pollutants such as CO are transported upward and trapped in the anticyclone during this unique atmospheric phenomenon. Associated with the anticyclone is a layer of enhanced aerosols located near the tropopause often referred to as the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL). The chemical and physical properties of aerosols in the ATAL are not yet fully understood as direct observations of the aerosols are limited. The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) is a satellite mission that provides high‐resolution infrared observations of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols. ACE observes chemical isolation in the anticyclone and identifies three main types of aerosols in the ATAL: solid ammonium nitrate (AN), sulfate aerosols, and ice. ACE observes four main features in the spectrum of AN; the previously known 831 cm−1 feature and the first‐ever identification of the spectral bands at 1,390–1,450 cm−1, 3,080 cm−1, and 3,220 cm−1.

In rare circumstances, ACE observes aerosols similar to AN far outside of the monsoon region. In these aerosols the 3,080 cm−1 and 3,220 cm−1 features align well with AN observed in the ATAL. The 831 cm−1 feature is suppressed and shifted to 829 cm−1, suggesting that AN aerosols outside the ATAL are liquid, or potentially an alternative phase of AN."

In contrast, frequent wintertime plumes of CFC‐113 and CFC‐13, often accompanied by HFC‐23, revealed unresolved emissions linked to fluoropolymer and HCFC‐134a manufacture; tracer inversions yield 2.4 ± 0.7 Gg yr−1 of CFC‐113 and 0.07 ± 0.04 Gg yr−1 of CFC‐13, together representing ∼31% of current global totals. Summer heat triggered large enhancements of HCFC‐22, HCFC‐141b, and R‐410A components HFC‐32 and HFC‐125, by up to twofold relative to winter, implicating leaking during room air‐conditioning and refrigeration equipment operation/servicing. Tracer‐ratio inversions reveal that HFC‐32 and HFC‐125 emissions from southeastern China amounted to 39 ± 8 Tg yr−1 CO2‐equivalent. These observations demonstrate that dense urban monitoring can detect clandestine by‐product release, and expanding similar high‐frequency networks cross China's industrial corridors would enable targeted mitigation of most climate‐ and ozone‐relevant emissions from rapidly growing megacities. Strengthened HFC quota enforcement, accelerated adoption of lower‐GWP refrigerants, improved bank management and destruction, and tighter by‐product emission controls are critical to align China's emissions with the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment."

Barbosa,Diurnal Cycle and Seasonality of Cirrus Clouds Over the Amazon From a Seven‐Year Ground‐Based Lidar Record,"Cirrus clouds strongly influence Earth's radiation balance, yet their optical properties and formation pathways add uncertainty to climate models. Satellites offer a global view of cirrus but have key limitations: passive sensors struggle to detect thin layers, and active instruments in polar orbits miss the diurnal cycle. Long‐term records of ground‐based lidar measurements can help fill this important observational gap. Here, we analyzed 5481h $5\,481\,\mathrm{h}$ of lidar data gathered near Manaus, Brazil (July 2011–December 2017), to characterize the cirrus clouds over the Amazon rainforest. An automated routine set cloud boundaries, and multiple‐scattering‐corrected retrievals yielded cloud optical depth (COD) and the lidar ratio. Cirrus were found to occur with a frequency of 73.1%. Thin layers (COD=0.03 $\text{COD}=0.03$‐0.30) are the most prevalent with a 48.4% relative frequency, followed by opaque (>0.30 ${ >} 0.30$; 26.4%) and subvisual (<0.03 ${< } 0.03$; 25.2%). The mean base and top altitudes were 12.8±2.2km $12.8\pm 2.2\,\text{km}$ and 14.4±1.9km $14.4\pm 1.9\,\text{km}$, and the lidar ratio averaged 26.1±8.3sr $26.1\pm 8.3\,\text{sr}$. Thinner clouds clustered near the tropopause, while higher tops tracked the tropopause variability. A clear diurnal cycle shows a noon minimum frequency of occurrence and a late‐afternoon maximum, strongest for opaque cirrus and consistent with convective‐anvil outflow. Optical properties such as COD, lidar ratio, and geometric properties follow a well‐defined daily rhythm. Seasonally, cirrus are more frequent in the wet season (81.8%) than in the dry (56.7%). Bases, tops, and thickness are likewise larger in the wet season, whereas lidar ratios peak in the dry season. This long‐term record benchmarks satellite retrievals, sharpens radiative impact calculations, and clarifies cirrus formation over tropical forests."

Development of Algorithm Theoretical Basis,"This paper presents the first part of a two‐part study to develop a new algorithm to retrieve the aerosol vertical extinction profile using the hyperspectral measurements at ultraviolet bands, O2 A‐band and B‐band, from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We represent the aerosol vertical profile by the weighted sum of 3–5 most important EOFs (empirical orthogonal function, i.e., eigenvectors) from the principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15‐year record of aerosol extinction profiles from spaceborne lidar Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Hence, the retrieval is simplified to derive 3–5 coefficients or weights of corresponding EOFs to capture the variation of aerosol vertical profiles. A new PCA module was developed in the Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL‐VRTM) for calculating the Jacobians of top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) reflectance with respect to the weights of EOFs, which is used to facilitate the optimal inversion of the EOF weights. The analytical Jacobian calculations are validated against the Jacobians computed from a finite difference method. The averaging kernel analysis for directly retrieving the aerosol extinction profiles from measurements of TROPOMI and high‐resolution metagrating spectropolarimeter for aerosol profiling was provided. Finally, the retrieval experiments with synthetic TROPOMI measurements generated by UNL‐VRTM were conducted to verify the self‐consistency and feasibility of the inversion algorithm on a theoretical basis."

Smith;Aurélien Podglajen;Cameron R. Homeyer,Atmospheric Turbulence in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere From Airborne Observations During the DCOTSS Field Campaign,"Turbulence in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) plays an important role in total energy dissipation and in the transport and mixing of heat, momentum, and atmospheric constituents while also posing significant hazards to aviation. In this study, we leverage high‐altitude in situ observations from the NASA Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) field campaign—including data acquired near convection and at altitudes rarely covered by commercial aircraft—to investigate turbulence and its potential link to UTLS composition. We find that strong turbulence occurs frequently within 2 km above the tropopause, which corresponds to 1–2 km above deep convective cloud tops, particularly within moist convective plumes characterized by enhanced water vapor. The occurrence of strong turbulence increases with proximity to convection with elevated frequencies persisting out to 100 km from convective cores. In particular, enhanced turbulence potential occurs near UTLS convective outflows, which is supported by favorable environmental factors such as strong vertical wind shear, flow deformation, and large divergence tendencies. Furthermore, although turbulence intensity and water vapor are generally weakly correlated, positive correlations occur more frequently near the tropopause and under strong vertical wind shear, suggesting that turbulent mixing may contribute to localized stratospheric moistening under certain atmospheric conditions. The findings demonstrate the utility of high‐altitude in situ observations for advancing our understanding of UTLS turbulence and its influence on atmospheric composition, with implications not only for climate but also for future high‐altitude aviation applications."

Jaffe,Impact of Wildfires on O3 and Air Quality Across the United States for 2019–2024 Using Generalized Additive Models,"Wildfire smoke contains various air pollutants and can be transported and dispersed over long distances, deteriorating air quality across a wide area. In 2019–2024, numerous large‐scale wildfires occurred across the United States (US) and surrounding regions. We collected daily PM2.5 and maximum daily 8‐hr average O3 (MDA8) data from ∼800 US air quality monitoring sites (April–October, 2019–2024) and incorporated model‐based meteorological data (MERRA‐2 and HYSPLIT) and satellite‐derived parameters (HMS and TROPOMI) for use in a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Smoke days were identified using HMS and PM2.5 data, and GAMs were developed individually at each site for the MDA8 using non‐smoke days. Our results demonstrate that incorporating interaction smooth terms improves GAM performance, particularly for high‐altitude mountainous sites where simple models struggle with MDA8 predictions. We then applied the same model to the smoke days to quantify the smoke O3 contribution to the MDA8 (SMO). We estimated an overall mean SMO of 3.8 ppb across the US, adjusted to 2.8 ppb after bias correction via Empirical Distribution Matching (EDM) for a more conservative estimate. Exceedance days (>70 ppb) with significant SMO across the US totaled 5,393 (∼33%) and 4,099 (∼25%) in the uncorrected GAM and GAM‐EDM, respectively. A key advantage of our approach is its reliance on satellite and model‐based data, ensuring nationwide coverage and consistency. Our method can be broadly applied across the US to improve the understanding of smoke impacts on O3 and support regulatory decision making."

Folkert Boersma;Jun Wang,Elucidating Contributions of Anthropogenic and Soil NOx Emissions Changes to O3 Trends Over China,"Surface ozone (O3) pollution is a critical environmental challenge, but existing research predominantly focuses on its summer peaks. Our analysis shows that high‐O3 episodes now expand into spring and autumn in China, with warm‐season (April–September) maximum daily average 8‐hr (MDA8) O3 concentrations rising at 5.2 μg m−3 yr−1 during 2014–2023. Current O3 mitigation focuses on anthropogenic NOx emissions (ANOx) while neglecting the contribution of soil NOx emissions (SNOx) to tropospheric O3 formation. Here, we developed an innovative framework combining the machine learning model (XGBoost) with the Unified Inputs for WRF‐Chem (UI‐WRF‐Chem) to quantify the impacts of ANOx and SNOx on O3 increases during 2015–2019. Results show that although warm‐season SNOx constitute only 23%–27% of total NOx emissions in China (2015–2022), they generally drive O3 increases, exhibiting distinct regional and seasonal heterogeneities. Compared to urban areas, the O3 formation regimes in rural areas of the Yangtze River Delta region predominantly shift to NOx‐limited, making O3 highly sensitive to SNOx. SNOx changes lead to warm‐season MDA8 O3 increases of 1.0–1.3 μg m−3 during 2016–2019 relative to 2015. Although similar regime shifts have occurred, rural areas in the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei and Fenwei Plain regions still retain strong VOCs‐limited characteristics; thus, SNOx perturbation impacts on O3 are smaller. Although summer SNOx are higher, their contribution to O3 increases in transitional seasons (April, May, and September) shows an upward trend, suggesting more attention should be paid to fertilization‐driven SNOx. Our study highlights that future O3 control strategies should account for SNOx and their regional and seasonal differences."

 Chemical transport models (CTMs) can provide information — albeit with biases — that is lacking in observations, including PM2.5 composition and source. Correcting biases in simulated PM2.5 could facilitate their use in exposure assessment, environmental epidemiology, environmental justice analyses, and other applications. Here we develop a novel set of species- and source-resolved PM2.5 estimates across the contiguous United States for 2001 and 2010. We use geographically weighted regressions (GWR) to predict and then correct for the bias in CTM PM2.5 concentration predictions for five chemical species (elemental carbon, organic aerosol, ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate). The GWR models are trained using speciated measurements, empirical PM2.5 exposure estimates, CTM predictions, and other geographic information. A 10-fold cross-validation shows minimal bias across each simulated PM2.5 species (−25 to 39 % before; 0–3 % after) and improved correlations with ground-level monitors for elemental carbon, nitrate, and organic aerosol (R2: 0.30 to 0.53 before; 0.53 to 0.87 after). GWR outperforms ordinary least squares (OLS) corrections for all PM2.5 species except elemental carbon, where performance is comparable. Corrected fields also show improved performance in predicting fractional composition.

 The gas-phase hydration of SO3 by water, forming sulfuric acid, is the primary atmospheric removal pathway for SO3. However, in some circumstances, this reaction competes with the formation of organosulfates (OSs) from SO3 and small hydroxyl-containing molecules. The mechanism for aromatic OS formation via reactions of phenols or aromatic alcohols with SO3 remains poorly understood. This study employs quantum chemistry calculations to investigate aromatic OS formation in the gas phase for monocyclic hydroxylated aromatics (phenols and aromatic alcohols). For the ternary reactions (SO3 + H2O + phenol/aromatic alcohol), two pathways occur: aromatic OS formation (catalyzed by H2O); sulfuric acid formation (catalyzed by the phenol/aromatic alcohol). Comparison of Gibbs free energy barriers and reaction rates shows the aromatic OS formation pathway predominates. Furthermore, while the Gibbs free energy barriers for uncatalyzed aromatic OS formation (19.29–30.89 kcal mol−1) are significantly higher than that for water-catalyzed SO3 hydration (7.86 kcal mol−1), the inclusion of a catalytic water molecule drastically lowers these barriers: phenols + SO3 + H2O: 6.35–11.68 kcal mol−1; aromatic alcohols + SO3 + H2O: 2.10–2.62 kcal mol−1. Rate comparisons indicate that the water-catalyzed reaction of benzyl alcohol with SO3 can form aromatic OSs in the middle and upper troposphere."

The study calls for integrated estimation methods, international collaboration, and research on climate-ozone links to improve air quality strategies. 
 Background ozone (O3) represents the baseline concentrations in the absence of local anthropogenic emissions and is critical for understanding and mitigating tropospheric O3 pollution. Accurate estimation of background O3 constrains the maximum achievable benefits of precursor emissions control and informs effective air quality management. This review synthesizes the definition and estimation methods for background O3, including in situ measurement, statistical analysis, numerical modeling, and integrated methods. A meta-analysis of background O3 in China from 1994 to 2020 reveals pronounced spatial variability, with concentrations ranging from 33 ppb in the Northeast China to 48 ppb in the Northwest China, and a national mean of 41 ppb, accounting for 79 % of the tropospheric maximum daily 8 h average O3. Methodological discrepancies are evident for background O3: in situ and statistical methods yield higher estimates, whereas integrated approaches produce lower yet more consistent values. Placed in a global context, background O3 levels in China are medium-to-high and exhibit an increasing trend. This review highlights the need for integrated estimation methods to improve accuracy, underscores the international collaboration to address long-range pollutant transport, and calls for further research on the interactions between background O3 and climate change. By advancing the understanding of background O3 dynamics, it provides critical insights for atmospheric chemistry and air pollution control in China and beyond."

Vogel;Yafang Cheng;Stephan Borrmann,Transport of Biomass Burning Aerosol into the Extratropical Tropopause Region over Europe via Warm Conveyor Belt Uplift,"We show measurements of a filament with biomass burning influence transported by a warm conveyor belt (WCB) into the tropopause region over Europe. The pollution originates from Canadian forest fires and is transported in the lower troposphere towards Europe. The WCB transport is followed by mixing with air masses of stratospheric chemical signatures. We hypothesize that this mixing leads to a change in the vertical gradient of the potential temperature. 
 We present measurements from the aircraft-based TPEx (Tropopause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) mission in June 2024 over Europe. The measurement platform, a Learjet 35A, was equipped with in-situ trace gas and aerosol measurements and filter samplers for offline analysis. For vertical gradient measurements of trace species and aerosol, we conducted redundant measurements on a fully automated towed sensor shuttle (TOSS) 200 m below the aircraft. On 17 June 2024, we observed a filament with elevated aerosol number concentrations of up to 800 particles cm−3 between 100 nm and 1 µm. This is higher by a factor of two to four than the local background. Carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios were larger than 100 ppbv. Single particle analysis of impactor samples using electron microscopy show characteristic biomass burning (BB) aerosol in the tropopause region. The TOSS measurements also allow the calculation of the potential temperature gradient (Δθ⋅Δz-1). Within the polluted filament, we observe changes towards smaller gradients, which is presumably due to an increase of potential temperature at lower altitudes by radiative heating as a consequence of the transported BB aerosol. Trajectory analysis show air mass origin over Canada with low-level long-range transport and subsequent uplift by a warm conveyor belt (WCB) over Europe as additional pathway of pollution into the UTLS. Furthermore, this analysis yields that BB aerosol can be transported in a WCB into the UTLS there it can be mixed with stratospheric air masses."

We found that China's 2022 CH4 emissions were 45.1 TgCH4·yr⁻¹, significantly lower than previous estimates, especially in coal mining and waste sectors. The inversion substantially reduced emission uncertainties and improved CH4 concentration simulations. These results suggest China’s climate mitigation burden may have been overestimated. 
 Methane (CH4), the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, significantly impacts global warming. As the world's largest anthropogenic CH4 emitter, China faces challenges in accurately estimating its emissions. Top-down methods often suffer from coarse resolution, limited data constraints, and result discrepancies. Here, we developed the Regional Methane Assimilation System (RegGCAS-CH4) based on the WRF-CMAQ model and the EnKF algorithm. By assimilating extensive TROPOMI column-averaged dry CH4 mixing ratio (XCH4) retrievals, we conducted high-resolution nested inversions to quantify daily CH4 emissions across China, with a focus on Shanxi Province in 2022. Nationally, posterior CH4 emissions were 45.1 ± 3.8 TgCH4 yr−1, 36.5 % lower than the EDGAR estimates, with the largest reductions in the coal and waste sectors. In North China, emissions decreased most significantly, mainly attributed to the coal and enteric fermentation sectors. Posterior emissions in coal-reliant Shanxi Province decreased by 46.3 %. Sporadic emission increases were detected in major coal-producing cities but were missed by the coarse-resolution inversion. Monthly emissions exhibited a winter-low, summer-high pattern, with the rice cultivation and waste sectors showing higher seasonal increases than those in EDGAR. The inversion significantly improved XCH4 and surface CH4 concentration simulations, reducing emission uncertainty. Compared to other bottom-up/top-down estimates, our results were the lowest, primarily because the high-resolution inversion better captured local emission hotspots. Sensitivity tests underscored the importance of nested inversions in reducing the influence of boundary condition uncertainties on emission estimates. This study provides robust CH4 emission estimates for China, crucial for understanding the CH4 budget and informing climate mitigation strategies."

Turner,Emulating chemistry-climate dynamics with a linear inverse model,"Chemistry-climate models are used to investigate how physical climate influences the composition of the atmosphere but are slow and expensive to run. We train a linear inverse model that can replicate the behavior of chemistry-climate models at low computational cost. It captures how large-scale climate features like El Niño affect atmospheric composition and can make accurate forecasts up to a year ahead. This model enables fast hypothesis testing and estimates of past atmospheric composition. 
 Coupled chemistry–climate models (CCMs) are powerful tools for investigating chemical variability in the climate system, but high computational cost limits their use for hypothesis testing and adequately sampling variability on long timescales. Here, we present the first application of a linear inverse model (LIM) to emulate a CCM. A LIM is a low-dimensional empirical model that reproduces the CCM's statistics and dynamics at low computational cost. By linearizing the CCM's dynamics, the LIM captures coherent modes of variability, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that describe the coupled evolution of physical and chemical fields. Deterministic seasonal forecasts of the LIM result in skillful predictions of physical and chemical variables at lead times up to a year, outperforming damped persistence models. We show that the LIM's skill in chemical fields depends on its coupled chemistry–climate modes: forecasts without the ENSO dynamical mode show a substantial loss of skill, suggesting the importance of ENSO in driving predictable chemical variability.

Johnson;Kai-Lan Chang;Emma L. Yates;Owen R. Cooper;Laura T. Iraci,Global source–receptor-relationship  database for integrated tropospheric ozone  observations from multiplatform datasets in  western North America during 1994–2021,"Atmospheric observations show that free tropospheric ozone has increased across the Northern Hemisphere over the past three decades. The sources driving this increase remain unclear. In this study, we developed a source-receptor relationship database combining multiplatform ozone data and advanced atmospheric transport modeling. This database can identify emission regions responsible for ozone increases and can also be used to analyze other co-observed atmospheric constituents. 
 Long-term atmospheric ozone observations in Western North America (WNA) provide essential data for assessing tropospheric ozone trends. Backward atmospheric simulations based on these observations establish the source–receptor relationships (SRRs) to improve our understanding of the factors driving ozone trends across different regions, time periods, and atmospheric layers. In this study, we integrated 28 years of ozone observations (1994–2021) from ozonesondes, lidar, commercial aircraft, and aircraft campaigns across WNA, spanning the upper atmospheric boundary layer, free troposphere, and upper troposphere (i.e., 900 to 300 hPa). We integrated the multiplatform datasets using a data fusion framework to generate 553 608 gridded ozone receptors. For each receptor, we use the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model, driven by ERA5 reanalysis data, to produce the SRRs calculations, providing global simulations at high temporal (hourly) and spatial (1°×1°) resolution from the surface up to 20 km a.g.l. (above ground level). This SRR database retains detailed information for each receptor, including the gridded ozone value product, which enables user to illustrate and identify source contributions to various subsets of ozone observations in the troposphere above WNA over nearly 3 decades at different vertical layers and temporal scales, such as diurnal, daily, seasonal, intra-annual, and decadal. More generally, the calculated SRRs are applicable to any study looking to evaluate origins of airmasses reaching WNA. As such, this database can support source contribution analyses for other atmospheric components observed over WNA, if other co-located observations have been made at the spatial and temporal scales defined for some or all of the gridded ozone receptors used here. The entire dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5067/ASDC/WNA-BackTraj (Cui et al., 2025)."

Stratus dominates the poleward regime of the cyclones. It transitions into closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) downstream and then to open MCC in the cold sector of cyclones. Clustered and suppressed cumulus are often found in the warm sector. Principal component (PC) analysis is applied to a set of cloud controlling factors to characterize properties of the entire extratropical cyclone that are critical to low cloud mesoscale morphologies. The first two PCs are strongly related to cyclone intensity and sea surface temperature averaged over the cyclone domain, respectively. Daily average insolation at the top of the atmosphere, which has large seasonal and latitudinal variability over the SO, is used as an additional independent predictor. Closed and open MCC are negatively correlated with insolation, while disorganized MCC and clustered cumulus are positively correlated with insolation. In stronger cyclones, closed MCC, open MCC, and clustered cumulus tend to be more frequent, whereas stratus and suppressed cumulus tend to be less common. In cyclones over a colder sea surface, closed MCC and stratus are more abundant, and clustered cumulus and suppressed cumulus are less abundant. These results deepen the current understanding of low cloud processes and provide insights of transitions between morphologies, and thus changes in cloud radiative effects, over the SO in a changing climate."

Recent work that mapped the trajectory of the Sun found that the solar system may have passed through a massive interstellar cold cloud–the Local Lynx of Cold Clouds–with density nH≈ ${n}_{H}\approx $ 3,000 cm−3 ${\text{cm}}^{-3}$ two to three million years ago. Such crossing would have compressed the heliosphere and directly exposed Earth to the interstellar flux of GCRs, which will react with N2 ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ and O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ molecules to produce ion pairs in the atmosphere. Using a 2D atmospheric chemistry and dynamics model, we simulate how the increased low‐energy GCR flux affects Earth's climate. We study two cases: the removal of heliospheric shielding, and the concurrent effect of exposure to interstellar GCRs and a geomagnetic pole reversal, such as the Gauss‐Matuyama pole reversal which occurred 2.58 Mya. Without heliospheric shielding, we find a 5%–15% increase in polar stratospheric NOy ${\text{NO}}_{y}$ when compared to pre‐industrial solar minimum conditions. This produces a 1%–2% decrease in polar stratospheric ozone which decreases stratospheric temperatures by ≈ ${\approx} $0.1–0.2 K. In the case that a geomagnetic pole reversal would occur during the cold cloud crossing, we see almost no shielding of cosmic rays at the equator and mid‐latitudes; this produces over 50% NOy ${\text{NO}}_{y}$ enhancement, 14% polar stratospheric ozone depletion, and up to ≈ ${\approx} $1 K decrease in stratospheric temperature. Changes in stratospheric temperatures could have localized effects on surface temperatures, and ozone depletion could increase UV exposure on Earth's surface."

In this study, the physicochemical properties and formation mechanisms of secondary aerosols in cloud‐free, cloud interstitial, and cloud residual particles are investigated at a mountain site in southeastern China. The results show that elevated concentrations of NO3− and more‐oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO‐OOA) in cloud‐free particles primarily result from aqueous‐phase reactions along the dust transport. Aqueous‐phase processes during cloud events promoted the formation of NO3−, SO42−, NH4+ and MO‐OOA, with cloud residual particles exhibited 1.2–1.6 times higher growth rates than cloud interstitial particles. Lower fractions of C4H7+, C4H9+, C5H6O+, and C3H7O3+ were found in cloud residual particles, suggesting that cloud droplets could facilitate the aging of these organics. Additionally, higher liquid water content increases the O/C ratio in secondary organic aerosols (SOA) by 0.1–0.15, and higher O3 concentrations facilitate oxidation in cloud droplets via hydroxyl radicals (•OH) production in the acidic cloud water. SOA in cloud residual particles was enriched with carbonyl functional groups (>C=O), suggesting the presence of oxidized acids or esters, which contrasted with less‐oxidized aldehydes/ketones in cloud‐free and cloud interstitial particles. These findings highlight the combined influence of long‐range transport and cloud processing on secondary aerosol chemistry in high mountain region in southeastern China and provide critical insights for improving aerosol‐climate models in topographically complex regions."

Gordon;Cameron R. Homeyer,Examining Stratosphere‐Troposphere Exchange in an Idealized Simulation of a Tropical Cyclone,"Tropical cyclones (TCs) have been recognized for their damaging hazards and impacts on the climate system. One under‐investigated climate impact from TCs is stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE) and accompanying upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) composition change, which alters the radiation budget. Previous case studies have identified multiple STE processes within TCs, but it remains unclear how much STE occurs in individual storms and how these individual processes contribute to the total STE in TCs. This study utilizes an idealized simulation to provide a more thorough understanding of the importance of STE in TCs and the role of various STE processes. The 3‐D TC version of the Bryan Cloud Model (CM1) is used to simulate a TC and evaluate UTLS composition change and accompanying transport pathways. STE and composition change are assessed using water vapor concentrations and a suite of custom passive tracers. These passive tracers include: boundary layer and stratospheric tracers, and a convective tracer. The simulation suggests substantial hydration of the lower stratosphere occurs within the TC inner core. Specifically, water vapor reaches nearly 20 ppmv at an altitude of approximately 18.5 km (> ${ >} $2 km above the tropopause) with a spatial extent limited to 250 km from TC center. Downward transport of stratospheric air occurs (a) within the upper portion of the near‐tropopause outflow and (b) via subsidence within the eye, where approximately 10% stratospheric air reaches altitudes as low as 7 km. Additionally, substantial two‐way transport is found within overshooting tops in the TC and its inner core."

 Montane forests are biodiversity hotspots that provide important ecosystem services, including temperature buffering for numerous species underneath forest canopies. In recent decades, montane forests have been under increasing pressure from small-and large-scale deforestation, yet associated spatio-temporal changes in temperature buffering capacity remain unclear. Here, we studied the changes in temperature buffering capacity due to forest loss from 2003 to 2022 in three montane forest ecosystems in Africa (Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Bale, and the Taita Hills). We modeled the temperature buffering changes based on in situ microclimate measurements inside forests and in open areas, climate data, airborne laser scanning data, and satellite observations. We found that during the study period montane forests were lost at a rate of 2–9% across the study areas. This loss led to an annual average microclimate air temperature warming ranging from 2.0 ± 0.8 °C to 5.6 ± 2.1 °C across the three montane forests. The warming reduced the maximum air temperature buffering by an average of 3 ± 1.5 °C. Locally, the temperature buffering disappeared over time and transitioned to a mesoclimate amplification. Our findings demonstrate that microclimate buffering capacity was markedly diminished as a result of microclimate warming driven by recent forest loss. Between 2003 and 2022, montane forests in Africa saw a 2–9% decrease, resulting in higher microclimate air temperatures and a reduction in microclimate buffering capacity, according to analysis of changes in temperature buffering capacity due to forest loss."

 This study is part of a project which aims to compute the total deposition of sulfur, nitrogen and ozone over both Canada and the US. This initiative is named ADAGIO (Atmospheric Deposition Analysis Generated by Interpolation of model and Observations) and is led by Environment and Climate Change Canada. More details about the overall methodology were given in Part I of this project. Similarly, here, a deterministic data fusion methodology is used to combine information from air quality models and surface observations to produce seasonal objective analyses (OAs) for six gas species (O3,SO2, NO2, NO, HNO3, NH3) and three dry particulate species (p-NH4+, p-NO3-, p-SO4=) for multiple years during the period 2010–2019. The main difference in the methodology with PART II is that for dry species, the OAs are obtained for concentration instead of wet deposition measurements. The seasonal dry deposition fluxes and concentrations obtained from air quality model simulations for each species are corrected using the OA concentration fields to obtain the corrected total annual dry deposition. In part II, we focus on the species which contribute the most to the N deposition, that is NO2, HNO3, and NH3. ADAGIO yields total dry nitrogen deposition results that are in good agreement with those of the US/TDep project of the US. Comparison with satellite-derived concentrations for NH3 and NO2 are also presented and found reasonable. This paper demonstrated that the simple algorithm based on data fusion presented in part I (for wet species) also works for dry species deposition over large territories."

 To understand the physicochemical properties, size distribution, and pollution sources of aerosols in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), an intensive field observation campaign was conducted in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture during the summer of 2023. Field observations integrated optical particle counting and ion chromatography, supported by principal component analysis (PCA) and trajectory clustering. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) were dominated by NH4+, followed by NO3−, SO42−, and Cl−. Secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) showed a strong positive correlation with each other, but a weaker correlation with Cl−. SIA and Cl− ions originated from different emission sources. The mass concentration size distribution exhibited a bimodal pattern dominated by an accumulation mode peak at 0.25 μm and a coarse mode peak at 5 μm with the coarse mode accounting for 89 % of the total mass concentration. Coarse particles constituted the dominant fraction of aerosols, as evidenced by the PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 0.2. SIA was positively correlated with accumulation mode particles (R2 = 0.21), whereas there was no linear relationship with coarse mode aerosols (R2 = 0.01). PCA revealed that regional anthropogenic pollution is the dominant source. Three industrial cities in low-altitude regions were identified as potential source areas of SIA and accumulation mode aerosol, while chloride ions were derived from salt lakes on the plateau. The present study quantified the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols in the northeastern TP and resolved their mixing sources."

Suresh Babu,Aerosol light-scattering enhancement and liquid water content in a tropical coastal atmosphere,"•Aerosol growth due to increased RH levels resulted in a > 35 % increase in aerosol total scattering coefficients. •A higher aerosol scattering growth factor during the day than at night due to increased hygroscopicity. •Secondary aerosols, especially oxygenated organics and sulfate, contributed to enhanced hygroscopicity. •Exponential increase in aerosol water uptake at elevated RH levels with mass growth factors as high as 10–12. •Increasing amounts of inorganics were found with increasing ALWCorganicsat ambient RH >85 %. 
 Ambient relative humidity (RH) determines the aerosol water content and modulates aerosol optical properties, chemical composition, and mixing state. Understanding aerosol hygroscopicity is crucial for assessing its climate forcing. In this study, aerosol hygroscopic properties were characterized using the measurements of aerosol scattering coefficients (σsp) at varying RH conditions over a tropical coastal environment in the Indian region. The observations were carried out using an aerosol conditioning system consisting of dry (RH <40 %) and wet nephelometers (60–85 %) from 24 December 2019 to 4 January 2020 (winter) and from 3 November 2020 to 30 November 2020 (post-monsoon). The aerosol light-scattering enhancement factor, f(RH) (the ratio of σsp measured by wet and dry nephelometers), was calculated and parameterized using an aerosol growth function. The overall mean dry aerosol total scattering coefficient at 550 nm was 170 ± 72 Mm−1 and 155 ± 61 Mm−1, whereas aerosol light-scattering enhancement factors at 85 % RH, i.e., f(RH = 85 %, 550 nm), were in the range of 1.45–1.48. A higher scattering enhancement (5–8 %) was observed during the sea-breeze periods than the land-breeze periods. Composite aerosol hygroscopicity (κchem) values derived from the concurrent non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) chemical composition also reflected contrasting aerosol systems within a day. Aerosol growth function parameter (γ) depicted a well-defined association with the mass fraction of inorganic aerosols, suggesting their prominent role in regulating aerosol scattering properties. Detailed analysis performed to elucidate the role of elevated RH levels (RH > 85 %) revealed that the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) showed a step enhancement with corresponding mass growth factors (the ratio of mass loading in dry and wet conditions) increasing to as high as 10 to 12. At elevated RH conditions, the ALWC associated with organic aerosol (OA) (ALWCorganics), which is the dominant species in the NR-PM1 aerosol system, also increased significantly. Such enhanced ALWC and hygroscopicity (κorganics) of organics possibly contributed to the increased aqueous-phase production of inorganic aerosols (especially sulfate), as inferred from a significant correlation (r > 0.8) between the parameters. These results highlighted the role played by ambient RH in controlling aerosol formation pathways and their hygroscopic properties over the highly humid tropical atmosphere."

 Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a highly potent and long-lived greenhouse gas whose atmospheric concentrations are increasing due to human emissions. In this study, we determine European SF6 emissions from 2005 to 2021 using a large ensemble of atmospheric inversions. To assess uncertainty, we systematically vary key inversion parameters across 986 sensitivity tests and apply a Monte Carlo approach to randomly combine these parameters in 1003 additional inversions. Our analysis focuses on high-emitting countries with robust observational coverage – UK, Germany, France, and Italy – while also examining aggregated EU-27 emissions.SF6 emissions declined across all studied regions except Italy, largely attributed to EU F-gas regulations (2006, 2014), however, national reports underestimated emissions: (i) UK emissions dropped from 68 (47–77) t yr−1 in 2008 to 19 (15–26) t yr−1 in 2018, aligning with the reports from 2018 onward; (ii) French emissions fell from 78 (51–117) t yr−1 (2005) to 35 (19–54) t yr−1 (2021), exceeding reports by 88 %; (iii) Italian emissions fluctuated (25–48 t yr−1), surpassing reports by 107 %; (iv) German emissions declined from 182 (155–251) t yr−1 (2005) to 97 (88–104) t yr−1 (2021), aligning reasonably well with reports; (v) EU-27 emissions decreased from 403 (335–501) t yr−1 (2005) to 225 (191–260) t yr−1 (2021), exceeding reports by 20 %.

The mosaic is made harmonising and blending seven regional inventories, gapfilled with the most recent release of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. By incorporating the best available local information, the HTAP_v3.2 emission mosaic can be used for policy-relevant studies at regional and global level. 
 This study, performed under the umbrella of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF-HTAP), responds to the need of the global and regional atmospheric modelling community of having a mosaic emission inventory of air pollutants that conforms to specific requirements: global coverage, long time series, spatially distributed emissions with high time resolution, and a high sectoral resolution. The mosaic approach of integrating official regional emission inventories based on locally reported data, with a global inventory based on a globally consistent methodology, allows modellers to perform simulations of a high scientific quality while also ensuring that the results remain relevant to policymakers.HTAP_v3.2, an ad-hoc global mosaic of anthropogenic inventories, is an update to the HTAP_v3 global mosaic inventory and has been developed by integrating official inventories over specific areas (North America, Europe, Asia including China, Japan and Korea) with the independent Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory for the remaining world regions. The results are spatially and temporally distributed emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, Black Carbon (BC), and Organic Carbon (OC), with a spatial resolution of 0.1 × 0.1° and time intervals of months and years covering the period 2000–2020 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17086684, Crippa, 2025, https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_htap_v32, last access: 27 October 2025). The emissions are further disaggregated to 16 anthropogenic emitting sectors. This paper describes the methodology applied to develop such an emission mosaic, reports on source allocation, differences among existing inventories, and best practices for the mosaic compilation. One of the key strengths of the HTAP_v3.2 emission mosaic is its temporal coverage, enabling the analysis of emission trends over the past two decades. The development of a global emission mosaic over such long time series represents a unique product for global air quality modelling and for better-informed policy making, reflecting the community effort expended by the TF-HTAP to disentangle the complexity of transboundary transport of air pollution."

However, the morphological spatial patterns of UGI and their impact on PM2.5 remain largely unexplored, as most related studies have focused solely on case studies. This study employed morphological spatial pattern analysis to document the national scale spatial distribution of seven UGI morphology space patterns (MSPs) across 288 Chinese cities. It verified the disparities of each MSP under varying geographic conditions and scalar categories. Using advanced interpretable machine learning methods that account for aggregated contribution of location features, the study confirmed the positive role of UGI proportion in mitigating PM2.5 levels. Significantly, the findings revealed that smaller non‐core UGI areas, such as perforation and islet, exert a more pronounced positive impact on reducing PM2.5. Furthermore, the study explored the potential PM2.5 risks facing Chinese cities due to temporal changes of UGI.

 The increase of surface solar radiation (SSR) observed during the last decades in Europe has raised concerns for its implications for the climate system. Here, we evaluate the past and projected SSR trends in Europe from 1994 to 2054 based on a comprehensive set of ground site observations, five historical gridded datasets and a remarkable ensemble of 30 CMIP6 climate models with projections in four different forcing scenarios. Together, they provide a seamless unprecedented characterisation of the SSR trend in Europe across time and space. The regional SSR trend observed in the period 1994–2023 is 3.1 W/m2/decade. All gridded datasets, except the ERA5 reanalysis, deviate from this value by ±0.3 W/m2/decade, or less. Assuming that clouds and aerosols are the only boosters of the SSR trend, it is found that ≈20% of the trend is explained by aerosol direct effect (ADE). It is shown that the first aerosol indirect effect (AIE) alone cannot explain the SSR trend related to cloud changes, thus leaving a significant role for changes in cloud coverage. It is estimated that the total SSR trend is approximately explained in 1/5 by ADE, 2/5 by first AIE and 2/5 by cloud coverage changes. However, this fractions are likely affected by biases in aerosol optical depth. The results suggest that the CMIP6 ensemble overestimates (underestimates) the clear (cloudy) SSR trend during 1994–2014. The median SSR trend projected by the CMIP6 models is, on average, ≈85% smaller than the trend observed during 1994–2023 with small differences between forcings scenarios."

 The long-term trend for aerosol optical properties and climate impact sensitivity in terms of radiative forcing efficiency were analyzed at a suburban station in Athens, Southeast Mediterranean, using an extensive dataset from 2008 to 2022. The study examined scattering (σsc) and absorption (σap) coefficients, scattering Ångström exponent (SAE), absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry parameter (g), and radiative forcing efficiency (RFE). Seasonal variability was linked to meteorological conditions and human activities. Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) was lowest (0.86), and Radiative Forcing Efficiency (RFE) was highest (−61 W/m2) in winter, confirming enhanced contributions from traffic and biomass burning. Lower SAE values (1.5) in spring indicate a greater presence of coarse particles due to frequent Saharan dust events (SDEs). Daily patterns of σap and SSA reflect local emissions, with pronounced traffic-related peaks. Aerosol classification revealed that Black Carbon (BC) dominates the suburban aerosol (51 %), with mixed BrC-BC (16 %) peaking in winter and dust-pollution mixtures (13 %) increasing in spring. The presence of large particles mixed with BC (11 %) was more frequent in spring, further highlighting seasonal variability. Trend analysis showed statistically significant (ss) decreases in σsc (−0.611) and SSA (−0.003), alongside increases in σap (+0.027) and RFE (+0.270) at a 95 % confidence level, suggesting a shift toward more absorbing aerosols. The findings provide new insights and reveal a new aerosol regime, where a reduction in anthropogenic emissions is affecting the scattering rather than the absorbing aerosol component, while the impact from forest fires as a climate feedback mechanism has a significant effect in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is important for future studies and climate modelling to account for the regionally observed changes of the state of mixing of ambient aerosol leading to a shift in radiative forcing efficiency through the reduction in SSA. This is evident in the long term for the east Mediterranean region and must be accounted for in radiative forcing estimates and future climate projections."

Phuleria,Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions From Residential Heating in India: Field Measurements of Emission Factors and Optical Properties,"Residential activities are major contributors to global carbonaceous aerosol emissions, particularly in densely populated and low‐middle‐income countries such as India. Assessing the climatic impacts of these aerosols requires a detailed understanding of their optical properties and atmospheric abundance. Despite a strong understanding of cooking activities, residential water and space heating emissions in India remain highly uncertain. Using the field measurements, this study quantifies emission factors (EFs) and optical properties of emissions from water and space heating in India. The measured PM2.5, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) EFs for heating range between 2.2–20.7, 0.4–2.2, and 0.8–5.5 g kg−1, respectively, are ∼2 fold higher than those for cooking. PM2.5 EFs from firewood (20.7 ± 8.5 g kg−1) are larger than those during the crop residue (7.1 ± 5.7 g kg−1) and dung cake (17.4 ± 9.8 g kg−1) burning for water heating. These emissions exhibit significant absorption, corroborated by low values of single‐scattering albedo at 532 nm ranging from 0.17 to 0.96. A large absorption Angström exponent of 1.34–2.57 suggests the presence of brown carbon. The study estimates emissions of 1,239 (±264), 309 (±88), and 88 (±30) Gg yr−1 for PM2.5, OC, and EC, respectively, from residential heating activities in India. Spatially, emission patterns from heating differ from those for cooking, with high emissions in northern hilly regions, the Indo‐Gangetic plains, and western and southern India. The derived EFs, optical properties, and high‐resolution emissions enhance the understanding of aerosol climate impacts, offering insights for regional mitigation strategies for air pollution."

 Strict emission-control measures in China have markedly reduced anthropogenic emissions and improved air quality, yet their impacts remain insufficiently quantified. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) together with multiple linear regression (MLR), this study quantified the respective contributions of emission reductions and meteorological conditions to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in January and July during 2015–2024, and evaluated how emission reductions affect meteorological variability and boundary-layer stability. Both WRF-Chem and MLR attributed the observed PM2.5 declines primarily to emission reductions rather than meteorological conditions. Over the North China Plain, WRF-Chem attributed PM2.5 declines of −3.9/−1.8 μg m−3 yr−1 for January/July to emission reductions, whereas MLR yielded −6.3/−4.9 μg m−3 yr−1. Emission reductions increased clear-sky surface shortwave radiation by 0.36 W m−2 yr−1 in January and 0.32 W m−2 yr−1 in July, accompanied by modest increases in near-surface temperature, boundary-layer height, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, and by decreases in relative humidity. In Beijing, reduced aerosols produced surface warming in January with slight cooling at 900−950 hPa, whereas July exhibited warming below 850 hPa, increasing near-surface temperature gradients and enhancing boundary-layer instability."

Total CH₄ emissions were 16.9 ± 5.3 t h−1, dominated by older, shallow-water platforms. Emissions were lower than inventories but 2 times larger than operator reports. Trace gas data suggest venting and fugitives as main CH₄ sources. The carbon intensity was 3.4 ± 0.8 g CO₂ eq MJ−1, with older platforms CH₄-dominated and newer deep-water sites CO₂-dominated. 
 In September 2022, the METHANE-To-Go Africa (MTGA) scientific aircraft campaign, part of UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) Methane Science Studies, conducted the first methane (CH4) emissions measurements from the offshore oil and gas sector in West Africa. Using aircraft-based mass balance methods, we quantified trace gas emissions from all 57 Angolan offshore facilities, estimating total sector emissions and assessing 30 individual sites and 10 facility groups, thereby providing the first independent dataset for this previously unstudied region. Emissions were generally consistent across repeated measurements, but two facilities showed intermittent high emissions of 10 and 4 t h−1, significantly influencing total emissions. Older, shallow-water platforms emitted more than newer, deep-water floating production facilities. These findings suggest that production volume is a poor proxy for CH4 emissions, while age and maintenance status are more reliable indicators. Due to operational variability, regular monitoring remains essential, particularly for older facilities.  We estimate total CH4 emissions at 16.9±5.3th-1, only 20 %–22 % of EDGAR and CAMS inventory estimates, but over twice the operator-reported values. Additional trace gas measurements (CO2, CO, C2H6, SO2, NOy, and aerosols) suggest CH4 stems primarily from fugitive emissions and venting, not combustion. The calculated carbon intensity of Angolan offshore oil and gas is 3.4±0.8 g CO2 eq MJ−1, with nearly equal contributions from CH4 and CO2. Notably, shallow-water platforms are CH4-dominated, while deep-water facilities mostly emit CO2. These results improve our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from offshore production in a key oil- and gas-producing region."

Kurowski;Matthew D. Lebsock;Kevin M. Smalley,The diurnal susceptibility of subtropical clouds to aerosols,"This study explores how clouds respond to pollution throughout the day using high-resolution simulations. Polluted clouds show stronger daily changes: thicker clouds at night and in the morning but faster thinning in the afternoon. Pollution reduces rainfall but enhances drying, deepening the cloud layer. While the pollution initially brightens clouds, the daily cycle of cloudiness slightly reduces this brightening effect. 
 The diurnal susceptibility of clouds and their radiative properties to aerosols is examined during their Lagrangian transition from subtropical stratocumulus to shallow cumulus regimes. Using large-eddy simulations, we analyze the six-day evolution of an air mass along a 3800 km observed trajectory from the coast of Peru toward the equator. Pristine and polluted scenarios are simulated with forcing imposed from weather reanalysis. The polluted scenario exhibits stronger diurnal variations in cloud water, cloud fraction, and albedo, with enhanced nighttime entrainment and suppressed precipitation. The overall response of cloud properties and outgoing shortwave radiation to droplet number concentration follows a distinct diurnal pattern: strong positive cloud adjustments dominate at night and in the morning, while weak negative adjustments prevail in the afternoon. This cycle is driven by the competition between precipitation suppression, which enhances cloud water and coverage, and entrainment drying, which depletes them. In polluted conditions, enhanced entrainment leads to a deeper and more decoupled boundary layer that cannot be sustained by surface fluxes in the afternoon, resulting in negative cloud adjustments. The enhanced entrainment rate under polluted conditions is caused by the reduced sedimentation of cloud and precipitation water from the entrainment zone. While the Twomey effect dominates the diurnal average albedo response, the diurnal variation in the competing cloud adjustments lead to a near-neutral net susceptibility in the afternoon, highlighting the critical role of diurnally varying processes in aerosol-cloud interactions."

Alxa Plateau’s elevation (>1500 m) filters dust to Lanzhou/Mu Us, enabling recycling. Spatial variations show Lanzhou’s dust: 26 % Gurbantunggut, 18 % Taklimakan; Mu Us: 28 % Alxa, 22 % Taklimakan. Elevation barriers and sediment recycling modulate East Asian dust dynamics. 
 Northern China's arid lands constitute one of Earth's most active aeolian ecosystems, yet persistent uncertainties remain regarding the precise source apportionment of dust emissions impacting downstream regions. By applying advanced geochemical fingerprinting techniques to modern airborne dust samples collected from 11 to 29 April 2023 across major potential provenance areas (Taklimakan, Gurbantunggut, Hexi Corridor, Heihe River Basin, Alxa Plateau, and Qaidam Basin Desert), we systematically quantified dust provenance through coupled rare earth element signatures and trace element ratios. Our multivariate analysis reveals three critical findings: (1) The Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut deserts dominate as primary provenance than Alxa Plateau, Hexi Corridor and Heihe Basin and the Qaidam Basin Desert; (2) Despite the Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut Desert's upwind position relative to the CLP, the intervening Alxa Plateau (> 1500 ma.s.l.) acts as a topographic filter of dust destined for the Lanzhou and Mu Us regions while facilitating multi-phase recycling through localized deposition and remobilization; (3) Provenance shifts exhibit strong spatial dependency, with Lanzhou's dust load dominated by Gurbantunggut provenance (26.1 %), then Taklimakan (18.3 %); but Mu Us dust dominated by Alxa (27.5 %), then Taklimakan (21.6 %). These findings redefine our understanding of East Asian dust dynamics by demonstrating how elevation barriers and sedimentary recycling jointly modulate source-sink relationships over millennial scales."

By using advanced computer models, we examined the impact of different emissions and environmental conditions on these aerosols in Central Europe. Our findings show that including specific emissions significantly improved the accuracy of our predictions. 
 This study explores the uncertainties in modeling organic aerosol (OA) over Central Europe, focusing on the roles of chemical mechanisms, emission parameterizations, and boundary conditions. Organic aerosols, particularly secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), significantly influence climate, health, and visibility, comprising up to 90 % of submicron particulate matter. Using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast Model, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and chemical boundary conditions on primary and secondary organic aerosol concentrations.Model evaluation against organic carbon measurements over the Czech Republic showed that including source-specific IVOC and SVOC emissions significantly improved CAMx's performance, particularly when using the 1.5-dimensional Volatility Basis Set framework with activated chemical aging. For example, the domain-averaged SOA concentrations increased by up to 1.17 µg m−3 during summer when both IVOC and SVOC emissions were included. Furthermore, incorporating OA into the boundary conditions enhanced model predictions, with the accuracy of modeled organic carbon concentrations significantly improved during summer at some monitoring sites. Despite these improvements, challenges remain due to uncertainties in emission estimates, parameterization schemes, and the spatial resolution of the models.The findings underscore the importance of refined parameterizations for IVOC and SVOC emissions, higher temporal and spatial resolution in chemical boundary conditions, and better representation of chemical aging. Addressing these gaps in future studies will further enhance the understanding and prediction of OA dynamics in regional air quality modeling."

Goldstein,Biogenic and anthropogenic contributions to urban terpenoid fluxes,"Terpenoids are organic gases that can originate from natural and human-caused sources, and their reactions in the atmosphere can cause air pollution. In this study, emissions of organic gases in an urban environment were measured. For some terpenoids, human-caused sources were responsible for about a quarter of the emissions, while others were predominantly from vegetation. This study contributes to a better understanding of urban emission sources and causes of air pollution. 
 Terpenoids influence atmospheric chemistry through rapid oxidation reactions which form secondary products including ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Source apportionment of terpenoids is complicated in urban environments because there are biogenic and anthropogenic sources. This study utilizes measured fluxes of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes with MEGAN, a biogenic emissions model, and FIVE-VCP, an anthropogenic emissions inventory, to characterize urban terpenoid emissions. Volatile organic compound (VOC) mixing ratios were measured using a Vocus proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) during the URBAN-EC (Urban Research on Biogenic and ANthropogenic Emissions of Carbon) study in Berkeley, California from May to November 2022. Fluxes were calculated using the eddy covariance technique. Median fluxes of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes were 0.269, 0.182, and 0.013 nmol m−2 s−1 respectively. Terpenoids were 2 % of the measured molar flux, 26 % of OH reactivity flux, and 21 % of SOA formation potential. The MEGAN isoprene emission factor was 4.56 nmol (m2 leaf area)−1 s−1. MEGAN isoprene fluxes matched URBAN-EC distributions seasonally and diurnally, while MEGAN monoterpene and sesquiterpene fluxes had more pronounced seasonal trends and lower morning emissions relative to URBAN-EC. Weekday/weekend differences were used to determine if terpenoids had anthropogenic sources. Monoterpene and sesquiterpene fluxes were significantly higher on weekdays (p<0.05); these differences were not represented in MEGAN or FIVE-VCP. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes had lower-bound anthropogenic fractions of 23 % and 24 %. Personal care products were not an important contributor to monoterpene emissions. This study presents a detailed analysis of urban terpenoid fluxes and contributes to better understanding their sources."

We used aircraft to measure BC, CO, and CO2 over the Yellow Sea across seasons. Our results show that BC changes in size and mixing state significantly depending on its origin and weather during transport, highlighting the need for better model representation of this pollutant. 
 Both size and mixing state of Black Carbon (BC) are critical climate-relevant physical parameters. It remains a challenge for ambient measurements to characterize their variability across different atmospheric conditions particularly in outflow regions. To investigate how BC's physical properties are determined in source regions and altered during transport, we conducted 23 flight measurements of BC, CO, and CO2 over the Yellow Sea from 2021 to 2022. The refractory BC mass concentration (MrBC) varied by up to two orders of magnitude between near sea surface and around 5 km above sea level, and Planetary Boundary Layer height-dependence of MrBC was stronger in winter than in spring. Smallest rBC's mass median diameter (MMD, 163.4 nm) observed in South Korea-sourced air indicated fresh urban emissions, whereas larger MMD, enhanced internal mixing, and higher rBC/CO slopes were exhibited in the air masses from North Korea and China, reflecting additional emissions from biomass and coal combustion. Both MMD and internal mixing tended to decrease with altitude, highlighting the wet scavenging effect during particle transport. When accumulated precipitation exceeded 1 mm, MrBC decreased by more than 50 %, with moderate decrease in MMD and internal mixing. As a result, overall BC transport efficiency declined to 1/e within 5.5 d. These observations reflect the complex effects of source region, seasonality, and wet removal on varying rBC distributions in the outflow region. These findings provide valuable observational constraints for improving model representations of the size distribution and mixing state of ambient BC particles in outflow regions."

With this procedure, observation datasets can be analyzed to extract gravity wave parameters, such as period, horizontal wavelength, and phase speed, for climatological purposes. The procedure showed reliable performance and is ready for use at other observation sites. 
 Medium-scale gravity waves (MSGWs) are atmospheric waves with horizontal scales ranging from 50 to 1000 km that can be observed through airglow all-sky images. This research introduces a novel algorithm that automatically identifies MSGWs using the keogram technique to study the waves over the Antarctic Peninsula. MSGWs were observed with an all-sky airglow imager located at the Brazilian Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station (CF, 62° S), near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Several preprocessing techniques are necessary to extract the parameters of MSGWs from the airglow images. These include projecting the images into geographical coordinates, applying a flat-field correction, performing consecutive image subtraction, and employing a Butterworth filter to enhance the visibility of the MSGWs. Additionally, a wavelet transform is used to identify the primary oscillations of the MSGWs in the keograms.  Subsequently, a wavelet transform is also used to reconstruct the MSGWs and obtain the fitting coefficients of phase lines. The fitting coefficients are then used to calculate the MSGW parameters and assess the quality of the results. Simulations with synthetic images containing typical propagating gravity waves were conducted to evaluate the errors generated during the MSGW calculations and to determine the threshold for the fitting parameters. This methodology processed a year's worth of data in less than 1 h, successfully identifying most waves with errors lower than 5 %. The observed wave parameters are generally consistent with expected results; however, they show differences from other observation sites, exhibiting larger phase speeds and wavelengths."

It is therefore critical to predict the heterogeneous spatiotemporal pattern of future temperature changes. We use the CESM2 single‐forcing large ensemble to identify spatiotemporal changes in temperature associated with greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols, leveraging the temporal offset of aerosol emissions from high income and developing economies to parse climate impacts of aerosols from these two groups of countries. Our results suggest that aerosol emissions from non‐OECD regions could still mask over 20% of greenhouse gas induced warming for over 40% of the global population in 2050. Parsing climatological impacts from different emission source regions improves our understanding of regional climate impacts and reduces the computational barrier to including regional impacts in simplified modeling frameworks."

 Organic aerosols (OA) constitute a large portion of atmospheric aerosols. The detailed sources of OA, especially precursors and formation processes of secondary OA (SOA) in megacities remain unclear, largely due to lack of molecular composition. We characterized the molecular composition of OA using online extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer in winter Shanghai. Eleven OA sources were identified using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), combined with gas-phase organic precursors and other auxiliary measurements. We identified a plasticizer-related OA source and a primary biomass burning OA source containing likely oxidation products of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). SOA from photo-oxidation and aged biomass burning contributed substantially (~48%) to OA and dominated in SOA. Possible precursors of photo-oxidation SOA included aromatics and oxygenated VOCs. The nighttime oxidation of aldehydes and ketones by NO3 radicals were important sources of SOA. Aqueous SOA derived from aged biomass burning emissions also contributed markedly to OA. Our results here highlight the previously under-appreciated sources and formation processes of OA in megacities, improving our understanding of OA sources and providing support for more accurate air pollution control strategies."

Despite growing needs such as Nature-Based Solutions, there is a lack of operationalized near-real-time satellite observations of forest fuel conditions to assess whether forests are acting as carbon sinks or emitters. Most existing satellite products focus on chlorophyll content or vegetation cover rather than directly measuring hydrological or thermal variations that influence carbon flux. From Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L-band microwave brightness temperature, we retrieved forest (or canopy) temperatures over the 2023 Canadian and 2021 Sakha Republic wildfires that generated some of the world’s largest carbon emissions. We propose forest canopy temperature as a predictor of natural carbon emissions from mega-wildfires, in comparison with Soil Moisture Active Passive vegetation water content and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 land surface temperature products, which fail to capture the tipping points of thermal development in cold forests. The heat-amplifying feedback between forests and pre-fire sensible heat further accelerates fuel dryness through evapotranspiration driven by snow-melt water and forest warming, leading to the large-scale spread of wildfires. Under such dry conditions, forestation policies may inadvertently increase fuel availability and wildfire risk, potentially leading to an increase in net carbon emissions rather than achieving the intended benefits of carbon sequestration."

In this study, we compared these new satellite measurements with ground-based radar data and found that, after proper corrections, the CPR gives reliable results, especially in ice clouds. This means scientists can confidently use EarthCARE data to better understand clouds and improve weather and climate predictions. 
 The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission was launched on 28 May 2024. One of the most exciting new measurement capabilities of the EarthCARE mission is the CPR Doppler velocity measurement. The availability of Doppler measurements from space will offer a unique opportunity for the collection of a global dataset of vertical motions in clouds and precipitation. An important step in realizing this opportunity is to evaluate the CPR Doppler velocity measurements against those collected by surface-based observatories. Validation with two high-latitude surface-based Doppler radar observatories demonstrates that the CPR Level-2 Doppler velocities exhibit minimal biases (within a few cm s−1), especially in ice clouds. Even in low-level mixed-phase clouds, the CPR's Doppler velocity measurements provide reliable values, although careful consideration is needed for specific limitations such as vertical smoothing effects due to the radar's pulse length. Despite the inherent challenges associated with space-based Doppler measurements, these results suggest strong potential for the EarthCARE mission to provide unprecedented global climatological insights into hydrometeor sedimentation velocities."

To investigate this prolific fire season's impacts on US air quality, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s 72‐hr Unified Forecast System Air Quality Model (UFS‐AQM) is run once‐daily from 15 August–30 September 2020. A meteorological and air quality‐based forecast verification is carried out for this period. The 72‐hr forecasts of near‐surface temperature, moisture, and winds perform quite well against observations in terms of correlation and bias. The UFS‐AQM surface ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) often concur with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirNow station data, though the model ozone displays a consistent positive bias ranging from 8.5 to 15.4 ppb. Anomalously poor PM2.5 predictions are identified during extreme wildfire activity in the Pacific Northwest between 13 and 20 September. Here, in addition to periods of widespread cloudiness, smoke is quite thick. As a result, fire activity is obscured from satellite detection. The UFS‐AQM thus underestimates wildfire emissions in the Pacific Northwest. The lack of dynamic aerosol–radiation interactions in UFS‐AQM coupled with uncertainties in fire emissions leads to a large underestimation of surface PM2.5 there, along with high temperature and low humidity biases. Finally, satellite‐based measurements are also employed to evaluate the UFS‐AQM's performance in the deeper troposphere. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite 550‐nm aerosol optical depth provides additional insights into the UFS‐AQM's handling of smoke transport, while the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument suggests UFS‐AQM suffers from overpredictions of NO2 and CO in active fire regions."

SmartAQ+ demonstrated superior performance compared to SmartAQ that does not use real-time measurements in estimating the present-time PM2.5, reducing the corresponding mean error, fractional bias (FBIAS) and fractional error (FERROR) by a factor of two. SmartAQ+ correctly identified 132 out of 190 PM2.5 exceedance events of the daily limit of 25 μg m−3, compared to SmartAQ's 34, while reducing false positives by a factor of 2 and missed events by a factor of 3. The performance gains depended on the availability of nearby sensors. In data sparse zones and during unusual events the model can inherit biases from the chemical transport model and can underestimate extremes. The study highlights the potential of data fusion models to address the limitations of standalone approaches, offering more precise air quality estimations in areas of a city in which there are no measurements."

 The study examined the ionic composition (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4+, NO3−, Cl−, HCO3−, SO42), trace elements (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, V, Ni, Mn, Co, Mo), S, P, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the snow cover in Vorkuta (Russia, Komi Republic), both before the reconstruction of the fuel and energy complex in 2017 and after gasification in 2023. In 2017, high levels of aerotechnogenic pollution were revealed in Vorkuta and the surrounding area, with an average concentration of 360 mg/L of suspended particles during fuel oil and coal heating. High concentrations of mercury (up to 0.19 μg/L), vanadium (18 μg/L), nickel (18 μg/L) and petroleum products (0.06 mg/L) were also found, exceeding current Russian sanitary and hygiene standards.The morphology, size and elemental composition of particles formed as a result of coal pyrolysis were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The zones of influence of TPP-1, TPP-2, and the Central Boiler House in the urbanised territories of the Vorkuta agglomeration are shown, along with the areas of deposition of various ions, macrocomponents, and heavy metals. The transition to a more environmentally friendly fuel (natural gas) has significantly reduced atmospheric emissions – in 2023, a 40-fold decrease in suspended particles, a 10–20-fold decrease in macrocomponents and a more than 100-fold decrease in mercury, vanadium and aluminium were recorded. Following the shift towards gasification, emissions from fuel and energy facilities became less significant than those from motor vehicles and other urban infrastructure. Vorkuta is no longer a significant 'hot spot' in the Arctic zone."

 This study investigates the impact of forest fires on the spatial distribution of aerosols over the Indian region during the initial phase of the national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April and May 2020. Given the significant reduction in anthropogenic emissions during this period, it provides a suitable opportunity to isolate the effect of fire activity on aerosol loading. The present study conducts a spatial correlation analysis to examine the spatial extent of pollution plumes produced by forest fires over India. Statistically significant correlation analysis (p < 0.05) using Satellite-derived fire and aerosol observations indicates that burning in central India modulates the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Bay of Bengal on the same day. A lag analysis shows that the impacts of fire pollution emitted from Central India persist over Bay of Bengal up to 4 days after the events, which can affect the air quality and thermodynamics of the marine atmosphere. It is also observed that the fire-AOD correlation is more pronounced over the transported regions than at the source region indicating the influential role of transport in shaping unexpected aerosol patterns over India. Present study provides the spatial footprint and temporal persistence of fire-pollution over India using collocated satellite measurements of fire and aerosols, based on physical linkage and empirical evidence."

 Under global warming, Eastern China faces severe challenges from co-occurrences of heat and ozone (O3) pollution extremes (CHOEs). Utilizing long-term observational data, two dominant modes of interannual variability in the summer frequency of CHOEs over Eastern China during 2000–2022 are identified with empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The leading two modes account for nearly 50 % of the total variance. The first mode (EOF1) exhibits a positive anomaly center over the North China Plain (NCP). EOF1 is associated with increased springtime snow cover in Eastern Europe. The thermal anomalies due to snowmelt trigger Rossby wave trains that propagate eastward along the mid-latitude westerly jet, modulating local circulation and consequently CHOE anomalies over NCP. The second mode (EOF2) features a dipole pattern with intensified positive anomalies over the southern urban clusters while weaker negative anomalies in the north. For EOF2, a La Niña-like sea surface temperature pattern induces Rossby waves that propagate along the subtropical jet stream. Meanwhile, springtime sea ice loss over the Barents Sea trigger southeastward propagating wave trains. The combined effects of these remote drivers modulate the local atmospheric circulation across southern urban clusters, ultimately regulating the anomalous CHOE frequency. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the large-scale climate drivers shaping the dominant modes of CHOEs over Eastern China, but also highlight the distinctive teleconnection pathways between northern and southern urban clusters, offering a scientific basis for improving early warning and regional mitigation strategies."

It can have a significant influence on e.g. the scattering and absorption of light, cloud formation, and solar energy production. We present 21 years of optical particle size distribution measurements at a mountain station in Italy, from which we assess Saharan dust transport events. A peak in the number of events was observed in summer and autumn, while a trend in the number of events over the 21 years was not detected. 
 The Mediterranean Basin is regularly affected by atmospheric dust transport from the Saharan desert. These recurring events have strong implications for the Earth’s energy budget, cloud formation processes, human health, and solar energy production. Monte Cimone, with 2165 m a.s.l., is an ideal platform to investigate dust outbreaks in Mediterranean Europe. In this study, we present 21 years (2003–2023) of dust transport event identification, derived from continuous measurements of the aerosol optical size distribution coupled with backward trajectories. Throughout all the years investigated, the fraction of dust transport days remained constant at values between 15 % and 20 % without any detectable trend. This absent trend was also observed in the particulate matter concentration. The annual cycle of dust transport days was characterized by two peaks from May to August and in October and November with values up to 20 %. A similar annual cycle was reflected in the particulate matter concentration with the highest concentrations in summer and the lowest in winter. Grouping consecutive dust transport days into dust transport events revealed that in the winter months a typical event had a duration of one or two days, whereas in the summer months dust transport events lasted longer (three or more days). The 21 years of measurements presented in this study will set a baseline to assess future dust transport scenarios. Furthermore, they can be used to validate dust forecast models to increase the accuracy of predicting atmospheric dust transport towards the Mediterranean Basin."

Results provided the critical insights into understanding of regional O3 pollution genesis with the exceptional natural sources contribution derived from the stratosphere. 
 Stratospheric ozone (O3) intrusion acts as a major natural source of tropospheric O3 affecting atmospheric environment. Targeting a stratospheric intrusion (SI) hotspot, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with the immediately adjoining O3 pollution region of Sichuan Basin (SCB) in Southwest China, this study assesses the contribution of SI to the near-surface O3 over SCB and reveals the multi-scale coupling mechanisms of atmospheric circulations with the seasonally discrepant terrain effects of the TP. Based on the simulations on four selected SI events in 2017, it is estimated that SI over the TP can penetrate deeply into the near-surface atmosphere in SCB, with event-specific maxima of up to 38.7 % in O3 increments, providing an extra contribution of 11.1 %–16.0 % to regional O3 pollution. The evolution of South Asian High in the upper troposphere with the peripheral subsidence in the warm seasons and the subtropical westerly jet over the TP in the cold seasons facilitates tropopause folding, driving stratospheric O3 into the free troposphere. We further identified the dominant processes for SI-derived O3 entering the near-surface layer over the basin with (1) a direct intrusion pathway of downward transport over the central and eastern SCB regions in the warm seasons, and (2) an indirect pathway of downslope transport along the TP-SCB slope into the western SCB region in the cold season, revealing the distinct seasonal effects of TP thermal and mechanical forcing on stratospheric O3 transport into the SCB region. These findings highlight the critical role of the TP in modulating stratosphere-to-troposphere O3 transport and its implications for  regional air quality changes."

Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase with elevation due to the evaporation of fuel oil from low pressure, unlike at lower elevations where tailpipe is predominant. This suggests that specific emission control measures are needed. This research aims to understand emissions at high altitudes and to guide cleaner transport. 
 Vehicular emissions significantly impact atmospheric composition, yet their behavior in high-altitude environments remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of vehicular emissions conducted across ten tunnels on the Tibetan Plateau, encompassing nearly 3000 m of altitudinal variation. Our findings reveal that total emission factors of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase with altitude, driven primarily by a pronounced rise in evaporative emissions. Source apportionment indicates that evaporative emissions contribute 67 % of the total VOCs, markedly outweighing the 24 % from tailpipe exhaust, a pattern that diverges from those observed at lower altitudes, where tailpipe emissions dominate. We identify low atmospheric pressure as the key factor enhancing evaporative VOC release at high altitudes. This study offers critical new insights into the mechanisms of vehicular emissions in plateau regions, underscoring the necessity of accounting for specific environmental conditions and fuel evaporation when formulating emission control strategies for high-altitude settings."

 We describe a new version of the Chicago Water Isotope Spectrometer (ChiWIS), designed for airborne measurements of vapor-phase water isotopologues in the dry upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aboard research aircraft. This version of the instrument is a tunable diode laser (TDL), off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer (OA-ICOS).

Our findings demonstrate strong agreement between online and offline X-ray fluorescence analyses, underscoring the potential of advanced monitoring technologies for air quality research. 
 Measuring the elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) can provide useful information on the adverse effects of PM and facilitate the identification of emission sources. Carrying out these measurements at a high temporal resolution (1 h or less) allows describing the fast processes to which aerosol particles are subjected in the atmosphere, leading to a better characterization of the emissions. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectrometry is one of the most widespread techniques used to determine the elemental composition of PM. In recent years, new systems known as online XRF spectrometers have been developed to provide real-time measurements of the PM elemental concentration at a high temporal resolution. Among these advanced instruments, the Xact® 625i Ambient Metals Monitor by Cooper Environmental (USA) performs in situ automated measurements with a user-selected temporal resolution ranging from 15 to 240 min. In this study, an Xact® 625i monitor equipped with a PM10 inlet was deployed for nearly 6 months (July–December 2023) in Milan (Po Valley, Italy) at a monitoring station of the Lombardy Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (ARPA Lombardia). The instrument was configured to quantify 36 elements, ranging from Al to Bi, with 1 h temporal resolution in the PM10 fraction. The objective of the study was to verify the correct functioning of the instrument and to evaluate the quality and robustness of the data produced. Xact® 625i data were aggregated to 24 h daily means and then compared to 24 h PM10 filter data retrieved by ARPA Lombardia in the same station and analyzed offline for the elemental concentration with a benchtop ED-XRF spectrometer. The intercomparison focused on 16 elements (Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Sr, and Pb) whose concentrations were consistently above their minimum detection limits (MDLs) for both online and offline techniques. The results of the intercomparison were satisfying, showing that the Xact® 625i elemental concentrations were highly correlated to the offline ED-XRF analyses (R2 ranging from 0.67 to 0.99 and slopes ranging from 0.79 to 1.3, with only a few elements showing slopes up to 1.70)."

These heated cables have small cones attached to sense how air moves around them. We found that hollow cone designs detect airflow more accurately than earlier versions. This helps us better understand air movement near the ground and could improve the physical foundations of weather and climate models. 
 This study investigates the impact of microstructure geometry on the thermal and turbulence responses of electrically heated fiber-optic (FO) cables under varying flow conditions and turbulence intensities for the purposes of sensing flow direction. The underlying measurement principle is the directionally sensitive heat loss from electrically heated FO cables with imprinted microstructures exposed to turbulent airflows resembling a long hot-wire anemometer. Using the COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0 finite-element software, this study explores a wider range of different configurations of filled-coned and hollow-coned microstructures of varying size compared to existing studies. The research identifies optimal combinations which maximize temperature differences (ΔT) across FO cables with cones pointing in opposite directions while balancing key design criteria such as sensitivity to wind speed and minimizing the FO-cables' PVC coverage. We demonstrate that FO cables with hollow-coned microstructures (radius = 24 mm, height = 24 mm, and spacing = 15 mm) outperform their filled-coned counterparts, maintaining ΔT values above 2 K across a broader range of wind speeds and turbulence intensities. Notably, the hollow-cone configuration sustains a temperature difference of up to 0.8 K at a 60° wind attack angle. The findings implicate substantial improvements for an optimized FO cable design in atmospheric boundary layer studies, enabling more accurate measurements of wind direction, distributed turbulent heat fluxes, and vertical wind speed perturbations using fiber-optic distributed sensing (FODS). Future work shall validate the findings under field conditions to assess the robustness and real-world applicability of the optimized design."

Wright;Neil P. Hindley,Stratospheric gravity waves in a post-limb sounder era: can GNSS-RO be used to extend the SABER QBO-driving record?,"Gravity waves (GW) influence atmospheric dynamics. One key effect is on the zonal winds in the tropics stratosphere, which drive the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Satellite observations are used to study gravity waves, but each satellite is constrained by its observational limits. This study investigates how GW–QBO interactions are observed by two satellites, SABER and GNSS-RO, and examines the potential for GNSS-RO to extend the GW climatology that is carried out by SABER for 23 years. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a slowly repeating cycle of winds which dominates tropical lower-stratospheric dynamics and has been described as the “heartbeat of the stratosphere”.  However, it is challenging to represent in weather and climate models because its periodicity and magnitude are controlled by small-scale gravity waves (GWs) that cannot be resolved on model grids. To quantify this GW driving we require high-resolution measurements, ideally from satellites to ensure full spatial coverage. Since 2002, the SABER instrument on the TIMED satellite has provided such data, facilitating long-term studies of QBO GW driving. However, SABER is expected to be decommissioned later this year, and no replacement is planned. Here, we assess the possibility of using GNSS-RO data to extend the 23-year SABER record. GNSS-RO  cannot be used as a simple replacement for long-term studies because data volumes are too low before 2006 and for most of the late 2010s, and thus, we ideally wish to supplement rather than replace the  SABER record. However, while the two datasets have broadly similar lower stratospheric resolutions when compared to the full Earth observation constellation, GNSS-RO measurements are higher resolution in all three dimensions than SABER and are oriented differently in 3D space. As a result of this, GNSS-RO GW measurements exhibit much larger GW potential energies (GWPE) and shorter vertical wavelengths than those from SABER. To understand these differences, we use a high-resolution run of the GEOS model to produce synthetic GW measurements, then systematically vary the measurement characteristics between those of the two real instruments. This allows us to identify the key drivers of the different GW properties they measure. We demonstrate that the differences between QBO-driving GW properties measured by the two instruments are primarily due to vertical resolution, with horizontal resolution (either along or across line of sight) and orientation angle playing a negligible role. We further demonstrate that, with a simple vertical smoothing of the GNSS-RO data in the vertical before analysis for GWs, the measured GW properties become near-identical, allowing us to use SABER and GNSS-RO data near-equivalently for this use case. Since GNSS-RO data are now a crucial component of the global numerical weather prediction constellation and are hence highly likely to be available in the long term, this allows us to produce a consistent long-term record of QBO GW forcing from 2002 onwards without key gaps which would be otherwise present in the early 2000s and late 2010s."

Utilizing 2014–2021 Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) observations and the vertical profile heating (VPH) method, we quantify LH over northern East Asia (30°–60°N, 105°–140°E) and document its seasonal, meridional, and land‐sea contrasts. Relative to spring/autumn, summer precipitation exhibits higher rain tops, elevated positive/negative turning points, and stronger LH with peak release occurring 1–2 km higher for comparable near‐surface rain rates or echo‐top heights viewing the average latent heat profiles. From 30°N to 60°N, the heights of maximum heating, the sign‐change (turning) levels, and the LH top all decrease poleward by ∼1–2 km consistent with lower freezing levels in colder climates. The horizontal pattern of LH mirrors both latitude and land‐sea distribution: heating at ∼5 km is amplified over coastal/peninsular regions compared with inland mountains. Spectral analyses show that increasing precipitation intensity shifts profiles toward convective‐type, column‐deep heating and lowers the turning level. Intercomparisons with GPM Goddard convective‐stratiform heating (CSH) and spectral latent heating (SLH) products confirm the temporal and vertical robustness of these patterns; mid‐tropospheric heating is comparable across data sets, whereas VPH retrieves markedly stronger low‐level cooling than CSH/SLH. Uncertainties arise from DPR's limited snowfall sensitivity (winter underestimation) and potential low‐level cold bias in VPH, where raindrop breakup mimics evaporation.

We explore the potential oceanic emissions of NO and its impacts using a global chemistry‐climate model with a newly developed oceanic NO emission inventory, considering the abiotic photochemical production of NO in the seawater. The results are evaluated using global observations from the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom). We propose that the photochemical production of NO from the photolysis of dissolved inorganic nitrite and nitrate in the surface seawater could lead to an oceanic NOx source of ∼3 Tg N per year, which could explain the missing NO in the remote marine boundary layer. This potential oceanic NO source leads to a small but potentially widespread increase in surface ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the remote marine environment, altering our understanding of the role the remote marine atmosphere plays in the global system. Further, the role of the photolysis of nitrate aerosols may be overestimated in recent studies and warrants further investigation."

Numerous aqueous organic aerosols are emitted into the troposphere by biomass burning. The surface of such aqueous organic aerosols is then potentially covered by organic surfactants, modifying its properties and hence also the photosensitized oxidation of gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2). It is therefore desirable to explore how such reactions are influenced by the presence of surfactants. First, we investigated the effect of surfactants on the uptake rate of SO2 on vanillin, 4‐benzoylbenzoic acid, and humic acid films. The uptake coefficient of SO2 is increased by approximately a factor of 2–3 under acidic conditions (a pH of 2), compared to that on the humic acid alone film, especially. Second, ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with high‐resolution mass spectrometry was employed to analyze organosulfur compounds, demonstrating the effect of the surfactant‐covered surface on the products. It was found that surfactants, by promoting the interfacial abundance of photosensitizers, facilitate the formation of organosulfur compounds, indicating that the concentration effect is a critical factor in photosensitized interfacial chemistry of aerosols between the bulk liquid water and the gas phase, as it induces abundant product formation at the air‐aqueous interface."

Ten years ago, a landmark study by Brandt et al. (2014, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1247045) found generally higher top‐down emissions determinations than industry estimates. Here, we revisit this topic by examining 10 years of peer‐reviewed literature that has been published since. A total of 73 results for top‐down/bottom‐up ratios from 57 articles were included. Most of the published literature focuses on methane emissions, with only 11 articles reporting other O&NG emissions. In the newer literature, 49 (86%) of the studies reported that inventory (bottom‐up) emissions underestimated results from determinations based on ambient observations (top‐down). This finding is similar to the Brandt et al. (2014) study, which found that 82% of literature reported higher top‐down emissions than inventory‐based estimates, suggesting little improvement in inventory data accuracy over the past decade despite this discrepancy having been well documented earlier. However, fewer extreme ratio values (top‐down/bottom‐up) >10 were reported after 2014. A meta‐analysis building on carefully selected literature that has been published since 2014 resulted in a mean ratio value of 2.50 ± 0.62, implying that measured emissions were on average 250% of inventory values. For North American countries, the mean ratio values ranged from 2.59 to 3.75, exceeding the global average. The lowest ratio values were observed when United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reports were used as inventory comparisons to top‐down measurements (mean = 1.45); all other inventory types resulted in mean ratios >2."

 Despite the adoption of the Paris Agreement ten years ago, fossil CO2 emissions continue to rise, pushing atmospheric CO2 levels to 423 ppm in 2024 and driving human-induced warming to 1.36°C, within years of breaching the 1.5°C limit 1,2. Accurate reporting of anthropogenic and natural CO2 sources and sinks is a prerequisite to tracking the effectiveness of climate policy and detecting carbon sink responses to climate change. Yet notable mismatches between reported emissions and sinks have so far prevented confident interpretation of their trends and drivers 1. Here, we present and integrate recent advances in observations and process understanding to address some long-standing issues in the global carbon budget estimates. We show that the magnitude of the natural land sink is substantially smaller than previously estimated, while net emissions from anthropogenic land-use change are revised upwards 1. The ocean sink is 15% larger than the land sink, consistent with new evidence from oceanic and atmospheric observations 3,4. Climate change reduces the efficiency of the sinks, particularly on land, contributing 8.3 ± 1.4 ppm to the atmospheric CO2 increase since 1960. The combined effects of climate change and deforestation turn Southeast Asian and large parts of South American tropical forests from CO2 sinks to sources. This underscores the need to halt deforestation and limit warming to prevent further loss of carbon stored on land. Improved confidence in assessments of CO2 sources and sinks is fundamental for effective climate policy."

 Evaluations of model- and reanalysis-based surface solar radiation (SSR) products often depend on satellite-derived estimates, which can be biased, particularly under broken-cloud conditions or over high-albedo surfaces. In this study, we first evaluated JAXA’s Himawari satellite SSR against ground-based observations. We then combined sparse but accurate ground measurements with high-resolution meteorological data to train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that captures and spatiotemporally extrapolates the systematic bias between satellite SSR and ground truth data. Our model is physics-informed, interpretable via feature-attribution analyses, and generalizes across snow-covered terrain. Applying this correction over Japan, we achieved close spatial pattern alignment with a distinct ground-based gridded SSR dataset, which further allowed us to examine the spatial transferability of the correction method. Finally, we used the bias-corrected satellite SSR data to assess a novel high-resolution regional reanalysis, and found that the reanalysis data reproduce expected spatial patterns and overall SSR magnitudes well but tend to slightly overestimate the SSR data under cloudy skies. However, especially under clear skies, the reanalysis remains valuable for refining bias-corrected satellite SSR data in certain high-altitude mountainous regions, where our machine learning model struggles to extrapolate. Overall, the proposed method shows promise for application across platforms and regions, enabling more reliable datasets for climate assessment and downscaling."

 Aerosol water-uptake behavior affects aerosol remote sensing and prediction of visibility, cloud processes, and phenomena sensitive to aerosol liquid water such as heterogeneous chemistry. Aerosol hygroscopic properties are not well characterized seasonally over marine regions, including the northwest Atlantic. The NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) conducted aircraft measurements over the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWAO) with two spatially coordinated aircraft to better understand aerosol-cloud interactions in the region. A statistically dense set of observations of aerosol particle hygroscopicity, composition, size, and optical properties were strategically made below, in, and above boundary layer clouds with instruments on board an HU-25 Falcon aircraft from 2021 to 2022. Results show that median submicron aerosol hygroscopicity f(RH), comparing light scattering at <40 % and 82 % relative humidity, is highest in the winter (1.40 with lower to upper quartiles of 1.21–1.63) over the NWAO, and generally higher farther offshore around clouds as compared to closer to the coast where it is more cloud-free. Higher f(RH) coincides with enhanced inorganic mass fraction, which is dominated by accumulation mode sulfate. In Bermuda, median submicron f(RH) (1.20) is lower than typical clean marine environments, coinciding with transported dust particles. Though f(RH) generally decreases with altitude, there is a slight increase at cloud level presumed to be due to cloud processes related to sulfate, nitrate, and oxidized organics. Our study shows the need to further characterize the variety of processes affecting aerosol hygroscopicity in the NWAO and their impacts on clouds."

 High-resolution retrospective simulations of air quality can generate O3 and PM2.5 concentrations to estimate their health effects and establish a baseline to assess the impacts of future climate and emission scenarios. To this end, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is applied to a triple-nested domain over Brazil, with a high spatial resolution of 3-km over the metropolitan areas of São Paulo (MASP) and Rio de Janeiro (MARJ) for the period of 2012–2016. This work is presented in two-part papers. Part I describes an initial application and evaluation of WRF-Chem for August 2012 to study the impacts of improved inputs and wind speed correction parameterization options on the model performance. These simulations aim to improve the model's accuracy in reproducing the observed meteorological variables and air pollutant levels. The model results with updated land use and cover and urban fraction show a lower positive bias in temperature at 2-m. Updated elevation based on high-resolution (30-m) data reduces the positive bias on wind speed at 10-m for MARJ. The modified wind speed correction reduces the systematic bias of wind speed at 10-m for all domains. WRF-Chem using the combined emissions based on global and local inventories performs well with lower bias and better temporal and spatial representations of historical concentrations of major air pollutants than those using global emissions only. These sensitivity simulations identify the best possible model inputs and wind speed correction parameterization option for simulations for the period of 2012–2016, which will be presented in Part II paper."

 Co-evolving emission controls and a warming climate are reshaping urban air quality. However, the relative weight of these two forces on air pollution trends remains insufficiently quantified over multi-decadal horizons. Here a robust machine learning framework is employed to disentangle weather-driven variability from anthropogenic emission changes, using 32 years of hourly air quality measurements collected at multiple monitoring stations in Vienna, Austria (1991–2022). The investigation focuses on ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and total oxidants (Ox, defined as O3 + NO2). Predictive random forest models, incorporating an extensive set of predictors, were rigorously validated using growing-window forward-validation to preserve chronological order. Results indicate NO2 reductions across all monitoring sites, with sharper decreases in daily maximum values compared to daily means, which suggests that pollution-control measures have been especially effective at curbing high-exposure events. In contrast, O3 trends display marked spatial variation: increasing within built-up areas mostly due to reduced chemical removal (titration), but declining on the city's natural outskirts. Satellite HCHO/NO2 column ratios corroborate the intra-city coexistence of different photochemical regimes. By separating the meteorology-driven fraction of pollutant variability, empirical evidence is found for a dual climate change impact in Central European urban air quality: ongoing warming increasingly favours O3 accumulation (a climate change penalty), while promoting NO2 dispersion (a climate change benefit). These insights suggest the need for spatially targeted emission strategies accounting for local chemistry and underscore that a stronger integration of climate change into air quality management policy and practice is essential."

 Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pose serious environmental and health risks due to their toxicity, persistence, and long-range transport potential. Yet, their seasonal dynamics, regional sources, and nonlinear regulatory mechanisms remain unclear in subtropical coastal regions influenced by monsoonal circulation. We monitored 23 parent and 8 derivative PAHs year-round in Xiamen, China, and applied PMF, trajectory analysis, and XGBoost to investigate their sources and nonlinear environmental drivers. The results revealed clear seasonal variation: particulate-phase PAHs peaked in winter (11.37 ng/m3) and declined in summer (0.13 ng/m3), while gaseous compounds showed the opposite trend. The gas-particle partition coefficients (log Kₚ) showed a strong positive correlation with the octanol-air partition coefficients (log Kₒₐ), while displaying a marked negative correlation with ambient temperature, reflecting the dual influence of compound traits and environmental conditions on phase behavior. PMF identified six major source factors, among which coal combustion and gasoline vehicle emissions were the leading contributors to wintertime toxicity, accounting for 56.73 % of the toxic equivalent (∑TEQ). Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) and Source Region Attribution (SRA) showed that the PAH pollution in Xiamen mainly comes from local source (34 %), northern and northeastern China (46 %) and Southeast Asia and south China Sea (20 %). SHAP-based interpretation of the XGBoost model demonstrated that low-ring PAHs were more sensitive to local meteorological conditions, while high-ring PAHs exhibited stronger association with air mass origins and particle-phase accumulation. These findings reveal seasonal PAH patterns in coastal air and underscore the importance of distinguishing local from transboundary sources."

We assess warm cloud responses by comparing variables important for ACI between GiOcean and satellite observations and further evaluate changes in cloud properties using a source–sink budget framework. 
 Aerosols influence the Earth's radiative balance through direct interactions with radiation and by affecting cloud properties. Anthropogenic aerosols have led to cooling during the industrial era through aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI), including aerosol effects on cloud microphysical properties and the subsequent adjustments.  However, large uncertainties remain in Earth system models (ESMs) regarding the magnitude of this cooling. In part, ESMs substantially disagree on cloud properties, thermodynamics, the hydrological cycle, and general circulation. Reanalysis provides a useful avenue for exploring the impact of ACI on clouds and radiation because its atmosphere is forced to match realistic conditions through the assimilation of observations. Here, we explore the impact of ACI on clouds in the GiOcean reanalysis – the first to incorporate aerosol-cloud interactions. We contrast variables important for ACI between GiOcean and satellite observations and develop 2-dimensional lookup tables of ACI for both using a source-sink budget perspective to attribute the changes in cloud droplet number (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol and meteorology. A compositing analysis using lookup tables shows that GiOcean captures key aspects of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions, including (1) activation of aerosol into cloud droplets, (2) effective precipitation scavenging of Nd, (3) suppression of precipitation by high Nd in regions with heavy aerosol emissions. In contrast, satellite observations do not exhibit clear patterns for processes (2) and (3). Random Forest analysis shows that interannual variability in Nd and LWP over the Northern Hemisphere ocean in GiOcean is primarily driven by precipitation, consistent with satellite observations."

The drought stress impact on isoprene emissions is still uncertain, and we aimed to constrain it in South Korea using observation and model simulation. The results presented in this study may give useful information for future studies on drought stress on isoprene emissions. 
 Biogenic isoprene emissions play an important role in air quality so it is important to quantify their response to extreme events such as drought. This study aims at constraining drought stress on biogenic isoprene emissions in South Korea using satellite formaldehyde (HCHO) column, the key product of isoprene oxidation, and a chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem) with Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1). It was found that the HCHO column from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) increased by 5.4 % under the drought condition compared to the normal condition, but GEOS-Chem simulated a 20.23 % increase indicating an overestimation of isoprene emissions under drought. We implemented two existing drought stress algorithms in MEGAN2.1 and found they were not effective to reduce HCHO column biases in South Korea because those algorithms were proposed and developed for the Southeast United States (SE US). To improve this, we applied an iterative finite difference mass balance (IFDMB) method to estimate isoprene emissions using the OMI HCHO column. With this method, isoprene emissions were reduced by 60 % under the drought condition compared to those simulated by the standard MEGAN2.1 implemented in GEOS-Chem. The increase of HCHO column under the drought condition compared to the normal condition was also reduced to 10.71 %, which is comparable to that in the satellite retrievals. Based on isoprene emission difference between MEGAN2.1 and IFDMB, we developed the empirical equations to adjust isoprene emissions in South Korea that also improved model prediction of the secondary pollutant such as ozone."

Our results reveal that the commonly used biomass burning emission inventories significantly underestimate the fire emissions and emphasize the importance of the ground-based remote sensing data in reducing uncertainties in the estimated emissions. 
 We perform a global inverse modelling analysis to quantify biomass burning emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) from the extreme wildfires in Canada between May and September 2023. Using the GEOS-Chem model, we assimilated observations at 3 d temporal and 2° × 2.5° horizontal resolution from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) separately and then jointly with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements. We also evaluated prior emissions from the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED), Blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product eXtended (GBBEPx), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), and Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CFFEPS). The assimilation of TROPOMI-only measurements estimated posterior North America emissions for QFED, GBBEPx, GFAS, and CFFEPS of 110.4 ± 20, 112.8 ± 20, 127.2 ± 17, and 125.6 ± 18 Tg CO compared to prior estimates of 37.1, 42.7, 91.0, and 90.2 Tg CO, respectively. The joint assimilation of TROPOMI+TCCON reduced the posterior 1σ uncertainty on the North American emission estimates by up to about 30 %, while showing only a modest impact (<5 %) on the mean estimate of the inferred emissions. An evaluation against independent measurements reveals that adding TCCON data increases the correlations and slightly lowers the biases and standard deviations. Additionally, including an experimental TCCON product at East Trout Lake with higher surface sensitivity, we find better agreement of the assimilation results with nearby in situ tall tower and aircraft measurements. This highlights the potential importance of vertical sensitivity in these experimental data for constraining local surface emissions. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of the greater temporal coverage provided by TCCON with the spatial coverage of TROPOMI when these data are jointly assimilated."

Temperature and interannual variability were key drivers, with urban reductions concentrated in urban core zones and suburbs. The effect of interannual variability on PM decreased significantly, while other factors showed periodic fluctuations. 
 Understanding the urban-rural patterns and driving drivers behind the recent decrease in particulate matter (PM) pollution across eastern China is essential for assessing the efficacy of environmental policies and ensuring equitable health co-benefits. By employing an interpretable, end-to-end machine learning framework integrating satellite observations, meteorological factors, and auxiliary datasets, this study reveals changes in urban and rural PM pollution and the underlying drivers. During the period 2015–2023, the average decrease rates of PM10 and PM2.5 in eastern China were −4.02 ± 1.29 and −2.41 ± 0.91 µg m−3 yr−1, respectively. The rate of decrease in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas, which played a dominant role in PM reduction. Significant reductions in PM concentrations were observed in urban core areas, suburbs, towns and regions with high agricultural pressure. The interpretability analysis showed that temperature and interannual variability were the main drivers of PM pollution reduction. However, only interannual variability showed a significant decreasing trend in its effect on PM pollution, while other driving factors showed periodic variations. Furthermore, there were differences in the drivers of PM reduction between urban and rural areas, particularly with interannual variability in particular contributing to PM pollution reduction in urban areas, but having a lesser impact in most rural areas. This study reveals the urban-rural patterns of PM pollution reduction in eastern China, and highlights the need for differentiated air pollution control strategies in urban and rural areas."

Asa-Awuku,Hygroscopicity of isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol mixture proxies: importance of diffusion and salting-in effects,"This study looks at how natural compounds when mixed with salts in the air affect how clouds form. These compounds come from plants and are found all over the world. They are sticky, and this changes how water droplets and clouds form. Sometimes the compound spreads more easily when mixed with salt, while the other compound does not change. Depending on the condition, these mixtures can behave differently, which affects how we predict cloud formation. 
 Isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituents, such as the 2-methyltetrols (2-MT) and 2-methyltetrol sulfates (2-MTS), have been readily detected in atmospheric aerosols (PM2.5) and within mixtures containing ammonium sulfate (AS). Despite its prevalence, the water uptake of 2-MT, 2-MTS, and their mixtures is not well understood. In this study, we determine the physicochemical properties (e.g., surface activity, diffusivity, phase morphology) of synthesized 2-MT and 2-MTS samples and their mixtures with AS. 2-MT and 2-MTS have been identified as surface active and viscous. Thus, dynamic surface tension (σs/a) measurements were taken to determine organic diffusion coefficients (Ds). The droplet growth of organic / AS mixtures was measured under subsaturated conditions using a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) at 88.2 % RH ±1.5 %. Droplet activation was measured under supersaturated (>100 % RH) conditions using a cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC); supersaturation (SS) ranged from 0.3 %–1.4 %. Hygroscopicity in both regimes was parameterized by the single hygroscopicity parameter κ.This study demonstrates how diffusion and salting-in effects influence the water uptake of synthesized, isoprene-derived SOA mixtures. Results show that when mixed with AS, organic diffusion for 2-MTS / AS becomes an order of magnitude faster, while 2-MT diffusivity remains unchanged. Both 2-MT / AS and 2-MTS aerosols present a plateau in subsaturated κ values close to pure AS. However, under supersaturated conditions, 2-MTS / AS behaves ideally and well mixed and can be characterized by κ-Köhler theory. Isoprene-derived SOAs like 2-MT and 2-MTS samples are ubiquitous, and thus, the impact from biogenic sources and its non-ideal thermodynamic properties must be considered in aerosol–cloud interactions."

We have assessed ammonia emissions using real-world measurements on the island, demonstrated emission decrease, and proposed a network to improve emission monitoring. 
 Quantifying real-world emission reductions is a core goal of atmospheric inversion methods, yet direct validation against known events remains rare, especially for reactive species like ammonia. In this study, we have applied local-scale Bayesian inversions using ground-based measurements and the LOTOS-EUROS air quality model, with high-resolution emission inventories as prior input, not to explore a theoretical scenario, but to evaluate a documented emission reduction. On the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Netherlands, where GVE (grazing livestock units) decreased from 639 to 541, with a particularly notable reduction in dairy cattle, ammonia emissions are expected a 23 % reduction between 2019 and 2022. Our inversion captured a similar trend, estimating a 51 % decrease, which may be overestimated, largely attributed to uncertainties in the 2019 posterior emissions.  The posterior for 2022 shows consistency with the validation and indicates a 27 % reduction compared with the prior emissions of 2019. The associated uncertainty, derived from the posterior error covariance, highlights both the potential of the method and its limitations for policy verification. Moreover, we developed a method to assess the usefulness of individual observations and propose that adding a single high-quality continuous measurement in a strategically chosen location can significantly enhance the inversion performance. This strengthens the observational constraint and enhances the system’s ability to resolve temporal variations in emissions."

Major contributions to the budget arise from the correction of the analog non-linearity, the black body characterization, the scan mirror reflectivity and the background radiance instability. The estimated uncertainty remains relatively stable throughout the lifetime of the instruments. 
 The Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer onboard the Eumetsat MetOp (Meteorological Operational) polar orbit satellite series. The three MetOp satellites (A, B, and C) were launched in October 2006, September 2012 and November 2018, respectively. IASI-B and IASI-C are still operational, while IASI-A was decommissioned in November 2021. IASI's mission is to provide accurate atmospheric spectra primarily for meteorological and climate applications, and as such a high measurement precision is required. Furthermore, the estimation of the measurement uncertainty is a valuable element, especially concerning climate studies and the establishment of long climate series. This study presents the global radiometric uncertainty budget as estimated for the IASI instruments. Four major contributors, the correction of the analog non-linearity, the black body characterization, the scan mirror reflectivity, and the background radiance instability, have been identified and their impact is presented alongside other minor contributors. For black body or earth view scenes under investigation, the global budget was found to be lower than 0.2 K for a reference temperature of 280 K, when all uncertainties were considered fully correlated. These estimates are expected to remain relatively stable throughout the instrument lifetime."

The concentrations of most gases increased and were higher than at two other Antarctic stations. Their sources were linked to industrial activities such as refrigeration and electronics. Although limited to one year, the data provide important background information for detecting future changes in the Antarctic atmosphere. 
 As potent greenhouse gases with high global warming potentials, fluorinated gases (F-gases) have emerged as significant contributors to global radiative forcing. Owing to minimal anthropogenic influences, Antarctica provides an exceptional natural environment for investigating background atmospheric F-gas concentrations. This study presents the first comprehensive report of temporal variations in 11 F-gas species at the Zhongshan National Atmospheric Background Station (ZOS; 69.4° S, 76.4° E) throughout 2021. This study is the first to provide concentration changes of 11 F-gases at ZOS in Antarctica in 2021. The datasets are publicly available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.302283 (Tian et al., 2025). The concentrations of most F-gases significantly increased throughout 2021 at ZOS. The concentrations of F-gases in East Antarctica were greater than those in the Antarctic Peninsula and the interior on the basis of data comparisons with three other Antarctic stations. Back trajectory and clustering analyses using the HYSPLIT model revealed that the contributions of different trajectory clusters were nearly identical at each station.  Source apportionment analysis via the PMF model identified industrial processes, refrigeration, fire suppression, and electronics as key contributors to F-gas concentrations in the Antarctic atmosphere. While the one-year observation period precludes long-term trend assessment, these high-frequency measurements capture the baseline variability critical for detecting future anomalies. Continuous multiyear monitoring at ZOS is necessary to establish statistically robust growth rates."

Compared to an instantaneous dispersion approach, the plume approach estimates 15 % lower aviation aerosol number concentrations, due to more efficient coagulation at plume scale. The model is sensitive to background conditions and initialization parameters, such as ice crystal number concentration and fuel sulfur content. 
 Aviation emissions of aerosol particles and aerosol precursor gases alter the Earth's radiation budget via both direct and indirect aerosol effects, resulting in a significant climate effect. Current estimates of aviation-induced climate effects are based on coarse-resolution global aerosol-climate models, which are not able to resolve the microphysical processes at the aircraft plume scale. This results in large uncertainties in the aviation-induced impact on aerosol number and size, which are key quantities for estimating the aerosol indirect effect, especially for low-level liquid-phase clouds. In this work, a double-box aircraft exhaust plume model is developed to explicitly simulate the aerosol microphysics inside a dispersing aircraft exhaust plume, together with a simplified representation of the vortex regime (which begins ∼ 10 s after the aircraft emissions and captures the dynamics of aerosol particle interactions with contrail ice particles). The aircraft exhaust plume model is used to quantify the aviation-induced aerosol number concentration at the end of the dispersion regime (∼46 h) and the results are compared with the result obtained by the instantaneous dispersion approach commonly applied by the global models. The difference between the plume approach (simulated using two boxes) and the instantaneous dispersion approach (simulated by a single box) is defined as the plume correction: for typical cruise conditions over the North Atlantic and typical aviation emission parameters, the plume correction for aviation-induced particle number concentration ranges between −15 % and −4.2 %, depending on the presence or absence of the contrail ice in the vortex regime, respectively. A tendency-based process analysis shows that the negative value of the plume correction is due to the higher efficiency of coagulation and nucleation processes in the plume approach, leading to lower total particle number concentrations compared to the instantaneous dispersion approach. Sensitivity studies over different regions highlight the role of background conditions for the plume microphysics, with the plume correction varying between −12 % for Europe and −42 % for China in a scenario with contrail ice in the vortex regime. Parametric studies performed on various aviation emission parameters used to initialise the plume model demonstrate the high relevance of contrail ice in the vortex regime to considerably reduce the aviation-induced aerosol number concentration in the plume approach. Moreover, the parametric studies show a large sensitivity towards aviation fuel sulfur content, driving sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) formation, which in turn is a primary driver for the nucleation process. Thanks to its flexible configuration and minor additional computational costs, the plume model presented here can readily be applied in coarse-resolution global aerosol-climate models or used as offline parametrisation to quantify the climate effects of aviation-induced aerosol particles."

The growth rate of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and net ecosystem exchange flux in East Asia were significantly positively correlated with the Niño3.4 SST index six to nine months and five to seven months, respectively, after the El Niño peak. Temperature anomalies exhibited distinct spatial characteristics, with negative (positive) anomalies in the developing (decaying) summer of the El Niño. The temperature anomalies mainly led to changes in vegetation respiration, which subsequently contributed to a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations after El Niño. The findings for the interactions between El Niño and the carbon cycle provide fundamental insights for enhancing our understanding of the potential impacts of future climate variability on the carbon cycle in East Asia."

 Satellite remote sensing has provided valuable information on fire radiative power (FRP), which is an important indicator for estimating biomass burning emissions and understanding fire dynamics. However, FRP evaluation faces challenges due to limited field measurements and the high variability of satellite sensor characteristics. Previous studies have tried to quantify the uncertainty of FRP by intercomparison, but they are limited to small numbers of cases and are not free from the detection capacity. To address this issue, we presented a comprehensive global evaluation of FRP from three satellite sensors—Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)—by integrating all possible fire clusters after minimizing differences in fire occurrence detection while preserving inherent differences in detection extent across sensors. Furthermore, we applied extended triple collocation analysis (ETC) to evaluate the consistency of FRP without relying on true reference data for the first time. Intercomparative results highlight robust consistency when the fire clusters overlap well across all three sensors, even under varying sample selection criteria. Notably, SLSTR and VIIRS have slightly higher FRP than MODIS, even after aligning detected fire events, due to the superiority of observing small or weak fires at the edge of fire clusters. ETC revealed high consistency in boreal forests, where large-scale, strong fire clusters are well matched. In contrast, uncertainties remain in South Africa because of highly variable fire dynamics in that area. This study contributes to understanding the regional characteristics of FRP and provides a robust framework for global-scale FRP assessments as new satellite datasets become available."

 Air quality in central Taiwan is strongly influenced by meteorological conditions, particularly sea-land breeze circulation and atmospheric vertical stability, which govern the horizontal transport and vertical dispersion of pollutants. Douliu City, an inland urban area, experienced the highest PM2.5 concentrations in the region. Despite nearly a 50% reduction in PM2.5 levels from 2005 to 2020 due to emission control measures, stable atmospheric conditions accompanied by low average wind speeds (∼1.4 m s−1) continued to favor pollutant accumulation. This study combined long-term observations with an intensive autumn 2015 field campaign in Douliu, utilizing surface aerosol optical measurements and ground-based remote sensing instruments. Results indicated that daytime sea breezes transported pollutants from coastal to inland areas within 2–4 h, increasing surface PM2.5 concentrations from 39 to 54 μg m−3 and reducing AE440–870 from 1.34 to 1.04 (i.e., coarser particle). At night, the planetary boundary layer descended from approximately 1 km to below 300 m, resulting in elevated surface PM2.5 concentrations and higher AE450–700 values, which reflected the accumulation of fine-mode aerosols. Analyses of both surface and vertical measurements demonstrated that the effects of sea-land breeze circulation significantly influenced pollutant transport and accumulation, leading to higher PM2.5 concentrations in the inland site compared to the coastal site. Moreover, atmospheric stability plays a critical role, as low wind speeds and temperature inversions favor pollutant accumulation and suppress the vertical dispersion of aerosols in inland regions. This study highlights the critical role of meteorology in shaping inland air quality and suggests that future research to focus on vertical profiling with lidar and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to better elucidate pollutant accumulation mechanisms."

Ferrare,Aerosol extinction and backscatter Optimal Estimation  retrieval for High Spectral Resolution Lidar,"Advanced lidars can retrieve atmospheric aerosol backscatter, extinction, and linear depolarization ratio. However excessive noise propagation in the traditional inversion method can make extinction unusable when the signal is weak, such as from space. Implementing a weak constraint can reduce the noise propagation while preserving accuracy. Here we also focus on fully characterizing both random and systematic uncertainties and examining the tradeoff between uncertainty and resolution. 
 High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs) have been successfully deployed from a variety of platforms: ground based, airborne, and now satellite. These lidars are uniquely valuable for characterizing atmospheric aerosol and clouds, benefiting from the ability to characterize vertical variability in more detail than any passive instruments, and, compared to elastic backscatter lidars, provide additional channels of measurements that permit the direct retrieval of particulate extinction. Although analytic solutions exist for deriving particulate backscatter, extinction, and linear depolarization ratio, in the case of extinction, the analytic technique greatly magnifies measurement noise. Low signal-to-noise measurements stress the traditional inversion methods. Accordingly, algorithms for the retrieval of HSRL backscatter and extinction are re-examined and optimized to reduce the noise propagation. Here we explore an Optimal Estimation methodology and compare it with an implementation of the direct differentiation method like that historically used for the processing of airborne HSRL data from NASA Langley Research Center."

 The assimilation of satellite spectral sounder data requires fast and accurate radiative transfer models. This study proposes a novel methodology to automatically parameterize atmospheric optical depths within the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) version 13 scheme using statistical thresholds across pressure levels and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to induce sparsity. Numerical experiments with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) infrared channels demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The sparsity also facilitates the automatic selection of absorbing gases and predictors by channel and pressure level, making it particularly effective for multispectral instruments with numerous atmospheric variables.

The results show that including cloud- and precipitation-affected satellite data improves forecasts of moisture, wind, and clouds, especially in the tropics. This work highlights the potential of this new ensemble data assimilation system to enhance global weather forecasts. 
 The Gain-form of Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LGETKF) has been implemented in the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) with the Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere (MPAS-A) (i.e., MPAS-JEDI). LGETKF applies vertical localization in model space and is particularly convenient for assimilating satellite radiances that do not have an explicit vertical height assigned to each channel. Additional efforts are made to optimize the ensemble analysis procedure and improve the computational efficiency of MPAS-JEDI's LGETKF. This is the first application of JEDI-based LGETKF for assimilating radiance data in all-weather situations with a global MPAS configuration. The system is first tuned for covariance inflation and horizontal localization settings. It is found that using a combination of relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) and relaxation to prior spread (RTPS) outperforms using RTPP or RTPS alone, and using a smaller horizontal localization scale for all-sky radiances is preferable. With the optimized inflation and localization settings, assimilating all-sky radiances of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit – A (AMSU-A) window channels with an 80-member LGETKF improved the forecasts of moisture, wind, clouds, and precipitation fields, when compared to the benchmark experiment without assimilation of all-sky AMSU-A radiances. The positive forecast impact of all-sky AMSU-A radiances is the largest over the tropical regions up to 7 d. Some degradation in the temperature forecasts is seen over certain regions, where the model forecast is likely biased, causing deficiencies for assimilating all-sky data. The LGETKF capability is available in the recent public release of MPAS-JEDI and is ready for research and operational explorations."

 Soil carbon changes are difficult to measure globally, and global models are poorly constrained. Here, we propose a framework to map annual changes in soil carbon and litter (SOCL) as the difference between the net land CO2 flux from atmospheric inversions and satellite-based maps of biomass changes. We show that SOCL accumulated globally at a rate of about 0.34 ± 0.30 ( ± 1 sigma) billion tonnes of carbon per year (PgC yr−1) during 2011-2020. The largest SOCL sink is found in boreal regions (0.93 ± 0.45 PgC yr−1 in total) particularly in undisturbed peatlands and managed forests. The largest losses occur in the dry tropics (−0.50 ± 0.47 PgC yr−1) and correspond with agricultural expansion from land use change, cropland management and grazing. By contrast, forests in the wet tropics act as a net soil carbon sink (0.32 ± 0.35 PgC yr−1). Our findings highlight the large mitigation opportunities in the dry tropics to restore agricultural soil carbon.

A study now evaluates the health impacts of different PM2.5 reduction strategies, providing evidence of their effectiveness across different regions and timeframes. 
 Long-term PM2.5 exposure is a risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Here a global health impact assessment was conducted utilizing seven future scenarios evaluating strategies to reduce PM2.5 exposure. Strategies included reducing fossil fuel use, air pollution control, adopting cleaner cooking methods and combinations thereof. Under current trends, air quality is projected to improve by 2050; nevertheless, the absolute attributable burden of ischaemic heart disease, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains high in many regions. Cleaner cooking fuel use is effective in the short term (by 2030) in South and Central America, Asia, and Africa for reducing PM2.5-related deaths. In the long term (by 2050) for most regions, only strategies that simultaneously target ambient and cooking-related PM2.5 resulted in sustained improvements that expand beyond current trends for reducing disease burden across these three health outcomes. In the Asian region, for example, under current trends, the population-attributable fraction decreases from 35% in 2015 to 18% in 2050. In the scenario combining universal clean cooking and climate policy, it drops further to 15%, and when all strategies are combined, it reaches as low as 11% by 2050. With all strategies combined, the average global population-weighted PM2.5 exposure from both ambient and cooking sources is reduced by nearly two-thirds (66 µg m−3 compared with 26 µg m−3). For North Africa and the Middle East region, the population-attributable fraction remains high across all scenarios. Additional strategies beyond those mentioned here are required to further improve air quality. It is recommended to pursue climate mitigation alongside universal access to cleaner household fuels to maximize cardiopulmonary health benefits. Exposure to air pollution poses a substantial risk to health, contributing to high rates of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. A study now evaluates the health impacts of different PM2.5 reduction strategies, providing evidence of their effectiveness across different regions and timeframes."

 Accurate methane (CH4) emission estimates from Arctic and boreal wetlands are essential for reducing global budget uncertainties but are hindered by poorly constrained wetland distribution and classification. We assessed how land cover map resolution and thematic detail influence these estimates. Using very high spatial resolution land cover maps (≤2.5 m) with five to seven harmonized classes and 4–50% wetland coverage, we estimated CH4 emissions across seven Arctic and boreal sites in North America and Eurasia. Resampling to coarser resolutions (up to 5 km) revealed that CH4 flux estimates remained within 13% error when resolution was ≤25 m pixel size. At resolutions coarser than 1 km, four of seven sites shifted from net CH4 source to sink, due to misrepresentation of wetland extent in heterogeneous landscapes with small, fragmented wetlands. Thematic detail also proved critical, as fens—high CH4 emitters—were disproportionately underrepresented in coarse (>1 km) maps relative to other wetland types. We also show that existing global or circumpolar land cover maps tend to misrepresent wetlands, either overlooking smaller features or overestimating coverage in wetland dominated areas. Our findings indicate that coarse-scale land cover datasets are unsuitable for estimating CH4 budgets in these regions, where high spatial resolution and biogeochemically relevant land cover classes are essential for reliable CH4 emission upscaling.

 In recent efforts to reduce the radiative forcing of aviation, fuel design has gained increased attention. Sustainable Aviation Fuels are seeing wider adoption, and their positive impact on carbon dioxide and non-volatile soot particle emissions is well-established. However, the effects of the reduction in fuel sulfur content on volatile particle emissions and contrails are unknown. This study presents observations from in-flight measurements of emissions and contrails of an Airbus A350-900 burning fuels with different sulfur contents. We find a reduction in volatile particles and contrail ice crystals for low-sulfur fuels. For higher fuel sulfur contents, our findings demonstrate an additional contrail ice particle source through activation of sulfate aerosols. Our data-driven results need to be consolidated by in-flight observations with different fuels and engines. Eventually, climate impact estimates as well as regulations should account for the modulating effect of the fuel sulfur content on contrail ice particle numbers.

 Ship emissions are a major source of aerosols over oceans, affecting both air quality and energy balance of the climate. However, estimates of their climate forcing diverge between studies relying on visible ship-tracks and those based on models. Here we show that forcing due to visible ship-tracks accounts for just 5% of the total forcing over the southeast Atlantic shipping-lane. Most forcing from ship emissions comes from aerosols that do not form detectable ship-tracks. They are only tips of the iceberg. We make three forcing calculations, one bottom-up based on visible ship-tracks, one top-down based on spatial relationships, and a hybrid approach that combines top-down or model estimated cloud droplet number concentration changes and cloud adjustments. Although the forcing based on machine learning detected ship tracks is an order of magnitude greater than prior results using manually detected ship-tracks, it remains only 5% of that inferred by top-down or cloud adjustment based methods for pre-2020 shipping. The top-down and the combined cloud adjustments methods show similar forcing for the post-2020 reduction in ships’ sulfur emission, although the methods have important regional differences in cloud adjustments that need further investigation. Our results reconcile a long-standing discrepancy in the literature and have important implications for aerosol indirect forcing and marine cloud brightening.

 The eruption of Hunga volcano on 15 January 2022 was an exceptional event in the satellite era. Record-breaking heights of the volcanic plume were reported, a large amount of water was injected into the stratosphere and a broad spectrum of atmospheric waves were detected. Here, we use satellite measurements to show that a transient ring of small ice particles (~2 μm) formed around the plume. We hypothesize that the ice ring was generated by the passage of an atmospheric wave triggered by a pressure pulse at the surface corresponding to a violent explosion that occurred during the 15 January 2022 eruption sequence. The passage of the atmospheric wave produced a transient rarefaction in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere, which in turn led to oscillations in ambient temperature. Due to the supersaturated state of the atmosphere with respect to ice, ice particles formed in the wake of the radially propagating atmospheric wave, allowing an exceptional opportunity to study ice particle growth via vapour deposition. This atmospheric phenomenon serves as an important natural experiment that reveals the time scale on which ice particles nucleate and grow given an abrupt perturbation in ambient temperature.

 In this study, a Rapid Multi-Temporal Pollution Assessment System (RMT-PAS) has been developed based on a trend-decomposition explainable machine learning (ML) method, which was used to isolate and quantify the contributions of meteorology (MET) and anthropogenic emissions (EMIS) to the ambient PM2.5/O3 levels at different scales such as inter-annual, seasonal and typical pollution events. The RMT-PAS employed a stacking ensemble technique integrating the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models to establish the nonlinear response relationship between PM2.5/O3 pollution levels and multiple meteorological elements as well as emission components, and achieved high predictive accuracy. Inter-annual analysis (2015–2020) showed that reductions in EMIS accounted for 53.1 %–158.9 % of the observed decreases in annual-mean PM2.5, whereas for O3 the MET contribution increased substantially and displayed strong regional heterogeneity (−126.5 % to +48.6 %). Seasonal analyses indicated that MET contributions to PM2.5 exhibited the greatest fluctuation in winter, followed by autumn, spring, and summer (mean standard deviations: 5.13, 3.82, 2.95, and 2.00 μg/m3). In contrast, for O3, the highest fluctuation occurred in summer, followed by autumn, spring, and winter (5.72, 4.70, 3.48, and 2.11 μg/m3). The analysis of typical pollution events further revealed that PM2.5 pollution were mainly driven by boundary layer height (PBLH), relative humidity (RHU) and sea-level pressure (PRS_Sea), whereas O3 pollution were primarily controlled by temperature (TEM) and RHU. The developed RMT-PAS system can support government and environmental regulators in conducting long-term assessments and implementing timely, effective control measures during emergency events."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108627,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文分析了印度Gadanki地区热带对流层顶反演层（TIL）的年代际变化及其辐射驱动因素。它利用2006年至2024年的无线电探空仪数据，研究了对流层顶高度、TIL宽度和强度的变化趋势。研究发现，对流层顶高度呈正趋势，而TIL宽度和强度呈负趋势，表明未来气候变暖可能导致TIL变弱变窄。此外，论文还分析了臭氧和水汽对UTLS区域加热率的影响，发现夏季更强更窄的TIL是由于臭氧在LS中的辐射加热和水汽在UT中的冷却造成的。这项研究首次提供了热带地区辐射强迫对TIL形成和维持的观测证据，与大气成分分析和气候变化密切相关。,"['Tropopause Inversion Layer (TIL)', 'Radiosonde data', 'Ozone', 'Water vapor', 'UTLS (Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere)', 'Radiative forcing', 'Climate change', 'Atmospheric composition']",K.P.

Venkat Ratnam,Decadal changes in the Tropical Tropopause Inversion Layer and its radiative drivers over Gadanki (2006–2024),"•A warming climate in the future, results in a weaker and narrower TIL. •A strong temperature inversion in the UTLS could result in a stronger TIL in summer. •The formation of TIL can be influenced by other dynamical processes. 
 The upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), due to their minimum temperature, play an important role in radiation escaping to space and, thus, climate feedback. The tropopause, separating the well-mixed troposphere and the stably stratified stratosphere, is a good indicator of climate change, as it is sensitive to the concentration of radiatively active species. A highly stable layer above the tropopause, the Tropopause Inversion Layer (TIL), was confirmed to exist across all latitudes and seasons. Studying the TIL is essential for understanding the composition of the UTLS. The trends in key TIL parameters, the width and strength, and the radiative effects of water vapor and ozone on TIL formation over the tropical station, Gadanki (13.5oN, 79.2°E), India, based on radiosonde data spanning from 2006 to 2024, are investigated. The tropopause height shows a positive trend of 0.08 ± 0.06 km/decade, suggesting a future climate warming with a weaker and narrower TIL, as indicated by the negative trend in TIL width (−0.2 ± 0.07 km/decade) and TIL strength (−1.35*10−5 ± 1.63*10−5 km/decade). A heating rate analysis in the UTLS region due to ozone and water vapor reveals that, the stronger and narrower TIL in summer is a result of radiative heating due to ozone in LS and cooling due to water vapor in UT, leading to an enhanced temperature inversion, and modulating the UTLS, potentially impacting climate change via tropopause. Present study provides the first time observational evidence of radiative forcing on TIL formation and maintenance over a tropical station for summer."

Schooling;Paul I. Palmer;Auke Visser;Nicolas Bousserez,Development of a parametrised atmospheric NOx chemistry scheme to help quantify fossil fuel CO2 emission estimates,"This study presents a new method to estimate fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions by modelling NOx chemistry. Our regression models predict NOx chemical rates and NO2 : NO ratios with R² values above 0.95 using meteorological inputs. Incorporating these regressions reduces computational time compared to traditional methods and enables integration into model inversion frameworks. This scalable approach supports global emissions monitoring and climate change mitigation efforts. 
 Success of the Paris Agreement relies on rapid reductions in fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions. Atmospheric data can verify the ffCO2 reductions pledged by nations in their nationally determined contributions. However, estimating ffCO2 from atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to natural fluxes and varying backgrounds. One approach is to combine with nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), which are co-emitted with CO2 during combustion. A key challenge in using NOx to estimate ffCO2 is the computational cost of modelling atmospheric photochemistry. Additionally, the NO2 : NO column ratio must be well understood to convert model NOx columns to NO2 columns for comparison with satellite data. We use random forest regression to parameterise NOx chemistry, relying only on meteorological parameters and NOx concentration. The regression is trained on outputs from a nested GEOS (Goddard Earth Observing System)-Chem model simulation for mainland Europe in 2019. We develop a monthly NOx chemistry parameterisation that performs well when tested on perturbed emission runs (R2 > 0.95) and on unseen meteorology for 2021 (R2 > 0.79). We also parameterise the NO2 : NO ratio (R2 > 0.99 on perturbed outputs, R2 > 0.92 on unseen meteorology). Additionally, we present an alternative method to predict NOx rates by scaling baseline NOx rates with changes in NOx concentration (R2 = 1.0 on perturbed outputs). Our models reproduce NO2 columns with minimal deviation from full-chemistry models, with reconstruction error smaller than the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) precision in over 99.9 % of cases, supporting robust ffCO2 inversion efforts. These results provide a robust framework for accurately estimating fossil fuel CO2 emissions from atmospheric data, enabling more reliable monitoring and verification of global emissions reductions."

Schiferl;Andrew Hallward-Driemeier;Yuwei Zhao;Ricardo Toledo-Crow;Róisín Commane,Missing wintertime methane emissions from  New York City related to combustion,"Identifying and quantifying methane emissions from urban sources is important for mitigating climate change. Using 6 years of winter and spring observations, we found that methane emissions from New York City are highly variable and underestimated compared to inventories, especially in winter, and correlate well with emissions of carbon monoxide (CO). Our results suggest a common urban incomplete combustion source for both methane and CO currently missing from emissions inventories. 
 Accurately quantifying methane emissions from cities, and understanding the processes that drive these emissions, is important for reaching climate mitigation goals. Methane emissions from New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA), the most populous urban area of the United States, have consistently been underestimated by emission inventories compared to aircraft and satellite observations. In this study, we used continuous rooftop measurements of methane over six winter-to-spring transitions (January–May 2019–2024) to examine the variability of city-scale methane enhancements (ΔCH4) and estimate methane emissions from the NYCMA. We found large variability in the 10 d mean observed ΔCH4 (∼50–250 ppbv) and monthly afternoon methane emissions rates (10.1–30.4 kg s−1) within and between the years of our study period. A recently released high-resolution regional methane emission inventory developed for the NYCMA performed better than other global and national inventories against the rooftop observations but still underestimated methane emissions, especially in winter. The estimates of methane emissions correlated with those of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, determined from coincident measurements, suggesting a common city-scale incomplete combustion source for both methane and CO. Our analysis of these continuous measurements also implies a consistent diurnal cycle in urban methane emissions from the NYCMA, which reveals a potential bias in traditional afternoon-only approaches in this domain. This work highlights the usefulness of a long term, multi-species approach to constrain urban greenhouse gas emissions and their sources."

Crounse;Paul Wennberg;Felix Piel;Stefan Swift;Wojciech Wojnowski;Armin Wisthaler,Technical note: Identifying biomass burning emissions during ASIA-AQ using greenhouse gas enhancement ratios,"Biomass burning is a significant source of greenhouse gases and airborne pollutants in Asia. Airborne measurements of greenhouse gas enhancement ratios, trace gases, and particle scattering were used to identify air masses impacted by biomass burning over several Asian countries during February and March of 2024. Further analysis using atmospheric transport models and satellite hotspot products was performed to understand the transport history of biomass burning impacted airmasses over Thailand. 
 Biomass burning (BB) is a primary source of atmospheric chemistry reactants, aerosols, and greenhouse gases. Smoke plumes have air quality impacts local to the fire itself and regionally via long distance transport. Open burning of agriculture fields in Southeast Asia leads to frequent seasonal occurrences of regional BB-induced smoke haze and long-range transport of BB particles via the northeast monsoon. The Airborne and Satellite Investigation of Asian Air Quality (ASIA-AQ) campaign visited several areas including the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan during a time of agricultural burning. This campaign consisted of airborne measurements on the NASA DC-8 aircraft aimed to validate observations from South Korea's Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) and to address local air quality challenges. We developed a method that used a combination of BB markers to identify ASIA-AQ DC-8 data influenced by BB and flag them for further analysis. Specifically, we used rolling slope enhancement ratios of CO/CO2 and CH4/CO along with mixing ratios of CH3CN, HCN, and CO, and particle scattering coefficient measurements. The flag was triggered when a combination of these variables exceeded a flight specific threshold. We found varying levels of BB-influence in the areas studied, with data flagged for BB being < 1 % for the Philippines and Korea, and < 2 % for Taiwan, but 19 % for Thailand. Our method for flagging ASIA-AQ BB-affected data can be used to focus additional analyses of the ASIA-AQ campaign such as pairing with back trajectories, satellite hotspot products, and microphysical aerosol characteristics."

Schuck;Colm Sweeney;Andreas Engel,CO2 variability and seasonal cycle in the UTLS: insights from EMAC model and AirCore observational data,"We investigate the distribution of CO2 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere using both, observations and an atmospheric model. Simulating an artificial tracer, we separate CO2 seasonality from long-term trend and transport variability. We found that patterns in the seasonal signal are attributable to large-scale transport features like the subtropical jet or the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Being a powerful diagnostic tool we recommend to use this tracer for model intercomparisons. 
 The complex distribution of CO2 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) results from the interplay of different processes and mechanisms. However, in such difficult-to-access regions of the atmosphere our understanding of the CO2 variability remains limited. Using vertical trace gas profiles derived from measurements with the balloon-based AirCore technique for validation, we investigate the UTLS and stratospheric CO2 distribution simulated with the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) global chemistry-climate model. By simulating an artificial, deseasonalised CO2 tracer, we disentangle the CO2 seasonal signal from long-term trend and transport contribution. This approach allows us to study the CO2 seasonal cycle in a unique way in remote areas and on a global scale. Our results show that the tropospheric CO2 seasonal cycle propagates upwards into the lowermost stratosphere and is most modulated in the extra-tropics between 300–100 hPa, characterised by a 50 % amplitude dampening and a 4-month phase shift in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. During this propagation the seasonal cycle shape is also tilted, which is associated with the transport barrier related to the strength of the subtropical jet. In the stratosphere, we identified both, a vertical and a horizontal “tape recorder” of the CO2 seasonal cycle. Originating in the tropical tropopause region this imprint is linked to the upwelling and the shallow branch of the Brewer-Dobson-circulation. As the CO2 seasonal signal carries information about transport processes on different timescales, the newly introduced tracer is a very useful diagnostic tool and would also be a suitable metric for model intercomparisons."

Our model underestimated boundary layer height and showed warm biases, affecting ODE simulation. Updates improved coastal ozone agreement but failed to capture strong ODEs. Bromine monoxide (BrO) was overestimated at the surface yet underestimated in columns. Long-term data show declining strong ODEs since 2008, suggesting additional climate-driven factors beyond sea ice age. 
 Ozone depletion events (ODEs) and bromine explosions (BEs) occur regularly in the springtime polar boundary layer. ODEs alter the oxidation capacity of the polar boundary layer and promote formation of toxic mercury. We investigated Arctic ODEs and BEs in 2019/2020 using the chemistry-climate model ECHAM/MESSy v2.55.2, nudged with ERA5 reanalysis data. Model results were evaluated against surface ozone measurements, satellite-derived tropospheric BrO vertical column densities (VCDs), and in situ data from the MOSAiC expedition. The model underestimated boundary layer (BL) height during shallow BL conditions, coinciding with a warm surface temperature bias (2–10 K), particularly below −10 °C, likely inherited from ERA5. An updated model configuration, incorporating more realistic multi-year sea ice and relaxed bromine release thresholds, improved agreement with coastal ozone observations (Eureka, Utqiaġvik) but still failed to reproduce strong ODEs observed during MOSAiC. Consequently, modeled surface BrO mixing ratios were overestimated, while BrO VCDs were underestimated, suggesting that simply increasing Br2 emissions does not resolve discrepancies. A weaker colocation between modeled BrO VCDs and ODEs aligns with prior airborne studies and may reflect tropospheric chemical and transport processes rather than stratospheric contributions. Despite decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and increasing BrO VCDs, long-term records from Alert, Utqiaġvik, and Zeppelin show a decline in strong ODE frequency since 2008. This suggests that bromine emissions from first-year sea ice alone may not fully account for observed ODE variability, and that additional climate-sensitive mechanisms may modulate Arctic ozone chemistry. Long-term model integrations are recommended to better understand these trends."

Using this radar moment-based algorithm will save users time and computational expenses of processing large spectral datasets when looking for case studies of processes associated with multi-modal spectra. Storing linear depolarization ratio for detected events can facilitate finding cases specific to ice or drizzle events. Pairing this with temperature helps determine processes that may be active. 
 In this paper, we process three years of vertically pointing Ka-band radar spectral data according to the methodology described and established in Part 1 (Wugofski et al., 2025). Across three years of data, we demonstrate that the detection algorithm is successful in identifying multi-modal spectra, with 89.6 % of detected events verifying. Beyond the verification, we explore other characteristics of the detected events such as the height, depth, and temperature of the layers containing secondary modes. Reanalysis data from ERA5 was used to gain additional context to the environmental conditions associated with the detected events. By connecting temperatures from ERA5 with the detected layers, we assess the potential for these events to be associated with common microphysical processes such as growth of columns or plates, Hallett–Mossop rime splintering, dendritic growth, and primary ice nucleation. We further explore the potential microphysical processes revealed by the multi-modal spectra using spectrally integrated linear depolarization ratio to determine if the secondary mode may comprise ice crystals that can produce such a signal. Of the cases with a detected enhanced LDR signal, >64.1 % of those occurred in a layer with a mean temperature consistent with columnar ice or Hallett–Mossop rime splintering. Finally, three cases are investigated in more detail to illustrate the variety of events detected by the algorithm."

By applying an advanced aerosol retrieval algorithm called GRASP, we were able to more accurately observe both atmospheric and ground conditions and their dynamics over time. The results closely matched ground-based measurements and showed potential for even better monitoring when combined with ground-based lidar data. 
 The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite is an imager with 16 spectral bands covering from the visible to infrared. The AHI has high temporal resolution with observation frequency of every 10 min and high spatial resolution 0.5–2 km (depending on channel) for full disk, which provides great potential for studying the dynamics of aerosol properties in East Asia and Western Pacific regions. In this study, the development of aerosol and surface property retrievals from the AHI/Himawari-8 using the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm is described. Due to the pseudo multi-angular observations obtained from AHI/Himawari-8 and the flexibility of GRASP algorithm with its innovative multi-pixel concept, multiple time and spatial pixels were retrieved simultaneously with both aerosol and surface properties constrained between the pixels together with additional constraints on spectral variability of underlying surface parameters within each pixel.The developed GRASP based algorithm has been applied to AHI/Himwari-8 observations over land for the entire year of 2018, and over ocean for May 2018 only, due to computational resource limitations and the relatively lower complexity of aerosol retrievals over ocean. The generated retrieval products were validated against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements and were also intercompared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface products. Overall, the validation analysis shows robust agreement of AHI/GRASP spectral AOD product with AERONET with correlation coefficients of 0.82–0.93 across the spectrum over land. The AHI/GRASP results demonstrate encouraging agreement with AERONET that is with 34.4 % of the AOD (510 nm) satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirement, and a bias within ±0.02 for AOD over land. The validation for fine and coarse mode AOD also showed promising results with a correlation of 0.89 and mean bias of 0.04 for fine mode AOD when compared with AERONET measurements. As for the intercomparisons with MODIS products, the overall performance is quite comparable to MODIS surface products. In addition to the analysis of AHI/Himawari-8 alone retrieval, this study demonstrated a novel synergetic retrieval between AHI/Himawari-8 and micro-pulse lidar (MPL). Using this synergy resulted in further improvements of the aerosol retrievals especially over the low AOD conditions due to the improved sensitivity to aerosol."

Laboratory and in-flight tests confirmed its precision and stability. Observed gradients near the tropopause reveal active mixing and transport processes in the tropopause region. 
 In this paper we introduce the new TropoPause Composition TOwed Sensor Shuttle (TPC-TOSS), which constitutes an advanced development of the AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle (AIRTOSS), introduced by Frey et al. (2009). As part of a tandem measurement platform with a Learjet 35A, both platforms were equipped with redundant instruments for co-located measurements of aerosol size distribution (Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer, UHSAS), ozone (2BTech model 205), cloud particles (Back-Scatter Cloud Probe, BCP), as well as relative humidity, temperature and pressure. To measure the exact position of the two platforms as well as the relative distance of the TPC-TOSS to the Learjet a Global Positioning System (GPS) is installed on both platforms. Two identical Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) further allow to monitor attitude angles (roll, pitch, and heading) and accelerations. Laboratory tests before and ground tests as well as in-flight tests during the intensive operation period show a good agreement of the ozone and temperature measurements of better than 4.2 ppbv +1.1 % (ozone) and 0.5 °C (temperature) at a noise level of ± (2 ppbv + 0.5 %) for 2 s data (ozone) and ± 0.1 K for 1 Hz data (temperature). Stability of the ozone monitor mounted in the TPC-TOSS has been tested and is estimated to be 2.2 ppbv (offset, 1σ) and 0.7 % (gain, 1σ), respectively, based on the drift of offset and gain during regular calibrations between measurement flights in the two weeks operation period. The new TPC-TOSS was successfully flown during the TPEx I (TropoPause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) mission in June 2024 and performed four flights covering the altitude range between 6.4 and 10.9 km. The tropopause was crossed several times as evident from different temperature and ozone gradients as well as gradients of the aerosol number concentration. With the setup we are able to resolve transient stability and composition gradients ranging from almost zero or even negative to strong positive gradients of up to 25 K km−1 for potential temperature and from inverted to strong positive vertical gradients of ozone of up to 800 ppbv km−1, respectively. These gradients are caused by transport and mixing due to convection or shear induced turbulence at the tropopause."

The model predicts summer 2013 emissions of 10.92–11.37 teragrams of carbon. Validation shows our model performs better than the existing models, revealing underestimated isoprene impacts on ozone pollution in eastern China. 
 Isoprene is the dominant non-methane Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emitted from terrestrial ecosystems and plays an important role in ozone chemistry. Understanding isoprene emissions is critical for controlling air pollution. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is widely used to calculate biogenic isoprene emissions worldwide. While MEGAN predictions are good for many regions, a previous analysis of isoprene observations around China showed large discrepancies between observed and simulated isoprene concentrations. The uncertainties of isoprene emissions in China are also reflected in the large differences between MEGAN version 2.1 and 3.1. In this work, bottom-up high-resolution vegetation distributions and updated emission factors are combined with satellite data in the Speciated Isoprene Emission Model with the MEGAN Algorithm for China (SieMAC) to improve isoprene emission estimates in China. The results from this new emission inventory for summer 2013 improve upon MEGAN versions 2.1 and 3.1 when compared with isoprene observations and satellite HCHO products. This improved emission inventory is applied in a regional model, and the results indicate a potentially underestimated role of biogenic isoprene in ozone formation over polluted eastern China."

Trends are determined using linear least squares fits, multiple linear regression, and dynamical linear modeling. Regardless of the method, EqL‐θ $\theta $ improves consistency between trends across the UTLS, reduces large UT tropical uncertainties, alters the magnitude of mid‐latitude trends, and, most notably, in the Southern polar lower stratosphere, reveals statistically significant trends exceeding 8% per decade during Antarctic Spring. This provides further evidence of Antarctic ozone recovery. These robust trends are not captured using geographical coordinates.

The transport of air between the troposphere and stratosphere, known as stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE), involves greenhouse gases such as ozone and water vapor whose impact on Earth's radiation budget and climate is most sensitive to changes in UTLS composition. Therefore, we examine observations of STE in TCs and relate these changes to TC and environmental characteristics. We utilize 17 years of trace gas profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Aura satellite in conjunction with TC track information and environmental data to relate UTLS ozone and water vapor changes to TC intensity, distance from TC center, and environmental wind shear. We find that accounting for varying tropopause heights and basin‐specific background composition is important to accurate assessment of UTLS composition changes within a TC. We also find that TCs are associated with increased water vapor throughout most of the UTLS and dehydration at tropopause level, while ozone is reduced greatly in the upper troposphere. All diagnosed UTLS composition changes demonstrate significant sensitivity to distance from TC center and TC intensity. Additionally, we find that TC‐induced UTLS water vapor changes are sensitive to environmental shear magnitude, where weaker shear is associated with more pronounced tropospheric hydration and tropopause dehydration."

A neural network‐based scale‐adaptive cloud fraction scheme, predicting cloud area fraction that affects cloud radiative effects, was developed previously using CloudSat observations and demonstrated good performance in capturing cloud spatial distribution and vertical structure. This study further improves the scheme by considering in the inputs the atmospheric stability (affecting cloud formation and evolution) and introducing cloud volume fraction (important for cloud microphysics) as an additional output. Results show that including atmospheric stability significantly enhances both prediction accuracy and scale adaptability for cloud area fraction compared to the original scheme. On the test data set, root‐mean square errors (RMSEs) for liquid, mixed‐phase, and ice clouds are reduced by 15.5%, 11.6%, and 6.67%, respectively. These leads to better predictions of cloud area‐fraction vertical structure and spatial distribution, with RMSE reduced by 33% and 17% in those aspects. Notably, improvements are most pronounced for low‐level clouds, particularly in simulating the seasonal variation of stratocumulus over the Southeast Pacific and the cloud regime transitions along the Pacific Cross‐Section Intercomparison transect of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study/Working Group on Numerical Experimentation. The new scheme also performs well in predicting cloud volume fraction, showing accuracy and scale adaptability comparable to that for area fraction. Offline evaluations using simulation data from the FGOALS‐f3‐L GCM confirm the superiority of the updated scheme, highlighting its potential to improve cloud fraction representation and associated climate effects in GCMs."

In addition to mineral dust, soil dust, and marine organics, laboratory and field measurements suggest biomass burning aerosols (BBA) can act as immersion‐mode INP between around −30°C and −15°C. However, the contribution of BBA to the global INP budget remains poorly understood due to poor knowledge of which fuels yield INPs, uncertainties in global coverage of those fuels, and unknown size distributions of the INPs in the BBA. Nonetheless, with some understanding of these uncertainties from sensitivity studies, the relative importance of ice nucleation activity of BBA compared to other INP sources can be quantified. In this work, we investigate the potential global importance of BBA as INP using a global aerosol‐climate model, specifically the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). We evaluate the model using field campaign data sets. We examine potential uncertainties in fuel types and particle sizes on BBA‐based INP concentrations. Averaged over June–September between 15°S and 50°S, BBA is a more important INP than dust and marine INP about 30% of the time at altitudes with temperatures between −30°C and −20°C. Our simulations therefore suggest BBA INPs may be at least as important as mineral dust and marine INP over the atmospheric regions and seasons where grassland fires are frequent."

Previous studies have largely relied on empirical curve models, which have not been systematically validated against global‐scale observational fluxes. Here, we developed a process‐based bidirectional exchange model (GSEM) to predict global soil Hg0 emissions. The model incorporates key processes, including photochemical and non‐photochemical redox reactions, soil‐water partitioning, and gaseous diffusion. By constraining model outputs with global observations, we demonstrate that four mainstream empirical curve models underestimate air‐soil Hg0 exchange fluxes, while the GSEM model offers improved performance in replicating the fluxes and yields an improved global estimate of 2272.3 Mg yr−1. Emission hotspots are primarily concentrated in tropical regions such as the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, and the latitudinal variations in simulated fluxes closely align with global soil respiration patterns. This process‐based approach significantly enhances the accuracy of air‐soil Hg0 exchange predictions and contributes to reducing uncertainty in global Hg budget assessments."

In the United States, the level of surface ozone in many regions is close to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, making it important to understand even small changes in emissions. Subsequently, model simulations of ozone are less tolerant of uncertainties in emission estimation, such as those caused by outdated emission updates. Here, we propose and assess four emission refresh methods: state‐level emission adjustment (ADJ), ADJ with budget‐aware urban adjustment (BA), ADJ with TROPOMI‐derived city emissions (SatNOx), and an approach with a machine learning product generated by Variational AutoEncorder (VAE). The observed temporal trends from ground measurements Air Quality System (AQS) and TROPOMI products are employed to provide updates of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from a base year (2019) to the targeted model period (2020). The adjusted emissions effectively reflect the decrease in summer from 2019 to 2020. Comparisons of the ozone forecasts using the base and refreshed emission inputs show that the emission adjustments have reduced model mean biases by 19%–21% and enhanced the model's capability to forecast O3 surface concentrations. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) predicted with updated emissions shows more underestimation at the surface and aloft due to lower baseline emissions. This work demonstrates the potential of using near‐real‐time ground and satellite observations to rapidly update emissions to reduce a key source of emission uncertainty in chemical transport modeling."

The Microwave Humidity Sounder‐II (MWHS‐II) aboard the FengYun‐3 satellite includes channels near both bands, offering complementary capabilities. Although the assimilation performances of instrument channels in these bands have been studied, their comparative impacts on hydrometeor fields remain insufficiently explored. Through the separate and joint assimilation of 118 and 183 GHz MWHS‐II channels using hydrometeor control variables, this study investigates how directly adjusting hydrometeor analysis for thermodynamic consistency influences the analysis and forecasting of Typhoon Lekima (2019). Results show that the 183 GHz band has higher sensitivity to solid hydrometeors at higher levels, whereas the 118 GHz band is more sensitive to liquid hydrometeors at lower levels. These differences are clearly manifested in the hydrometeor analysis. Joint assimilation of both sets of channels improves the representation of temperature, humidity, and hydrometeor distribution. This not only enhances the analysis and forecasting of typhoon intensity but also deepens the understanding of typhoon structure. In particular, the sensitivity of the 183 GHz band to solid hydrometeors provides valuable insights into their role in the secondary eyewall formation for Typhoon Lekima (2019). With the use of hydrometeor control variables, the synergistic assimilation of MWHS‐II channels demonstrates potential for advancing tropical cyclone analysis, forecasting, and understanding of dynamics."

However, there remains limited understanding of how air pollution levels modify these relationships across different regions and populations. This study employed a two‐stage, multi‐city time‐series analysis using data from 13 cities in Jiangsu Province (2015–2023) to explore these effects. A multistage analytical approach, including the distributed lag non‐linear model, multivariate meta‐regression, and attributable risk calculation, was used to quantify the association between climatic variables, air pollutants, and HFMD. Findings indicated that HFMD incidence is closely associated with meteorological conditions, with peak risk at 24.8°C for average temperature and 89.2% for average relative humidity. Low average wind speed and short sunshine hours (SH) also contributed to increased risk. Air pollutants, such as PM2.5, SO2, and O3, significantly modified these associations. For example, PM2.5 and SO2 increased HFMD risk at higher temperatures, while O3 reduced risk. Under low humidity, some pollutants exhibited protective effects, though risk increased with high humidity. NO2 had the strongest influence in reducing variability, while high PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations weakened the protective effects of SH. These findings emphasize the non‐linear influence of climatic variables on HFMD risk and suggest that air pollution's modification of these relationships varies by gender, age, and location. This provides important insights for developing targeted, timely public health warnings."

 Sea fog hampers coastal activities, yet its decadal variability in coastal China remains insufficiently characterized. Using hourly marine observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), we identify an April–July sea fog frequency (SFF) trend reversal over fog-prone eastern coastal China: from a decrease of 1% per decade (1980–2000) to an increase of 3% per decade (2001–2011) (p < 0.01 for both trends). Hourly ERA5 reanalysis corroborates this reversal and links it to enhanced 2001–2011 near‑surface cooling, which strengthens near-surface inversions and stability. Daily CMIP6 model simulations indicate that aerosols are the primary driver of the 2001–2011 SFF increase, enhancing stability through radiative cooling and promoting water vapor condensation by supplying cloud condensation nuclei. Our findings highlight aerosols’ critical role in increasing SFF and underscore the need for sustained emission-reduction efforts in China to mitigate fog-related disruptions."

 In Europe, a large proportion of the population lives in industrial and urban coastal areas, due to their role as hubs of population migration and economic activity. Despite regulatory efforts, these areas frequently experience PM10 and PM2.5 pollution episodes due to the high density of emission sources combined with complex atmospheric dynamics. In this context, we investigate pollution days (PDs) over a 4-year period (2018–2021) on the Great Dunkirk Area, a coastal region significantly affected by diverse pollution sources. We show that PM2.5 pollution plumes predominantly exhibit regional extension, while PM10 plumes are more often local, with clear seasonal patterns. Using SEM-EDX analysis of over 23,000 individual particles collected during the 2021 MIXTAPE campaign, we reveal a highly heterogeneous aerosol composition, dominated by sea salt and carbonaceous particles, with fine particles enriched in sulfur secondary species and coarse particles in calcium. The mixing state index (χ) ranges from 0.5 to 0.9, indicating a continuum from external to internal mixtures, strongly influenced by atmospheric ageing, recirculation, and turbulent mixing. Our results highlight that neither local wind direction nor plume extension alone can explain the observed chemical variability. Instead, the evolution of particle composition and mixing state depends on fine-scale meteorological dynamics including sea breezes and recirculation periods affecting pollutant dispersion and ageing. This work underlines the need to incorporate high-resolution particle chemistry and urban-scale atmospheric dynamics in air quality assessments and demonstrates the added value of single-particle analysis in complex, multisource coastal environments."

 Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) remains a serious issue in Asia. To address the lack of observational data and investigate the status of PM2.5 in the forests, we collected PM2.5 above a tropical dry deciduous forest in a remote area of northeastern Thailand during the dry season. Notably, a large-scale surface fire occurred at the forest site during the mid-dry season. We also analyzed the PM2.5 data collected by the Pollution Control Department of Thailand and the satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Southeast Asia. Three episodes of elevated PM2.5 concentration were observed at the site. Based on the ground-based measurements and AOD, two episodes were attributable to the long-range transport from urban areas in Vietnam and Thailand. The proportion of SO42− increased in the two episodes, indicating SO42− was a key indicator for identifying the sources of air pollution. While NH4+, NO3−, and SO42− dominated approximately 83 % of the total concentration of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) during the non-fire periods, the forest fire substantially altered the chemical composition, with K+ and Cl− accounting for approximately 42 %. The maximum concentration of total WSII in PM2.5 during the forest fire period reached 88.0 μg m−3, which was approximately three times higher than that during the non-fire periods (26.4 μg m−3). The forest site served not only as a receptor of urban air pollution but also as a large source of PM2.5. Enhancing regional cooperation and forest management is necessary in this region."

 Investigating the synergistic effects of air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their influencing factors is crucial for developing more scientific environmental governance and climate change mitigation strategies. This study investigated spatiotemporal patterns of air pollutants and CO2 emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during two distinct phases (2018–2020 and 2020–2022). Through integration of high-resolution emission inventories with WRF-CAMx modeling, sectoral contributions to CO2 emissions and to PM2.5 and O3 concentrations were quantified. A systematic assessment of synergistic effects employed three metrics: pollution control efficiency, elasticity coefficients, and coupling coordination degree. Finally, geographic detector analysis combined with econometric modeling revealed driving mechanisms underlying these synergistic effects, incorporating spatial correlations and causal inference. The results indicated a continuous decline in air pollutants and CO2 emissions across most cities in the BTH region from 2018 to 2022, with notable heterogeneity in the synergistic effects contributed by different sectors. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO2 exhibited stronger synergistic effects compared to ozone (O3) and CO2. These effects were positively influenced by population size and negatively impacted by energy consumption intensity. Total standard energy consumption and energy consumption intensity had relatively greater influences. Furthermore, there were interaction effects between different influencing factors, including two-factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement. This study provided valuable scientific insights for enhancing the synergistic management of environmental pollution alleviation and carbon emission control in future phases, and offered strategic guidance for more effective integration of air quality improvement and climate change mitigation efforts."

 The Himalayan glacier valleys are encountering escalating environmental challenges. One of the contributing factors is thought to be the rising amounts of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols, particularly brown carbon (BrC) and black carbon (BC), that are reaching glacier valleys. The present study examines the optical and radiative characteristics of BC at Bhojbasa, near Gaumukh (∼3800amsl). Real-time in-situ BC data, optical characteristics, radiative forcing, heating rate, several meteorological parameters, and BC transport pathways to this high-altitude site are investigated. The daily mean concentration of equivalent black carbon (eBC) was 0.28 ± 0.21 μg/m3 over the research period, and the eBC from fossil fuel (BCFF) is dominant with 78 % with a daily mean of 0.22 ± 0.19 μg/m3, and eBC from biomass burning (BCBB) is 22 % with a daily mean of 0.06 ± 0.08 μg/m3. Meteorological data, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) imaging, and backward air-mass trajectory analysis demonstrate the presence of BC particles and their plausible transit pathways from multiple source locations to the pristine Gangotri Glacier Valley. The estimated daily mean BC radiative forcing values are +6.71 ± 1.80 W/m2 in the atmosphere, +1.87 ± 1.16 W/m2 at the top of the atmosphere, and −4.84 ± 1.01 W/m2 at the surface with a corresponding atmospheric heating rate of 0.19 ± 0.05 K/day. These findings highlight the critical role of ground-based measurements in monitoring the fluctuations of BC over such varied Himalayan terrain, as they offer important information on the localized trends and effects. Long-term measurements of glacier valleys are essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of BC particles on Himalayan ecology and climate."

 Under global warming, the change of lightning activity is a controversial issue. This study investigates historical trends in lightning over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) based on 18-years lightning data detected by optical transient detector (OTD) and lightning imaging sensor (LIS). Local and remote meteorological factors from reanalysis datasets are used to analyze the primary parameters controlling the change of lightning activity. To explore the proxy of lightning flash density over the TP, we employed multiple linear regression through k-fold cross validation. Furthermore, future projections of lightning activity are examined based on outputs of climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Historical analysis reveals that flash density over the eastern TP has shown consistently positive trends with a significant increase at a rate of 0.064 fl km−2y−2 over the entire observation period. Our ensemble model mean indicates that sea surface temperature of northwest of Australia and local surface temperature are closely related to the interannual variations in lightning activity over the eastern TP, accounting for 67 % of the variation in flash density. By applying the developed regional proxy to climate models, our projections suggest that lightning activity will increase by 32 % under SSP1–2.6 scenario and by 60 % under SSP2–4.5 scenario by the end of this century."

 Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a harmful secondary atmospheric pollutant and an important greenhouse gas. Multiple satellite records have shown conflicting long-term O3 trends across regions of the globe, including Europe. Here, we investigate lower-tropospheric sub-column O3 (LTCO3, surface – 450 hPa) records from three ultraviolet (UV) sounders produced by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL): the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME, 1996–2010), the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY, 2003–2011) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI, 2005–2017). GOME and SCIAMACHY detect negative trends of approximately −0.2 DU yr−1, while OMI indicates a negligible trend. The TOMCAT 3-D chemical transport model was used to investigate processes driving simulated trends and to identify possible reasons for satellite trend discrepancies. The simulated LTCO3 trends were negligible (consistent with ozonesonde trends), even when spatiotemporally co-located to the satellite level-2 swath data and convolved by averaging kernels (i.e. a measure of the satellite retrieval vertical sensitivity). Model sensitivity experiments with the emissions or meteorology fixed to 2008 also showed negligible LTCO3 trends between 1996 and 2018, indicating that changes in emissions and meteorology had a limited impact on LTCO3 temporal evolution. Given the substantial decrease in air pollutant emissions, this was unexpected, while year-to-year variability dominated the meteorological influence on LTCO3. Finally, we find a negligible trend in the long-term stratosphere O3 flux into the free troposphere over this period arriving over Europe. Overall, our observational and modelling analysis indicates that European LTCO3 trends have been stable between 1996 and 2018."

The datasets show important differences from one another in ozone magnitude, greater than 5 ppb, and trends, globally and regionally.

These differences among datasets highlight uncertainties for applications to health and other impacts. 
 Ground-level ozone is a significant air pollutant that detrimentally affects human health and agriculture. Global ground-level ozone concentrations have been estimated using chemical reanalyses, geostatistical methods, and machine learning, but these datasets have not been compared systematically. We compare six global ground-level ozone datasets (three chemical reanalyses, two machine learning, one geostatistics) relative to observations and against one another, for the ozone season daily maximum 8 h average mixing ratio, for 2006 to 2016. Comparing with global ground-level observations, most datasets overestimate ozone, particularly at lower observed concentrations. In 2016, across all stations, grid-to-grid R2 ranges from 0.50 to 0.75 and RMSE 4.25 to 12.22 ppb. Agreement with observed distributions is reduced at ozone concentrations above 50 ppb. Results show significant differences among datasets in global average ozone, as large as 5–10 ppb, multi-year trends, and regional distributions. For example, in Europe, the two chemical reanalyses show an increasing trend while other datasets show no increase. Among the six datasets, the share of population exposed to over 50 ppb varies from 61 % [28 %, 94 %] to 99 % [62 %, 100 %] in East Asia, 17 % [4 %, 72 %] to 88 % [53 %, 99 %] in North America, and 9 % [0 %, 58 %] to 76 % [22 %, 96 %] in Europe (2006–2016 average). Although sharing some of the same input data, we found important differences, likely from variations in approaches, resolution, and other input data, highlighting the importance of continued research on global ozone distributions.

Most warm season trends in high O3 in Europe were shown to be decreasing, though low values in both warm and cold seasons were increasing. Trends in the USA were similar, but showed less increasing trends low O3 in the warm season. Sites with similar trends were grouped, more different were seen in the USA, and identified ones where trends in high O3 values had started to increase later in the period. 
 Trends in urban maximum daily 8 h average ozone concentrations, alongside annual ozone episodic and exposure metrics, across Europe and the United States of America were explored between 2000–2021. Using surface monitoring site data from the TOAR-II and European Environment Agency databases, piecewise quantile regression (PQR) analysis was performed on 353 time series (204 European, 149 USA). The PQR analysis permitted 2 break points over the period to balance the intent to describe changes over a large time period, while still capturing the abrupt changes that can occur in urban atmospheres. We found that there were many sites across Europe with high certainty increasing trends in the 5th and 50th quantiles, whereas the majority of high certainty trends in the 95th quantile were found to be decreasing. A similar pattern was observed across the USA, with 5th quantile trends increasing and 95th quantile trends decreasing, though a small but increasing number of sites showed a return to increasing trend at τ = 95. To group trends, hierarchical clustering with dynamic time warping was employed and these groups used to guide analysis. Clustering was typically regional across Europe and the USA, and increasing trends were identified across southern and the central alpine regions of Europe, and in California and the Intermountain West of the USA. Recent high certainty increasing trends in the Intermountain West may be related to warmer summers and increased wildfire events in the region, highlighting the need to monitor changing ozone trends with climate change, to assess human exposure risk to elevated levels of ozone."

Using simulations with high resolution, we found that fire heat and moisture help form these clouds, lifting particles high into the atmosphere. This process is crucial for understanding how fires affect the environment. Despite some differences from observational data, our findings match well over time, showing the importance of fire-induced heat in cloud formation. 
 Understanding pyro-convective clouds is essential. These clouds transport significant quantities of aerosols and gases into the upper atmosphere and therefore influence atmospheric composition, weather, and climate on a global scale. This study investigates the dynamics of pyro-convective clouds during the Australian New Years Event 2019/2020 using convection-resolving simulations that incorporate the effects of sensible heat and moisture released by fires. These effects are modeled through parameterizations using retrievals from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS). The results show that the plume top height remains unchanged when accounting for fire-induced heat and moisture release in regions where convective cells form independently of the fire. In areas with the most intense fires, the sensible heat and moisture release from the fire provide the necessary buoyancy for enabling the formation of pyro-convective clouds. Pyro-convective clouds lift aerosol masses up to altitudes of 12.0 km. During their formation, the plume top height more than doubles, compared with a reference simulation in which such clouds do not develop. Additionally, the plume height increase is, on average, just 0.87 km by fire-induced heat and moisture in cloud-free areas. We demonstrated that sensible heat release is the primary contributor to pyro-convective cloud formation. However, the release of moisture enhances the formation process and increases the lifetime of the pyro-convective cloud. Comparisons with observational data show that the plume's distribution and height are underestimated. However, the simulations align well with observations after a 5–6 h delay, indicating that pyro-convective cells are accurately modeled but occur later in the model than are actually observed."

Satellite data, surface measurements and air mass modeling tracked the smoke from fires in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, transported to São Paulo within 2 d. The smoke–cloud interaction reduced surface irradiance to zero for 40 min and increased radiative efficiency by 7 %, highlighting impacts on air quality and radiation budget. 
 Biomass burning is a worldwide practice applied to deforestation that can have disastrous consequences for local and regional environments. This paper describes a case study of an extreme event of biomass burning smoke transport toward the São Paulo metropolitan area (MASP), on 19 August 2019, when the city experienced an uncommon completely dark sky around 15:00 UTC−3. A synergy between air mass back trajectories, satellite-retrieved aerosol fields and surface radiometric measurements was used to find the origin of the smoke plume affecting the city and to analyse the radiative impact of the transport of the smoke toward the city. Results showed that the MASP atmosphere was affected by the transport of a dense smoke plume with aerosol optical depth at 550 nm above 1. Air mass back trajectories and auxiliary data indicated that most of the smoke was emitted 2 d before arrival. The smoke plume in combination with clouds, associated with a frontal system, produced a strong radiative impact, as observed by a regional network of pyranometers. During the day of darkness, the diurnal clearness index was below 0.1 in all five MASP stations, and a maximum of the cloud optical depth higher than 300 was retrieved, producing irradiances at surface that dropped to 0 for approximately 40 min. The strong radiative efficiency (cloud radiative effect per cloud optical depth unit) of this extreme event was 7 % higher than other overcast days observed in a 2-year period."

The Amazon rainforest is a major source of isoprene. We derived isoprene emissions using satellite retrievals of isoprene columns and a chemical transport model. We evaluated our isoprene emission estimates using ground-based isoprene observations and satellite retrievals of formaldehyde. We found that using satellite retrievals of isoprene can help us better understand isoprene emissions over the Amazon. 
 Isoprene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The Amazon rainforest is a globally relevant source of atmospheric isoprene. We report isoprene emissions inferred from a full-physics retrieval of isoprene columns from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the local sensitivities between isoprene emissions and isoprene columns determined by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. Compared with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) isoprene emissions, the isoprene emission estimates inferred from CrIS have  different spatial and seasonal distributions with generally lower emission rates but higher emission rates over the northern Amazon basin and southeast Brazil. The observed mean isoprene concentration at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), March–December 2019, is 3.0 ± 2.2 ppbv, which is reproduced better by the GEOS-Chem model driven by isoprene emissions inferred from CrIS (2.8 ± 1.4 ppbv) than by the MEGAN inventory (4.1 ± 1.3 ppbv). Isoprene emission estimates inferred from CrIS generally agree better than MEGAN with in situ observations of seasonal isoprene fluxes over the Amazon. GEOS-Chem model formaldehyde (HCHO) columns, corresponding to isoprene emissions inferred from CrIS, are generally more consistent with TROPOMI data (normalized mean error, NME = 43 %) than the HCHO columns corresponding to MEGAN isoprene emissions (NME = 50 %), as expected. CrIS-inferred isoprene emission rates can vary by ±20 % considering potential model biases in nitrogen oxide emissions. Our results provide confidence that we can use CrIS data to examine future impacts of anthropogenic activities on isoprene emissions from the Amazon."

Chipperfield;Chris Wilson;Wuhu Feng,Global optimal estimation retrievals of  atmospheric carbonyl sulfide over water  from IASI measurement spectra for 2018,"We use satellite measurements to estimate quantities of a gas called carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the atmosphere. OCS is consumed during photosynthesis, much like carbon dioxide (CO2). Our data is focused mostly over the global oceans for the year 2018, and we find it compares well with past satellite observations, ground-based measurements and modelled OCS. We hope to extend this measurement record and use it in data-driven tools in the future to better understand the carbon cycle globally. 
 Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is consumed by vegetation during photosynthesis in a one-way hydrolysis reaction, making measuring OCS vegetative uptake a means of inferring and quantifying global gross primary production. Recent studies highlight that uncertainties in OCS surface fluxes remain high and OCS datasets with better spatial coverage are required, particularly from satellite. Here OCS profiles are retrieved using measured radiances from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments. We estimate total column amounts over oceanic and inland water regions for the example year 2018, using an optimal estimation scheme, using the University of Leicester IASI retrieval scheme (ULIRS) for selected microwindows in the 2000–2100 cm−1 wavenumber range. Information content exceeds one between ±50° latitude and a peak in vertical sensitivity around 6–10 km (500–300 hPa) in the troposphere. Diurnal variations are limited to ±2 %, showing larger total column amounts at the daytime overpass. The IASI OCS observations show a correlation of at least 0.74 at half the ground-based flask measurement sites compared. Results also agree with the University of Leeds TOMCAT 3-D chemical transport model simulations within ±5 % throughout most tropical regions. This study demonstrates the ability of the IASI instrument to detect OCS in the troposphere and observe a reasonable seasonal cycle indicative of being driven by photosynthesis. Further data acquisition is recommended to gain insight into inter-annual variability in OCS. This novel work will also help improve our understanding of the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle, particularly when utilised in inversion methods."

We use combined state-of-the-art aerosol and cloud properties from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors. We also use a global reanalysis from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) to provide vertical distribution of aerosol properties and atmospheric conditions. Diurnal mean satellite DARE values range from −25 W m−2 (cooling) to 40 W m−2 (warming) over the southeast Atlantic during 3 days from the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) aircraft campaign. These 3 days indicate agreement between our satellite-calculated DARE and co-located airborne Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) measurements. This paper constitutes the first step before applying our algorithm to more years of combined satellite and model data over more regions of the world. The goal is to ultimately assess the order of importance of atmospheric parameters in the calculation of DARE for specific aerosol and cloud regimes. This will inform future missions about where, when, and how accurately the retrievals should be performed to reduce all-sky DARE uncertainties."

Here we show, using observations and model experiments, that aerosols also intensify rainfall variability on two- to four-week timescales over South China primarily through cloud-microphysical processes, while radiative effects play a secondary role, thereby amplifying prolonged heavy rainfall events. 
 Persistent heavy rainfall events over densely populated South China are closely linked to the intensification of quasi-biweekly (8–30 d) oscillations. This study examines whether and how aerosols influence quasi-biweekly oscillations using observational analyses and model experiments. Statistical analysis reveals a significant phase-leading relationship between increased aerosol loadings, quantified by aerosol optical depth, and subsequent enhancement of 8–30 d rainfall anomalies. At the 8–30 d timescale, aerosols primarily influence rainfall intensity through cloud microphysical processes, with radiative effects playing a secondary role. Approximately four days before enhanced rainfall events, positive aerosol anomalies contribute to increased low-level cloud water content, leading to condensational latent heat release. This low-level latent heating strengthens low-level moisture convergence and ascending motion, which uplifts cloud droplets above the freezing level. Subsequently, additional latent heat release from mixed-phase processes (freezing/deposition) further intensifies vertical motion, amplifying precipitation anomalies. Once deep convection develops, clouds absorb longwave radiation, sustaining precipitation intensification. Sensitivity experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) confirm these mechanisms, demonstrating that anthropogenic aerosol enhancement intensifies precipitation anomalies through both aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and longwave cloud-radiative effects, with the former being more dominant. Quantitatively, aerosol-induced latent heating exceeds aerosol-induced longwave radiative heating by a factor of ∼ 4–7 in both observations and model simulations. These findings highlight the need to improve aerosol-cloud microphysical parameterizations in operational models to enhance the accuracy of extended-range heavy rainfall predictions in South China."

This study examined the complex diurnal aging cycles on biomass burning aerosol composition and oxidative potential, a key toxicity metric. Additional organic aerosol (OA) mass was produced after the two (day/night and night/day) cycles, varying from 35 to 90 % of the initial OA. The aging of the emissions led to a final oxidative potential increase of 60 % for both cycles. 
 Residential biomass burning is an important wintertime source of aerosols. These particles are subjected to complex diurnal aging processes in the atmosphere, contributing to urban and regional air pollution. The cumulative impact of these aging cycles on aerosol composition and oxidative potential, a key toxicity metric, remains unclear. This study examined the oxidation cycles of biomass burning emissions during day-to-night and night-to-day transitions in the FORTH (Foundation for Research and Technology – Hellas) atmospheric simulation chamber, focusing on emissions from burning of olive wood. The final high-resolution AMS spectra of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) after either oxidation cycle were almost identical (R2 > 0.99, θ= 3°). This indicates transformation into similar biomass burning secondary organic aerosol (bbSOA) regardless of the initial step of the diurnal cycle. A 56 % average increase in the bbOA oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio was observed during both cycle cases (from 0.38 ± 0.06 for the fresh to 0.59 ± 0.07 after aging). Additional OA mass was produced after the two cycles, varying from 35 % to 90 % of the initial OA. The aging of the emissions led to a final water-soluble oxidative potential (WS-OP) increase of 60 % to 68 ± 18 pmol min−1 µg−1 for both cycles, but with notably different transient values that depend on the order of the oxidation regimes. The effect of each oxidation regime on the WS-OP of the bbOA depends on the airmass history. The evolution of the WS-OP was not well correlated with that of the O:C."

These measurements revealed missing reaction pathways in current chemical mechanisms. Our findings help improve predictions of air quality and deepen understanding of chemical processes in the atmosphere. 
 Bicyclic peroxy radicals (BPRs) from aromatics hydrocarbons oxidation play increasingly recognized roles in the formation of secondary air pollutants. However, their reaction mechanisms remain poorly constrained, largely due to the lack of direct measurement techniques. In this study, we developed a method for quantitative measurement of BPRs using an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer (Vocus AIM). Following instrument optimization, the sensitivity for BPRs reached 0.3–0.6 ncps pptv−1, with a detection limit of ∼ 1 pptv and an uncertainty of ∼ 41 %. Our flow reactor experiments revealed that the bicyclic pathway dominates the OH-initiated oxidation of aromatics under low-NOx conditions, accounting for 57.0 % and 69.5 % of the oxidation products of toluene and m-xylene, respectively. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that conventional product-yield-based approaches underestimate the branching ratio of the bicyclic pathway by 4 %–9 % relative to direct BPR quantification. This discrepancy suggests the presence of unaccounted reaction channels in current chemical mechanisms, even when autoxidation and accretion reactions are considered. By directly quantifying BPRs, this study provides new insights into the atmospheric oxidation of aromatics and highlights the need for further mechanistic investigation. Moreover, the reaction-pathway-controlled quantification approach proposed here effectively reduces the challenges associated with measuring functionalized RO2 radicals and demonstrates strong potential for sensitive, speciated RO2 detection using Vocus AIM in both laboratory and ambient environments."

Using quantum-chemical calculations and photochemical box model simulation with an updated Master Chemical Mechanism, we found that the formation pathway of acetic acid from the 2-butene + OH reaction involves NO-mediated multi-generation oxidation processes. Our findings enhance the understanding of organic acid formation and highlight the pivotal role of NO in polluted urban atmospheres. 
 Alkenes are primary pollutants in petrochemical source atmospheres, and their atmospheric chemistry is of great importance for tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation. Hence, combining quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modelling, we investigated the oxidation mechanism and kinetics of 2-butene (BU), as one of the most important alkenes, and its impact on the environment. The mechanism results show that OH addition is the dominant pathway for cis- and trans-isomers of BU, and then the corresponding OH-adducts are attacked by O2 to produce peroxy radicals, which further react with NO to form acetaldehyde and hydroxyalkyl radicals. Different from the one adopted in current atmospheric models, addition of hydroxyalkyl radicals by O2 and NO to form acetic acid proceeds with a smaller barrier than that for H-abstraction by O2 to form acetaldehyde. A lifetime of less than a few hours (<4 h) for BU is estimated in the petrochemical regions. Kinetic modelling demonstrates that oxidation of BU is predicted to yield significant amounts of organic acids (>56 %) in the petrochemical areas, larger than those are currently recognized, even in environments with low NO concentrations. Our results reveal that the OH-initiated oxidation of BU contributes importantly to organic acid budgets, particularly in the petrochemical regions, bridging the gap in organic acid budgets."

Our study shows that the presence of surfactants alters the spreading coefficients of the organic and inorganic phases. Therefore, the phase-separated particle morphology can shift from the conventional core-shell structure to partial engulfing configurations, or even to inverse core-shell forms where the organic phase is surrounded by an outer inorganic shell. 
 The mixing state of atmospheric aerosols undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is crucial for regulating atmospheric chemistry and influencing global climate, often adding uncertainties to atmospheric and climate models. Despite its significance, understanding how coexisting species, such as surfactants, affect the mixing state of phase-separated aerosols remains limited. This study investigated the phase transition behaviors and resulting mixing states of aerosols composed of 1,2,6-hexanetriol and ammonium sulfate, with added surfactants. Contrary to the commonly assumed core-shell structure, we observed that at very low concentration of hydrocarbon surfactants, the organic phase partially engulfed the aqueous inorganic phase, a configuration we termed partial organic-phase engulfing. Furthermore, we discovered the formation of partial inorganic-phase engulfing and inverse core-shell structures, where the inorganic phase partially or fully spread over the organic domain at higher surfactant levels. We identified a relationship between equilibrium particle morphology and spreading coefficients, primarily governed by surface tension reduction in the separated organic and inorganic phases. These distinctive mixing states may substantially alter the chemical, physical, and optical properties of organic-inorganic aerosols under real atmospheric conditions. Our findings bridge a critical knowledge gap regarding the role of surface tension evolution in the equilibrium particle morphology of internally mixed atmospheric particles and its potential impact on aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions. These insights emphasize the need to refine current aerosol models to incorporate the specific LLPS morphologies observed in this study."

The reconstructed fields can be used to monitor ARs. It studies what low-Earth orbit (LEO) radio occultation (RO) constellation is appropriate to quantify the structure, location and timing of ARs. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are long filaments that transport large amounts of water vapor from the Tropics to mid- and high latitudes. They are directly related to heavy precipitation and extreme weather leading to flooding and mud slides. Accurate identification of AR structures over the ocean is important to improve the forecast of their landfall location and timing. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) is a space-based technique that can measure meteorological variables with high vertical resolution. While RO can observe structures like ARs in individual RO profiles, RO observations have non-uniform and sparse spatial and temporal sampling, so it is not yet possible to fully characterize AR morphology using RO alone.In this work, we use previous research in which we applied machine learning (ML) to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of RO observations. Here, we train neural networks (NNs) to map RO observations and help resolve ARs. Analyses using existing RO data, such as from the COSMIC-2 mission, showed that the sampling density is insufficient to resolve and geo-locate ARs. Adding observations from the other available missions (for example METOP) improved matters, but was still insufficient to reliably reconstruct AR structure.We undertake a study to determine how many LEO RO satellites would be needed to quantify the structure, location, and timing of ARs. We simulate RO observations as would be obtained with Walker constellations of 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 LEO RO satellites. First, we investigate possible constellations for proper AR monitoring. We aim for constellations that lead to hourly RO counts that change as little as possible during the AR (up to several days). This allows us to resolve ARs with similar accuracy during the scenario. We conclude that 3 or 6 orbital planes and inclinations between 85 and 90° perform best. Second, we make use of 12 h forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system to interpolate the forecasts to the simulated RO constellation sampling coordinates. Third, we use the ECMWF-based RO observations to train ML models and map them to the ECMWF grid. We compare ML-mapped RO sampled grids to ECMWF products in a closed-loop validation. Initially, we map RO refractivity at 2 km geopotential height, where small-scale structures related to water vapor are visible. We find that at least 36 RO satellites are needed to characterize the morphology of ARs in the Pacific basin with useful precision and accuracy (from the ML produced maps). Then, we use a framework with two consecutive NNs to map column-integrated water vapor (IWV) from profiles of RO. The first NN maps the refractivity into IWV, and the second NN maps the IWV spatially. In this case, we find that a constellation of 48 satellites is needed to continuously map IWV fields accurately and thus reconstruct the morphology of ARs with useful precision and accuracy. Finally, when using RO, we find that mapping refractivity into IWV is less accurate over land than over oceans. To further improve the AR mapping over land, we made use of IWV from ground-based (GB) GNSS. The significantly higher spatial and temporal resolutions of GB data compared to RO lead to much improved IWV fields and thus AR path and shape over land."

This result enables continuous aerosol monitoring and highlights microwave radiometry's under-utilized potential in atmospheric research. 
 Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a crucial parameter for understanding the impact of aerosols on Earth's atmosphere and air quality. Nevertheless, most existing remote sensing techniques rely on the shortwave spectrum, precluding nighttime measurements. While lunar and stellar photometry can measure nighttime AOD, their data availability is limited due to the scarce moonlight for lunar photometry and the rarity of application for stellar photometry. In this study, we made a first attempt to retrieve AOD from ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR) measurements in Beijing Nanjiao Meteorological Observatory in China. Brightness temperatures (BTs) at the K-band (from 22.23  to 30.00 GHz) and V-band (from 51.25 to 58.80 GHz) are trained against daytime spectral AOD from sun photometer measurements together with the temperature profile using the random forest regression (RFR) retrieval model, and the model is then used to retrieve nighttime AOD. The algorithm demonstrates satisfactory performance, with reasonable agreement with lunar AOD retrievals from the lunar photometer (R=0.91 and RMSE =0.14). The results also reveal a distinct day–night cycle of AOD, with nighttime AOD typically higher than its daytime value for the Beijing-CAMS Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site and AOD estimated based on MWR measurements. The physical basis of our approach is verified using vertical temperature and humidity profiles from sounding observation and simulation results from WRF-Chem as well as the monochromatic radiative transfer model (MonoRTM). Our study provides an effective and convenient approach to estimate nighttime aerosol loading from surface, which has great potential in environmental monitoring and climate forcing research."

It can also be measured (from ground or space) by radar and lidar. We compare satellite data we developed using the oxygen method with other estimates to help us refine our technique. 
 We previously developed the Cloud Height Retrieval from O2 Molecular Absorption (CHROMA) algorithm for the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) on the new NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission. Here, we apply CHROMA to observations from the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) to guide expectations for PACE, as it will take some time to obtain large-scale validation data for OCI. We use cloud top height (CTH), phase, and (for liquid clouds) cloud optical thickness (COT) data from the ground-based Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) network to evaluate the OLCI retrievals. We found that OLCI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) CTH compare similarly well to the ARM reference. OLCI has a tendency to underestimate CTH as CTH increases, and algorithm assumptions about cloud geometric thickness may contribute to this. ARM COT from multifilter shadowband radiometers (MFRSR) and Sun photometers are well-correlated with one another, albeit with a roughly 30 % offset on average; OLCI and MODIS COT agree more closely with the MFRSR data. OLCI retrieval uncertainty estimates show skill at telling low-uncertainty cases from high-uncertainty ones, although CTH uncertainties are underestimated. Additionally, we compare the OLCI data to satellite retrievals based on thermal infrared measurements from MODIS and  Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) data. Differences are broadly consistent with physical expectations based on the A-band vs.  thermal techniques, although one key challenge in such aggregated comparisons is different cloud masking sensitivities and algorithm failure rates meaning additional sampling differences are introduced. We conclude by discussing the transition to and possible enhancements for PACE OCI."

We evaluate measurements of five furanoids under laboratory conditions. Sensitivities were stable across humidity and electric field changes, though some compounds fragmented or formed hydrated ions. Long-term gas standard concentrations were stable. Overall, measurements are accurate but affected by unknown ions and fragments. 
 Furanoids are significant contributors to volatile organic compound hydroxyl radical reactivity in biomass burning emissions, yet their accurate measurement using proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) remains challenging due to potential interferences and measurement uncertainties. In this study, we conduct detailed laboratory characterizations of furan (C4H4O, protonated m/z 69.033), 2(3H)-furanone (C4H4O2, m/z 85.028), 2-furaldehyde (C5H4O2, m/z 97.028), 2,5-dimethylfuran (C6H8O, m/z 97.065), and maleic anhydride (C4H2O3, m/z 99.008). Sensitivities for these compounds were found to have minimal dependence (less than 15 %) on both sample humidity and drift tube electric field strength (E/N). At high E/N (150 Td), fragmentation was observed for 2-furaldehyde (∼ 8 %) at m/z 69.033, potentially interfering furan measurements, while hydrolysis products corresponding to m/z+18 ions were detected for 2(3H)-furanone, 2-furaldehyde, and maleic anhydride. The hydrolysis of maleic anhydride to maleic acid is most prominent, with the hydrate accounting for 7 %–31 % of the parent ion signal across E/N conditions.Gas standard recertification confirmed the long-term stability of furanoids, and 21 other VOCs, in compressed gas mixtures, with changes in mixing ratios of less than 5 % over seven years, although PTR-ToF-MS instrument sensitivities decreased by ∼ 30 % during this time, likely due to aging of the microchannel plate (MCP). While the stability of gas standards and the minimal humidity and fragmentation effects support the accurate measurement of furanoids by PTR-ToF-MS, discrepancies with co-deployed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry highlight the need to further investigate potential isomeric and fragment interferences, particularly in aged BB smoke."

 The 2023 Canadian wildfires yielded record-breaking emissions that were transported long distances over large sections of the mid-Atlantic region, significantly impacting regional surface air quality. In this study, we analyzed the effect of long-distance transported wildfire smoke on the Baltimore-Washington Corridor (BWC), a highly populated and industrialized metropolitan region prone to air quality exceedances. Central to the analysis is the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer in Beltsville (suburban BWC), whose linear depolarization ratio (LDR) profiles provide a continuous, altitude-resolved fingerprint for distinguishing wildfire smoke from locally generated urban aerosols. By combining the LDR-derived with satellite imagery, surface air quality observations, and NOAA HYSPLIT trajectories, we analyzed four discrete smoke events to characterize smoke's vertical distribution and interaction with the planetary boundary layer (PBL). One of the cases showed that the timing of the smoke plume's apparent lowering over the study site in relation to synoptic frontal passage was decisive in determining its impact on air quality. In contrast, those events with well-mixed smoke in the PBL during the advection-driven conditions exhibited a clear deterioration in air quality near the surface, with particulate levels exceeding the regulation threshold. The results underscore the importance of accurately representing vertical mixing in smoke forecasts and illustrate the added value of routine ceilometer LDR measurements for real-time identification of lofted smoke plumes – information not attainable from column-integrated satellite products or surface monitors alone."

The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) measures 214polonium (Po), a progeny of Rn. This study presents Po-based Rn activity concentrations measured with the HRM at eight stations in Germany with guidelines for estimating Rn from Po measurements. Comparison between modeled and measured activity concentrations shows that at high relative humidity Po measurements cannot be interpreted as Rn. 
 Atmospheric measurements of the short-lived radioactive noble gas radon-222 (222Rn) have many applications. Its concentrations are driven by atmospheric mixing as well as seasonal variations, which follow the seasonality of 222Rn exhalation from continental soils, with lower values during the wet winter and spring months compared to more dry summer conditions. Hence, it can be used as a tracer to distinguish marine from continental air masses or for transport model validation. The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) is a static filter detector measuring atmospheric 214polonium (214Po), which is a progeny of 222Rn. These measurements can be used to infer atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations if the radioactive disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn at the measurement site is known. In this study, 214Po activity concentrations measured with the HRM at eight stations in the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) Germany  network are presented, along with guidelines for evaluating these data to estimate atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations. In addition to the established line loss and disequilibrium corrections applied when sampling through long tubing or from air intake heights close to the ground, respectively, an upper limit for relative  humidity (RH) is suggested, where secular equilibrium can still be assumed. At higher RH, aerosol scavenging effects can cause disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn. Using comparison with the model this threshold is determined to be at about 98 % RH and was applied uniformly at all measurement sites. A clear diurnal cycle of 222Rn is observed at all German tower stations during the summer and autumn months as is a seasonal cycle with a maximum during summer and autumn months. Overall, our results demonstrate that the 214Po-based 222Rn measurements with the HRM are reliable if the equilibrium conditions between 214Po and 222Rn can be ensured, i.e., for air intake heights above 80–90 ma.g.l. during conditions with  RH<98 %. The corrected and ready-to-use dataset of 10-year radon activity concentrations from the eight ICOS stations is published alongside this paper (https://doi.org/10.18160/Q2M8-B1HJ, Fischer et al., 2024)."

Pure liquid water droplets are liquid until about −35 °C without the presence of a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to primary ice formation and therefore impact the phase of clouds. The dataset described herein provides INP concentration measurements at two altitudes. Connecting this data to synoptic conditions and ambient data might provide a better understanding of INPs in Finnish Lapland. 
 A novel filter-based sampler was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a one-month period in September and October 2022 in Finnish Lapland around 5 km north of the Sammaltunturi station. This area frequently features low-level clouds during autumn. The sampler was deployed on-board of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and on the ground. Two filters were deployed simultaneously on the ground and on the UAV to enable a comparison between the two vertical levels. The dataset contains 9 ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentration spectra that feature a temporal overlap at both altitudes, a handling blank filter to assess possible contamination during handling and additional samples from both setups without the temporal overlap. The dataset is the first of its kind, providing altitude-based INP concentrations in Finnish Lapland, and is available at the Zenodo Open Science data archive (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13911633, Böhmländer et al., 2024). There is no clear systematic difference between INP concentrations measured at the different altitudes. The INP concentration is variable over the period measured and also does show some differences on the vertical level. The INP concentration at 253 K varies between 0.15 and 3.06 Lstd-1 on the ground, and between 0.48 and 1.69 Lstd-1 at higher altitudes. The connection to synoptic conditions and ambient measurements might provide a better understanding of the origin, lifetime, and distribution of INPs in Finnish Lapland."

One of these interactions happens due to a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to the freezing of pure water droplets above −35 °C, which otherwise would stay liquid. This has impacts on the weather and climate. The present data set presents a unique data set with a high temporal resolution. 
 The Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a three-month-period at the Sammaltunturi station in autumn 2022 (between late September 2022 and late December 2022). The station is located on top of a hill on the edge between sub-Arctic and boreal forest environments, typically receiving air masses from the Arctic and the south. Since clouds are frequently present at the station during autumn, the present aerosol particles can have a direct impact on cloud properties. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are aerosol particles that facilitate primary ice nucleation in supercooled cloud droplets. The PINE measured the INP concentration with a high temporal resolution of six minutes at different nucleation temperatures between 240 and 252 K. The INP concentration varied exponentially with the freezing temperature and differences between different months were observed. The highest median INP concentration was measured during December over the whole temperature range, while during November the lowest median INP concentration was measured. The data presented here is useful to study aerosol-cloud interactions for a sub-Arctic location with minimal anthropogenic influence. The high temporal resolution allows to correlate the INP concentration with other measurements, such as size distribution data and meteorological data. In addition, the data provides the ice nucleating ability of ambient aerosol particles, which can be combined with models to study the nature, the source and the age of the INPs."

By comparing downwind and background conditions, the study revealed significant reductions in pollutants linked to traffic: -35.6 % for CO, -52.3 % for NOₓ, -56.7 % for eBC, and -15 % for CO2. These trends align with emission decrease estimates from AIRPARIF inventories over the same period. 
 CO2 is the main contributor to global warming, and cities now account for more than two-thirds of emissions of this gas. Atmospheric observatories located on the outskirts of cities are therefore important facilities for measuring the impact on atmospheric composition of the emission reductions planned by cities. The Saclay observatory, part of the ICOS and ACTRIS research infrastructures and located 20 km southwest of Paris, has been monitoring greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4), reactive gases (NOx, O3, CO), and carbonaceous aerosols (eBC) since 2012. This study presents 10 years of monitoring of these compounds, characterizing diurnal, seasonal cycles and decadal trends. In order to best characterize the impact of Parisian emissions, we defined two sets of data depending on whether the station is downwind of Paris or, conversely, in background conditions with westerly winds. This strategy allows us to characterize the urban offset in the Saclay measurement series. The results show a significant decrease in the urban offset of compounds mainly linked to traffic emissions: -35.6 %, -52.3 %, and -56.7 % for CO, NOx, and eBClf. There was also a 15 % decrease in urban offset of CO2 between the 2012–2017 and 2019–2022 periods, a figure consistent with the Airparif inventories' estimate of the decrease in emissions in Paris over the same period."

During KORUS‐AQ (May–June 2016), aircraft observations over Seoul using chemical ionization mass spectrometry reported MHP concentrations exceeding 1 ppb in the planetary boundary layer, four times higher than simulated by the GEOS‐Chem atmospheric chemistry model. We show that this discrepancy can be explained in part by the instrument's positive interference from methanediol (MD) under high‐humidity conditions, where MD is produced in clouds by formaldehyde hydration. Including MD chemistry in GEOS‐Chem increases the global formic acid source by 11% but has otherwise minimal impact on the model chemistry. Observed MHP concentrations in the dry free troposphere are much less sensitive to MD interference and vary with the branching ratio of the CH3O2 reaction with HO2 versus NO, supporting current understanding of low‐NO and high‐NO chemical regimes for VOC oxidation."

Tai observatory,"•Primary air pollutants decreased from the ground surface to the free troposphere during COVID-19. •O3and Oxlevels at Mt. Tai remained stable, contrasting with sharp increases at ground-level sites. •PM2.5rose significantly at Mt. Tai, driven by enhanced secondary aerosol formation. 
 To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), China adopted a series of rigorous containment measures, resulting in dramatic anthropogenic emission reductions, and thus exerted great influences on air quality. Ground-based measurements reported notable decrease in major air pollutants such as CO, NOx, SO2, PM2.5 during the lockdown period, however, O3 concentration increased markedly due to the alleviated NO-titration. However, the impact of these emission reductions on the regional air quality in the free troposphere remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the influence of the emission reductions on air pollutant concentrations at the summit of Mt. Tai, which lies above the identifiable residual layer (RL) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) during wintertime and is therefore representative of the lower free troposphere over the central North China Plain (NCP). Our results showed that during the lockdown period, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations decreased significantly by 37.1 %, 27.6 % and 23.4 %, respectively, compared to the pre-COVID period. O3 and Ox concentrations remained largely unchanged, but PM2.5 concentrations increased significantly by 21.9 %, diverging from most ground-level stations. Combined with the RACM-CAPRAM model simulations, the result suggests that the increased in PM2.5 was mainly attributed to enhanced secondary aerosol formation, as indicated by enhanced formation of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and organic aerosol component associated with aqueous-phase reactions. This enhancement was more pronounced during nighttime. These findings suggest that enhanced secondary aerosol formation during the lockdown period can offset primary emission reductions, contributing to the elevation of PM2.5 in the free troposphere of the NCP."

 In this study the emission-driven aerosol–meteorology feedback on winter PM2.5 variations in Central and East China (CEC) from 2014 to 2020 is examined by applying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry. Emission reductions from 2014 to 2020 led to increases in downward shortwave radiation at the surface, 2-m temperature and planetary boundary layer height, as well as decreases in 2-m relative humidity in the central part of CEC. This also led to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in the liquid water path in the southern part of CEC. The change in the PM2.5 concentration induced by aerosol‒meteorology feedback (ΔM PM2.5) was −10 μg m−3 to −5 μg m−3 in eastern Hunan Province and −5 μg m−3 to −2 μg m−3 in other CEC regions. The average percentages of ΔM PM2.5 relative to the total change in the PM2.5 concentration due to emission reduction were 9.8 %, 5.7 %, 5.6 %, 9.2 %, and 20.3 % for CEC, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Fenwei Plain (FWP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), respectively. In the central part of CEC, the contribution of aerosol‒radiation interaction (ARI) dominated, with a very slight contribution from aerosol‒cloud interaction (ACI). In the southern part of CEC, both ACI and ARI contributed to ΔM PM2.5, with ACI playing a more significant role. ΔM PM2.5 exhibited distinct diurnal variations in the BTH, the FWP, and the YRD, with greater contributions during the day and smaller contributions at night, which was attributed primarily to the diurnal variation in the ARI contribution. This study emphasizes the necessity of considering aerosol–meteorology feedback when assessing the effects of emission control measures on PM2.5 concentrations."

 Aerosol-Radiation Interaction (ARI) and Aerosol-Cloud Interaction (ACI) significantly affect radiation budgets and hydrological cycles. However, quantifying the contribution of anthropogenic aerosols to regional precipitation remains a major challenge. In this study, utilizing the Regional Climate Model version 5 (RegCM5), we unraveled the mechanisms related to the disparities between daytime and nighttime in the impact of the anthropogenic aerosols on the summer precipitation over the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). The results indicate that the ARI decreases the daily total precipitation amount (PA) by 0.05 mm (12 h)−1 and precipitation frequency (PF) by 0.74 %. This suppression occurs primarily through a reduction in daytime convective precipitation, driven by radiative cooling (up to 14.02 W m−2 reduction in surface net shortwave radiation) that enhances lower-atmospheric stability, manifested as a significant suppression of the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), leading to moisture divergence and widespread subsidence. Compared to ARI, ACI exerts a stronger suppression, reducing daily total PA (PF) by 0.16 mm (12 h)−1 (1.91 %) mainly by reducing daytime light to moderate convective precipitation. This is attributed to increased high cloud cover (3.89 %), which reduces surface net radiation and profoundly enhances atmospheric stability, quantified by a significant reduction in Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), thereby weakening ascending motion. This study quantifies that ACI has a stronger impact than ARI, and both effects are significantly more pronounced during the daytime, revealing the critical role of diurnal processes in modulating aerosol-precipitation interactions."

Then, radon exhalation maps from the 19ENV01 traceRadon project, STILT trajectories from the ICOS Carbon Portal, best estimate of radon activity concentration and greenhouse data have been used to estimate the surface emissions.  To our knowledge, this is the first study in Europe using the latest radon exhalation maps and standardized radon measurements to estimate CO2, CH4, CO and N2O surface emissions. We found that the average RTM estimates are 867 ± 565, 1.10 ± 0.89, 1.01 ± 1.05 and 0.094 ± 0.118 mgm-2h-1 for CO2, CH4, CO and N2O, respectively. These fluxes are in good agreement with the literature for the same site or for similar suburban sites in Europe. No significant trends are observed over time, except for CO, which shows a small decreasing trend especially over the last three years.CH4, N2O and CO are also in fair agreement with the inventories, though with higher values. CO2 fluxes are about 5 times higher than modeled anthropogenic and biogenic fluxes combined. The differences mainly occur during summer, and the CO/CO2 ratio points toward a misrepresentation of the biogenic fluxes by the WRF-VPRM version used here."

 This paper presents the results of 3 weeks of aerosol sampling at the Henties Bay coastal site in Namibia during the Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) field campaign in August–September 2017. The campaign coincided with a transition period between two synoptic regimes and corresponded to a significant change in the aerosol composition measured at the site and in particular of that of mineral dust. During August, the dust was natural windblown from the southerly gravel plains, with a composition consistent with that previously observed in Namibia. In September, the dust was fugitive from anthropogenic mining, possibly with a minor contribution of smelting emissions in northern Namibia or as far as the Copper Belt in Zambia, one of the regional hotspots of pollution.Chemical analysis of filter samples highlights the difference in elemental composition, in particular heavy metals, such as As, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn, but also silicon, in the anthropogenic dust. The metal solubility of the natural dust was higher, including that of iron (up to 5 % compared to less than 1 % for anthropogenic dust). Anthropogenic dust was associated with slight higher content of iron oxides and a larger proportion of coarse particles. Additionally, we found that the iron solubility, and, more in general, the metals' solubility, correlated to the high concentrations of fluoride ions which are attributed to marine emissions from the Namibian shelf. In a renewed manner, these results highlight the importance of ocean–atmosphere exchanges affecting both the atmospheric composition and the marine biogeochemistry in the Benguela region."

Airborne observations from a field campaign are used to constrain an ensemble of global model configurations and their associated cloud property changes. Results show that airborne in-situ measurements of aerosol and cloud properties do provide insight into global changes in cloud microphysics but are sensitive to uncertainties in both airborne measurements and Earth system model emulators. 
 Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) in warm clouds alter reflected shortwave radiation by influencing cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties. The variable of state controlling ACI is the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd). Here, we examine the perturbations in Nd due to anthropogenic aerosols (ΔNd, PD-PI) using a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) hosted in the sixth Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6). Surrogate models are created for the CAM6 PPE outputs and are used to generate 1 million model variants of CAM6 by sampling 45 sources of parameter uncertainty. The range of uncertain physical parameters related to ACI are constrained with observations of aerosol and cloud properties from SOCRATES. The likely range of uncertain parameters and the associated range of ΔNd, PD-PI are more strongly constrained with observations of Nd relative to observations of cloud condensation nuclei. We conduct sensitivity tests of how constraints on  ΔNd, PD-PI are affected by systematic uncertainties in observations and our limitations in our surrogate models created for CAM6 PPE outputs. Based on this, we provide guidance on the impact of reducing systematic uncertainty in airborne microphysical observations and in surrogate models."

Steiner,Observed changes in the temperature and height  of the globally resolved lapserate tropopause,"The tropopause, the boundary between the lower and upper atmosphere, is a sensitive marker of climate change. We studied changes in tropopause height and temperature over the past two decades using precise satellite observations. We found warming in the tropics and rising tropopause heights in many regions, especially over Asia and the Middle East. These changes reflect how both atmospheric layers are responding to climate change and highlight the need for continued satellite monitoring. 
 The tropopause is a key indicator of atmospheric climate change, influenced by both the troposphere and stratosphere. Here we present a global view of tropopause changes, using high-resolution GNSS radio occultation data from 2002 to 2024. We identify significant trends in lapse rate tropopause (LRT) temperature and height with seasonal and regional detail. The tropical LRT has warmed, with particularly strong warming (>1 K per decade) over the South Pacific during austral spring and summer, while height changes remain largely insignificant. Outside the tropics, LRT temperature changes are confined to southern high latitudes in winter, showing cooling of up to 1 K per decade. Notably, LRT height has increased significantly across most extratropical regions, with localized trends exceeding 200 m per decade over Asia and the Middle East during Northern Hemisphere winter. An exception is the LRT height decreases over the South Pacific, coinciding with a LRT warming in that region. These results highlight the interrelated effects of tropospheric and stratospheric changes and demonstrate the value of precise tropopause monitoring for detecting ongoing changes in the global climate system."

This research advances our understanding of cloud life cycle and improves the ability to characterize cloud profiles, which is crucial for enhancing weather forecast and climate change research. 
 Stratiform liquid cloud profiles are key to deciphering cloud life cycles, microphysical processes, and climate change impacts. Nevertheless, remote sensing of cloud vertical structure remains largely unresolved. CloudSat active measurements provide cloud microphysical profile products but are restricted to narrow orbital tracks. Multiangle passive imagers, such as Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance (POLDER), are capable of generating a variety of cloud properties with broad area coverage; however, they lack key prior knowledge and effective methods for obtaining cloud vertical information. Focusing on single-layer cloud profile retrieval, we first reveal the structural characteristics of stratiform cloud effective radius (CER) profiles based on global CloudSat data and find that the dominant structures include triangle-shaped and monotonically decreasing profiles, which account for approximately 88.5 % of global liquid CER profiles. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to estimate the structural characteristics of triangle-shaped profiles from POLDER observations like the properties of the profile turning point (TP). This approach integrates vertical structure morphology recognition with a combination of fitting methods and machine learning models. The cloud profiles are then accurately reconstructed using physical parameterization models. Our retrieval results exhibit good consistency with active observations, with an RMSE of 1.1 µm for TP_CER and 0.1 for the normalized cloud optical thickness at the TP. This research advances the parameterization of liquid cloud profiles and enables profile structural characteristic retrieval based on a multiangle passive imager. Our findings provide valuable insights into improving the understanding and modelling of cloud processes in weather and climate systems."

Lange;Anna Novelli;Benjamin Winter;Changmin Cho;Iulia Gensch;Sergej Wedel;Andreas Wahner;Astrid Kiendler-Scharr,Measurement report: Comprehensive seasonal study of the composition and sources of submicron aerosol during the JULIAC campaign in Germany,"We measured air particles at a rural site in Germany over a year to understand how their sources and properties change with the seasons. Particles from natural sources peaked in summer, especially during heatwaves, while those from burning activities like residential heating and wildfires dominated in colder months. Winds carrying air from other regions also influenced particle levels. These findings link air quality to climate change and energy transitions. 
 The seasonal variations of aerosol sources and their atmospheric evolution are investigated using observations from the year-long JULIAC (Jülich Atmospheric Chemistry Project) campaign (January–November 2019) in Jülich, Germany. Non-refractory submicron aerosol components were continuously measured alongside oxidants (OH, O3, NO3), trace gases, and meteorological conditions. Organic aerosols (OA) dominated the aerosol composition throughout the year (39 %–58 %), with secondary formation being the major source. OA, including organic nitrate and organosulfate, peaked during a summer heatwave event due to enhanced daytime and nighttime secondary OA formation driven by elevated concentrations of atmospheric oxidants. Changes in the OA composition during the heatwave suggest a shift in the formation pathways, where isoprene may play an important role. Biomass-burning, mainly wildfires and anthropogenic activities (e.g., heating, industry), is the dominant primary OA source (45 %–83 %), which may grow in influence due to climate change and the expected energy transition. Air masses containing OA from regional transport from marine and wildfire sources are identified through source apportionment. Analysis and modeling prove this method to be more reliable than traditional tracer-based methods. Regional transport to this study site typically shows a cleansing effect on the aerosol concentration, except in winter. Furthermore, seasonal variations in the effects of regional transport are seen, where identical transport pathways led to different influences on aerosol properties, driven by seasonal differences in biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. This study enhances understanding of seasonal variation in submicron aerosol properties in response to their sources, atmospheric evolution, and transport."

During dust events, oxalic acid and precursors shift from fine to coarse particles, with concurrent heterogeneous reactions on coarse particle surfaces. The characteristic isotopic fractionation signatures accompanying these transformations yield novel theoretical frameworks for elucidating aerosol aging mechanisms in mountainous environments. 
 Dust transport significantly affects downwind aerosol formation and regional climate, yet the evolutionary mechanisms of SOA during this process remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted vertical observations of PM2.5 and size-segregated aerosols at the foot and top of Mount Hua, focusing on C2 formation and its δ13C signatures influenced by dust transport. Under non-dust conditions, PM2.5 and diacid concentrations at the foot were 4.5 and 2.1 times higher than those at the top, indicating stronger anthropogenic influence at lower elevations. Aerosols at the top revealed enhanced photochemical aging, with higher C2 / C4 (5.84 vs. 4.74), C3 / C4 ratios (1.04 vs. 0.56), and more positive δ13C values (−21.5 ‰ vs. −27.6 ‰). The positive correlation of C2 with ALWC and its consistent size distribution with precursors confirm aqueous-phase oxidation as the dominant formation pathway. During dust events, although PM2.5 concentrations increased, C2 concentrations in PM2.5 decreased by 59 % at the foot and 25 % at the top. Concurrently, the δ13C values of C2 showed a positive shift, particularly at the top (from −21.5 ‰ to −13.2 ‰), suggesting that alkaline dust catalyzes the formation of 13C-enriched oxalate. Size-segregated data revealed a shift of C2 from the fine to the coarse mode, with the coarse-to-fine ratio increasing from 0.3–0.4 to 0.6–1.1. These findings demonstrate that under dust influence, the primary formation pathway of C2 shifts from aqueous-phase oxidation in fine particles to heterogeneous reactions on coarse-particle surfaces. Moreover, this shift is accompanied by a positive shift in the δ13C signature of C2 and is more pronounced at higher altitudes."

EarthCARE's radar provides the first space-based vertical wind data, capturing updrafts and downdrafts. Combined with satellite imagery from other sensors, it offers a broader view of convective storms. While resolution limits detail, cloud-top cooling helps track storm development. This combined approach improves understanding and modeling of convection. 
 Convective updrafts and downdrafts play a vital role in Earth’s energy and water cycles by modulating vertical energy and moisture transport and shaping precipitation patterns. Despite their importance, the characteristics of convective motions and their relationship to the near-storm environment remain poorly constrained by observations.Doppler radars, in principle, are able to measure the vertical air motion within clouds, thus providing critical insight into convective dynamics and enabling estimates of convective mass flux. The payload of the recently launched EarthCARE satellite mission includes a 94 GHz Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) with Doppler capability. In this study, we present first-light CPR Doppler velocity observations in deep convective clouds. These early examples offer a first glimpse into the dynamic nature of cloud systems. The narrow footprint of the CPR helps reduce the impact of multiple scattering and non-uniform beam filling (NUBF) on the Doppler velocity measurements. However, the instrument’s low Nyquist velocity presents a significant challenge for recovering the true Doppler velocity profiles in deep convective systems.The CPR Doppler velocity observations are expected to challenge traditional methodologies for identifying deep convective cores, which typically rely on reflectivity-based thresholds. We showcase examples that demonstrate the synergy between CPR Doppler velocity measurements and geostationary satellite observations, illustrating how their combined use can help capture the evolution of the convective lifecycle.These results align with EarthCARE’s broader mission objectives and highlight the potential of spaceborne Doppler radars to significantly advance our understanding of cloud dynamics and convection in the climate system."

By equipping the high-altitude Grob G 520 Egrett with a suite of custom and modified commercial instruments, we demonstrate precise, high-resolution measurements of aerosol particles, trace gases, and contrail ice in the engine exhaust plume at cruise altitudes. 
 This paper reports on the successful first deployment of a new, autonomously operating measurement system on a Grob G 520 Egrett aircraft, which was used as a chase aircraft to perform in-flight aerosol and trace gas measurements of engine exhaust from other aircraft. A suite of custom-built and commercially available instruments was selected, modified, and adapted to operate in the unpressurized compartment of the Egrett over a wide range of ambient temperatures and pressures. We performed these first in-flight emission measurements at cruise altitudes between 7.6 and 10.4 km (FL250 and FL340) behind a Piper Cheyenne, a twin-turboprop aircraft powered by Garrett/Honeywell TPE 331-14 engines over Texas in April 2022. The instrumentation and inlets on the Egrett were designed to measure non-volatile particulate matter (nvPMDp>10), total particulate matter (tPMDp>10), nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and contrail ice particles. All instruments were operated in relevant plume conditions at cruise altitudes and distances ranging from 100 to 1200 m between the two aircraft. The instruments proved to have high reliability, a large dynamic range, and sufficient accuracy for measuring the emissions of the turboprop engine.We derived the emission indices (EI) for tPM, nvPM, and NOx at cruise. The particulate emission indices range from 9.6 to 16.2 × 1014 kg−1 (particles per kg fuel burned) for EItPM and from 8.1 to 12.4 × 1014 kg−1 for EInvPM (medians). For NOx we find rather low EINOx between 7.3 and 7.7 g kg−1 for EINOx (medians). Furthermore, the tPM aerosol size distributions have been measured in the exhaust plume, taking into account the size-resolved sampling efficiency of the instrument. The analysis of the size-resolved emission index indicates a log-normal distribution with geometric mean and standard deviation at Dg=27.5±2.0 nm. This geometric diameter value is in the range of jet engine soot emissions previously measured in flight. The measurements help to constrain the climate impact of small-class turboprop engines and need to be compared to larger turboprop aircraft in the future. The current work provides a benchmark for future alternative H2 propulsion systems, such as fuel cells and direct combustion engines."

A Python package is developed, providing advanced tools for input preparation, validation and visualization results. 
 Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is the most commonly used approach for particulate matter source apportionment; however, the implementation steps of the model require considerable user experience. Most studies apply PMF according to the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission, while relatively few studies focus on further developing the PMF methodology. This study aims to develop a systematic method that reduces some subjective aspects when performing a PMF study, providing recommendations and tools for its application and validation. A total of 13 targeted tests were conducted to address key sources of subjectivity in PMF, categorized into three critical aspects: preparation of the input matrix, selecting the number of sources, and validation of the PMF solution. The results of the first step highlighted that using a single source tracer reduces the tracer's dispersion into other sources, leading to more accurate results. The second stage tests suggested that the selection of a source tracer should be based on low uncertainty and specific temporal evolution, in order to facilitate the determination of a new source without compromising the PMF solution. Finally, the validation step was set up as an advanced comparison of the PMF-derived source profiles with those in the literature, including SPECIEUROPE database, using the ratio of chemicals and distance metrics. All outcomes of this study are compiled into a Python package providing essential tools to support the work from PMF implementation to solution validation, leading to less subjective solutions and more rigorous and reliable source apportionment."

Winker,Mapping 532 nm lidar ratios for CALIPSO-classified marine aerosols using MODIS AOD constrained retrievals and GOCART model simulations,"NASA's CALIPSO satellite mission observed aerosols (airborne particles) globally from 2006 to 2023. Its final data products update improves its aerosol optical parameters over oceans by adjusting for regional and seasonal differences in a new measurement-model synergistic approach. This results in a more realistic aerosol characterization, specifically near coastlines (where sea salt mixes with pollution), with potential impacts to future studies of science applications (e.g., climate effects). 
 The NASA-CNES Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission provided a spaceborne global record of atmospheric aerosol and cloud profiles from June 2006 to June 2023. As an elastic backscatter lidar, the CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) typically required an assumption of the aerosol lidar ratio (extinction-to-backscatter ratio; Sa) to retrieve aerosol extinction and column-integrated aerosol optical depth (AOD). In all previous versions of its data products, the CALIPSO extinction algorithms first determine the aerosol types then assign one Sa value globally for each aerosol type (e.g., 23 sr for marine at 532 nm). One of the major changes for the final CALIPSO data products release (Version 5, or V5) is the implementation of regional and seasonal Sa tables for CALIOP-classified “marine” aerosols. In this study, we describe the process of creating the tables using 12 years (June 2006–August 2018) of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) total column AODs to constrain collocated CALIOP backscatter profiles in a Fernald inversion scheme and infer Sa (at 532 nm), focusing solely on the CALIOP “marine” aerosol type. The Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) global aerosol model is used to estimate sea salt volume fraction (SSVF) that are collocated with the constrained Sa retrievals. Patterns of smaller SSVF (< 65 %) and larger constrained Sa (> 40 sr) are found near land masses, while larger SSVF (> 95 %) and smaller constrained Sa (< 30 sr) are generally observed in the remote oceans. The inverse empirical relationship found between modeled SSVF and constrained Sa over global oceans yields values of ∼ 21 sr for SSVF of 100 % (i.e., “pure” marine) and ∼ 58 sr for SSVF of 0 % (i.e., the absence of marine aerosol). This relationship is applied to develop regional and seasonal hybrid (retrieval and model-assisted) climatological Sa maps for CALIOP-classified marine aerosols; i.e., when MODIS-constrained results are not available, the model-assisted values are used. These hybrid Sa maps are subsequently used to retrieve new CALIPSO Level 2 (L2) aerosol extinction profiles and column AODs in the V5 release. For a 4-month (January, April, July, and October 2015) analysis, the V5 L2 CALIPSO AODs compared better to CALIPSO Ocean Derived Column Optical Depth (ODCOD) than the CALIPSO Version 4.51 (V4.51) standard AODs in several regions, most notably the Bay of Bengal/Arabian Sea, where smoke/pollution typically mixes with marine aerosols. Also, the V5 CALIPSO AODs likely provide a lower AOD bias and root-mean-square-error than V4.51 AODs relative to coastal and island Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AODs, as found in a validation study using data from June 2006 through October 2022. The technique described in this study contributes to CALIPSO's final V5 data products release and provides critical Sa information for future spaceborne elastic backscatter lidars."

This sharp reduction in anthropogenic emissions has occurred against a background influenced by changing regional biomass burning emissions over a similar period of time. Here, we use the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) to estimate aerosol instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) due to changes in emissions of aerosols and precursors from biomass burning and anthropogenic sources (separately and in combination) over 2008–2016, with a focus on China and regions downwind. We also separately quantify the IRF due to changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions inside China (CHN) and the Rest Of the World (ROW). Reductions in Chinese anthropogenic emissions of BC, SO2 and OC contributed −0.30 ± 0.01, +1.00 ± 0.04, and +0.05 ± 0.01 W m−2, respectively to IRF over China, accounting for ∼97% of the total local anthropogenic aerosol IRF. These emission changes contributed a remote regional IRF of 0.22 ± 0.04 W m−2 over the North Pacific Ocean. The reduction in SO2 emissions from China contributed a global IRF of equal magnitude to that from SO2 emissions from ROW (∼0.08 W m−2). Changes in global biomass burning emissions contributed 0.03 W m−2 (equivalent to over 20% of the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol IRF), enhancing the global anthropogenic aerosol IRF, whereas they partly offset the anthropogenic IRF over China. Meanwhile, biomass burning emissions dominated the total IRF (around 98%) over the Arctic."

Researchers have developed various morphological models of BC and computed their scattering matrices in attempts to replicate experimental measurements. However, prior simulation endeavors frequently encountered issues such as significant discrepancies with observational data, implausible particle shapes, or unsuitable computational parameters. In this study, we developed a fractal‐based overlapping and necking model to represent the morphology of bare BC particles. We computed the scattering matrices for both individual particles and particle population using these models and compared the results with the previously reported measurements. Our findings revealed that the overlapping model reproduces the measured scattering matrix elements more accurately, whereas the necking model fails to achieve similar consistency. At a wavelength of 532 nm, the overlapping model yields F22(π)/F11(π) ranging from 0.80 to 0.99 for single particles and from 0.86 to 0.99 for particle population, both of which are much closer to the experimental observations than those of the necking model. In contrast, only a small subset of results from the necking model falls within the measured range. The overlapping model outperforms the necking model in reproducing the scattering matrix and should be preferred for representing bare BC particles. The established understanding provides useful guidance for retrieving microphysical parameters of BC from polarization features and for diminishing the uncertainties associated with its radiative forcing estimates."

In this work, the main absorbing components of BrC were separated into three fractions and each fraction was analyzed individually and systematically. The compositional and structural characteristics of BrC across different wavelengths were studied, and the potential BrC compounds were revealed. Overall, nearly 100 light‐absorbing compounds were identified. The result showed that aromatic and heterocyclic compounds were main contributors to BrC absorption in the wavelength from 220 to 450 nm, which play an important role in radiative forcing. Interestingly, carbonyl groups dominated the BrC absorption in the wavelength from 200 to 220 nm. Although BrC compounds have minimal direct radiative impact due to limited solar radiation at such a wavelength, it can still play important roles in atmospheric photochemistry by participating in light‐induced oxidation process and lead to severe photochemical pollution. Additionally, carboxyl‐rich alicyclic molecules and lignin‐like substances all promoted the absorptivity of BrC, and nitrogenous substituents further enhanced such a process. These results were further extrapolated to various environmental conditions, which indicated that urban BrC probably contained more carbonyl groups. Conversely, more heterocyclic substances were observed in the forest and ocean areas, which illustrated high burden of radiative forcing in these areas. Overall, our work reveals that the BrC absorption is largely dependent on their molecule properties in different wavelengths, and such a correlation can guide and facilitate the BrC absorption analysis."

The model integrates ceilometer, surface meteorology, and radiation measurements, and is trained using thermodynamic PBLH estimates derived from radiosondes. This approach aims to bridge gaps between aerosol‐based and thermodynamic‐based PBLH estimates. The RF model outperformed traditional methods during daytime and better captured transition periods, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness. At ARM SGP, it showed a substantial reduction in both bias and RMSE, with a bias near zero (−4.9 m) compared with traditional Haar Wavelet (HW) (70.9 m) and Vaisala BL‐View software (124.1 m), and an RMSE of 303.2 m, lower than both BL‐View (566.9 m) and HW (404.6 m). During daytime hours, RF consistently outperformed both alternatives, maintaining lower bias and RMSE across all periods. At a second evaluation site, RF achieved the lowest overall RMSE (323.7 m), similar to HW (326.4 m) and significantly better than BL‐View (738.3 m). However, all models showed reduced accuracy under stable nighttime conditions, limiting the reliability of PBLH estimates. Key predictors for the model included the lifting condensation level height (LCLH), aerosol gradients, and month for seasonal variability. The study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning with multiple data sets such as surface energy and thermodynamic data to advance PBLH estimation."

 Surface ozone pollution, a major threat to ecosystems and human health, can be exacerbated by interactions between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. Here we combine field observations with numerical models to reveal a previously unrecognized pathway that intensifies ozone pollution: urban expansion fragments forests, forming Urban-Forest-Urban plumes that trigger cascading ozone production. In South China, five-year observations show ozone levels in Urban-Forest-Urban plumes are 35%–105% higher than in other plume types during hot seasons. Urban pollutants infiltrating forests elevate atmospheric oxidation capacity, accelerating biogenic volatile organic compounds oxidation and boosting their ozone contribution by up to twelvefold. The resulting long-lived oxygenated volatile organic compounds are transported downwind and further react with urban nitrogen oxides, enhancing ozone production. This mechanism shows strong temperature dependence, with up to 10% more ozone per 1 °C warming, underscoring its growing significance under climate change.

 Methane (CH4) emissions from super-emitters on Turkmenistan make it a major global methane hotspot, yet regional emissions and temporal dynamics of these super-emitter sources remain poorly characterized. This study presents a joint analysis of CH4 point source emissions along Turkmenistan’s west coast using multi-satellite hyperspectral observations from PRISMA and Advanced Hyperspectral Imagers (AHSIs) onboard Chinese satellites GF-5B, ZY-1E, and ZY-1F during 2020–2024. We identified 38 point sources with 256 plumes across 1078 satellite overpasses, revealing total regional intermittent emissions of 0.60 (+0.39/-0.29) Tg·a–1. Individual plumes emission rates ranged from 0.37 ± 0.10 to 34.13 ± 11.98 t·h–1, with 25 of 38 sources associated with inefficient flaring operations. A significant ∼ 7 % annual increase in emissions from 2020 to 2023 corresponds with growth in natural gas production. This estimate of annual increase is consistent with that from multispectral satellites of Sentinel-2 and Landsat. Integration of multi-satellite hyperspectral data enhances detection capabilities, enabling finer plume delineation and improving emission quantification. Our findings show emissions consistent with EDGAR v8.0 inventories but nearly three times that of EDGAR v2024, revealing substantial inventory inconsistencies. These findings underscore the importance of high-resolution satellite monitoring for accurate emission inventories and methane mitigation."

 This study investigates the temporal variability of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density over Milan in Italy and its surrounding area using daily satellite observations from Aura/OMI over the period of 2004–2023. The analysis reveals a significant long-term decrease of 55 % in NO2 pollution which is consistent with previous studies. Using spectral analysis techniques such as wavelet and harmonic analysis, we identified distinct oscillation patterns such as an annual cycle linked to seasonal heating and NO2 lifetime variations, and shorter-term variabilities of 6.5–7.5 days (I7) as well as two to five days (I3). The I7 pattern, attributed to weekly traffic variations, shows consistent presence throughout the study period, while I3 exhibits notable temporal variations. The I3/I7 ratio demonstrates significant shifts corresponding to major economic events, including the 2008 global economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the increased adoption of remote work during the pandemic (2.5 %–12 % between 2019 and 2021) disrupted traditional weekly commuting patterns, reflected in enhanced I3 dominance. This study establishes a clear connection between economic activities, commuting behavior, and NO2 variability patterns, demonstrating how the shift to remote work, leaves distinct signatures in atmospheric NO2 variability."

 Introduced in April 2019, the London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) targets reductions in NOx and PM emissions to improve ambient air quality, with COVID-19 related restrictions superimposed throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, little existing research assesses the impact of these interventions on O3 and UFP (Ultrafine particles) concentrations, or accounts for variations in meteorological or anthropogenic influences. To assess these effects, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 and 51 size-channel UFP data collected between January 2015 and December 2022 were normalised using Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models comprised of twelve predictor variables, including overall trend, time of day/year, wind speed/direction, temperature and traffic volume. The introduction of the ULEZ expedited reductions in NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 abundance, aligning with existing research, alongside reductions in nucleation mode UFP abundance and concomitant increases in O3, Aitken and accumulation mode UFP abundance. The implementation of COVID-19 restrictions expedited an increase/decrease in O3/NO2 respectively through the typical OX couple chemistry. The use of BRT models accounts for changes in the predictor variables, thereby showing that changes in atmospheric composition are not wholly a reflection of seasonality, meteorology or anthropogenic activity. The findings indicate the introduction of both ULEZ and COVID-19 restrictions precipitated a reduction in ambient concentrations of larger particulate matter (i.e. PM10, and PM2.5) and larger modes of UFPs (i.e Accumulation and Aitken), alongside increasing concentrations of nucleation mode particles. The findings reinforce the necessity of examining the impact of interventions on atmospheric composition, including changes in the abundance of secondary pollutants."

 Tropospheric ozone (O3), formed through photochemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2), poses detrimental risks to health and ecosystems. In South Korea, the fourth-highest maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations have increased from 53 to 89 ppbv over the past three decades, and the implementation of the carbon neutrality strategy in South Korea is expected to alter emissions of O3 precursors (NOx, VOCs). In particular, emission changes in the transportation sector can affect ozone concentrations in densely populated urban areas, thereby impacting public health outcomes. Therefore, we investigate O3 responses to transportation decarbonization using a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) under mobile NOx and VOCs emission reduction scenarios. Across all scenarios involving 40 % reductions in mobile NOx emissions in South Korea, with additional VOC reductions and expanded coverage to China in some cases, MDA8 O3 concentrations increased. Furthermore, O3 production regimes in South Korea remain NOx-saturated or transitional in major cities despite NOx reductions, while suburban and remote forested regions are becoming more limited by NOx availability. NOx-only mobile emission reductions led to substantial MDA8 O3 increases (up to 4.7 ppbv) and additional six exceedance days compared to results from the control run, whereas concurrent VOCs reductions mitigated both the magnitude (2.7 ppbv) and the number of ozone exceedance days. Also, emission reductions for both NOx and VOC in South Korea and China resulted in reducing O3 exceedance days in May–July compared to results implemented only in South Korea, highlighting the importance of transboundary VOC mitigation."

 The aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) is a significant contributor to uncertainties in visibility predictions. The visibility diagnostic algorithm (S1) utilized in the China Meteorological Administration Mesoscale Model (CMA-MESO) does not incorporate the AEC, leading to an inadequate representation of aerosol impacts on visibility, particularly during haze events, which diminishes the effectiveness of visibility forecasts. In this study, the AEC has been integrated into the model's calculations to enhance the accuracy of visibility predictions. Two optimization schemes for the visibility diagnostic algorithm have been proposed: one based on historical observational data from monitoring station (S2), and another that calculates the AEC using haze model forecast data (S3). A comparative evaluation of the visibility forecasting capabilities of the three schemes (S1, S2, and S3) was conducted, focusing on their spatial-temporal characteristics. The findings indicate that for the visibility range of 1-3 km, the original S1 scheme already performs well in terms of the Threat Score(TS), owing to the CMA-MESO model's good forecasting ability for precipitation and fog; however, the S3 scheme demonstrates a more advantageous TS score. For visibility range of 3-5 km and 5-10 km, the S3 scheme demonstrated strong forecasting capability, performing well in errors reduction and TS scores improvement, compared to the S1 scheme, the annual mean error (ME), normalized mean bias (NMB), and root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 56.88 %, 67.73 %, and 65.97 %, respectively. The performance of the S2 and S3 schemes varies across different regions and seasons in China. The S2 scheme performs well in improving the TS scores across six regions, with the performance in spring and slightly weaker results in summer and autumn. The S3 scheme demonstrates a stronger ability to reduce visibility forecast errors in northern regions than in southern regions."

This has implications for satellite data applications, which only use measurements in the absence of clouds. 
 Satellite measurements of tropospheric trace gases are often only used when there are few clouds, which screens out 20 %–70 % of the data, depending on geographic region. Although clouds cause satellite data gaps, in situ surface measurements and model simulations can provide insight on NO2 during cloudy conditions. Here, we intercompare surface observations, meteorological reanalysis (ERA5), satellite measurements (TROPOMI and TEMPO), and a model (WRF-Chem) during 2019 over the contiguous US to quantify how NO2 concentrations differ under clear and cloudy skies. We find that in situ surface NO2 measurements are, on average, +17 % larger on all days compared to clear-sky days and +36 % larger during cloudy days versus clear-sky days, with a wide distribution based on geographic region and roadway proximity: largest in the Northeast US and smallest in the Southwest US and near major roadways. WRF-Chem simulated surface NO2 between cloudy and clear conditions is larger than the observed differences: +59 % on cloudy days vs. clear-sky days for the model. We additionally find modeled jNO2 values are reasonable, suggesting this WRF-Chem NO2 bias could be arising from overly rapid OH removal of NO2 in sunlight, too slow NOz regeneration of NO2 in sunlight, or differing boundary layer depth biases under cloudy versus clear skies. Finally, using in situ NO2 matched to provisional TEMPO data, we find the NO2 differences between cloudy and clear conditions to be larger in the afternoon than morning. This study quantifies some of the biases in satellite measurements introduced by using only clear-sky data."

Our analysis revealed that the reduction rates of BC and its sources varied across different station types, with spatial differences in the drivers of reduction. These long-term observations provide valuable insights to enhance understanding of pollution trends and improve models for predicting air quality. 
 Black carbon (BC) significantly influences climate, air quality, and public health, and long-term observations are essential for understanding its adverse effects. While previous studies have primarily focused on spatiotemporal variations, deeper insights from such datasets remain uncovered. Using 13 years (2008–2020) of continuous measurements of equivalent black carbon (eBC) in China, this study reported the spatial-temporal variations of eBC and its sources, including solid fuel (eBCsf) and liquid fuel combustion (eBClf). The results showed that eBC and its sources exhibited higher concentrations in eastern and northern China compared to western and southern China. Seasonal variations of eBC and eBCsf generally showed lower values during summer and higher values during winter at most stations. Long-term trends indicated that eBC and eBClf decreased most rapidly at urban stations, while eBCsf declined faster at rural stations. Comparisons of eBC concentrations and trends between this study and global observations revealed higher eBC levels but lower reduction rates in China. These long-term observations showed that the model simulations performed well in simulating spatial distribution but poorly in capturing inter-annual variations. The weather-normalized eBC concentrations showed potential for adjusting emission estimates. The normalized results also suggested that emission control was the dominant driver of the BC reduction. This decrease was primarily driven by reductions from solid fuel combustion at rural and background stations. This study provides insights for reducing uncertainties in black carbon emission inventories and improving model performance in simulating surface concentrations."

The results showed that the reactivity of nitric oxide (NO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with NO3 decreased, and that the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 played a critical role in nocturnal nitrate formation. 
 The chemistry of nitrate radical (NO3) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) plays a pivotal role in tropospheric nighttime chemistry. Given their close linkage to precursor variations, emission reduction during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics likely affected NO3 and N2O5 behavior. In this study, we measured N2O5, NO2, O3, etc. during and after the Olympics, and compared pollutant levels as well as the contributions of reaction pathways to the loss of NO3 and N2O5. Throughout the entire observation period, NO3 production rate averaged 0.5 ± 0.4 ppbv h−1, and the N2O5 mixing ratio could reach up to 875 pptv within 1 min, indicating their active production. The relatively long nighttime N2O5 lifetime (τN2O5), with an average of 11.9 ± 11.8 min, suggested a slow N2O5 loss rate during winter season. Despite low NO mixing ratio (below 3 ppbv), it dominated NO3 loss (79.0 %). VOCs oxidation contributed 0.2 %, primarily driven by styrene. During the Olympics, emission reductions led to decreased NO and VOCs, which in turn reduced their reaction with NO3. The heterogeneous uptake of N2O5, another key NO3 loss pathway – accounted for 20.8 % of NO3 loss during the Olympics, but this contribution decreased to 10.6 % after the Olympics. This uptake is crucial for nighttime NO3 removal and would be essential for winter nitrate formation in urban Beijing. Our results highlight that under emission control scenarios, the relative importance of heterogeneous processes in nocturnal NO3 cycling increases, providing new insights into how emission reduction measures shape nighttime oxidation processes in polluted urban environments."

Our results show that air pollution by particles has clearly decreased, mainly due to lower emissions, while total ozone levels show signs of slow recovery. The rising height of the tropopause, linked to climate change, was found to influence ozone amounts in opposite ways. 
 Long-term observations (1993–2024) of total column ozone (TCO) and aerosol optical depth at 320 nm (AOD320) from the Brewer spectrophotometer at Poprad-Gánovce, Slovakia, were analysed. The data used in this study are closely tied to three environmental issues driven by human activities: ozone depletion, climate change, and air pollution caused by aerosols. Both parameters exhibit distinct seasonal variability, with AOD320 peaks in April and August and TCO maxima from February to April. AOD320 shows a statistically significant long-term decrease (−0.057 ± 0.005 per decade), reflecting reduced anthropogenic emissions. The lowest annual mean occurred in 2020, corresponding to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, TCO shows no clear trend (0.0 ± 0.4 DU per decade), whereas the tropopause height increases markedly (105 ± 7 m per decade) and exerts an inverse influence on TCO. After removing this effect, a positive TCO trend (1.3 ± 0.3 DU per decade) appears, while the tropopause-related component decreases (−1.3 ± 0.1 DU per decade). The most significant positive linear trend in tropopause height was identified in August (200 ± 70 m per decade), while the strongest negative TCO trend also occurred in August (−3.6 ± 1.8 DU per decade). Only about one third of this August TCO decrease is explained by the tropopause rise. LOTUS regression confirmed the inverse TCO-tropopause relationship and revealed significant ENSO (positive) and QBOB (negative) influences. A weak positive trend in TCO since 1997 (2.0 ± 1.2 DU) indicates ongoing recovery from ODS reductions."

We examined how different cloud layers influence satellite estimates of cloud thickness and droplet size using observations and computer simulations over China. We found that high ice clouds can hide lower water clouds, causing large errors. This shows satellites need to consider cloud layers to improve accuracy. 
 The vertical structure of clouds plays a critical role in atmospheric radiative transfer and is a major source of uncertainty in satellite-based retrievals of cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER). Most operational algorithms assume a single homogeneous layer, but the biases introduced by this simplification under realistic multilayer conditions remain poorly quantified. This study systematically investigates how perturbations in cloud vertical structure affect COT and CER retrievals using Fengyun-4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (FY4A/AGRI) and simulations from Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) over central and eastern China during June–August 2018. We designed ten sensitivity experiments by varying water and ice content across single-, double-, and triple-layer cloud configurations to quantify the impact of structural differences on channel reflectance and the COT-CER relationship. The results indicate that upper-level ice clouds significantly mask reflectance from lower water clouds, reducing total reflectance by approximately 50 % and leading to systematic retrieval biases: single-layer algorithms underestimate COT at small CER (< 10 µm) but overestimate it by approximately 20 units under larger CER conditions. In single-layer clouds, variations in low- and mid-level water content produce mean COT increases that are ∼ 24 % larger than in double-layer structure, with similar biases occurring in three-layer clouds. Furthermore, enhanced mid-level liquid water enhances the nonlinear relationship between COT and CER, increasing retrieval uncertainties. These findings identify cloud vertical heterogeneity as a major source of retrieval bias and emphasize the necessity of integrating multilayer cloud information into satellite retrieval algorithms."

Walker,Assessment of ACE-MAESTRO v3.13 multi-wavelength stratospheric aerosol extinction measurements,"Measurements of stratospheric aerosol from the Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument are compared to other measurements to assess their scientific value. We find that medians of MAESTRO measurements binned by month and latitude show reasonable correlation with other data sets, with notable increases after volcanic eruptions, and that biases in the data can be alleviated through a simple correction technique. Used with care, MAESTRO aerosol measurements provide information that can complement other data sets. 
 The Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument on the SCISAT satellite provides aerosol extinction measurements in multiple solar wavelength bands. In this study, we evaluate the quality and utility of MAESTRO version 3.13 stratospheric aerosol extinction retrievals, from February 2004–February 2021, through comparison with measurements from other satellite instruments. Despite significant scatter in the MAESTRO data, we find that gridded median MAESTRO aerosol extinctions and stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) values are generally in good agreement with those from other instruments during volcanically quiescent periods. After volcanic eruptions and wildfire injections, gridded median MAESTRO extinction and SAOD are well correlated with other measurement sets but generally biased low by 40 %–80 %. The Ångström exponent (AE), which can provide information on aerosol particle size, is derived from the MAESTRO spectral extinction measurements in the lowermost stratosphere, showing perturbations after volcanic eruptions qualitatively similar to those from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS) for the eruptions of Ambae (2018) and Ulawun (2019). Differences in AE anomalies after the 2019 extratropical Raikoke eruption may be due to the different spatiotemporal sampling of the two instruments. Furthermore, we introduce a method to adjust MAESTRO extinction data based on comparison with extinction measurements from SAGE III/ISS during the period from June 2017–February 2021, resulting in improved comparison during volcanically active periods. Our work suggests that empirical bias correction may enhance the utility of MAESTRO aerosol extinction data, which can make it a useful complement to existing satellite records, especially when multi-wavelength solar occultation data from other instruments are unavailable."

This work reviews the use of machine learning in tropospheric ozone research, focusing on three main application areas in which significant progress has been made. Common challenges in using machine learning across the three areas are highlighted, and future directions for the field are indicated. 
 Machine learning (ML) is transforming atmospheric chemistry, offering powerful tools to address challenges in tropospheric ozone research, a critical area for climate resilience and public health. As in adjacent fields, ML approaches complement existing research by learning patterns from ever-increasing volumes of atmospheric and environmental data relevant to ozone. We highlight the rapid progress made in the field since Phase 1 of the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR), focussing particularly on the most active areas of research, namely short-term ozone forecasting, emulation of atmospheric chemistry and the use of remote sensing for ozone estimation. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements, highlights critical challenges, and proposes actionable pathways to develop ML in ozone research. Further advances hinge on addressing domain-specific issues such as the dependence of ozone concentrations on several poorly observed precursor species, as well as making progress on generic ML challenges such as the definition of suitable benchmarks and developing robust, explainable models. Reaping the full potential of ML for ozone research and operational applications will require close collaborations across atmospheric chemistry, ML and computational science and vigilant pursuit of the rapid developments in adjacent fields."

Large dust (diameter >10 μm) contributes 30% of the global longwave dust optical depth, providing observational constraints on large‐particle abundance, and offsets 20% of the dust shortwave cooling over major source regions. Incorporation of EMIT mineralogy reduces shortwave uncertainty by more than 50%.

Adequate knowledge of monsoon characteristics is necessary for understanding the development of extreme weather events. Given that the monsoon is usually associated with distinct variations in water vapor between dry and wet seasons and rapid dry‐wet transitions, understanding the distribution and variability of water vapor can help characterize the monsoon. In this work, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data from over 1,000 stations densely distributed in China were used to obtain zenith tropospheric delays (ZTDs). Combined with ERA5 meteorological data, precipitable water vapor (PWV) grid products were retrieved during the period 2016–2020 to characterize the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). To address the issue of data gaps in GNSS‐derived PWV, we employed a random forest machine learning method using ERA5‐derived PWV for data imputation ensuring the integrity of the products. We first utilized the bimodality of PWV statistical distribution and selected a suitable metric to quantify the monsoon impact across different regions. Subsequently, the normalized precipitable water indexes (NPWI) were constructed based on temporal variations in PWV to describe the monsoon movement characteristics. The average monsoon onset in China occurs from late May to mid‐June (Day of year (DOY) 150–170), whereas the monsoon retreat takes place in September (DOY 252–274). The interannual variability of the monsoon onset and retreat times is similar with a variation of around 10 days. Generally, the monsoon advances from southeast to northwest over China with an uneven speed."

Accurate representation of the heterogeneous distribution of fuels and the structure of smoke plumes requires high‐resolution modeling frameworks. In this study, we conducted simulations of prescribed burns in Fort Benning, Georgia, with BlueSky‐CMAQ and WRF‐SFIRE modeling frameworks and compared the differences between the results. BlueSky‐CMAQ was run at a 1‐km resolution, while WRF‐SFIRE operated at a 200‐m resolution, both generating outputs every 20 min. We compared the emission profiles, smoke plume structures, and ground‐level concentrations of pollutants between these two modeling frameworks. We used measurements of winds and pollutant concentrations collected at the military base to evaluate model performance and identify critical factors affecting simulation accuracy, including the plume rise scheme, uncertainties from satellite‐detected fire start time and FRP, and biases in wind simulations. All settings of the simulation frameworks showed a correlation higher than 0.21 with measurements of PM2.5 during the prescribed burning periods. The WRF‐SFIRE had the highest correlation (r = 0.29) with observation, and the BlueSky‐CMAQ with Freitas plume rise scheme showed the best performance for simulating the intensity of detected smoke, with a regression slope of 0.93.

 Neutron reflectometry was used to examine the reaction of gas-phase hydroxyl radicals with thin surfactant films at the air–water interface. The films comprised insoluble material extracted from aerosol particulate matter collected from the atmosphere of a broadleaf woodland; sampled above and below the canopy across spring, summer, and winter. The measurements presented here act as a proxy for oxidation reactions at the air–water interface of broadleaf woodland atmospheric aqueous aerosols. The material extracted from the woodland atmosphere formed stable surfactant-like thin films at the air–water interface, with maximum thicknesses of 30 Å and neutron scattering length densities between 0.1 × 10−6Å −2 and 2.5 × 10−6Å −2. Oxidation by hydroxyl radicals reduced the amount of interfacial material, leaving an oxidation-resistant fraction of 20%–60% of the original film. The values of the surface reaction coefficients, determined by KM-SUB, for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with woodland films were approximately 10−7 cm2 s−1. Film half-lives were estimated to be 1—2 h in typical day-time hydroxyl radical concentrations and 2 days–1 week in night-time concentrations. Thus, organic material extracted from temperate, broadleaf woodland aerosol can form thin, stable surfactant films at the air–water interface that can be partially removed by the gas-phase hydroxyl radical at a significant enough rate to warrant inclusion in atmospheric models."

 As China's air pollution control advances, ground-level ozone (O3) has gradually replaced PM2.5 as the primary pollutant, threatening public health. Spanning COVID-19 control to economic recovery, 2019–2024 witnessed anthropogenic changes. Yet, understanding of O3's spatiotemporal patterns, extreme-temperature sensitivity, and causal mechanisms during this period remains inadequate, limiting effective policy responses. To address these, this study, integrating ground-based O3 observations, TROPOMI products, and ERA5 meteorological data, developed a BiTCN-Attention model to estimate China's 1km-resolution monthly average O3 (2019–2024). 10-fold cross-validation confirmed its performance (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 6.96 μg/m3), with stable spatial generalization (R2 = 0.88) and monthly prediction ability (R2 = 0.81–0.94). Spatiotemporal analysis revealed: (1) O3 presented a “dual-core gradient expansion” pattern with high-concentration cores in the North China Plain (anthropogenically driven) and Northwest China (naturally driven); (2) nationwide O3 increased significantly (0.94 μg/m3/yr, p < 0.005) with high-concentration areas expanding inland; (3) during extreme summer heat (2022−2023), the intensity, position, and wind speed of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) dictated O3's regional dispersion patterns. Causal inference via double machine learning indicated temperature (ATE = 7.39) and solar radiation (ATE = 3.7) were core drivers with nonlinear thresholds (temperature > 17.16 °C, solar radiation > 157.94 W/m2). Regionally, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei was temperature-dominated; Yangtze River Delta and Greater Bay Area showed diurnal “dilution–accumulation” by land-sea breeze; by topographic obstruction and stable weather, inland agglomerations (e.g., Chengdu-Chongqing) had rapid O3/precursor accumulation. This study fills the gap in high-precision research on China's ground-level O3 in 2019–2024."

We analyzed the fire dynamics and its impact on carbon flux across three fire prone regions in South Asia, Region-1 (southwestern Nepal, Uttarakhand), Region-2 (central India), and Region-3 (northeast India) from 2010 to 2021, with a focus on the significant fire season of February, March, and April (FMA) of 2021. We find high burned areas (5000–10 000 km2), and fire carbon emissions (0.3–4 TgC season–1) across these regions in FMA, 2021, as compared to a climatological mean from 2010–2020. Each of the three regions shows distinct drivers that preceded the fires. In Region-1, snow-induced soil moisture deficits drive fire activity, leading to a subsequent decline in gross primary production . In Region-2, human activities, likely cropland burning, contributed to the forest fire. In Region-3, the scattered distribution of burned areas hints that human activity is the likely cause of the forest fire. During FMA, 2021, fire carbon emission in Region-1 (∼4 TgC) were almost twice of the fossil fuel emissions (∼2.2 TgC), while in Region-2 (∼3.8 TgC), it remained below fossil fuel emissions (∼16 TgC). In both regions, emissions from forests and croplands contributed equally to the total fire carbon emissions.

However, the long-term variations in GHGs from cropland biomass-burning emissions (CBBEs) remain unclear across the world’s countries. Here, we used satellite observations of CBBE of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), both GHGs, to examine the emission trends from 2003 to 2023 and analyze the causes across 139 agriculture-producing countries. The global CO2 and CH4 emissions from CBBE are decreasing at rates of −8.21 Mt CO2 and −1.55 10−2 Mt CH4 per year, respectively. However, these emissions are increasing significantly (P < 0.05) in eight countries, mainly in South and East Asia. The CBBE was strongly correlated to the human development levels (indicated by the Human Development Index, HDI) of the countries, resulting in overall higher unit area CBBE in low-medium HDI countries and lower unit area CBBE in high-very high HDI countries. In 13 countries, variations in CBBE are associated with changes in the crop residue from productivity. However, there is also a strong variation in CBBE associated with the regulation of agricultural fires, where appropriate agricultural residue management policies have effectively reversed the increasing CBBE trends in some countries."

Revell,Description and evaluation of airborne microplastics in the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1.1) using GLOMAP-mode,"Airborne microplastics are a new air pollutant but are not yet included in most global models. We add them to the UK Earth System Model to show how they move, change, and are removed from air. Smaller microplastics persist for longer and can travel further, even to Antarctica. While their current role in air pollution is small, their presence is expected to grow in future. This work offers a framework to assess future impacts of microplastics on air quality and climate. 
 Airborne microplastics are a recently identified atmospheric aerosol species with potential air quality and climate impacts, yet they are not currently represented in global climate models. Here, we describe the addition of microplastics to the aerosol scheme of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1.1): the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP). Microplastics are included as both fragments and fibres across a range of aerosol size modes, enabling interaction with existing aerosol processes such as ageing and wet and dry deposition. Simulated microplastics have higher concentrations over land, but can be transported into remote regions including Antarctica despite no assumed emissions from these regions. Lifetimes range between ∼17 d to ∼1 h, with smaller, hydrophilic microplastics having longer lifetimes. Microplastics are present throughout the troposphere, and the smallest particles are simulated to reach the lower stratosphere in small numbers. Dry deposition is the dominant microplastic removal pathway, but greater wet deposition occurs for smaller hydrophilic microplastic, due to interactions with clouds. Although microplastics currently contribute a minor fraction of the total aerosol burden, their concentration is expected to increase in future if plastic production continues to increase, and as existing plastic waste in the environment degrades to form new microplastic. Incorporating microplastics into UKESM1.1 is a key step toward quantifying their current atmospheric impact and offers a framework for simulating future emission scenarios for an assessment of their long term impacts on air quality and climate."

 The atmospheric aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)) is a key parameter for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and atmospheric visibility. In this study, a prediction model for the aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor of PM10 at ambient relative humidity (RH) was constructed using a machine learning method based on the observed data of aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)) in the urban area of Beijing from 2018 to 2022. CatBoost regression model, utilizing meteorological and air quality data, achieves high accuracy in reconstructing the f(RH), with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.9388 on the testing dataset. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) showed that: the contribution of SHAP value of RH accounted for 58 % of the total, which was the dominant factor; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) indirectly influenced f(RH) by affecting the formation of secondary inorganic salts, NO2 concentrations below 35 μg/m3 enhanced aerosol hygroscopicity, while concentrations above 35 μg/m3 weakened it. The model was successfully applied to the analysis of heavy pollution events, with good simulation results for low atmospheric visibility periods; the optical parameters reconstructed by the model showed the potential for application in radiative forcing assessment (relative error = 4.04 % at RH = 85 %). This study provides a novel machine learning-based approach for acquiring high time-resolution aerosol f(RH) data, which is helpful in improving the accuracy of aerosol climate effect assessments and atmospheric visibility predictions."

We show the model is unable to reproduce measured atmospheric oxidized mercury concentrations, even in several cases where oxidation rates in the model are enhanced. 
 An improved mechanistic model of mercury redox chemistry has recently been implemented in the GEOS-Chem model. In this study, GEOS-Chem simulations were compared to ambient measurements made during a high-oxidized mercury episode that originated in the free troposphere at a mountaintop site in Colorado, USA (40.455° N, −106.744° W, 3220 m above sea level). Measurements were collected with a dual channel atmospheric oxidized mercury measurement system that has been shown to accurately quantify oxidized mercury compounds in ambient air. The model and observations showed similar temporal trends for elemental and oxidized mercury (R2 of 0.54 to 0.79) and similar elemental mercury concentrations (normalized mean square error of 0.04 in the base model). However, the base model only produced 17 % of the maximum oxidized mercury observed in the dual channel system. In sensitivity tests with increased oxidation rates, the model still only produced, at most, 23 % of maximum observed oxidized mercury. In addition to underestimating net mercury oxidation, an analysis of elemental to oxidized mercury slopes indicated the model overestimated oxidized mercury deposition. An analysis of GEOS-Chem results from a separate study confirmed that while GEOS-Chem is able to simulate the range of measured oxidized mercury in low-oxidized mercury episodes and locations it consistently underestimates measured values during high-oxidized mercury periods at surface locations in western USA."

A. Driver;Marc E. J. Stettler;Edward Gryspeerdt,The ice supersaturation biases limiting contrail modelling are structured around extratropical depressions,"Contrails are ice clouds caused by planes. They have a warming effect, so are important to model. In humid (ice supersaturated) regions, ice crystals are stable so can persist. However, weather model data doesn't represent ice supersaturated regions well enough. We demonstrate that ice supersaturation modelling is structured by North Atlantic storm systems. Averaging many systems, we link the bias to underling processes being modelled, and gain insight into how the existing data could be used. 
 Contrails are ice clouds formed along aircraft flight tracks, responsible for much of aviation's climate warming impact. Ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) provide conditions where contrail ice crystals can persist, but meteorological models often mispredict their occurrence, limiting contrail modelling. This deficiency is often treated by applying local humidity corrections. However, model performance is also affected by synoptic conditions (such as extratropical depressions).Here, composites of ERA5 reanalysis data around North Atlantic extratropical depressions enable a link between their structure and ISSR modelling. ISSRs are structured by these systems: at flight levels, ISSRs occur less frequently in the dry intrusion – descending upper-tropospheric air – than above warm conveyors – where air is lifted.  Both ERA5 reanalysis and in situ aircraft observations show this contrast, demonstrating that the model reproduces the fundamental relationship.  Individual-ISSR modelling performance (quantified using interpretable metrics) is also structured.  Of the rare ISSRs diagnosed in the location associated with the dry intrusion, fewer are confirmed by in situ observations (20 %–25 % precision drop compared to the warm conveyor) and fewer of those observed were diagnosed (13 %–19 % recall drop).  Scaling humidity beyond the occurrence rate bias dramatically increases the recall at low precision cost, demonstrating the potential value of scaling approaches designed with different intentions.  However, the failure of scaling to improve precision, or the performance in the dry intrusion, implies that there is a need to account for the synoptic weather situation and structure in order to improve ISSR forecasts in support of mitigating aviation's climate impact."

Diamond;Lili F. Boss,Conflict-induced ship traffic disruptions constrain cloud sensitivity to stricter marine pollution regulations,"Militia attacks on ships in the Red Sea disrupted container ship traffic in 2024. We use these traffic changes to quantify how the cloud-altering properties of ship pollution decreased following sulfur regulations in 2020 with measurements of two types of ship pollution, one of which is sensitive to fuel composition and another which is not. Near Africa, cloud changes in 2024 were nearly as large as before the regulations, but only one-third as strong after accounting for increased traffic. 
 Starting in November 2023, the Houthi militia occupying northwestern Yemen has attacked ships passing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, a chokepoint on the Europe-Asia route via the Suez Canal. Cargo ship traffic through the Red Sea has since plummeted, with ships instead taking the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. The increase in traffic in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean is readily apparent in satellite retrievals of nitrogen dioxide. Within the stratocumulus deck covering much of the southeastern Atlantic, a previously detectible cloud microphysical perturbation due to ship pollution had largely disappeared following the International Maritime Organization's sulfur-limiting regulations in 2020 but returns during 2024 due to the increase in ship traffic despite the lower cloud brightening efficacy per ship. Because nitrogen dioxide pollution per unit of fuel oil burned is not affected by switching to low-sulfur fuel, quantifying the ratio of shipping-enhanced cloud droplet number and nitrogen dioxide concentrations before and after the fuel sulfur limits went into effect provides a constraint on the cloud changes from the regulations. We find that the ∼ 80 % reduction in sulfur emissions leads to a ∼ 67 % reduction in the increase in cloud droplet number concentration per unit marine fuel oil burned."

 Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), generated from the oxidation of various biogenic volatile organics with diverse yields, are a great contributor to SOA formation. Terpinolene is an isomeride of limonene, with a high SOA yield. Herein, we investigated the elaborate oxidation mechanism of terpinolene by OH and NO3, elucidating the new formation mechanism of OOMs and their yield profiles based on the newly-built zero-dimensional chemical model under three typical atmospheric conditions. For terpinolene oxidation by OH, H shift imposes restrictions on continuous autoxidation, instead by the reactions with HO2/NO/NO2 resulting in chain termination. For the reaction of terpinolene with NO3, the transfer of the radical center via bond breaking, triggering a new round of autoxidation, is newly found to be pivotal in the formation of organic nitrate (RONO2) OOMs with high yields. The effective saturation concentration (C∗) of RONO2 OOMs is mostly lower than the OOMs formed by OH oxidation, more easily distributed into the particle phase. The estimated C∗ of the generated OOMs is distinctly varied among OOM isomers, which emphasizes the necessity of determining their molecular structures, peculiarly the number of rings. The comparative analysis of OH-initiated (daytime) and NO3-driven (nocturnal) terpinolene oxidation mechanism, highlighted the formation of RONO2 OOMs, would be conducive to molecular structure identification of OOMs in atmospheric monitoring and atmospheric chemical model refinement."

Therefore, contributing to the second TOAR, we harmonise as much as possible the observational perspective of sixteen tropospheric ozone products from satellites. This only partially accounts for the observed discrepancies, with a reduction of 10–40 % of the inter-product dispersion upon harmonisation. 
 The first Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR, 2014–2019) encountered several observational challenges that limited the confidence in estimates of the burden, short-term variability, and long-term changes of ozone in the free troposphere. One of these challenges is the difficulty to interpret the consistency of satellite measurements obtained with different techniques from multiple sensors, leading to differences in spatiotemporal sampling, vertical smoothing, a-priori information, and uncertainty characterisation. This motivated the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to initiate a coordinated activity VC-20-01 on improving the assessment and harmonisation of tropospheric ozone measured from space. Here, we report on work that contributes to this CEOS activity, as well as to the ongoing second TOAR assessment (TOAR-II, 2020–2025). Our objective is to harmonise the spatiotemporal perspective of (sixteen) satellite ozone data records, thereby accounting as much as possible for differences in vertical smoothing and sampling. Four harmonisation methods are presented to achieve this goal: two for ozone profiles obtained from nadir sounders (UV-visible, IR, and combined UV-IR), and two for tropospheric ozone column products derived by one of the residual methods (Convective Cloud Differential or Limb–Nadir Matching). We discuss to what extent harmonisation may affect assessments of the spatial distribution, seasonal cycle, and long-term changes in free tropospheric ozone, and we anchor the harmonised profile data to ozonesonde measurements recently homogenised as part of TOAR-II. We find that approaches that use global ozone fields as a transfer standard (here the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ReAnalysis, CAMSRA) to constrain the harmonisation generally lead to the largest reduction of the inter-product dispersion (IPD) between satellite datasets. These harmonisation efforts, however, only partially account for the observed discrepancies between the satellite datasets, with a reduction of about 10 %–40 % of the IPD upon harmonisation, depending on the products involved and with strong spatiotemporal dependences. This work therefore provides evidence that it is not only the differences in spatiotemporal smoothing and sampling, but rather the differences in measurement uncertainty that pose the main challenge to the assessment of the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of free tropospheric ozone from satellite observations."

This paper accompanies the public release of the Level 1b dataset, i.e. calibrated limb images. Later products will provide global maps of gravity wave properties, airglow, and noctilucent clouds. 
 MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) is a Swedish satellite mission designed to investigate atmospheric gravity waves. In order to observe wave patterns, MATS observes structures in the O2 atmospheric band airglow (light emitted by oxygen molecules in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere), as well as structures in noctilucent clouds (NLCs) which form around the mesopause.  The main instrument is a telescope that continuously captures high-resolution images of the atmospheric limb. Using tomographic analysis of the acquired images, the MATS mission can reconstruct waves in three dimensions and provide a comprehensive global map of the properties of gravity waves. The data provided by the MATS satellite will thus be three-dimensional fields of airglow and NLC properties in 200 km-wide (across track) strips along the orbit at altitudes of 70 to 110 km. By adding spectroscopic analysis, by separating light into six distinct wavelength channels, it also becomes possible to derive temperature and microphysical NLC properties. Based on those data fields, further analysis will yield gravity wave parameters, such as the wavelengths, amplitudes, phase, and direction of the waves, on a global scale.The MATS satellite, funded by the Swedish National Space Agency, was launched in November 2022 into a 580 km sun-synchronous orbit with a 17.25 local time of the ascending node (LTAN). This paper accompanies the public release of the Level 1b (v. 1.0) dataset from the MATS limb imager. The purpose of the paper is to provide background information in order to assist users to correctly and efficiently handle the data. As such, it details the image processing and how instrumental artefacts are handled. It also describes the calibration efforts that have been carried out on the basis of laboratory and in-flight observations, and it discusses uncertainties that affect the dataset."

These new insights into the variability of the GW spectrum entering the ionosphere‐thermosphere system further our understanding of the dynamical connections between tropospheric and space weather."
10.1029/2024JD043145,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文主要关注南大洋低云的模拟和评估，使用了包括地基激光雷达在内的多种观测数据，以及ERA5和MERRA-2再分析资料以及ICON气候模型。虽然没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但它利用了激光雷达这种大气遥感技术来研究云的特性，并评估模型对云的模拟能力。云对辐射平衡有重要影响，因此这项研究间接与大气环境相关，特别是通过评估云对短波辐射的影响。此外，论文中使用了地基激光雷达模拟器，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Southern Ocean low clouds', 'Lidar observations', 'Cloud fraction', 'Outgoing shortwave radiation', 'Cloud biases', 'Radiosonde profiles', 'ERA5', 'MERRA-2', 'ICON model', 'Ground-based lidar simulator']",Peter Kuma;Frida A.‐M.

One of them is a 5‐km Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON). Its high resolution means that parameterizations of convection and clouds, including subgrid‐scale clouds, are omitted, relying on explicit simulation but necessarily utilizing microphysics and turbulence parameterizations. Standard‐resolution (10–100 km) models, which use convection and cloud parameterizations, have substantial cloud biases over the Southern Ocean (SO), adversely affecting radiation and sea surface temperature. The SO is dominated by low clouds, which cannot be observed accurately from space due to overlapping clouds, attenuation, and ground clutter. We evaluated SO clouds in ICON and the ERA5 and MERRA‐2 reanalyzes using approximately 2400 days of lidar observations and 2300 radiosonde profiles from 31 voyages and a Macquarie Island station during 2010–2021, compared to the model and reanalyzes using a ground‐based lidar simulator. We found that ICON and the reanalyzes underestimate the total cloud fraction by about 10% and 20%, respectively. ICON and ERA5 overestimate the cloud occurrence peak at about 500 m, associated with underestimated lower tropospheric stability and overestimated lifting condensation level. The reanalyzes strongly underestimate fog and very low‐level clouds, and MERRA‐2 underestimates cloud occurrence at almost all heights. Outgoing shortwave radiation is overestimated in MERRA‐2, implying a “too few, too bright” cloud problem. SO cloud and fog biases are a substantial issue in the analyzed model and reanalyzes and result in shortwave and longwave radiation biases."
10.1029/2025JD045452,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文主要关注利用卫星图像来分析城市近地平线的光排放对环境的影响。它提出了一种新方法，通过分析城市周围的漫射光晕，特别是卫星观测到的城市边界内外的辐射值，来确定城市光向上半球低仰角方向的排放比例。该方法旨在识别那些在接近水平方向发射大量光线的区域，这些区域的光污染会传播到周围环境中，导致远处天空辉光。该研究强调了气溶胶光学厚度和城市周围气溶胶分层对该方法的影响，表明了大气成分对光污染传播的重要性。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，尤其是利用卫星观测进行光污染监测和分析。,"['satellite imagery', 'light pollution', 'urban light emissions', 'aerosol optical depth', 'remote sensing', 'skyglow', 'nighttime satellite imagery']",Miroslav Kocifaj;Ladislav Kómar,Satellite Imagery Reveals Near‐Horizon Urban Light Emissions Impacting Ambient Environment,"A novel method has been developed to characterize ground‐based light sources from nighttime satellite imagery. The fraction of light directed toward low elevation angles is determined relative to the total emission into the upper hemisphere. This approach aims to identify locations that exhibit an increased amount of light emission at angles near the horizontal, thereby contributing to the extensive propagation of light pollution into the surrounding environment. The method is based on analysis of the halo of diffuse light around cities, specifically the radiance values R1 ${R}_{1}$ and R2 ${R}_{2}$, measured in the direction of an artificially lit urban area, before and beyond its nearest and farthest boundaries, as observed from satellite. Unlike traditional approaches, the method avoids the exhaustive process of directly monitoring all city lights but relies on and embraces relative radiance patterns. Although the method is not based solely on the R1/R2 ${R}_{1}/{R}_{2}$ ratio, values exceeding unity are typically associated with a high fraction of light flux at low elevation angles. The method presented here offers an experimentally simple approach for systematically identifying sources with substantial potential to transport light pollution over long distances ultimately contributing to skyglow even in remote areas. The results reveal the significant dependence of the method on aerosol optical depth and aerosol stratification around cities."

Using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) and four biomass‐burning data sets (Fire Inventory from NCAR version 1, Fire Inventory from NCAR version 2.5, Quick Fire Emissions Data set [QFED], and Regional ABI‐VIIRS Emission), we analyzed aerosol transport from Canada to the US and assessed the model's accuracy in predicting PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$, O3 ${O}_{3}$, CO $CO$ and aerosol weather feedback. Model simulations were compared with ground‐based and remote sensing observations as well as field measurements from the Community Research on Climate and Urban Science (CROCUS) project. Our findings show that the movement of a low‐pressure system from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic, combined with the high‐pressure system over the Atlantic, caused the transport of aerosols from Canadian wildfires to the US. Results show WRF‐Chem significantly underestimated key atmospheric components: aerosol optical depth (AOD) by over 50%, PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$ by 65%–90% and peak O3 ${O}_{3}$ concentrations by 50%–55% across four biomass burning data sets. Additionally, CO and NO2 $N{O}_{2}$ concentrations were underpredicted. The substantial underestimation of PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$ led to an overestimation of temperature by up to 3.6° ${}^{\circ}$C primarily due to excessive downward shortwave radiation, which resulted from the underestimation of direct aerosol effects and an increase in sensible heat flux. Among the biomass‐burning data sets, QFED produced the most accurate AOD and PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$ predictions due to improved wildfire emission estimates, leading to a 1.0 to 1.5° ${}^{\circ}$C reduction in temperature overestimation during the daytime. These findings underscore the need for improving wildfire emission estimates for trace gases and aerosols to enhance air quality and weather feedback predictions."

 This study presents the first high-resolution Regional Climate Model 5 (RegCM5) analysis of the unprecedented May–June 2024 heatwave in India, evaluating the role of absorbing aerosols—black carbon (BC) and dust—in amplifying extreme heat. Heatwaves have a severe impact on health, mortality, and agriculture, with absorbing aerosols exacerbating warming. MERRA-2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) anomalies show that BC peaked at +0.027 in May, weakening in June, while dust remained higher (up to +0.36), intensifying over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and northwestern India. RegCM5 simulations, validated against India Meteorological Department (IMD) observational data, indicate that these aerosols amplified surface temperature anomalies, with BC-induced warming exceeding +4 °C in northern India during May, while dust produced stronger anomalies, surpassing +5 °C in the IGP and Rajasthan in June. BC-induced warming was vertically distributed and more pronounced under clear skies, whereas dust-induced warming was surface-concentrated and persisted longer in regions with higher dust concentrations. Both aerosols increased net shortwave radiation (SWR; >300 W m−2 for BC, ∼270 W m−2 for dust) and upward longwave radiation (ULR; >130 W m−2), inducing surface energy imbalances. This radiative forcing caused lower-tropospheric warming (up to +3 °C at 925 hPa for BC and 850 hPa for dust) and humidity deficits (−0.009 kg/kg), which stabilised the atmosphere, suppressed convection, and delayed monsoon onset. These findings highlight aerosol–radiation interactions as critical drivers of heatwave onset and persistence, emphasizing the need for their integration into regional climate models and early warning systems."

 High-resolution emission inventories (EIs) are critical for policymakers to develop air pollution mitigation strategies. However, traditional EIs are often outdated due to data lag. Here, we develop a novel framework for high-resolution EI inversion based on response surface model. Application to a continuous pollution episode in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) demonstrates that the posterior emissions significantly improve the simulation accuracy of NO2 and O3, revealing new spatiotemporal distribution patterns of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and O3 sensitivity regimes. The posterior NOx emissions decreased by 12.5 % compared to the prior emissions, with emissions primarily concentrated during the daytime and significantly reduced during nighttime. Besides, emissions decreased in central cities while increasing in peripheral cities, reflecting the notable impact of policies such as transportation electrification and industrial relocation. And changes in emissions notably impacted the spatial distribution of pollutants and atmospheric oxidation capacity, with the VOC-limited regime during the daytime expanding from central cities to surrounding areas. Finally, we uncover that Red Alert measures are insufficient to bring daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations into compliance during extreme weather in the PRD. The framework developed in this study provides policymakers with a robust tool to more effectively and promptly understand local emissions and implement targeted control strategies."

 This study examines Black Carbon (BC) and Brown Carbon (BrC) spectral absorption properties during contrasting periods dominated by residential wood burning (RWB) emissions (winter), and by regional-background carbonaceous aerosols (summer). The measurements were performed in Ioannina, a medium-sized Greek city, with the objective of understanding the contributions of primary and secondary carbonaceous aerosols (BC, BrC) from various sources (RWB, vehicular emissions, regional sources) to total absorption. During winter, the site experiences a heavy aerosol burden with high concentrations of PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), BC from wood burning (BCwb) and levoglucosan. Conversely, in summer, cleaner atmospheric conditions prevail, with increased impacts from vehicle emissions and regional background aerosols. During winter, BrC absorption dominated (64 % of total absorption at 370 nm), influenced by strong emissions, limited dispersion, and secondary aerosol formation. Secondary BrC (BrCsec) formation was promoted by the abundance of RWB emissions during nighttime, while there was also evidence of increased BrCsec absorption under enhanced O3 and low NOx conditions during midday. In summer, the absorption characteristics differed notably, and were mostly driven by BC from fossil-fuel combustion, regional aerosols, and atmospheric processing including photo-bleaching. An analysis of spectral absorptions at the near-UV and visible spectrum (370, 470, 660 nm) revealed seasonal and diurnal differences in the contributions of various chromophores. During winter, the coating of BC with OC and inorganic species (lensing effect) resulted in absorption enhancement, while strong RWB emissions led in the curvature of spectral absorption, as evidenced by a significant increase in Ångström exponent (AAE) by decreasing wavelength. The observed levels, the variability in spectral absorption properties, and the contributing sources and processes indicate the complexity and challenges of characterizing the radiative effects of urban carbonaceous aerosol."

After observing such humidity haloes up to a distance of 9km $9\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}$ from shallow cumulus clouds, we find an average increase in downward longwave radiation due to haloes of 0.68Wm−2 $0.68{\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$, which is consistent with previous satellite based observational estimates. The cause of halo formation is also examined. A rough mass flux estimate suggests detrainment from a single cloud alone can't explain their formation.

 Continuous measurements of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and nitrate radical (NO3) were conducted at an urban site in Seoul during the ASIA-AQ campaign (February–March 2024). Observed concentrations of N2O5 and NO3 ranged from the detection limit to 1047 and 9.7 pptv, with mean values of 58.7 and 0.4 pptv, respectively. To investigate nocturnal nitrate chemistry, a one-dimensional (1-D) model was applied using in-situ constraints. The model yielded a representative N2O5 uptake coefficient (γN2O5) of 0.021 (95 % confidence interval: 0.015–0.029), indicating significant heterogeneous loss. While the model successfully reproduced the general diurnal variations of key species, it tended to underestimate concentrations of N2O5 and NO3 during pre-dawn hours (01:00 to 04:00 Local Time) under the influence of mountain breezes. Simulations revealed the accumulation of high concentrations of NO3 and N2O5 in the upper residual layer, with heterogeneous N2O5 hydrolysis contributing 10.2–19.5 % of the total column nitric acid (HNO3) production but only 2.5–5.5 % near the surface. Although surface contributions were limited, vertical profiles indicated that this pathway becomes important when NO3 and N2O5 in the residual layer are transported downward. Such downward transport, driven by mountain breezes, enhanced early morning NO3 and N2O5 concentrations by a factor of two to three. These findings highlight the important role of nocturnal vertical transport in nitrate radicals budgets in complex urban areas, including Seoul and other megacities."

 North Pole, Alaska, experiences severe wintertime air quality degradation driven by elevated residential biomass burning and persistent meteorological inversions. However, the comprehensive characterization and underlying drivers of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in this region remain understudied. This study integrates data from four consecutive winter campaigns, combining pollutant measurements and meteorological variables to assess the key drivers of the PM2.5 and its carbonaceous components. Major factors influencing the PM2.5 threshold exceedances were identified using generalized ordered logit regression (GOLR) with an overall accuracy of 67.51 %. Colder temperatures, low absolute pressure, higher relative humidity (RH), elevated Absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE), and zonal component of wind (east to west wind direction), fireworks, and specific temporal patterns (afternoon, evening, and night hours), along with their interactions, were associated with higher PM2.5 levels (>55.4 μg/m3). Mean organic carbon to black carbon ratios (OC/BC) ranged from 8.25 to 10.83 across the four campaigns, consistent with influence from both biomass burning and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. High mean and median OC/BC ratios, strong correlations (R2 = 0.73–0.97) between PM2.5 and total carbon (TC), and weak to strong correlations (R2 = 0.47–0.87) between PM2.5 and black carbon (BC), highlighted source influence and atmospheric processing. The larger variability in OC/BC, ranging from 0.84 to 70.95, indicates the mixing of different primary sources and considerable SOA formation or atmospheric aging. Inter-winter variability in PM2.5 concentrations was primarily driven by local emissions, meteorological conditions including temperature, winds, and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), and pollutant dispersion patterns, with minimal influence from long-range transport. AAE consistently showed positive associations with elevated PM2.5 levels, indicating biomass burning was an important source during the campaigns."

 Glyoxal-derived nitrogenous organic products are becoming recognized for their role in atmospheric radiative processes. While their absorption in the UV–visible region and their impact on visibility have been extensively studied, their infrared (IR) properties, especially within the atmospheric window region (800–1250 cm−1) remain largely unexplored. This work presents a computational study where the IR vibrational frequencies of compounds generated from glyoxal-ammonium sulfate chemistry and their potential greenhouse impact are calculated. The potential of these chemicals to trap Earth's outgoing radiation within the atmospheric window is assessed by analyzing the calculated frequencies and intensities. The results suggest that the glyoxal-derived products have significant absorption features in the IR spectral region that could potentially influence atmospheric heat trapping. This may impact the output of atmospheric models, particularly in urban areas. A relative radiative efficiency (as compared to CO2) is calculated to attempt to scale the relative importance of these products of glyoxal reaction. This novel perspective underscores the need to account for the IR absorption of oxidation products of the glyoxal-ammonium sulfate chemistry in assessing their full impact on radiative balance."

While the barrier effect on MJO propagation over the MC is well documented, the role of aerosols in this process and its underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. Combining observations, reanalysis datasets and moisture budget diagnostics, this study demonstrates that absorbing aerosols from El Niño-enhanced wildfires significantly modulate MJO eastward propagation. During the boreal autumn (August–November), the peak season for aerosol loading, El Niño-induced subsidence over the MC exacerbates regional dryness and promotes widespread wildfires, further elevating aerosol concentrations. To isolate the aerosol impact from El Niño effects, we classified the MJO events under high- and low-aerosol conditions while controlling for similar Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies. Composite analyses reveal that the high aerosol loads disrupt the propagation of MJO convective envelopes, whereas MJO sustains eastward propagation under low-aerosol conditions. Mechanistically, enhanced shortwave absorption by elevated aerosols induces a boundary layer cold anomaly that suppresses low-level convergence, while simultaneous heating of the lower-to-mid troposphere enhances atmospheric stability. This combined thermal and thermodynamic effect weakens boundary layer moisture anomalies, inhibiting the development of shallow convection east of the MJO deep convection that is essential for sustained propagation. The findings highlight the overlooked role of MC aerosols in the MJO barrier effect via aerosol-radiation-convection interactions, suggesting that improved representation of aerosols in climate models may enhance MJO predictability."

This study developed multiple machine learning models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in 2022 by integrating ground-based PM2.5 observations, Himawari-8 measurements, CO, NO2 and ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) derived from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and ERA5. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that incorporating TROPOMI-derived CO, NO2 and UVAI produced the highest predictive performance, reducing root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 14% and 16% respectively. Meanwhile, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and partial dependence analysis identified CO as the most important species driving PM2.5 prediction, with all three variables showing positive contributions to PM2.5 that increased with higher values. This emphasis on the importance of CO and NO2 is physically realistic given that CO is co-emitted with primary aerosols, and NO2 is a secondary aerosol precursor. However, such work has not been previously considered by the community focusing on surface PM2.5 prediction using AI models and satellite observations. The model revealed pronounced spatiotemporal gradients in PM2.5 across Shanxi, peaking in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year (62.0 μg m−3), and minimizing in summer (21.0 μg m−3), while remaining persistently high in southern and eastern industrial regions. The steady PM2.5 rise in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year, suggesting that pre-holiday production activities may contribute to short-term emission intensification, while demonstrating that traditional season-based analysis approaches may miss these extremes. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multi-sensor satellite observations with interpretable machine learning for characterizing pollution dynamics in complex industrial regions."

However, photosynthetic duration is often overestimated, particularly in autumn, as greenness and photosynthesis tend to decouple. This highlights the need for a more precise understanding of autumn photosynthetic phenology to refine global carbon assessments. In this study, we estimated the end-of-photosynthesis date (EOP) across the Northern Hemisphere (>30° N) from 2001 to 2021 using satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and flux tower observations. We then analyzed EOP’s spatiotemporal variations and identified its primary biome-specific drivers. Our results reveal a widespread advancement of EOP, except in water-limited biomes, with the most pronounced shifts in colder regions such as boreal forests and tundra. These shifts are mainly driven by the carryover effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming, which are likely influenced by leaf lifespan and sink capacity. Nutrient limitation may further exacerbate sink constraints, particularly in colder biomes. The effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming counteract the delaying influence of late-season warming on EOP. The significant advancement of early-stage EOP (EOP75) indicates that early-season drivers have a stronger effect than late-season delays, while late-stage EOP (EOP25) remains nearly unchanged due to a balance of opposing forces. Consequently, the limited photosynthetic gains from an earlier or unchanged EOP may fail to offset respiratory carbon losses, potentially weakening the Northern Hemisphere’s carbon sink capacity and complicating future carbon-climate feedback projections."

Mayes,Measurement report: Extreme heat and wildfire emissions enhance volatile organic compounds  in a temperate forest,"Critical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored in a temperate deciduous forest in the Midwestern US using Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer. The forests contained diverse biogenic sources and were influenced by short- and long-range transport of anthropogenic emissions. Extreme heat and wildfire events increased VOC concentrations during the study, offering crucial insights into emission dynamics and their potential impacts on future climate scenarios. 
 Climate extremes are projected to cause unprecedented deviations in the emission and transformation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which trigger feedback mechanisms that will impact the atmospheric oxidation and formation of aerosols and clouds. However, the response of VOCs to future conditions such as extreme heat and wildfire events is still uncertain. This study explored the modification of the mixing ratio and distribution of several anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs in a temperate oak–hickory–juniper forest as a response to increased temperature and transported biomass burning plumes. A chemical ionization mass spectrometer was deployed on a tower at a height of 32 m in rural central Missouri, United States, for the continuous and in situ measurement of VOCs from June to August of 2023. The maximum observed temperature in the region was 38 °C, and during multiple episodes the temperature remained above 32 °C for several hours. Biogenic VOCs such as isoprene and monoterpene followed closely the temperature daily profile but at varying rates, whereas anthropogenic VOCs were insensitive to elevated temperature.  During the measurement period, wildfire emissions were transported to the site and substantially increased the mixing ratios of acetonitrile and benzene, which are produced from burning of biomass. An in-depth analysis of the mass spectra revealed more than 250 minor compounds, such as formamide and methylglyoxal. Extreme heat and presence of wildfire plumes modified the overall volatility, reactivity, O : C, and H : C ratios of the extended list of VOCs. The calculated OH reactivities during extreme temperature condition and transport of biomass burning plumes were 106.37±4.27 and 106.22±5.15 s−1, respectively, which are substantially higher than background level of 98.78±1.16 s−1. Multivariate analysis also clustered the compounds into five factors, which highlighted the sources of the unaccounted-for VOCs. Ultimately, results here underscore the effect of extreme heat and wildfire emissions on the overall chemical properties VOC in a temperate forest."

Haywood;Hugh Coe,The transport history of African biomass burning aerosols arriving in the remote Southeast Atlantic and their impacts on cloud properties,"This study investigates the transport history of African Biomass-Burning aerosols (BBAs) over the Southeast Atlantic (SEA) and their impacts on cloud properties. Using in situ airborne measurements around Ascension Island, this work provides critical parameterizations of aerosol–cloud interactions to improve the assessment of radiative forcing in the SEA region. It also identifies key entrainment regions for understanding the vertical transport process of African BBAs. 
 African biomass burning (BB) aerosols transported over the southeast Atlantic (SEA) strongly influence cloud properties but remain a major source of uncertainty in regional climate assessment. This study characterizes vertical profiles of thermodynamic conditions, aerosol properties, and cloud microphysics around Ascension Island during an aircraft campaign (August–September 2017). Backward-dispersion simulations evidence that observed pollution originated from long-range transported African BB plumes. In BB-polluted marine boundary layers (MBL), aerosol number concentrations (Na) were substantially elevated relative to the clean MBL, driving increased cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and reduced cloud effective radii (Re). Cloud-layer mean Nd correlated strongly with aerosols below the cloud (sub-Na) but weakly with free-tropospheric (FT) aerosols. Enhanced sub-Na was due to BB aerosols entrained from the FT into the MBL along long-range transport and/or locally. Droplet activation fractions were similar in clean and moderately BB-polluted (sub-Na < 700 cm−3) clouds, while a weaker Nd–Na correlation was observed in more polluted clouds. Region-specific Nd–Na parameterizations are necessary for representing BB aerosol-cloud interactions over the remote SEA. A robust inverse Nd–Re relationship was observed, regardless of BB influence. By coupling backward simulations with satellite retrievals, this study indicates that FT-to-MBL entrainment of African BB aerosols over the SEA occurs several days before arrival at Ascension Island, predominantly west of 0° E for examined cases. These findings provide unique observational constraints for representing aerosol-cloud interactions and vertical transport of African BB aerosols in climate models, offering improved assessments of African BB impacts over the SEA."

The findings underline the strengths and limitations of different observational and modeling approaches, and emphasizes on the importance of considering aerosol conditions and local meteorology when interpreting boundary layer dynamics. 
 We investigate the dynamics of the atmospheric Boundary Layer (BL) over the Atlantic Ocean, with a focus on the region surrounding Cabo Verde during the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC) and the ASKOS experiment, using a combination of ground-based PollyXT and Doppler lidars, satellite lidar data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), radiosondes, and the model outputs of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The comparison of CALIPSO lidar results with ECMWF/IFS reanalysis for 2012–2022, revealed good agreement for BL top over open ocean regions but weaker relation over dust-affected areas of the African continent. In these regions, daytime CALIPSO retrievals typically indicate lower BL tops than ECMWF, while at night CALIPSO often detects aerosols within the residual layer, leading to higher estimates than the model. Observations in Cabo Verde highlight distinctive Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) characteristics, such as limited diurnal evolution, but also show the potential for BL heights to reach up to 1 km, driven by factors like strong winds that increase mechanical turbulence. Additionally, the technical and physical challenges in estimating the BL height using different datasets and methods are discussed, examining cases with different thermodynamical conditions and aerosol load that directly affect the dynamics of the BL. The findings underline the strengths and limitations of different observational and modeling approaches, and emphasizes on the importance of considering local meteorology and aerosol conditions when interpreting BL height."

Our study improves ozone predictions by incorporating forest canopy shading and turbulence into a widely used model. We found that tree cover reduces near-surface ozone by decreasing photolysis rates and diffusion inside canopy, resulting in lower ozone concentrations in densely forested areas. These findings enhance ozone surface prediction accuracy and improve air quality modeling. 
 The presence of dense forest canopies significantly alters the near-field dynamical, physical, and chemical environment, with implications for atmospheric composition and air quality variables such as boundary layer ozone (O3). Observations show profound vertical gradients in O3 concentration beneath forest canopies; however, most chemical transport models (CTMs) used in the operational and research community, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, cannot account for such effects due to inadequate canopy representation and lack of sub-canopy processes. To address this knowledge gap, we implemented detailed forest canopy processes – including in-canopy photolysis attenuation and turbulence – into the CMAQv5.3.1 model, driven by the Global Forecast System and enhanced with high-resolution vegetation datasets. Simulations were conducted for August 2019 over the contiguous US. The canopy-aware model shows substantial improvement, with mean O3 bias reduced from +0.70 ppb (Base) to −0.10 ppb (Canopy), and fractional bias from +9.71 % to +6.37 %. Monthly mean O3 in the lowest model layer (∼ 0–40 m) decreased by up to 9 ppb in dense forests, especially in the East. Process analysis reveals a 75.2 % drop in first-layer O3 chemical production, with daily surface production declining from 673 to 167 ppb d−1, driven by suppressed photolysis and vertical mixing. This enhances NOx titration and reduces O3 formation under darker, stable conditions. The results highlight the critical role of canopy processes in atmospheric chemistry and demonstrate the importance of incorporating realistic vegetation-atmosphere interactions in CTMs to improve air quality forecasts and health-relevant exposure assessments."

The results indicate the differences in cirrus occurrence and optical properties across latitudes. Besides seasonality, the cirrus extinction and depolarization show a consistent decrease with increasing latitude. The potential causes are discussed and it turns out that aerosol particles show much larger concentrations at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes. 
 Cirrus clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's radiation budget. However, direct observations and model simulations of cirrus at high-latitudes are still sparse. In this study, we present the occurrence rate (OR) and geometrical thickness as well as extinction and particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR) of cirrus at midlatitudes (35–60° N; 30° W–30° E) and high-latitudes (60–80° N; 30° W–30° E) at temperatures below −38 °C using lidar measurements of CALIPSO in the years 2014 and 2018–2021. The results indicate a distinct seasonal cycle in the cirrus occurrence and optical properties. The seasonality in ORs and geometrical thicknesses generally becomes more pronounced with increasing latitude, while the altitude ranges of cirrus decrease with increasing latitude. The extinction coefficients decrease with increasing altitude at both high- and midlatitudes and are, in addition, larger at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes in all seasons. The calculated cirrus optical depths also show larger values at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes, while the differences across latitudes in winter are negligible. The distributions of PLDR in each 5° latitude bin show a general decrease with increasing latitude, leading to a remarkable latitudinal difference with larger values at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes. This indicates larger and more irregular ice crystals forming at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes. Finally, we compare the aerosol concentrations at different latitudes acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) to trigger heterogeneous freezing, as reported in previous studies. It turns out that aerosols such as mineral dust and soot (including aviation-induced soot) indicate much larger concentrations at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes."

Via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry of tropospheric and stratospheric filter samples, we identified various organic compounds. Our findings underscore the significant cross-tropopause transport of biogenic secondary organic aerosol and anthropogenic pollutants. 
 Increasing anthropogenic emissions have led to numerous organic compounds in the atmosphere, with uncertain effects on climate, ecosystems, and human health. Particularly, the composition and impact of organic aerosol in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) remain poorly understood, with few studies addressing the general distribution of aerosols in this layer. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of a tropopause fold and convective systems during an airborne campaign over central Europe in summer 2024. We collected filter samples with a multichannel sampler for organic aerosol, effectively separating tropospheric and stratospheric air masses. As a result, we analyzed the chemical composition on a molecular level using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. A subsequent non-target analysis provides novel insights into compositional differences throughout the UTLS. Our findings reveal numerous anthropogenic organic compounds, including C8H19O5PS2 and C15H15NO3S2, alongside dicarboxylic acids, organosulfates, and oxidation products of volatile organic compounds found in stratospheric samples. Additional target analysis identifies pollutants like perfluorooctanoic acid and tris(2-chloropropyl) phosphate that redistribute from the ground. These findings underscore the importance of transport processes to high altitudes and the growing impact of anthropogenic pollution, contributing to a better understanding of the relationship between emissions, the chemical composition of the UTLS, and climate effects."

 Siberia's vast wetlands, permafrost, and boreal forests are significant, but their sources of methane (CH4) are poorly quantified. Using vertical CH4 profiles and meteorological data from the ZOtino Tall Tower Observatory (ZOTTO; 60°48′ N, 89°21′ E) in Central Siberia, we analyse long-term trends in CH4 growth rates, seasonal patterns, and diurnal cycles from 2010 to 2021. Our results show a persistent long-term trend in CH4 mole fractions and an insignificant increasing seasonal cycle amplitude, (2.12 ppb yr−1, p=0.12) along with a pronounced late-summer CH4 peak. Diurnal analysis reveals a growing late summer (July–October) CH4 amplitude over the analysed decade (5.29 ppb yr−1, p=0.001), driven by rising nighttime fluxes correlated with late summer soil temperature (R2=0.65, p<0.01), soil moisture (R2=0.36, p=0.032) and with preceding spring snow depth (R2=0.54, p=0.03). Notably high nighttime CH4 fluxes occurred in 2012 and 2019 mainly due to wildfires. These findings suggest that increasing late-summer CH4 emissions, primarily from wetlands to the west and southwest of ZOTTO, dominantly contribute to the overall CH4 rise. Our study underscores the importance of continuous, high-frequency greenhouse gas observations for accurately quantifying regional CH4 trends."

Relatively small variations in longitude exist.We investigate biases in the observations by comparing them to each other and to models. C2 bending angles appear to be biased by about 0.15 % compared to Spire and other ROMEX data between 10 and 30 km altitude. These biases, most of which are representativeness or sampling differences, are caused by the different orbits of C2 and other ROMEX missions around the non-spherical Earth and the associated varying radii of curvature."
10.5194/amt-18-6979-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种新型的离子-分子反应区（IMR），用于化学电离质谱（CIMS）气体测量仪器。该IMR旨在减少非真实信号，降低实验室和现场痕量气体研究的不确定性。论文描述了该设计的细节，并展示了其在减少表面接触和壁效应引起的干扰方面的优势，尤其是在低挥发性有机产物方面。此外，该IMR还被用于现场测量，能够检测到亚ppt级的痕量气体浓度，包括反应性溴。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它所涉及的大气成分分析和空气质量监测与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，尤其是对于地面真值验证和算法开发方面。,"['trace gas', 'chemical ionization mass spectrometry', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'reactive bromine', 'marine boundary layer']",Phil Rund;Ben H. Lee;Siddharth Iyer;Gordon A. Novak;Jake T. Vallow;Joel A. Thornton,Laboratory and field characterization of an atmospheric pressure transverse chemical ionization ion-molecule reaction region,"We introduce a custom-built chamber (known as an IMR) for use with a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS) gas measurement instrument. The IMR shows large improvements compared to previous designs in reducing non-real signal in the instrument, reducing uncertainties for trace gas studies in the laboratory and the field. We characterize this new IMR and demonstrate its use in analyzing air masses of unknown composition during a field campaign, reporting concentrations of important gases. 
 We introduce a custom-built, field-deployable, atmospheric pressure Ion-Molecule reaction Region (IMR) for use with Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS), the so-called “t-IMR”. The design is described in quantitative detail and shows significant mitigation in potential measurement interference compared to other IMR configurations, particularly those operating at low pressure. The relatively large laminar flow and inner chamber diameter reduce the probability of sampled air and ion clusters interacting with the Teflon surfaces of the IMR before being detected by Time-of-Flight (ToF) mass spectrometry. This also leads to a substantial reduction in wall effects and artificial background signals for even low volatility organic products, as demonstrated in alpha-pinene ozonolysis experiments. An electric field is induced perpendicular to flow in the t-IMR to accelerate ions and consequent charged sample clusters to the MS interface. The strength of this field is modulated and optimized to simultaneously maximize total ion flux and instrument sensitivity. A sheath flow apparatus is introduced to provide small N2 flows counter to ion and sample cluster flow into the MS to reduce the likelihood of particulate buildup and clogs to the pinhole separating the IMR from the MS, ensuring uninterrupted sampling for extended periods of time. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the t-IMR to be deployed to the field to measure down to sub-ppt level ambient concentrations of important trace gases including reactive bromine at a ground-based site in the marine boundary layer. We find that the t-IMR design considerably reduces artificial signals from surface contact and wall effects, and improves detection of very low concentration species in the ambient atmosphere, with respective limits of detection of 0.06, 0.05, and 2 ppt for Br2, HOBr, and HNO3. The relationship between instrument sensitivity and IMR water vapor concentrations is also explored and applied to in-field measurements."

Here, we combine UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) measurements of CO2 gas concentrations with a Large-Eddy simulation model in a sub-mesoscale inversion to separate fluxes by landcover type, demonstrating a promising approach to capture and upscale flux heterogeneity within eddy-covariance footprints. 
 Many natural ecosystems are composed of heterogeneous patches differentiated by wetness levels and vegetation composition, resulting in fine-scale flux patterns across the different landcovers that can be challenging to quantify. Here, we present a case study at Stordalen Mire in subarctic Sweden, where we conducted Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) measurements of CO2 mole fractions and combine them with a large-eddy simulation (LES) model through a site-level inversion method to differentiate the flux rate signatures from different patch types. We use the LES model EULAG (EUlerian LAGrangian) to simulate high-resolution flow patterns and benchmark the spatial variability of modelled concentrations with data from UAV-based grid surveys of CO2 mixing ratio. Coupling the inversion results with eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements for the time of the UAV flight allows quantifying net CO2 fluxes for the individual landcover types. Model evaluation showed an R2 up to 0.70, with model uncertainties mostly related to the transport model uncertainty and the UAV sampling footprint that does not evenly sample landcover types. The inversion fluxes were subsequently compared to patch-level chamber measurements of carbon dioxide from palsa, bog, and fen, and showed a good agreement in flux patterns across those patch types dominating the UAV-sampled footprint. Different landcover classification schemes were considered, and results showed a consistent improvement in the model performance when further representing the ecological and hydrological heterogeneities. Our novel technique shows promising results in estimating landcover-type flux heterogeneity within eddy-covariance tower footprints, thus providing a basis for upscaling of EC fluxes to a larger domain."

 Climate change makes accurate weather prediction and large-scale data analysis increasingly crucial, but the sheer volume of weather data strains data storage and sharing. Here we introduce Aeolus, a deep learning framework with powerful Variational Auto-Encoder transFormer (VAEFormer) modules that dramatically reduces the size of weather datasets, compressing the widely used 400-terabyte reanalysis atmospheric dataset to just 0.85 TeraBytes (TB)-a compression ratio of 470  × . Aeolus surpasses traditional image compression methods such as Joint Photographic Experts Group 2000 (JPEG2000), which typically achieve much lower compression rates on weather data. It also enables fast data processing speeds of over 1 GigaByte (GB) per second, saving computational resources. Our tests show Aeolus maintains high accuracy, with temperature errors as low as 0.17∘ Kelvin and reliable climate patterns. These advances make it easier for researchers to access and analyze massive weather datasets, supporting better weather forecasting and climate studies. Aeolus thus offers a valuable tool for climate research and efforts to address global environmental challenges. 470-fold super compression of atmospheric data has been achieved through Aeolus, a two-stage deep-learning-based variational autoencoder framework."

Trends and future implications,"Five summer cruises of the Swedish icebreaker Oden in the inner Arctic in 1990, 1996, 2001, 2008, and 2018 provided a unique dataset on the seasonal distribution of atmospheric aerosol. Coupling these data with the seasonal sea ice distribution strongly indicated a regional biogenic aerosol source during late summer and early autumn freeze-up conditions. Given the expected further warming of the Arctic, we hypothesize an increase in biogenic aerosol in late summer and autumn. 
 Based on aerosol particle number size distributions measured ≥ 85° N on I/B Oden covering the summers of 1991, 1996, 2001, 2008, and 2018, regional atmospheric circulation regimes (nodes) delineated with self-organizing maps (SOMs) were investigated as potential controllers of Arctic aerosol sources. The three most prominent nodes were not connected to regional source-related differences and did not vary systematically throughout the study period. Instead, the seasonal course of sea ice melt and freeze-up appeared to affect the shape of the aerosol size distributions significantly. High sub-Aitken concentrations occurred during the “freeze-up”, most commonly associated with the low wind, restricted sea ice movement, and effective radiative cooling. The high concentrations of newly formed particles measured during “freeze-up” were interpreted as deriving from frost flower formation. With the data on ice and atmospheric conditions and their seasonal course, the study was extended to cover all years from 1991 to 2023 to enable speculations about changing aerosol source conditions in the warming Arctic climate. Over the 33 years of the study, the significant increases in seawater and air temperatures nearly doubled the favorable ice conditions for new particle formation ≥ 85° N, lengthening both “melt” and “freeze-up” parts of the illuminated Arctic by more than a week. Whereas the sum effect of counteracting processes during the ice melt season on the airborne biogenic Arctic aerosol in a warming climate is unclear, the net effect of the changing the freeze-up of sea ice is expected to enhance the biogenic Arctic aerosol in late summer/autumn."

The investigation suggests that HONO can be an important sink for Criegee intermediates and a potential source of OH radicals. Our study also reveals that this reaction is also capable of recycling OH • ↔ HO•2 , and hence, can be key in resolving the discrepancy between observed and modeled concentrations of OH and HO2 radicals. 
 One of the most important puzzles in atmospheric chemistry is a mismatch between observed and modelled concentrations of OH•/HO2• in the presence of high concentration of volatile organic compounds. It is now well established that to fulfill this gap, one needs a reaction that is not only capable of producing OH• but also able to act as a sink of HO2•. In the present work, we are proposing the Criegee + HONO reaction as a possible solution of this puzzle. Our quantum chemical and kinetic calculations clearly suggest that this reaction can not only be an important source of OH radical but can also act as a sink of HO2 radical. Our study also suggests that HONO has the potential to act as a bimolecular sink of Criegee intermediates, and for some Criegee intermediates under certain atmospheric condition it can even surpass the traditionally known bimolecular sinks such as SO2 and water dimer, even in high humid conditions."

Limited studies have characterized light absorbing aerosol emissions from these biomasses, thus necessitating this work. Brown carbon (BrC) emitted from laboratory-scale biomass burning had weak light absorptivities based on their complex refractive index values. A combustion temperature dependent light absorptivity continuum existed for emitted BrC. Photochemical aging decreased BrC light absorptivity. 
 Warming climate is predicted to increase forest fires which can be a major source of black and brown carbon (BC and BrC) into the atmosphere. Unlike North American forest fires, very limited studies have characterized North Eurasian biomass burning (BB) emissions. In this work, we determined the emission factors (EF) of carbonaceous aerosols and characterized light absorption of BrC emitted from boreal and peat burning through offline filter extraction method. The results were compared to African savanna emissions. Effects of atmospheric dilution and oxidative aging on BrC absorptivity were investigated for selected BB emissions sampled into an environmental chamber. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) EFs of fresh BB emissions ranged between 1.30–89.9 and 0.01–4.80 g kg−1 respectively. Methanol soluble OC (MSOC) represented more than 92 % of fresh BB emissions, irrespective of fuel type, and consisted of weakly absorbing BrC with imaginary refractive index at 550 nm (kMSOC_550) ranging from 0.002 to 0.011. Water soluble OC (WSOC) fractions varied among fresh BB emissions but overall exhibited higher mass absorption efficiencies at 365 nm (MAE365) than MSOC. Dilution-related evaporative loss in environmental chamber resulted in less volatile OC, making them less soluble in methanol. Photochemical and dark oxidative aging further increased the low volatility OC fractions of the organics along with its oxidation state. Our estimated OC-EC emission factors and kMSOC for fresh BB emissions can be used for future modelling purposes. Further online measurements are needed to account for non-soluble strong BrC in aged BB emissions."

Using an improved chemical transport model, we successfully reproduced the observed HONO levels and temporal variations. Further process analyses and sensitivity experiments quantified the formation mechanisms of HONO in coastal areas and shed light on its impact on the formation of OH radicals and ozone. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a vital precursor of hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the troposphere, leading to the formation of secondary air pollutants, including ozone (O3) and secondary aerosols. Previous studies have mainly focused on investigating the chemical fate of HONO in polluted urban areas of China and found a general diurnal variation featuring the minimum concentration around noon due to the fast self-photodissociation. However, this study reported a significantly higher daytime HONO concentrations based on one-month measurement during May 2024 over the coastal regions of Fujian in southeastern China. Using an updated Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model, we captured the magnitude and temporal variation of HONO concentrations observed in coastal areas, and improved the model performance on diurnal patterns of the NO2 and O3. Further process analysis revealed that two light-dependent chemical sources, i.e., the heterogeneous uptake of NO2 on the ground surface and NOx photo-oxidation, were the main contributors to HONO formation, particularly at high concentrations around noon in the presence of persistent intensive solar radiation. In addition, we assessed that shipping emissions contributed 20 % to the midday HONO production rate in coastal regions. Subsequently, model results indicated that HONO photolysis accounted for 34 % of primary OH sources during the daytime. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrated that incorporating multiple HONO sources increased the daily maximum OH and average O3 concentrations by 61 % and 44 %, respectively, in coastal regions. Overall, this study highlights the unique formation mechanisms of HONO and its significant contribution to ambient oxidants in typical coastal regions."

We found strong correlations between the online instruments and the reference method (better so for the Xact625i), while in terms of absolute concentrations, some elements were over- and underestimated. Overall, we determined both instruments can be used as powerful tools to produce high-time resolution elemental data for use in air quality monitoring. 
 This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Xact625i and PX-375 online energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) instruments for real-time trace elemental monitoring at a rural background site over six months. This represents the first direct comparison between the two instruments, assessing their performance against inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the reference method for elemental analysis. Both instruments demonstrated strong measurement capabilities, with the Xact625i achieving higher sensitivity for trace metals and showing closer agreement with ICP-MS using 24 h averaging of 2 h data (r2=0.89 vs. 0.78 for the PX-375). The PX-375 reported higher overall concentrations, primarily due to overestimations of Si and S. Both instruments correlated well for Ca, Fe, Zn, and Pb, while detection limits affected Ni and Cd. The Xact625i exhibited superior performance in measuring elements such as S, V, and Mn. While correlations with ICP-MS were high, systematic over- and underestimations in absolute concentrations were found, particularly for the PX-375. When directly comparing the two online instruments using raw 2 h data, a strong agreement was observed (mean r2=0.95). However, systematic slope discrepancies persisted, in line with comparisons against ICP-MS. The findings confirm the reliability of these two ED-XRF instruments for high-time-resolution elemental monitoring as a complementary technique to traditional filter analysis, enabling detailed source apportionment studies, improved trend analysis, and more responsive air quality management strategies. Future work comparing ED-XRF to laboratory-based methods could refine harmonisation efforts and address systematic differences in absolute concentrations."

We present early findings from Tanager-1 including the use of our data to locate and repair a leaking oil and gas pipeline. 
 The Carbon Mapper emissions monitoring system contributes to the broader ecosystem of greenhouse gas observations by locating and quantifying CH4 and CO2 super emitters at facility scale across priority regions globally and making the data accessible and actionable. The system includes observing platforms, an operational monitoring strategy optimized for mitigation impact, and a data platform that delivers CH4 and CO2 data products for diverse stakeholders. Operational scale-up of the system is centered around a new constellation of hyperspectral satellites. The Carbon Mapper Coalition (hereafter Tanager) satellites are each equipped with an imaging spectrometer instrument designed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory that are assembled, launched and operated by Planet Labs. The first Tanager satellite (Tanager-1) was launched 16 August 2024 completed commissioning in January 2025 and continued to improve observational efficiency through summer 2025. Planet is currently working to expand the constellation to four Tanagers. Each imaging spectrometer instrument has a spectral range of about 400–2500 nm, 5 nm spectral sampling, a nadir spatial resolution of 30 m, and nadir swath width of about 19 km at the lowest orbital altitude. Each satellite is capable of imaging 250 000 km2 per day on average. By combining the results of independent controlled release testing with empirical evaluation of the radiometric, spectral, spatial, and retrieval noise performance of the Tanager-1 spectrometer, we predict minimum detection limits of about 64–126 kgCH4 h−1 for CH4 point sources and about 10 078–18 994 kgCO2 h−1 for CO2 point sources for images with 25 % albedo, 45° solar zenith angle, and 3 m s−1 wind speed. A review of the first 11 months of Tanager-1 CH4 and CO2 observations including initial validation with coordinated aircraft under-flights and non-blind controlled release testing indicates that the system is meeting performance requirements and, in many cases, surpassing expectations. We also present early evaluations in challenging onshore and offshore observational conditions and summarize the first use of Tanager data to guide the timely mitigation of a CH4 super emitter."

Chemical processes in aerosols and polar clouds should be improved. 
 The daily analyses and forecasts of atmospheric composition delivered by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) are produced by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System configured for COMPOsition (IFS-COMPO). In 2023 this system was upgraded to Cy48 which solves explicitly for stratospheric chemistry through a module extracted from the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). In 2024 the system was further upgraded to Cy49 which improves the representation of stratospheric composition with an adjusted parameterization of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC), updated chemical rates for heterogeneous chemistry, and the implementation of missing processes to simulate an accurate distribution of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere.Here we report on these improvements and evaluate the resulting stratospheric composition in chemical forecast mode, where the model is constrained by assimilation of meteorological observations but not by assimilation of composition observations. These evaluations comprise 13 gas-phase species and sulfate aerosols in three case studies: a global-scale assessment during a quiescent period (July 2023 to May 2024) in the context of the operational upgrade of the CAMS system; the evolution of key tracers related to polar ozone depletion during the winter and spring seasons across several years; and the evolution of stratospheric aerosols over the three years following the June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption.The model captures the rapid increase of the sulfate burden after the Pinatubo eruption, with the peak of stratospheric sulfate burden timed correctly, gradual recovery, and expected vertical profiles for quiescent periods. A scorecard assessment of chemical forecasts in the stratosphere of IFS-COMPO Cy49 highlights good performance for O3, CH4, N2O, and H2O and adequate performance for HCl, ClO, BrO and BrONO2 in the polar lower stratosphere. The model performance is poorer for HNO3, N2O5, NO2 and ClONO2, highlighting the need to improve the representation of heterogeneous chemistry, particularly the interactivity between aerosols and gas-phase composition, and refine the parameterization of PSC to better capture their impact on gas-phase composition. Overestimations of CH4 and N2O in the upper stratosphere are potentially related to the Brewer–Dobson Circulation, and long-standing biases of NO2 and O3 in the upper stratosphere remain unresolved.Despite these points for further development, IFS-COMPO will be a useful tool for studies of the couplings between stratospheric aerosols and gas-phase chemistry. The current cycle paves the way for assimilating stratospheric composition observations beyond ozone."

 The northwestern Pacific has exhibited an anomalously rapid warming since 2011, causing significant climate disasters and marine ecosystem destruction. Yet the drivers of this accelerated warming remain insufficiently understood. Here we find that anthropogenic aerosol mitigation constitutes the principal driver of this phenomenon. During 2011 − 2022, aerosol reduction induces a 2.3 ± 0.91% decline in cloud cover over the downwind northwestern Pacific region, generating a 6.1 ± 2.4 W m−² enhancement in surface shortwave radiation that explains 72 ± 28% of the observed sea surface temperature rise. Aerosol-driven ocean warming manifests a five-year lag post-emission reductions, governed by threshold-triggered nonlinear aerosol-cloud interaction, where cloud decrease occurs only below critical aerosol thresholds. Coupled climate model simulations isolate a 0.25  ±  0.14 °C/decade warming signal attributable to aerosol reductions, which accounts for 66 ± 51% of the simulated warming in 2011 − 2022. These findings provide crucial implications for future climate policy formulation.

 This study investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics and decadal changes of extreme aerosol events over China from 2013 to 2022, a critical period marked by China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and the Blue Sky Defense Campaign. While previous studies have documented general declines in aerosol levels, the behavior of extreme aerosol events and their associated climate impacts remain poorly quantified. By integrating multi-sensor remote sensing data, this study revealed that: (1) The eastern monsoon region exhibits a significant aerosol optical depth (AOD) decreasing trend (MERRA-2: −0.11 ± 0.05 decade−1), primarily driven by reduced sulfate aerosol (SU) concentrations (−0.005 ± 0.01 decade−1), whereas the Tarim Basin shows increasing AOD (0.012 ± 0.005 decade−1) due to enhanced dust (DU) activity; (2) Extreme aerosol events (EAEs) frequency displays a marginal decline in eastern China (−0.005 ± 0.03 day month−1 decade−1) but a marked increase in the Tarim Basin (0.012 ± 0.016 decade−1); (3) Intercomparison reveals MERRA-2 overestimates AOD by 4 % in central-southern China (0.7–1.2) and shows stronger clear-sky top of the Atmosphere (TOA) positive radiative trends (0.50 W m−2 decade−1) in eastern monsoon regions, indicating limitations in black carbon (BC) mixing-state parameterization; (4) Aerosol-cloud interactions amplify uncertainties in all-sky radiation trends, with CERES showing surface SW positive trends (0.36 ± 0.57 W m−2 decade−1) but TOA negative trends (−0.09 ± 0.36 W m−2 decade−1) over eastern China, establishing clear climate feedbacks associated with AOD reductions. Our observation-derived findings provide critical evidence for evaluating climate co-benefits of air quality policies and identifies key priorities for improving aerosol monitoring and model parameterizations, thereby constraining the uncertainty in assessing aerosol impacts in a changing environment."

In recent decades, emissions of ozone-forming gases have decreased in North America and Europe but risen in Asia, alongside rising global methane levels. Using advanced modeling, this study reveals that while local reductions in nitrogen oxides have lowered summer ozone, increases in ozone production from natural and foreign sources offset these gains. Methane remains important, but its ozone impact has declined with reduced local emissions. 
 Surface ozone, with its long enough lifetime, can travel far from its precursor emissions, affecting human health, vegetation, and ecosystems on an intercontinental scale. Recent decades have seen significant shifts in ozone precursor emissions: reductions in North America and Europe, increases in Asia, and a steady global rise in methane. Observations from North America and Europe show declining ozone trends, a flattened seasonal cycle, a shift in peak ozone from summer to spring, and increasing wintertime levels. To explain these changes, we use TOAST 1.0, a novel ozone tagging technique implemented in the global atmospheric model CAM4-Chem which attributes ozone to its precursor emissions fully by NOx or VOC+CO+CH4 sources and perform multi-decadal model simulations for 2000–2018.  Model-simulated maximum daily 8 h ozone (MDA8 O3) agrees well with rural observations from the TOAR-II database. Our analysis reveals that declining local NOx contributions to peak-season ozone (PSO) in North America and Europe are offset by rising contributions from natural NOx (due to increased O3 production), and foreign anthropogenic- and international shipping NOx due to increased emissions. Transported ozone dominates during spring. Methane is the largest VOC contributor to PSO, while natural NMVOCs become more important in summer. Contributions from anthropogenic NMVOCs remain smaller than those from anthropogenic NOx. Despite rising global methane levels, its contribution to PSO in North America and Europe has declined due to reductions in local NOx emissions. Our results highlight the evolving drivers of surface ozone and emphasize the need for coordinated global strategies that consider both regional emission trends and long-range pollutant transport."

This allowed us to examine their optical and mass properties, seasonal patterns and events like pollen and dust. We also measured particles >10 µm using filters, which are missed by optical instruments. These large particles significantly influence light scattering. 
 Supermicron aerosol particles (PM1–10; here defined as 1 µm < aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) play a crucial role in aerosol-climate interactions by influencing light scattering and absorption. However, their long-term trends and episodic significance in boreal environments remain insufficiently understood. This study examines measurements of optical properties and mass of PM1–10 over a 12-year period at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiälä, Finland, focusing on their variability and key drivers. By assessing long-term trends, seasonality, and episodic variability, the study provides new insights into the role of these particles in aerosol-climate interactions. Episodic events, such as pollen outbreaks and dust transport, are identified as major contributors to PM1–10 variability and their role in atmospheric processes. In addition, cascade impactor filters were used to quantify super-PM10 particles (Dp>10 µm), which are not detected by optical instruments, addressing key detection limitations. The findings reveal significant long-term trends and pronounced seasonality in PM1–10 mass and optical properties, emphasizing their importance in boreal environments and their episodic relevance in coarse-mode aerosol characterization."

Our findings show that reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols lead to decreased dust loading compared to high fossil fuel scenarios. While aerosol reductions promote dust, GHGs decreases reduce wind speeds, suppressing dust emissions. These results suggest that carbon-neutral policies mitigate climate change and reduce dust pollution. 
 To mitigate future global warming, many countries have implemented rigorous climate policies for carbon neutrality. Given some shared emission sources with greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosol particles and their precursor emissions are expected to be reduced as the consequences of global efforts in climate mitigation and environmental improvement, potentially inducing complex climate feedbacks. However, a clear understanding of the individual effects of anthropogenic aerosols and GHGs on natural dust concentrations has not yet emerged, especially in the carbon neutral scenario. Here, we assess the large-scale impacts of reductions in anthropogenic GHGs and aerosol under a carbon neutral scenario in 2060 on natural dust emissions and concentrations over the low- to mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere using the fully coupled Community Earth System Model. Our findings demonstrate a decline in atmospheric dust loading toward carbon neutrality (SSP1-1.9) relative to the high fossil fuel scenario (SSP5-8.5). Mechanistic analysis reveals counteracting modulation mechanisms: (i) reductions in aerosols amplify surface downwelling shortwave radiation, convection and wind speed, thereby promoting dust emissions by 6 %–12 % and concentrations by 4 %–20 % over North Africa, the Central Asia Desert and East Asia; (ii) GHGs reductions diminish the land-ocean thermal contrast and wind speed, suppressing dust emissions by 6 %–15 % and concentrations by 8 %–20 % mainly over the Central Asia Desert and North Africa. The latter drives the future dust responses. These results highlight that carbon neutral strategies not only achieve climate mitigation goals and air quality improvements, but also generate synergistic benefits through dust pollution suppression."

Advanced analyses showed that sunlight makes this material more oxidized, nitrogen-enriched, chemically transformed, and different in light absorption and volatility. These sunlight-driven changes influence the particles’ behavior in the air, affecting air quality, climate, and how long they remain suspended in the atmosphere. 
 Photochemical reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in atmospheric waters can alter the composition and properties of organic aerosols (OA), with implications for climate and air quality. In this study, we investigated the aqueous-phase transformation of fog DOM under simulated sunlight using online aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), offline Orbitrap mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization, UV-vis spectroscopy, and aerosol volatility measurements. Irradiation increased the mass concentration of DOM-derived OA (DOMOA), defined as the low-volatility fraction of DOM that forms OA upon water evaporation. This increase was primarily driven by functionalization reactions that added oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups, as indicated by a stable C mass, rising oxygen-to-carbon (O / C) and nitrogen-to-carbon (N / C) ratios, and enhanced signals of heteroatom-containing compounds over the course of irradiation. Despite evidence of fragmentation, spectral features associated with oligomerization, such as phenolic dimers, were also observed. To characterize chemical aging of fog DOM, we applied positive matrix factorization to the AMS spectra and identified three distinct factors representing progressive stages of aqueous-phase aging: initial DOMOA, more oxidized intermediates, and highly oxidized products, characterized by progressively increasing O / C and N / C ratios. These findings demonstrate that sunlight-induced aqueous-phase oxidation and functionalization of fog DOM drive the formation and aging of secondary OA, altering its composition, volatility, and light-absorbing properties with potential atmospheric consequences."

Major updates include improving dust size distribution in the chemical boundary conditions, updating land surface properties using recent available satellite data and enhancing the representation of soil NOx emissions. We demonstrate subsequent model improvements over several of the MAIA target areas. 
 The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) satellite mission, to be jointly implemented by NASA and the Italian Space Agency, aims to study how different types of particulate matter (PM) pollution affect human health. The investigation will primarily focus on a discrete set of globally distributed Primary Target Areas (PTAs) containing major metropolitan cities, and will integrate satellite observations, ground observations, and chemical transport model (CTM) outputs (meteorology variables and PM concentrations) to generate maps of near-surface total and speciated PM within the PTAs. In addition, the MAIA investigation will provide satellite measurements of aerosols over a set of Secondary Target Areas (STAs), which are useful for studying air quality more broadly. For the CTM, we have developed a Unified Inputs (of initial and boundary conditions) for WRF-Chem (UI-WRF-Chem) modeling framework to support the MAIA satellite mission, building upon the standard WRF-Chem model. The framework includes newly developed modules and major enhancements that aim to improve model simulated meteorology variables, total and speciated PM concentrations as well as AOD. These developments include: (1) application of NASA GEOS FP and MERRA-2 data to provide both meteorological and chemical initial and boundary conditions for performing WRF-Chem simulations at a fine spatial resolution for both forecast and reanalysis modes; (2) application of GLDAS and NLDAS data to constrain surface soil properties such as soil moisture; (3) application of recent available MODIS land data to improve land surface properties such as land cover type; (4) development of a new soil NOx emission scheme – the Berkeley Dalhousie Iowa Soil NO Parameterization (BDISNP); (5) development of a stand-alone emission preprocessor that ingests both global and regional anthropogenic emission inventories as well as fire emissions.Here, we illustrate the model improvements enabled by these developments over four target areas: Beijing in China, CHN-Beijing (STA); Rome in Italy, ITA-Rome (PTA); Los Angeles in the U.S., USA-LosAngeles (PTA), and Atlanta in the U.S., USA-Atlanta (PTA). UI-WRF-Chem is configured as 2 nested domains using an outer domain (D1) and inner domain (D2) with 12 and 4 km spatial resolution, respectively. For each target area, we first run a suite of simulations to test the model sensitivity to different physics schemes and then select the optimal combination based on evaluation of model simulated meteorology with ground observations. For the inner domain (D2), we have chosen to turn off the traditional Grell 3D ensemble (G3D) cumulus scheme. We conducted a case study over USA-Atlanta for June 2022 to demonstrate the impacts of the cumulus scheme on precipitation and subsequent total and speciated PM2.5 concentrations. Our results show that keeping the G3D cumulus scheme turned on results in higher precipitation and lower total and speciated PM2.5 than the simulation with the G3D cumulus scheme turned off. Compared with surface observations of precipitation and PM2.5 concentration, the simulation with the G3D scheme off shows better performance. We focus on two dust intrusion events over CHN-Beijing and ITA-Rome, which occurred in March 2018 and June 2023, respectively. We carried out a suite of sensitivity simulations using UI-WRF-Chem by excluding chemical boundary conditions or including MERRA-2 chemical boundary conditions. Our results show that using MERRA-2 data to provide chemical boundary conditions can help improve model simulation of surface PM concentrations and AOD. Some of the target areas have also experienced significant changes in land cover and land use over the past decade. Our case study over CHN-Beijing in July 2018 investigates the impacts of improved land surface properties with recent available MODIS land data on capturing the urban heat island phenomenon. Model-simulated surface skin temperature shows better agreement with MODIS observed land surface temperature. The updated soil NOx emission scheme in July 2018 also leads to higher NO2 vertical column density (VCD) in rural areas within the CHN-Beijing target area, which matches better with TROPOMI observed NO2 VCD. This in turn affects the simulation of surface nitrate concentration. Lastly, we conducted a case study over USA-LosAngeles to tune dust emissions. These examples illustrate the fine-tuning work conducted over each target area for the purpose of evaluating and improving model performance."

Cminor is an advanced, open-source solver to model either combustion chemistry, or atmospheric chemistry and its direct influence on condensation of cloud droplets and the subsequent processing of aerosol. It uses the superdroplet idea, making it particularly feasible for coupling with such models, which is part of future work. 
 We present version 1.0 of the Chemical Mechanism Integrator (Cminor), a fully modularized modern Fortran software package for the computational simulation of skeletal and detailed chemical kinetic systems derived from atmospheric and combustion chemistry. Cminor aims for the efficient simulation of complex chemical mechanisms by using various mathematical techniques. These are tailored to systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), having the specific structure arising from chemical reaction systems. Additionally, a high-speed mechanism parser allows the user to interchange reactions or their parameters in an ASCII format text file and immediately start a new simulation without recompiling, enabling fast and numerous simulations. Cminor's solver technique is based on Rosenbrock methods. Different measures of local errors and an analytical Jacobian matrix approach are implemented, where efficiency is obtained by exploiting the sparsity structure of the Jacobian.Cminor can be run in one of three configurations: 
A box-model framework for either pure gas-phase mechanisms or a multi-modal aerosol distribution dissolved in mono-dispersed cloud droplets.

 With rapid climate warming, Arctic surface temperatures have increased by 1.2 °C per decade over recent decades. Meteorological factors influence surface temperature by perturbing the Arctic surface radiation (ASR) budget, yet the changing thermodynamic and dynamic processes driving the ASR budget remain poorly understood. Based on CERES observations from 2001 to 2020, this study quantified the contribution rates of different drivers to the long-term changes in the ASR budget using the stepwise multiple liner regression models. We found that Arctic surface net shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation show a positive trend of 2.8 and 2.9 W m−2/decade, respectively. Attribution analysis reveals that such trends of the ASR tightly relate to the changes in climatic factors, but their temporal relationships exhibit regional divergence. Over land and sea ice, cloud fraction dominantly contributes 46 % and 50 % of the variations in net SW flux anomalies, respectively, and 65 % and 40 % of the variations in net LW flux anomalies. Over open ocean, cloud optical thickness explains 49 % of the changes in net SW flux anomalies, and water vapor contributes 35 % of the variations in net LW flux anomalies. Across the most Arctic regions, clouds induce a net warming effects on the ground, particularly pronounced impacts in central Greenland where the cloud-induced radiative effects exceed 40 W m−2. Notably, contrary to conventional SW cooling expectations, peripheral Greenland exhibits cloud-induced SW warming. These findings provide critical insights for refining polar radiation parameterizations in climate models."

Jimenez;Khanneh Wadinga Fomba,A nitrate photolysis source of tropospheric HONO is incompatible with current understanding of atmospheric chemistry,"HONO is key to tropospheric chemistry. Observations show high HONO concentrations in remote air, possibly explained by nitrate aerosol photolysis. We use observations to parameterize nitrate photolysis, evaluating simulated HONO against observations from multiple sources. We show improved agreement with observed HONO, but overestimates in NOx and O3, beyond observational constraints. This implies uncertainties in the NOx budget and our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. 
 Recent observations of nitrous acid (HONO) in the remote troposphere show much higher concentrations than can be explained through known sources, with important implications for air quality and climate. Laboratory evidence and modelling of field observations suggests that nitrate aerosol photolysis is the likely mechanism providing the additional HONO, offering a rapid route for recycling of NOx from nitric acid (HNO3). Previous studies of the global impact of this chemistry have used either very restricted HONO data or a “top-down” approach to parameterize the HONO source by reconciling simulated and observed NOx concentrations. Here, we use multiple, independent tropospheric HONO observations from different locations to parameterize nitrate photolysis, and evaluate its impacts on global atmospheric chemistry using GEOS-Chem. The simulations improve agreement between modelled and observed HONO concentrations relative to previous studies, decreasing the model bias by 5 %–20 %. The remaining (and large) underestimate of HONO in the model is due predominantly to an underestimate of total nitrate aerosol (−95 %) and is reduced to 20 % when accounting for low model nitrate. Despite the low bias in the model HONO, we find that nitrate aerosol photolysis leads to substantial global increases in NOx, O3 and OH concentrations, likely beyond the observational constraints. The additional source of NOx (∼ 48 Tg N yr−1 globally) is comparable to total NOx emissions from all sources (∼ 55 Tg yr−1). These HONO observations in the remote troposphere, thus imply a large uncertainty in the NOx budget and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric chemistry. Improved techniques to measure HONO at the low concentrations typical of remote areas, coupled with more measurements in these areas and improved process level understanding of nitrate photolysis are needed to provide quantitative assessment of its potentially global-scale atmospheric impacts."

Such variations further lead to 0.1 to 3.3 ppbv summertime ozone enhancement in agricultural hotspot regions and 6.7 ppbv to 16.6 ppbv reductions in global methane concentrations. 
 Natural and agricultural soils are important sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx), accounting for about 10 %–20 % of the global NOx emissions. The increased application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in agriculture has strongly enhanced the N availability of soils in the last several decades, leading to higher soil NOx emissions. However, the magnitude of the N fertilizer-induced soil NOx emissions remains poorly constrained due to limited field observations, resulting in divergent estimates. Here we integrate the results from meta-analyses of field manipulation experiments, emission inventories, atmospheric chemistry modelling and terrestrial biosphere modelling to investigate these uncertainties and the associated impacts on ground-level ozone and methane. The estimated present-day global soil NOx emissions induced by N fertilizer application vary substantially (0.84–2.2 Tg N yr−1) among different approaches with different spatial patterns. Simulations with the 3-D global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem demonstrate that N fertilization enhances global surface ozone concentrations during summertime in agricultural hotspots, such as North America, western Europe and eastern and southern Asia by 0.1 to 3.3 ppbv (0.2 %–7.0 %). Our results show that such spreads in soil NOx emissions also affect atmospheric methane concentrations, reducing the global mean by 6.7 (0.4 %) ppbv to 16.6 (0.9 %) ppbv as an indirect consequence of enhanced N fertilizer application. These results highlight the urgent need to improve the predictive understanding of soil NOx emission responses to fertilizer N inputs and its representation in atmospheric chemistry modelling."

 Chemistry-climate models have developed significantly over the decades, yet they still exhibit substantial systematic biases in simulating atmospheric composition due to gaps in our understanding of underlying processes. Building on deep learning's success in different domains, we explore its application to correct surface ozone biases in the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model UKESM1. Six statistical models have been developed, and the model Transformer outperforms others due to its advanced architecture. A simple weighted ensemble approach is further proved to enhance performance by 14 % over the best single model Transformer, reducing RMSE to 0.69 ppb. Applied to future scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF), the UKESM1 shows a larger overestimation of ozone changes by up to 25 ppb compared to present-day conditions. Despite biases, UKESM1 captures the non-linear ozone sensitivity to precursors, with temperature-sensitive processes identified as a dominant contributor to biases. We highlight that simulations of future surface ozone are likely to become less accurate under a warmer climate. Therefore, the bias correction approaches introduced here have substantial potential to improve the accuracy of ozone impact assessments. These methods are also applicable to other chemistry-climate models, which is critical for informing air quality and climate policy decisions."

Quantifying detection limits of top-down methane monitoring infrastructures","Climate change is greatly affecting the Arctic. Among these changes is the thawing of permanently frozen soil, which may increase the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG). In this study we investigated the capabilities of tall GHG measuring towers and two satellite systems to detect this methane release. We find that these systems have different strengths and weaknesses, and that individually they struggle to detect these changes, though combined they might cover their weak spots. 
 Large quantities of carbon are stored in Yedoma permafrost. When temperatures rise, its high ice content is a catalyst for rapid degradation, which in turn may cause the release of large quantities of carbon. 40 % to 70 % of the radiative forcing from this release is expected to be in the form of CH4. In this observing system simulation experiment, we examined the capabilities of three atmospheric GHG monitoring platforms i.e. tall towers, and the TROPOMI and MERLIN satellite instruments, to detect changes in CH4 release from increased Yedoma thaw. A set of environments are simulated with the GEOS-5 model: one representing a “natural” emission case as the reference, a second featuring enhanced CH4 release from Yedoma soils. From within these modelled environments, synthetic measurements are generated following best in situ practices and realistic error characterizations.For the satellites we find the lowest detection limits when aggregating measurements over a 112 d period, at Yedoma fluxes of 144 % to 367 % of current conditions. These factors are up to 1.2 times higher when taking transport modelling uncertainties into account. The tall tower network shows a wide range of detection lower limits, the lowest at only 107 % of current fluxes, but has considerably higher lower detection limits when factoring in transport modelling errors. Overall, the individual systems appear to lack the ability to detect and attribute small changes in Yedoma CH4 fluxes, and would either need to be used in combination or require a considerable time to detect changes under higher emission scenarios."

 A better understanding of country-scale anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and natural flux estimates and the carbon-climate feedback, is critical in formulating national climate policies to attain net zero emissions. Here, we use the atmospheric carbon dioxide column observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite to unravel the response of the Indian land biosphere to global climatic phenomena such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole. An ensemble of global flux inverse models constrained by satellite observations indicates a reduction in carbon uptake by the Indian land biosphere during El Niño and an enhanced uptake during La Niña and positive Indian Ocean Dipole events. We find that the large Gross Primary Production variations, as compared to total ecosystem respiration, determined the response of flux variability to climatic phenomena. The carbon-climate constraints imposed by satellite observations over India help elucidate how biospheric uptake may offset anthropogenic emissions in the future.

 Recent reports on anomalously large ozone holes imply the uncertainty of the Antarctic ozone recovery. This study demonstrates that the sea surface temperature trends during this century hinder this recovery, despite declining ozone-depleting substances. Observations show a significant recovery of the polar mean total column ozone in September during 2000-2021, contrasted by robust ozone loss in the South Pacific middle stratosphere during October-November. Numerical experiments reveal that ozone-depleting substance reduction alone drives significant Antarctic ozone recovery throughout austral spring. However, superimposing observed sea surface temperature linear increments causes significant stratospheric ozone decreases over the South Pacific in October-November and reduces the spring mean recovery by approximately 46%. Both reanalysis data and simulations indicate that sea surface temperature forcing weakens Antarctic stratospheric planetary wave activity, causing regional cooling and nitric acid loss. These changes increase the ratios between the active halogens and the halogen reservoirs, thereby promoting ozone depletion. Recent sea surface temperature trends weaken Antarctic stratospheric planetary wave activity, reducing atmospheric nitric acid and promoting ozone depletion, according to analyses of observations, reanalysis data, and model simulations."

 Atmospheric deposition plays an important role in the global distribution and long-range transport potential of micro- and nanoplastic particles. However, our mechanistic understanding of contributing processes remains limited. While similarities in wet and dry deposition processes can be expected between micro- and nanoplastics and well-studied natural and anthropogenic aerosols (e.g. mineral dust, pollen, black carbon), no holistic theoretical framework currently accounts for specific micro- and nanoplastic properties and their inherent heterogeneity. Here, we present an integrated mathematical model of atmospheric particle transport which incorporates micro- and nanoplastic properties (size, shape, density and surface characteristics, including effects of environmental ageing) based on theory and empirical data. We find that estimated micro- and nanoplastic half-lives in air can range from seconds to weeks, depending on particle characteristics, land surface type, surface wind speed, atmospheric stratification and precipitation. Micro- and nanoplastic particles with diameters of around 1 µm and fibres have the highest potential for long-range atmospheric transport.

 An increase in black carbon (BC) column concentration intensifies atmospheric warming, alters precipitation regimes, and accelerates glacial melting, posing substantial risks to regional climates and ecosystems. This study systematically evaluated the applicability of MERRA-2 reanalysis data over China by using daily-scale BC column concentration observations from AERONET sites. By integrating multi-source remote sensing data with machine learning models, a high-precision BC column concentration dataset for China was reconstructed. The results show that MERRA-2 data exhibit significant limitations in the China region, with an overall correlation coefficient (R) of only 0.54, an RMSE of 6701 μg/m2, and only 41 % of the sites demonstrating high correlation. For the high-quality data, R is 0.44, with an RMSE as high as 9112 μg/m2; the poorest performance is observed in the medium and low-quality data, with an R of 0.21. In contrast, the constructed model increased R by 0.29 and decreased RMSE by 2396 μg/m2 across the entire dataset, with the number of sites showing good correlation improving by 34 %. For the high and medium-quality data, R ranged from 0.70 to 0.86, and the RMSE decreased by 1475—4569 μg/m2. In addition, MERRA-2 BCE column concentration and BC aerosol optical depth are the key factors in the model, while surface-level PM2.5, organic matter, and BC concentrations are also important variables. Spatiotemporal evolution analysis shows a high degree of spatial overlap between regions with elevated BC column concentrations and China's key national urban agglomerations as well as major energy corridors. From 2001 to 2023, the national BC column concentration exhibited a trend of initial increase followed by a steady decline, with an average annual decrease of 42.36 μg/m2. Significant emission reduction achievements were observed in the central and eastern regions, while high concentrations persist in the western region. This study provides a critical data and technical foundation for both regional climate research and atmospheric environmental governance."

 Assimilating accurate water vapor observations is an effective way to enhance the rainfall forecasting performance of numerical weather prediction models. In this study, using the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) method, Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) data observed by two kinds of powerful water vapor instruments, i.e., the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the Global Change Observation Mission 1st–Water (GCOM-W1) satellite and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), are assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to enhance its rainfall forecasting capacity. The assimilation impacts of AMSR2 and GNSS PWV are comprehensively examined for the extreme rainfall events occurred in South China during the period of April 01 to 30, 2024. Assessed by the rainfall observations from the densely distributed automatic weather stations, our results indicate that assimilating AMSR2 and GNSS PWV improves rainfall forecasting performance in terms of both rainfall forecast scores and spatial patterns. For the intense-precipitation days, with a threshold of 150 mm accumulated rainfall within 24-h, assimilating AMSR2 PWV improves the equitable threat score (ETS) by up to 0.020 (26.3 % of improvement), while assimilating GNSS PWV improves the ETS by 0.021 (27.6 % of improvement). When both AMSR2 and GNSS PWV are assimilated, the ETS score increases by up to 0.030 (39.5 % of improvement)."
