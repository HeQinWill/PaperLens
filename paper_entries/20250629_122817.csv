We have developed the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC) dataset to represent the dynamics of wetland extent on a global scale (0.25° × 0.25° resolution, monthly time step). This updated resource combines satellite data and existing wetland databases, covering 1992 to 2020. Consistent maps of other methane-emitting surface waters (lakes, rivers, reservoirs, rice paddies) are also provided. 
 The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) database first published in 2001 was a key advance toward the accurate representation of wetlands globally by providing dynamic time series of global surface water based on passive microwave observations. This study supplements the second version of GIEMS (GIEMS-2) with other datasets to produce GIEMS-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC), a dynamically mapped dataset of methane-emitting waterlogged and inundated ecosystems. We separated open water from wetlands in GIEMS-MC by using the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database version 2 (GLWDv2) while adding unsaturated peatland areas undetected by GIEMS-2. Rice paddies are identified using the Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas (MIRCA2000) product. A specific coastal zone filtering is applied to avoid ocean artifacts while preserving coastal wetlands. GIEMS-MC covers the period 1992–2020 on a monthly scale at 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution. The GIEMS-MC product includes two layers of monthly wetland time series – one for flooded and saturated wetlands and another for all wetlands and peatlands – together with seven layers of compatible static maps of open water bodies (lakes, rivers, reservoirs) and seasonal rice paddy maps used in its production. The dominant vegetation and wetland types per pixel are also provided in GIEMS-MC variables. GIEMS-MC is compared to Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modelling (WAD2M), a dataset providing dynamic wetland information. In terms of wetland extent, all wetlands and peatlands in  GIEMS-MC and WAD2M show similar results, with a mean annual maximum of 7.7 Mkm2 for GIEMS-MC and 6.8 Mkm2 for WAD2M, with similar spatial patterns in most regions. The GIEMS-MC seamless time series represents a significant advance in wetland representation for methane modelling, although limitations remain in the accurate identification of rice, coastal, and peatland areas.

Their fate during ozone-based water treatment processes is unknown due to a lack of kinetic and mechanistic information on their reactions with ozone. Apparent second-order rate constants kO3 of 12 model compounds were determined at pH 7: oxazoles react 2 orders of magnitude faster (kO3 = 9 × 102–5 × 104 M–1s–1, depending on their substituents) than thiazoles (kO3 = 1 × 101–2 × 103 M–1s–1). The low kO3 of thiazoles limits their degradability during ozonation. Only small yields of reactive oxygen species (•OH, H2O2, and 1O2) were observed during ozonation of oxazoles, suggesting that all oxygen atoms from ozone are incorporated into the products. Oxazoles and thiazoles react initially by a Criegee-type reaction at the C=C double bond, followed by two reaction branches, leading to two observed product groups: (1) carboxylates and cyanate; (2) formate, amide and CO2. For thiazoles, thiocarboxylic acids were identified as intermediates, reacting further to sulfate and carboxylic acids, forming 1O2. The nonaromatic 2-methyloxazoline is unreactive toward ozone. 2-Methylthiazoline reacts fast (kO3 = 2 × 104 M–1s–1), forming 1O2, leading to ring-opening and formation of dimerization products which react further to N-acetyltaurine. These results enhance the understanding of the ozone reactivity of heterocycles and help predict transformation product formation."

However, many recalcitrant DBPs like 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) still persist in the effluent, threatening water ecosystem safety. Here, we constructed a highly active and stable faceted photocatalyst, consisting of Al-doped SrTiO3 loaded with spatially separated cobalt oxide (CoOx) and palladium (Pd) cocatalysts, for efficiently eliminating the halogenated DBPs including 4-CP. This photocatalyst with a dual cocatalyst design enabled efficient photocharge separation and synergized the reductive dechlorination and oxidative degradation processes to augment 4-CP removal, exhibiting 70-fold higher decontamination efficiency than the cocatalyst-free control and 7-fold higher activity than the unfaceted control. Importantly, the high UV activity and singlet oxygen (1O2)-dominated oxidation pathway of the photocatalyst rendered it superior in environmental robustness and adaptability to the existing UV/chlorine process. Consequently, by introducing this photocatalyst, a rapid in situ elimination of DBPs during UV/chlorine treatment of the secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was achieved, with the concentrations of several representative DBPs all below the detection limits (<10–9 g/mL). In addition, it also demonstrated superior stability during cyclic photocatalytic decontamination and during long-term continuous operation in a photocatalytic membrane reactor for UV/chlorine treatment. Our work presents an important advancement to photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes and may inspire further development of photocatalytic water purification and disinfection technologies."

However, climate change and human disturbances are altering wetland hydrology with water level fluctuations profoundly influencing carbon sequestration. While previous syntheses and modeling studies have suggested the existence of water level thresholds in wetland carbon dynamics, the mechanisms underlying these thresholds remain poorly understood, and field-based evidence is lacking. Here, we present results from a long-term field experiment across six water level treatments, ranging from 100 to 40 cm above the soil surface. We identify a carbon sink threshold occurring between −20 and 0 cm, as water levels rise to the soil surface. This threshold emerges from water-level-induced soil-vegetation feedbacks. We further show that the dominant control of CO2 exchange shifts from soil properties (moisture and salinity) to vegetation traits (height and coverage) once the threshold is crossed. These findings provide in situ empirical evidence for a wetland carbon threshold and highlight the critical role of ecohydrological feedbacks. Our study offers new insights into wetland carbon dynamics under changing hydrological regimes and informs management strategies for enhancing wetland carbon storage."

To address this gap, we developed general steroidogenesis modulation models using data from ∼1,800 chemicals screened in H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells. A random forest model was validated using a prospective test set of 20 compounds (14 predicted active, 6 inactive), achieving 80% accuracy with conformal prediction adjustments.

These models enable predictions of both general steroidogenesis inhibition and potential molecular targets. Additionally, we developed a transformer-based model (MolBART) to predict all end points simultaneously and validated this performance. Combined, these models may offer a rapid and scalable system for assessing chemical impacts on steroidogenesis, supporting chemical risk assessment, product stewardship, and regulatory decision-making."

In this study, we aimed to identify previously unrecognized endocrine disruptors in thermal paper by employing a nontargeted screening coupled ToxPi Ranking (NSTR) approach. Among the substances identified with high confidence in thermal paper, Crystal Violet Lactone (CVL), a typical thermochromic dye, was prioritized with a high endocrine disruptive potential. CVL can be absorbed through the skin and excreted in the urine. In addition, we demonstrated significant bioaccumulation of CVL in zebrafish tissues, with hepatic concentrations reaching up to 3.1 times those in the exposure water, and five biotransformation products were identified. CVL exposure impaired the reproductive capacity of breeding pairs, led to gonadal histological alterations, and exhibited developmental toxicity to F1 offspring. Transcriptional analysis revealed disruptions in the expression of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPG-L) axis genes in adults. In embryos, CVL significantly increased the frequency of epiboly, yolk extension formation, and somite number while decreasing the ear-eye distance and size of the yolk sac. Significant alterations in HPG-L axis genes were observed, as well. Thus, our data demonstrated that CVL targeted multiple end points in both adult fish and embryos, exhibiting remarkably endocrine disruptive effects."

To date, a limited number of compounds have been identified in disinfected wastewater. In this study, we proposed a framework for comprehensively screening and identifying thiol-reactive compounds using a thiol probe combined with a nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis workflow, in which we monitored a fragment ion (C5H8NO3S–). To specifically target α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, this approach was developed and validated for 15 model α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Then, the technique was applied to analyze chlorinated municipal wastewater effluent, and 58 tentative thiol-reactive compounds were detected. We predicted the formulas of the 30 highest abundance α,β-unsaturated carbonyls.

However, its increasing use may lead to its inadvertent environmental release, creating potential ecological and health risks that remain poorly understood. In this study, wild-type and transgenic zebrafish were used to evaluate the potential developmental toxicity of small-size BP (S-BP), with a lateral particle size of 154.4 ± 34.6 nm, focusing specifically on vascular growth and hematopoiesis at relatively low concentrations of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/L. The results indicated that S-BP adhered to the chorion and induced developmental defects. The uninflated swim bladders and decreased heart rate were observed in S-BP-exposed larvae at 120 hpf. The angioarchitectural profiling using transgenic zebrafish showed that exposure to S-BP adversely impaired blood vessel development at 72 hpf, especially in the common cardinal vein (CCV). Moreover, erythropoiesis and the flow velocity of red blood cells (RBCs) were disturbed at 120 hpf in all of the S-BP-exposed groups. Transcriptomic analysis unveiled that S-BP exposure altered gene expression related to angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, ribosome function, and transport processes. Notably, the mRNA levels of vascular and hematopoietic markers, including clec14a, nme2b.1, klf2a, slc2a1a, csf1rb, atf3, scl, and scml4, were significantly downregulated following S-BP exposure. Our findings revealed that low concentrations of S-BP exposure caused vascular and hematologic toxicity and identified CCV and RBCs as sensitive targets.

Children exhibit heightened sensitivity to Pb exposure compared to adults, and prenatal Pb exposure can harm the developing fetal nervous system. However, the specific regulatory effects of Pb across various developmental stages are not well understood. This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze mice brains at different ages (2 and 8 weeks) following prenatal and postnatal Pb exposure. Blood lead level in exposed mice is comparable to those detected in human samples, implying its environmental implication. A total of 43,303 brain cells were sequenced for cell-specific analysis. Pb exposure was found to elevate the proportion of immature neurons in the brains of 2 week-old mice and to perturb neurodevelopment- and neural structure-related pathways within neurons. In 8 week-old mice, Pb primarily influenced pathways implicated in synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and learning and memory in both neurons and glial cells. The communication involving neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), along with their receptors, was disrupted between neuron and microglia.

However, as a crucial component in high-performance PSCs, highly toxic lead may leak from discarded PSCs and cause environmental and health risks. Implementing the effective recovery of lead from discarded PSCs is crucial for the sustainable development of the PSC industry.

This study proposes a facile ultrasonic water leaching technique for effectively recovering lead from the glass substrate of discarded PSCs. During the ultrasonic water leaching process, the perovskite layer undergoes rapid degradation, generating PbI2. Most of the PbI2 dissolves in the water, yielding a leaching solution containing a low lead concentration, while a minor fraction is converted into insoluble Pb(OH)I particles. The cumulative Pb removal ratio from the first two cycles of ultrasonic water leaching processes can reach 99.84%.

Sequence comparison highlighted the divergence of group-6 cluster-III SDIMOs, exhibiting amino acid features (e.g., proline avoidance and glycine substitution) in proximity of the active sites that can be relevant to their psychrophilicity, emphasizing the necessity to characterize their catalytic behaviors and develop sensitive biomarkers for field assessment. This research sheds light on the unique adaptations of psychrophilic consortia and their potential for remediation strategies in cold groundwater environments with a commingled contamination of dioxane and CAHs."

Pandis,Chemical Aging of Semivolatile Secondary Organic Aerosol Sesquiterpene Products,"The oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) is a significant source of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). This study investigates later-generation SOA formation from the reactions of three first-generation sesquiterpene ozonolysis products (β-nocaryophyllinic acid, 2-(2-carboxyethyl)-3,3-dimethylcyclobutane-carboxylic acid, and 2-(2-methyl-6-oxoheptan-3-yl)-3,6-dioxoheptanal) with the OH radical. These compounds were synthesized specifically for this study. Our results demonstrate that sesquiterpene-derived SOA can become progressively more oxidized as it reacts with OH, with an average oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio of approximately 0.6, in contrast with previous studies, suggesting considerably lower ratios. As the first-generation products continue to react, the corresponding SOA aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) mass spectrum changes by 20–25° compared to that of the fresh SOA. This suggests that quantifying the sesquiterpene SOA under ambient conditions based on its ozonolysis products may be problematic. To account for these observations, we propose and test a physicochemical model describing the processes that convert first-generation sesquiterpene SOA into highly oxidized compounds. Our analysis suggests that approximately two-thirds of carbon in the ozonolysis SOA follows functionalization pathways. The parametrizations developed in this work can be utilized in future modeling efforts to reassess the contribution of sesquiterpenes to SOA formation."

Thoma,Methane Sensor Characterization Using Colocated Ambient Comparisons and Simulated Emission Challenges,"Methane sensing technologies have wide applications, including leak detection and repair in the energy sector and emissions monitoring from landfills and agriculture. Lower-cost units, as opposed to reference-grade instrumentation, may be deployed in many forms (e.g., sensor networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, and mobile monitoring) and allow vastly improved spatial and temporal data resolution owing to their scalability. Ultimately, early detection of unexpected emissions enabled by lower-cost sensing technologies provides industry with rapid operational feedback, allowing for emission reductions and improved process control. The expanded use of such technologies allows for consolidation and resolution of “bottom-up” emission inventories with results using emerging “top-down” techniques (e.g., satellite measurements), thereby improving emissions management on many scales. Here, we introduce a novel testing method to assess four leading commercial methane monitoring technologies that employ three distinct working principles: metal oxide (MOx) conductometry, tunable diode laser (TDL) spectrometry, and photoacoustic spectrometry (PAS). We assess both nominal baseline performance and sensor response using ambient measurements and controlled release experiments, respectively. We observe the PAS technology to provide the lowest baseline signal noise (and therefore the lowest detection limit), followed by TDL and MOx. We also observe PAS to have the highest agreement with reference instrumentation during simulated emission plume events (with TDL and MOx technologies generally trailing in accuracy). Outcomes of this work include guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to better understand the best available commercial methane sensor technology. Analysis approaches employed here may also be applied to many other low-cost gas sensing technologies."

Previous studies have demonstrated associations of temperature with fall risk, but the effect and burden of hourly relative humidity and fall morbidity have been rarely investigated. Fall data and meteorological data were collected from the National Injury Surveillance System during 2006–2021 in China. Associations between hourly relative humidity and fall onset were analyzed using conditional logistic regression combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model. Stratified analysis was used to identify potential association modifiers. Several sensitivity analyses were applied to examine the robustness of the results. The study involved 4 197 495 fall-related cases. Relative humidity exhibited monotonic relationships with the fall onset risk. The excess risk (ER) of falls appeared immediately at lag 0 h and persisted for 8 h. A 10% decrease in relative humidity was associated with a 1.35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.87%) increase in excess risk of falls and much higher risk for males (ER = 1.89%, 95% CI: 1.29–2.48%) than that for females (ER = 0.52%, 95% CI: 0.14–0.90%). The excess risk of fall injury was the highest among individuals aged 5–14 years (ER = 3.45%, 95% CI: 2.57–4.32%) compared to other age groups. Moreover, compared to the highest relative humidity, the attributable fraction (AF) due to low relative humidity exposure was 4.94% (95% CI: 4.88–4.98%). Subgroup analyses revealed that males, individuals aged 5–14 years, students, cases occurring in public places, and cases engaged in sports activities were more susceptible to relative humidity than their correspondents. Regional disparities were observed, with individuals in southern China or warm regions showing greater sensitivity to changes in relative humidity. Results of this study suggest that hourly low relative humidity exposure is associated with an increased risk of fall onset. These findings underscore the necessity of time-specific interventions to mitigate the relative humidity risk."

Here, we first analyzed the constituents of e-cigarette liquid (e-liquid) and e-liquid vaping-produced aerosols (e-aerosols) by gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/Q-TOF MS) and inductively coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS), and our result indicated that the components of e-aerosols differed from those of e-liquid. However, there is insufficient evidence on the toxicity of e-aerosols; therefore, an animal study was conducted accordingly. Mice were exposed to e-aerosols for 30, 60, or 90 days within a whole-body exposure chamber equipped with an air quality monitor. Compared with the control, weakened lung function and fiber deposition in murine lungs were observed following e-cigarette exposure. Microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) images suggested fibrosis-like lesions in the lungs. Mechanistically, the expression of the core circadian rhythm gene, per1, was significantly inhibited by e-aerosols, which is negatively correlated with interleukin-6 (IL6) expression and resulted in continuous IL6+ macrophage infiltration in the lungs during both daytime and night. Eventually, the knockout of il6 expression could completely resist e-aerosol-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our results raise concerns regarding the role of circadian rhythm in regulating pulmonary fibrosis and the potential damages of e-cigarette consumption."

Consequently, human exposure to VMS through inhalation or other routes poses potential health risks. To provide insights for environmental contamination by VMS and its concerning health risks, a systematic literature search was conducted in online databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. This review analyzed contamination levels of VMS in various environmental matrices, including air, dust, water, and soil. It further summarized health risk assessments for different external exposure pathways. The exacerbation of VMS pollution is predominantly linked to the increase in atmospheric concentrations, resulting in health risks primarily driven by inhalation exposure. Vulnerable groups require greater attention as their daily intake levels may potentially approach the reference dose, including occupational populations and children residing in areas near factories. Currently, data on long-term and simultaneous environmental monitoring of VMS remain limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of established exposure guidance values, due to insufficient toxicity data and limited risk quantification methods. Therefore, advancing monitoring technologies and networks for VMS and their transformation products is crucial. Future efforts should prioritize integrating advanced tools, such as mixture toxicity models, to achieve more accurate quantification of health risks under complex exposure scenarios. Overall, this review sheds light on developing and revising regulatory frameworks for governing the production and handling of VMS, as well as guiding the health risk assessment."

Previous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on lipid metabolism. However, population studies have focused primarily on individual pesticides and have short-term fluctuations, and the animal experiments used doses far higher than those exposed by the general population. In this study, urinary concentrations of metabolites of three classes of pesticides, including organophosphate, pyrethroid, and phenoxy carboxylic acid, were determined in 1858 participants of repeated cross-sectional biomonitoring programs from 2018 to 2022. We comprehensively analyzed the association of pesticide metabolites and pesticide exposure patterns with lipid metabolism biomarkers. The indirect effects of liver function markers in these associations were explored by using the structural equation model analysis. Generalized linear models showed that 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and para-nitrophenol were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride. In contrast, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid was negatively correlated with apolipoprotein B. Quantile g-computation and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression showed a consistent gradual increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but a gradual decrease in apolipoprotein B levels with increasing exposure to pesticide mixtures. By analyzing the exposure patterns of different categories of pesticides, we found that the population has a high level of exposure to organophosphate pesticides, which disrupts lipid metabolism more significantly than other pesticides. Liver function exhibited significant mediating effects in the association between pesticide exposure and lipid metabolism biomarkers. The results indicated that pesticide exposure was significantly associated with lipid metabolism, and this association may be modulated by improvements in liver function."

While the endocrine-disrupting effects of PFCs are well-recognized, the structure–activity relationship with respect to vascular function has not been investigated yet. This study addresses this critical gap by investigating the impact of PFCs on endothelial cell function, a key determinant of cardiovascular health. Through a machine learning-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model, we analyzed 16 structural descriptors for 23 environmentally prevalent PFCs with respect to their binding affinities to endothelial cell receptors. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm suggested short-chain PFCs with strong acid groups may as particularly detrimental to endothelial cells, a finding substantiated by subsequent cell culture experiments. We also integrated computational and experimental approaches, providing a detailed understanding of the structure–activity and dose–response relationships of PFCs. Furthermore, the population health risk assessment, linking in vitro adverse effect with in vivo exposure data, indicated differences in risks across countries due to the global shift in the fluoride industry; the entire Chinese population is at high risk, with risk varying by gender and industrialization level.

Additionally, systemic inflammation levels were assessed using the low-grade inflammation score (INFLA-score) to elucidate the potential mechanism. We noted that the observed effects could be modified by circulating omega-3 PUFA levels (P-interaction < 0.05). Specifically, the significant pollutants-COPD associations were mainly observed in the lower circulating omega-3 PUFA groups.

Iron measurements are paired with time series data to explain the iron cycle contextualized to broader Southern Ocean biogeochemistry. Three distinct phases were revealed with clear coupling between iron and productivity in the first two phases. In the first phase, light limitation initially controls spring to summer primary production with shoaling of the mixed layer, accounting for around half of annual net community production (ANCP). In the second phase and remaining half of ANCP, rapid biomass increases and near‐complete drawdown of DFe drive iron limitation, evidenced by maximum fluorescence‐to‐chlorophyll ratios. A subset of this period covering a third of ANCP exhibits a mean Fe:C uptake ratio of 31.08 ± 8.88 μmol:mol. During the third phase, iron is weakly coupled to productivity as the system transitions to net heterotrophy and biomass declines despite increased Fe supply associated with the east Australian current system. Together, 27 years of continuous monitoring draws a comprehensive picture of how and when iron fuels subantarctic productivity, providing a critical baseline for model validation and continued monitoring in a rapidly changing climate."

Jones;Christopher Daly;Mark Schulze;Christopher J. Stlll,"Microclimate Refugia Are Transient in Stable Old Forests, Pacific Northwest, USA","An issue of global concern is how climate change forcing is transmitted to ecosystems. Forest ecosystems in mountain landscapes may demonstrate buffering and perhaps decoupling of long‐term rates of temperature change, because vegetation, topography, and local winds (e.g., cold air pooling) influence temperature and potentially create microclimate refugia (areas which are relatively protected from climate change). We tested these ideas by comparing 45‐year regional rates of air temperature change to unique temporal and spatial air temperature records in the understory of regionally representative stable old forest at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. The 45‐year seasonal patterns and rates of warming were similar throughout the forested landscape and matched regional rates observed at 88 standard meteorological stations in Oregon and Washington, indicating buffering, but not decoupling of long‐term climate change rates. Consideration of the energy balance explains these results: while shading and airflows produce spatial patterns of temperature, these processes do not counteract global increases in air temperature driven by increased downward, longwave radiation forced by increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In some months, the 45‐year warming in the forest understory equaled or exceeded spatial differences of air temperature between the understory and the canopy or canopy openings and was comparable to temperature change over 1,000 m elevation, while in other months there has been little change. These findings have global implications because they indicate that microclimate refugia are transient, even in this forested mountain landscape."

Traditionally, quantitative climatic measures of storm activity have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect Eulerian eddy activity, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA‐5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from 83 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the background state as the storms develop. In the limit of weak baroclinicity, we find that baroclinicity provides a good measure for storm maximum intensity. However, this monotonic relationship breaks for high baroclinicity levels. We show that although the actual growth rate of individual storms monotonically increases with baroclinicity, the reduction in maximum intensity at high baroclinicity is caused by a decrease in storm growth time. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional linear connection between baroclinicity and storms' activity. Then, we show that a simplified model of storm growth, incorporating the baroclinicity effect on the vertical tilt of anomalies, reproduces the observed nonlinear relationship. Expanding the analysis to include the mean flow's barotropic properties highlights their marginal effect on storm growth rate, but the crucial impact on growth time. Our results emphasize the potential of Lagrangianly studying storm dynamics to advance understanding of the midlatitude climate."

Garny,Intrinsic Predictability From the Troposphere to the Mesosphere/Lower Thermosphere (MLT),"The atmosphere's flow becomes unpredictable beyond a certain time due to the inherent growth of small initial‐state errors. While many research studies have focused on tropospheric predictability, predictability of the middle atmosphere remains less studied. This work contrasts the intrinsic predictability of different layers, with a focus on the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT, 50–120 km altitude). Ensemble simulations with the UA‐ICON model for an austral winter/spring season are conducted with a gravity‐wave‐permitting horizontal resolution of 20 km. Initially small perturbations grow fastest in the MLT, reaching 10% of saturation after 5–6 days, compared to 10 days in the troposphere and 2 weeks in the stratosphere. A saturation level of 50% is reached only after about 2 weeks in the MLT, similar to the troposphere. Saturation times are overestimated in a coarser resolution model (grid size 160 km) by up to a factor of two, highlighting the need for gravity wave‐resolving models. Predictability in the MLT depends on horizontal scales. Motions on scales of hundreds of kilometers are predictable for less than 5 days, while larger scales (thousands of kilometers) remain predictable for up to 20 days. This scale‐dependent progression of predictability cannot be explained by simple scaling for upscale error growth. Vertical wave propagation plays a significant role, with gravity waves transmitting perturbations upward at early lead times and planetary waves enhancing long‐term predictability. In summary, the study shows that MLT predictability is scale‐dependent and highlights the necessity of high‐resolution models to capture fast‐growing perturbations and assess intrinsic predictability limits accurately."

Many operational NWP models often struggle with slow or no fog formation after sunset and too rapid dissipation in the morning. This study investigates the role of physical processes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in shaping the limitations of fog and low stratus representation within the operational ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. Specifically, it evaluates the effects of turbulence parameterizations and vertical resolution on fog simulations. ICON simulations were conducted for selected winter periods characterized by persistent radiation fog, nocturnal fog, low stratus, and high pollutant concentrations over the Swiss Plateau. The simulations involved different configurations of the operational turbulence scheme (ICON‐TKE) and the newly developed two‐energies turbulence scheme (ICON‐2TE). The performance of these model configurations was assessed using an ABL profiler and surface observations from the Payerne weather station in Switzerland. The results indicate that ICON‐2TE, with its refined turbulence representation, allows fog to persist longer and aligns more closely with observations than ICON‐TKE. This improvement is attributed to a more sophisticated treatment of stability dependence and turbulence length scale in the ICON‐2TE scheme. Notably, an increase in vertical resolution improves fog representation in the ICON‐2TE scheme, while it shows almost no effect in the ICON‐TKE scheme. The lack of improvement in ICON‐TKE is likely due to an overestimation of turbulence mixing, which overrides the effect of changes in vertical resolution."

 It is well established that the drastic ozone loss in the Antarctic stratosphere, commonly known as the ozone hole, is primarily driven by gas-phase and heterogeneous chemical processes.

 Increasing combined heat and drought extremes due to climate change heighten the risk of crop failure, underscoring the need for improved stress diagnosis for effective management strategies. However, current plant physiology indicators struggle to differentiate crop stresses in hot-dry environments. This study proposes using specific leaf metabolites, detectable by leaf reflectance spectra, for more precise identification of heat and drought stress compared to traditional methods. We conducted two rounds of one-week drought treatments under heat stress on soybean seedlings. Throughout the experiment, we monitored stomatal conductance, reflectance spectra, and metabolites, including Abscisic Acid (ABA), Jasmonic Acid (JA), Salicylic Acid (SA), and proline (Pro), on a daily basis. Our findings revealed that ABA and JA exhibited differential sensitivities to drought and heat stress, respectively. In contrast, stomatal conductance was unable to differentiate between the two stressors. Using partial least-squares regression (PLSR), we determined that both ABA and JA could be detected via leaf spectroscopy with moderate predictive performance (R2 = 0.53, relative RMSE = 14.28 %; R2 = 0.53, relative RMSE = 14.96 %) and exhibited distinct sensitive spectral signatures. The metabolite-derived, stress-specific spectral models enable more precise and earlier diagnosis and differentiation of stress in a hot-dry environment than traditional physiological indicators (e.g., relying on stomatal conductance). This study provides an example of using metabolites as novel stress indicators, which could contribute to precision agriculture, offering the potential for accurate, stress-specific, and pre-physiological detection of crop health."

 Satellite land surface temperature (Ts) provides valuable information on vegetation drought stress via its physical linkage to plant stomatal activity and transpiration. New-generation geostationary satellites offer opportunities to monitor sub-diurnal variations in Ts and thus track plant physiological stress response occurring at sub-daily timescales. Nevertheless, the potential of satellite Ts and its derived metrics for early detection of vegetation drought stress before visible canopy changes occur has not been widely assessed. Here, we developed a parsimonious Surface-Air Temperature Difference Anomaly (SATDA) method for tracking vegetation drought stress using the cumulative sub-diurnal difference from late-morning to early-afternoon between Ts from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and hourly air temperature (Ta) from meteorological grids. SATDA utilised Ts−Ta as the physical driving gradient for sensible heat flux (H) to capture anomalous sensible heating due to reduced plant transpiration. We used SATDA to monitor the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2017–2019 Tinderbox Drought in southeast Australia. We benchmarked the skill of SATDA in forecasting visible drought-induced vegetation greenness decline against both conventional water availability-based indices (i.e., precipitation and soil moisture anomalies) and existing satellite Ts indices (i.e., Temperature Condition Index and Temperature Rise Index) across diverse climates and land covers. SATDA effectively captured a rapidly intensifying flash drought event at multi-week timescales (Jul to Sep 2019) embedded within the multi-year Tinderbox Drought, which contributed to detrimental impacts on agricultural production and increased wildfire risk. SATDA showed the best vegetation greenness forecast skill in the transitional semi-arid and sub-humid climates, with forecast correlation >0.5 at 32-day lead time. The advantage over water availability-based indices was more evident in woody-dominated ecosystems than herbaceous-dominated ecosystems, likely due to the importance of physiological regulations by trees during droughts such as deeper roots and stronger stomatal control. SATDA, based on Ts−Ta, showed overall better vegetation greenness forecasts than two Ts-only indices, especially in woody vegetation. Finally, SATDA showed consistently greater advantage over water availability-based and Ts-only indices in forecasting visible vegetation decline as the drought intensity increased. The parsimonious process-based SATDA method suits global-scale operational implementation to complement vegetation drought monitoring and early warning systems."

 Restoring natural ecosystems has the potential to remove billions of tons of CO2 annually through the end of the century, but rigorously measuring the climate impacts of restoration activities on the ground remains elusive. Ecosystem restoration interventions across hundreds or thousands of smallholder properties require robust above-ground biomass (AGB) products at high spatial (deca-metric: 10–30 m) resolution for annual monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). In addition to ongoing monitoring, historical AGB time series across the region are also necessary. Historical maps are for example needed for eligibility checks and the selection of appropriate counterfactuals, i.e., to establish a dynamic performance benchmark. We present a novel AGB product based on a recently developed foundation model leveraging progress in self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques from multi-spectral Earth Observation (EO) time series. The foundation model is non-contrastive and condenses all available spectral observations acquired within a year into a few, orthogonal and highly informative representations at 10 m (for Sentinel-2) and 30 m (for Landsat 7/8). Combined with spatially sparse Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform measurements at two relative heights (RH95 and RH10), but otherwise without any further fine-tuning, we are able to estimate forest biomass with an RMSE of <25 Mg/ha, when validated against 38 in-situ AGB measurement sites across a range of agroforestry (cacao and oil palm) and restoration age classes. Compared to five openly available datasets – most of them not available at annual time steps – our approach reduces the RMSE by 15–55%. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach, by producing annual AGB maps covering the entire state of Para, Brazil, for the years 2013 to 2024. The approach is computationally efficient, fully self-supervised without relying on contrastive samples, and can therefore be scaled to global coverage, even under conditions of high cloudiness."

GSA provided complementary results to assess estimation uncertainties of the proposed traits retrieval method across growth stages. A hybrid inversion framework combining DART simulations with an active learning strategy using Kernel Ridge Regression was implemented for traits estimation. The approach was validated using ground data and HyPlant-DUAL airborne hyperspectral images from two field campaigns in 2018 and achieved high retrieval accuracy of key maize traits: leaf area index (LAI, R2=0.91, RMSE=0.42 m2/m2), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, R2=0.61, RMSE=3.89 μg/cm2), leaf nitrogen content (LNC, R2=0.86, RMSE=1.13 × 10−2 mg/cm2), leaf dry matter content (LMA, R2=0.84, RMSE=0.15 mg/cm2), and leaf water content (LWC, R2=0.78, RMSE=0.88 mg/cm2).

 Accurate knowledge of vegetation water content (VWC) and crop height is crucial for agricultural management, environmental monitoring, and for satellite-based retrieval algorithms for geophysical variables. Traditional methods to estimate VWC, primarily rely on optical indices, which has limitations of biomass saturation, and sensitivity to atmospheric conditions. This study introduces a novel application of geospatial foundation models (GFMs), leveraging extensive, unlabeled datasets through self-supervised learning to enhance the skill of VWC and crop height estimation.

For VWC estimation, STL-GFM achieved R2 values of 0.90 and 0.89 for soybean and corn, respectively. For crop height, R2 values reached 0.95 for soybean and 0.98 for corn. The integration of SAR, optical, and climate data provided more reliable estimations than using individual data sources.Feature importance analysis identified NDVI, NDWI, VH backscatter, and precipitation as key drivers for accurate VWC and height estimations. The red-edge band emerged as significant for VWC estimation but showed limited importance for height prediction. Notably, surface roughness demonstrated a noticeable impact on corn VWC and height estimations, while soil moisture exhibited less influence than initially anticipated. Notably, without directly incorporating soil moisture and surface roughness data, but by including diverse field conditions in training and validation, the STL-GFM model demonstrated strong generalization capabilities.

 As one of the critical parameters in the land-atmosphere exchange processes, land surface temperature (LST) plays an essential role in various domains, such as climate change, urban heat island effect, disaster monitoring, and evaporation retrieval. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is one of the main approaches to obtaining LST on a large scale. For the sensors with only one TIR channel, the single-channel (SC) methods are commonly and effectively used to retrieve LST, as they are most suitable under such limitations. However, atmospheric correction is essential for the SC methods, which involves significant uncertainty and complexity. To reduce the atmospheric dependency of SC methods, this study proposes a Correlation-Hypothesis based Single-Channel (CH-SC) method to retrieve LST. In this method, the LST can be retrieved using the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature from a single TIR channel and the LSEs from two virtual adjacent channels, while atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) is used solely to assess atmospheric conditions. Consequently, the CH-SC method exhibits the least sensitive in atmospheric parameter errors compared to existing SC methods. This inherent robustness results in superior stability of retrieval accuracy, enhancing its practicality for real applications. Subsequently, the CH-SC method was applied to Landsat 7 data, alongside the mono-window (MW) method and generalized single-channel (GSC) method. The retrieved LSTs were compared with in-situ measurements for validation. As a result, the CH-SC method exhibited strong performance compared to in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 2.83 K in SURFRAD sites and 4.02 K in BSRN sites, which was comparable to Landsat 7 LST product (3.15 K at SURFRAD and 4.26 K at BSRN) and outperforming other SC methods.

 Radiative transfer models (RTM) enable the simulation of remote sensing observations and can therefore be useful for sensitivity analyses and model inversions, for example to determine the biophysical properties of vegetation. For this purpose, the calculation of observation derivatives is crucial. In this study, we propose to differentiate vegetation RTM based on Monte Carlo Ray tracing, PolVRT, as a function of the leaf area index (LAI). The variation of LAI is done considering the average leaf area (u). The difference between simulations corresponding to two areas close to each other (u and u′) is used to calculate the derivative as the limit when u′ approaches u. We propose in this work to adjust traced paths for u to simulate (u′), but such paths are weighted to correct their bias. This weighting is based on the technique of Importance Sampling. It increases the weighting of likely paths and conversely decreases it of unlikely ones. We have made a correction for the hot spot effect, since there is a strong dependency between the incident and backscattered paths. Our approach performances are verified using some discrete ROMC scene parameters and compared with the standard finite difference technique."

 An up-to-date, detailed global urban land use map is essential for disclosing urban structures and dynamics as well as their differences across different regions. However, generating an accurate global urban land use map remains challenging due to the complex diversity of land use types and the uneven availability of data. Existing methods, which either rely solely on remote sensing imagery or treat supplementary data like point-of-interest (POI) as mandatory inputs, fail to account for regional data disparities and the complex relationships between different data modalities. In this study, we propose an urban land use mapping framework optimized with POI prompts. First, we acquire global urban Sentinel-2 imagery, POI data, and labeled LU samples from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and OpenStreetMap (OSM), and then propose a POI-Prompt Urban Land-use Mapping Network (PPUL-Net), which utilizes POI prompts to enhance classification accuracy and produce reliable predictions in those regions lacking POI data. Consequently, a global land use dataset (GULU) with a 10 m resolution in 2020 has been produced at the first time. Experimental results show that GULU has an overall accuracy of 84.59 %, demonstrating robust performance across continents. Incorporating POI data improved the accuracies for some challenging categories, such as commercial and institutional lands, by 7.32 % and 17.66 %, respectively. Additionally, using POI as prompts instead of direct pixel-level fusion with imagery increased accuracy by 2.92 %. Finally, analysis of the GULU dataset reveals that Europe and North America exhibit high land use diversity, implying mature urban structures, whereas sub-Saharan Africa and South America are predominantly characterized by residential and undeveloped areas. This dataset provides invaluable insights for urban planning, development monitoring, and sustainable development assessments."

 Urban mesh data comprises large-scale textured meshes representing outdoor urban environments. Semantic segmentation of urban meshes is becoming increasingly important in urban analysis. However, many existing studies predominantly employ fully supervised methods, which typically require substantial facet-level annotations that are challenging to acquire in practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach, Semi-MeshSeg, to tackle the problem of insufficiently labeled data. Urban meshes are irregular and susceptible to distortion, leading to blurred boundaries and surface features. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel semi-supervised method for 3D mesh semantic segmentation, capable of leveraging all pseudo-labels, rather than relying solely on a small subset of high-confidence ones, to more effectively capture the inherent variability and irregularity of urban meshes. Given that pseudo-labels, particularly low-confidence ones, often contain substantial noise, we design dual-stream perturbation branches, a noise reduction loss, and a distribution alignment loss to mitigate this noise. The dual-stream perturbation branches enhance the semantic segmentation performance of the model by exploring extensive three-dimensional (3D) perturbation spaces, while the noise reduction loss and distribution alignment loss are designed to enhance the quality of noisy pseudo-labels. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves superior performance with only one tile of labeled data, improving mIoU by at least 3.0% on the SUM dataset and 4.5% on the seMet dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness under limited labeled data conditions."

 The Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite (TECIS) is the first Chinese satellite in orbit equipped with both waveform LiDAR and multi-angle imaging capabilities, dedicated to forest carbon monitoring. It has collected a large volume of waveform data. To accurately estimate canopy height using waveform data, two critical steps are identifying the effective signal range based on signal threshold settings and selecting the optimal waveform metrics processing method. The choice of waveform threshold settings and metrics calculation methods directly affects the accuracy of canopy height estimation.To optimize threshold settings and identify suitable waveform metrics calculation methods, this study focused on the northern forest region of China, using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as a reference to evaluate TECIS canopy height estimation approaches. First, effective TECIS footprints were selected and spatially matched with ALS data. Then, 24 waveform threshold combinations and 3 metrics calculation methods were applied to derive waveform metrics, and the bias between the Relative Height (RH) metrics and ALS percentile heights was analysed. Subsequently, seven sets of waveform metrics were used to construct linear regression models for estimating the 99th percentile ALS height (P99), representing the observed maximum canopy height. Finally, the bias between RH100 and ALS P99 under different conditions was evaluated.The results showed that using a six-times start signal threshold and a twelve-times end signal threshold, combined with RH metrics calculated based on waveform decomposition and signal cut-off points, yielded the highest consistency with ALS height data. For RH metrics calculated based solely on signal cut-off points, stricter threshold settings—especially at the signal end—resulted in better agreement. In ALS P99 regression modelling, the optimal waveform metrics model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.86 when slope was not considered. Under low-slope, medium canopy cover, and night-time data acquisition conditions, the estimation bias was further reduced.This study provides a new perspective from a signal processing standpoint for improving TECIS waveform-based canopy height estimation. The findings are expected to support the development of TECIS canopy height products and promote large-scale application of wide-footprint waveform LiDAR data."

 Wars profoundly affect air quality due to infrastructure loss, military activities, and population displacement; nevertheless, limited studies have thoroughly examined these impacts by remote sensing, with most offering broad evaluations lacking geographical correlation to particular damage. This study presents a novel method that combines Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD) with air quality data from satellites to examine the environmental effects of military actions. In this study, InSAR CCD was utilized to detect damaged areas during military operations. Focusing on the war in the Palestinian Gaza Strip following the 7 October 2023 attacks, the research investigates changes in key air quality indicators (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, HCHO, CH4, CO, and UVAI) over the first six months of conflict. Air pollution levels during the war were compared to the same period in the previous year to identify wartime-related shifts. Information from InSAR coherence was collected during the six months of war and compared to the air quality data by segmenting the study time into 18 different periods. Results reveal distinct shifts in pollutant correlations with coherence, indicating war-induced environmental degradation. PM2.5 and CO exhibited a reversal from positive to negative correlations post-conflict onset (Pearson’s r: +0.122 to −0.195 and +0.089 to −0.118, respectively), linking destruction to increased particulate and carbon monoxide emissions. CH4 and HCHO correlations similarly inverted after Israel’s full-scale land invasion (Kendall’s τ: +0.125 to −0.096 and +0.062 to −0.080, respectively). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, used for spatiotemporal analysis, pinpointed pollution hotspots that corresponded with the operational phases of the IDF. This study advances conflict-environment research by coupling InSAR coherence with air quality dynamics, offering a replicable framework for wartime pollution assessment. Findings emphasize the need to implement conflict-sensitive environmental policies and open-source high-resolution satellite monitoring in war zones."

 Near-infrared (NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing are primary methods for monitoring large-scale, high-resolution precipitable water vapor (PWV); however, their application is limited to clear-sky conditions. To overcome this limitation and enable all-weather PWV retrieval, this study develops a new satellite-based PWV retrieval model to derive all-weather PWV at a spatial resolution of 300 m based on the synergistic use of NIR and TIR data from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instruments onboard the Sentinel-3B satellite. The proposed model consists of two sub-models for PWV derivation: one each for clear- and cloudy-sky conditions. The clear-sky PWV retrieval model integrates water vapor information from both NIR and TIR observations, whereas the cloudy-sky PWV retrieval model uses cloud-top properties derived from TIR data to correct the NIR water vapor within or above the clouds to the ground. Tested against the GNSS PWV, the new model has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.01 mm and bias of 0.09 mm for clear-sky conditions, representing a 51 % improvement in accuracy over the operational OLCI NIR products. For cloudy-sky conditions, the RMSE and bias are 2.66 mm and 0.02 mm, respectively, thereby filling the gap in high-quality PWV retrieval products under cloudy-sky conditions. The combined all-weather PWV product demonstrates robust spatiotemporal performance, with an RMSE and Bias of 1.92 mm and 0.16 mm, respectively. Given that the GNSS PWV has an accuracy of 1.37 mm, the accuracy achieved in this study is satisfactory."

 Intertidal zones are home to critical ecosystems that provide a wide range of ecological, social and economic benefits, but are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic pressures. This study aims to develop a robust methodology for mapping and analysing these areas using satellite imagery, focusing on the creation of a new spectral index specifically designed for zoning marsh ecosystems. The methodology involves selecting optimal satellite data, correcting for solar reflectance, identifying intertidal pixels using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and classifying these zones into categories such as seagrass beds, mudflats, low marsh and high marsh. By comparing the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets, the research addresses common challenges in land cover mapping of intertidal environments — such as cloud cover, reflectance variability and tidal influences. The Bay of Cádiz (south-west Spain), with its extensive intertidal areas characterised by diverse habitats such as mudflats, marshes and seagrass beds, serves as an ideal case study for understanding coastal dynamics driven by tidal cycles. The results highlight the usefulness of the proposed spectral index in assessing changes in intertidal habitats over time, achieving classification accuracies of up to 93.6%, and supporting long-term monitoring efforts that are crucial for coastal conservation strategies. By refining intertidal mapping techniques and improving the detection of specific land cover classes, this research addresses existing methodological gaps and provides valuable insights for local coastal management. In future work, the methodology could be adapted to other intertidal systems and integrated with additional data sources to simulate future scenarios under sea level rise or extreme events.

 Elemental Carbon (EC) and Organic Carbon (OC) are critical components of PM2.5, with significant implications for air quality and public health. Traditional prediction models often fail to capture the non-linear dynamics of EC and OC, particularly in urban environments with high traffic and industrial emissions. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to account for temporal dependencies, meteorological factors, and co-pollutants (PM2.5, O3). Using comprehensive air quality and meteorological data from Changshu City, we identify distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns of EC and OC, driven by traffic emissions, weather conditions, and secondary aerosol formation. The proposed model significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving high prediction accuracy for both EC and OC concentrations. Key innovations include the integration of attention mechanisms to prioritize critical time steps and the incorporation of meteorological features and co-pollutants, which enhance the model's ability to capture complex pollutant interactions. The results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-time air quality forecasting, providing actionable insights for urban planning and pollution mitigation strategies.

 Owing to a high nonlinear dynamic relationship between the precursors of NOx-VOCs and O3 formation in actual atmospheric conditions, traditional approaches—such as empirical kinetic models and air quality models—struggle to accurately quantify the hour-scale relative contributions of VOCs to O3 production. Chemical industrial parks have become a critical challenge for ozone pollution control due to their high variability in emission intensities and types. This study aims to elucidate the real-time, hourly-scale relative contributions of alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and OVOCs to O3 formation. By integrating Coupled Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (CDFA) with the Ozone Formation Potential (OFP) model, this research analyzes 12 months of VOC composition data collected in 2023 from a chemical industrial park. OFP analysis reveals that the contributions to O3 formation followed an order of aromatics > OVOCs > alkanes > alkenes during non-O3 pollution periods, which was consistent with the results from O3 pollution days. A different trend was found from the results of CDFA analysis, with an order of aromatics > OVOCs > alkenes > alkanes. Importantly, evidence from the OFP not only verified the high effectiveness of the CDFA method, but also successfully revealed the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of VOC contributions with different types. This study pioneers a novel application of CDFA, enabling precise quantification of the real-time contributions of various VOC species to O3 formation.

 Marine microorganisms, widely distributed in seawater, can be transferred into the atmosphere through sea spray aerosols (SSA) generated by the bursting of bubbles. Considering the vast oceanic coverage on Earth, this process has significant climatic implications on regional and global scales, particularly under the influence of global warming. Using a self-constructed sea spray aerosol generation tank (SAGT), we simulated SSA production with seawater of varying salinities to investigate the transfer and enrichment of microorganisms in SSA. Our results confirm that microorganisms can be enriched in SSA. The microbial enrichment was size-dependent, with elevated enrichment factors observed in fine particles. Chlorophyll a, a proxy for marine primary production, demonstrated a significant positive correlation with microbial enrichment in submicron SSA, indicating the influence of marine biological activities. Additionally, salinity was found to play a critical role, with high salinity promoting the enrichment of microbes in SSA. Microbial cell growth in seawater should also be considered when assessing marine microbial contributions. We estimated the emission fluxes of microbial carbon via SSA production from low and high salinity seawater, and a global annual emission of marine microbes was estimated in the range of 0.68–2.50 Gg yr−1.

 Drought is increasingly recognized as a severe global risk, yet the ability to predict drought remains limited, particularly in capturing early warning signals. This study breaks through the limitations of existing drought prediction by combining causal inference and multiple machine learning models from an energy perspective, as well as designing adaptive preference algorithms to establish a framework for the dynamic identification of drought propensity, which is applied to the United States, Argentina, Congo, and the Yangtze River Basin. The findings reveal a causal lag effect (4–12 months) between surface energy flux fluctuations and drought. The ability of energy fluxes to predict drought index and identify drought propensity is different in different regions and different models, which may be affected by climatic diversity. Models for the United States and Argentina achieved R2 values of 0.85–0.91, with drought propensity identification accuracy reaching up to 80 %. In contrast, the Yangtze River Basin showed lower performance, with an accuracy of 56 %. Furthermore, the energy dominant factors in different regions vary significantly. Their energy thresholds (such as the net radiation of the United States at 132.87 W/m2 and the latent heat flux of the Yangtze River at 108.50 W/m2) and their action directions reveal the essential differences in the land-air energy distribution mechanisms in different regions.

 As an important indicator of pollution in environment, the distribution of PM2.5 (Particulate Matter) concentration provide an important basis for management and protection of the environment. In April 2022, the first Chinese atmospheric environment monitoring satellite DQ-1 was successfully launched, with an Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL) as its main payload. The ACDL is a High Spectral Resolution Lidar, which can provide full-time, high-precision global cloud and aerosol optical properties vertical profiles of aerosol and cloud data. This study developed a retrieval algorithm for near-surface PM2.5 concentration in China by using the ACDL aerosol optical properties products, reanalysis model data, and near-surface meteorological auxiliary data. A modified multiple linear regression (MMLR) model was developed, with considering the nonlinear effect of relative humidity on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. Taking into account the variability of PM2.5 sources and the domination of aerosol types over different regions of China, a sub-regional analysis was conducted which delineated the aggregation area into region I to VI. The data from June to December 2022 was selected, while three distinct time periods (period-JJ, period-ASO and period-ND) were defined. The regional retrieval model formulas were obtained by fitting iterations and then were cross-validated. The averaged Pearson correlation coefficient (R) in the period-JJ, period-ASO and period-ND are 0.65, 0.64, 0.80, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) are 5.61 μg/m3, 5.46 μg/m3, 16.56 μg/m3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) are 4.66 μg/m3, 4.43 μg/m3, 13.78 μg/m3, respectively. The value of R is higher than 0.70 in most sub-regions. Consequently, the findings indicate that the estimation of PM2.5 concentration is reliable based on the ACDL data products. Finally, the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 from June to December 2022 in China were analyzed. The ACDL is a valuable data source for the future observations of pollutant concentration."

 Spatially and temporally enhanced satellite precipitation products (SPPs) from the GPM mission offer a viable alternative to ground-based measurements. Although the SPPs have been extensively evaluated at specific time scales, such as hourly and daily, the temporally continuity feature of precipitation events is often overlooked. This study assessed and intercompared the performance of six GPM hourly SSPs, i.e. Early, Late and Final from IMERG, and NRT, MVK, NRT_GC (hereafter GC) from GSMaP, focusing on capturing three key precipitation properties (i.e. depth, duration and intensity) along with peak magnitude and timing, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their capability and potential for precipitation monitoring and related hydrometeorological applications. The minimum inter-event time (MIT) approach, with a range of threshold values (i.e. 1, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h), was adopted to delineate precipitation events for the SSPs and the reference data (site observations and CLDAS datasets). IMERG and GSMaP products revealed their respective strengths in detection capacity of precipitation events, with IMERG achieving lower FAR and GSMaP showing higher POD. Despite comparable capabilities in estimating the depth of precipitation events by all the SPPs, IMERG products tended to be more effective in characterizing precipitation intensity and event peak while GSMaP better identified event duration. Notably, near/post real-time products outperformed gauge-corrected versions in certain aspects. Early was more capable of capturing event-based precipitation properties compared to the other IMERG products, especially for shorter MITs, suggesting the potential of near-real-time products in precipitation monitoring and early warning of associated hazards. In addition, MVK excelled in characterizing event duration, intensity, and peak magnitude within the GSMaP system, revealing the possible effectiveness of gauge-free satellite retrieval algorithms. Subregion analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm demonstrated the integrated influence of multiple factors on the performance of the SPPs, also with region-dependent sensitivity to a specific factor. The findings obtained from this study could provide new insights into the practical application and possible further enhancement of the GPM SPPs."

 This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets in representing key meteorological parameters consisting of air temperature, mean sea level pressure, and relative humidity across Türkiye between 2010 and 2023. By comparing reanalysis data to observations from 116 meteorological stations, the analysis provides critical insights into their spatial and seasonal accuracy, revealing notable strengths and limitations. The findings confirm that ERA5 consistently outperforms MERRA-2 across all three parameters, exhibiting higher determination coefficients (R2), lower root mean square errors (RMSE), and reduced mean bias errors (MBE), particularly for air temperature and relative humidity. ERA5 demonstrated superior performance in temperature representation, with seasonal R2 values ranging from 0.85 to 0.91, while MERRA-2 exhibited lower performance, ranging from 0.75 to 0.86. Similarly, ERA5 outperformed MERRA-2 in relative humidity estimation, achieving R2 values between 0.50 and 0.75, compared to MERRA-2's lower range of 0.33 to 0.62. Both datasets performed comparably for mean sea level pressure; however, ERA5 achieved slightly lower RMSE and MBE values, particularly in winter and regions with complex topography, where MERRA-2 systematically underestimated pressure. The seasonal and spatial analyses highlight ERA5's finer spatial resolution and enable a more accurate representation of meteorological variability, particularly in topographically complex and coastal regions. Its reduced systematic biases and improved accuracy in transitional seasons underscore its suitability for high-resolution applications, such as urban climate modeling, air quality research, and hydrological simulations. Conversely, MERRA-2, with its coarser grid and pronounced biases in colder months, remains suitable for broader-scale climatological studies but may require bias correction for localized applications."

 Atmospheric heatwave events have substantial socioeconomic impacts, which have been widely studied under global climate change. This study investigates the characteristics and differences between long-lived and short-lived heatwave events (LHWs and SHWs). First, we identify heatwave events over the Western North America (WNA) over 1981–2022 and categorize them based on the 90th percentile of their duration parameter. Then, we reveal that the LHWs exhibit stronger surface warming with a stronger and thicker warm layer. Circulation anomalies show an anomalous ridge above the WNA, which is more persistent with a greater central value of positive geopotential height anomalies for LHWs. Furthermore, we reveal the important role of mid-to-high-latitude teleconnection in maintaining the LHWs. We find that the diabatic heating released by increased precipitation near Japan can excite Rossby wave trains crossing the Pacific Ocean, and then reach North America, which contributes to maintaining the anomalous ridge of LHWs. Moreover, positive diabatic heating anomalies, related to land-atmosphere interaction, in Central Siberia are also favorable for the generation or persistence of the anomalous ridge and thus the LHWs. Finally, we validate the above teleconnection mechanisms by using the linear baroclinic model and Community Atmosphere Model 5.0 model. By comparison, there is negligible cross-Pacific propagation of Rossby wave energy before the peak of SHWs. This study presents evidence of climate linkages of East Asia and Central Siberia with WNA, which may provide potential predictability for LHWs over the WNA."

 The Mentawai Islands, located in the eastern Indian Ocean approximately 150 km west of Sumatera, experience precipitation patterns heavily influenced by the eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This study investigates the impact of the MJO on local precipitation patterns, with a specific focus on diurnal cycles, during the rainy season (November–March, NDJFM). The analysis is based on Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data spanning from 2000 to 2022. It emphasizes diurnal patterns through the lens of precipitation amount (PA), precipitation frequency (PF), and precipitation intensity (PI). The size of the islands strongly shapes the diurnal precipitation patterns during the rainy season. On Siberut, the largest island, two pronounce precipitation peaks are observed: one in the afternoon (15 LST) and another in the early morning (04 LST). Two precipitation peaks were also observed in South Pagai, with an earlier early morning peak (02 LST) and an early afternoon peak (13 LST), exhibiting weaker afternoon peak values compared to those in Siberut. The early afternoon precipitation peak on larger islands suggests a dominant role of local convection in the diurnal precipitation system of the Mentawai Islands. In contrast, the smaller islands—Sipora and North Pagai—exhibit a single precipitation peak at 02 LST, dominated primarily by offshore precipitation propagation from Sumatera. The presence of the Mentawai Islands has been observed to disrupt the offshore propagation of convective systems during nighttime, as indicated by the disruption of PI propagation. However, this disruption becomes negligible when nighttime low-level winds from Sumatera strengthen during MJO phases 2–3. During these enhanced phases, the intensified offshore propagation from Sumatera significantly impacts both the peak values and timings of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai Islands. The enhancement of offshore precipitation propagation during phases 2–3 shifts the peak timing of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai mainland forward by 2 h. This shift in peak timing is particularly pronounced on the smaller islands, where stronger low-level winds associated with the MJO enhance precipitation propagation toward the Mentawai Islands. Understanding the MJO's influence on precipitation patterns in this region is critical for improving weather prediction models and enhancing preparedness for extreme weather events."

 The present study investigates the temporal variation in the connection between Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) during 1980–2023. The ISMR shows an insignificant correlation with the preceding October–November–December–January (OND(−1)J(0)) Greenland Sea SIC (GSSIC) during 1980–2001, whereas the relationship turns to be significant positive during 2002–2023. During this latter period, the increasing GSSIC in preceding OND(−1)J(0) can exert wave trains that travel from North Atlantic to northeast Pacific, inducing anomalous anticyclone and cyclone over northeast of Hawaii and southwest of Mexico, respectively. This, in turn, generates a dipole sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) over northeast Pacific, with positive SSTA northeast of Hawaii and negative SSTA southwest of Mexico. The Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback helps maintain this dipole SSTA through to the following June–July–August–September, contributing to the negative SSTA over north central tropical Pacific (NCTP). The negative NCTP SSTA can induce anomalous ascending motion over the western Pacific–Indian Ocean by modulating Walker circulation, ultimately leading to increase ISMR. In contrast, during 1980–2001, GSSIC shows stronger co-variation with North Atlantic dipole (NAD) SSTA compared with that during 2002–2023. Due to the response of atmospheric circulation anomalies to the GSSIC are nearly opposite to those in terms of the NAD SSTA, the influence of the GSSIC anomalies on the wave trains over Northern Hemisphere is disturbed. Therefore, the GSSIC anomalies can slightly impact on the SSTA over northeast Pacific, resulting in weaker GSSIC-ISMR relationship."

 Using radar observation data together with ERA5 reanalysis data, this study exposes the mesocyclone characteristics of supercells associated with extreme flash heavy rainfall (FHR, hourly rainfall intensity ≥50 mm) in Jiangsu Province of China during 2020–2021, and reveals their differences from other severe supercells associated with convective hazards such as hail, gales and tornadoes. The results show that most FHR supercells occur in July and August, seasonally later than hail supercells or gale supercells in this region. During the warm season, FHR supercells generally move eastward led by westerly flow since most of them appear along the north edge of the western Pacific subtropical high. Half of FHR supercell mesocyclones sustain only about 2–3 radar volume scans (12–18 min). Most extreme FHR supercells are embedded in mesoscale convective systems and are triggered at more favorable locations where more abundant moisture converges and stronger low-level vertical wind shear is produced. In comparison, the developing extreme FHR supercell generally needs more abundant moisture but not as much higher convective available potential energy or stronger vertical wind shear as hail or gale supercells. In terms of mesocyclone characteristics, tornadic supercells exhibit the strongest rotation intensity, followed by gale and hail supercells, and FHR supercells possess the weakest rotation intensity. Hail supercells have the largest storm diameter, deepest mesocyclone, and highest elevation of strongest rotation, followed by gale supercells, FHR supercells and tornadic supercells. These differences are possibly related to the distinct formation mechanisms of the various severe convective phenomena induced by supercell: hail grows in lower ambient temperature and therefore corresponds to the highest vertical extension of supercell; the majority of convective windstorms in the Yangtze-Huai River region is associated with mid-upper-level dry air entraining into the storm and triggering a strong evaporative effect; and the definition of a tornadic supercell implies that the least diameter and the strongest rotation must approach ground. In contrast, most FHR events in this region are linked to warm-rain processes."

 Drought will cause huge losses to humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the factors that control drought, and the changes that cause it in the context of global warming. Although drought is controlled by multiple factors, few studies have comprehensively considered the multiple controlling factors' effects at different time scales. For the Haihe River Basin (northern China), we investigated trends in meteorological drought and associated meteorological and atmospheric circulation factors for 1960–2017 using Mann-Kendall tests and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis. Multiple wavelet coherence analysis was used to examine the multiple factors' combined effects at different time scales. The Standard Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, an index of drought, decreased by 0.138 per decade, and the climate became warmer and drier over the 58 years. The meteorological factors with the greatest influence on drought were relative humidity (RH), the combination of mean temperature (Tmean) and RH, and the combination of Tmean, RH, and sunshine duration. Atmospheric circulation factors most affecting drought were the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the combination of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and AO, and the combination of AO, PDO, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

 Typhoon-induced heavy rainfall can lead to severe flooding, causing significant damage to social systems. Although machine learning (ML) offers an efficient approach for typhoon rainfall forecasting, individual models often exhibit considerable uncertainty. To address this, this study proposes a robust typhoon rainfall forecasting model based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) with four ML models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) across 0–6 h lead time. The model incorporates three types of features within the typhoon impact area (radius of 400 km): typhoon characteristics, grid spatial attributes and meteorological characteristics. Typhoon characteristics of each grid are dynamically weighted to reflect the weakening typhoon impacts with increasing distance from the typhoon center. Based on these features, multiple scenarios consisting of two experiments (Input Unchanged (IU) and Rolling Forecast (RO)) paired with various input designs (ALL: all features, SHAP3: 3 most critical variables, and LAG4: 4 lagged rainfall) are designed to explore the performance of all models. Case study of 28 typhoons affecting Guangdong Province from 2020 to 2023 clearly demonstrated that the weighted typhoon wind speed contributed the most in typhoon rainfall forecasting, and the BMA approach significantly enhanced the forecast accuracy. Leveraging sufficient effective information as model inputs could significantly improve the predictive performance of individual models in long-term forecasting. This method could provide flexible and suitable scenario options for data-rich and data-scarce regions, supporting early disaster warning during typhoon-prone seasons."

 On 8 August 2022, a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS) produced prolonged extreme rainfall (> 100 mm h−1) over the Seoul metropolitan area, Republic of Korea. These organized convective systems, primarily composed of convective components with interspersed stratiform elements, are characterized by the successive local generations of convective cells. This study analyzes data from multiple observational platforms to understand the formation of the MCS and its microphysical evolution. The convective cells were initiated just off the west coast near Seoul, along the boundary between warm and cold air masses. Low-level convergence and favorable environmental conditions, including low lifting condensation level, level of free convection, and large convective available potential energy, facilitated the triggering of these cells. As the cells moved inland, they intensified rapidly due to the land-sea surface-friction contrast. Radar data show that as the MCS matured, reflectivity increased and the differential reflectivity decreased downward above the melting level, indicating the growth of ice crystals and graupels. The evolution of microphysical structure led to increases in both the mean diameter (Dm) and the number concentration (NT) of raindrops. This observation also suggests that the rainfall intensity was more closely related to the increase in NT than Dm during the period of heavy downpours. This study improves our understanding of the mesoscale processes related to extreme rainfall in Korea, critical for forecasting local heavy rainfall."

 Anthropogenic influence have led to an increase in the frequency of compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) globally under the background of global warming. However, there is limited research on the extent of anthropogenic influence on the spatial extent of CDHEs. Our analysis, focusing on the changes in the affected area of CDHEs across the global land during the warm season from 1961 to 2013, indicates an increasing trend in both hemispheres and six continents, with the most obviously increases observed in the Northern Hemisphere (15.8 %/53 yr), Asia (16 %/53 yr), and Africa (14 %/53 yr). Using the optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution analysis, we found that the anthropogenic signal was robustly detected in all regions except Oceania. The greenhouse gases emission played a major role in the observed increasing trends in all regions except Oceania. Furthermore, we conducted an event attribution analysis for the 2022–like CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere, finding that nearly 95 %, 91 %, and 89 % of the trends in the Northern Hemisphere, Asia, and Europe, respectively, could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using the attribution result, we constrained projections of spatial extent of CDHEs under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 emission scenarios. The constrained projections show a smaller increasing magnitude compared to the raw projections (except for Asia), with the largest differences observed in South America in the Southern Hemisphere. By 2100, the CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere are projected to reach 43 % and 68 % under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios, respectively. Asia faces the most widespread impact from CHDEs, with more than 93 % under the SSP5–8.5 scenario and 56 % under the SSP2–4.5 scenario. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has huge benefits for better mitigating the impacts of CDHEs across the global land."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108211,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注冷空气爆发期间平流层积云向积云的转变过程，以及气溶胶在此转变过程中的作用。论文通过数值模拟，探讨了不同气溶胶方案对云层形态、降水起始时间和强度的影响。虽然气溶胶是大气成分的一部分，但该研究的重点在于云物理过程和气溶胶对这些过程的影响，而不是使用遥感技术（如卫星观测）来监测大气环境或分析大气成分。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['aerosols', 'cloud droplet number concentrations', 'stratocumulus to cumulus transition', 'cold air outbreaks', 'sea salt particles', 'liquid water content', 'sulfate availability', 'sea-spray availability', 'new particle formation']",Elissavet Bossioli;Georgia Sotiropoulou;Michail Karalis;Steven J. Abel,A stratocumulus to cumulus transition during a cold-air outbreak: The role of aerosols,"•Mesoscale simulations using prognostic cloud droplets successfully simulate the SCT. •The sectional scheme simulates the aerosol ultra-clean layer after the breakup. •The modal scheme simulates more accurately the cloud cover and the LWP. •Sea salt particles enhance liquid precipitation in the sectional scheme. 
 Cold air outbreaks (CAOs) are phenomena that occur across high latitudes during winter months and favor the development of extensive boundary layer clouds. As the boundary layer evolves, changes in cloud morphology often result in a stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT). The onset of precipitation is considered to be a key factor that leads to the break-up of the stratocumulus deck. In this modeling study we investigate the additional role that aerosols have on the SCT within a CAO event in the North Atlantic, by using prognostic fields for both aerosols and cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd). By using two chemical/aerosol schemes we assess and quantify the impact of aerosols on the SCT evolution. Our results indicate that the aerosol load and its chemical composition affect the timing of precipitation initiation and its magnitude and thus the break-up. However, the two schemes reveal contradictory results, which are mainly associated with different aerosol size and chemical composition partitioning between modes and bins. The simulations with the aerosol scheme, which considers the modal approach, show that the reduction of Nd across the SCT is driven by changes in the cloud liquid water content, the sulfate availability, and the fine sea-spray availability in the cumulus region, which suppresses sulfate activation. The Nd decreases mostly follow the decrease in accumulation-mode aerosols. For the scheme that considers the sectional approach, both the stratiform and the cumulus clouds appear sensitive to new particles formation and their competition for water. However, in the cumulus region, the higher updrafts and the greater availability of fine sea salt particles become critical for the activation of small particles. New particle formation and background sulfate concentrations are critical in this pristine environment, while sea salt particles have a significant impact on SCT in both sets of simulations."

 This study examines the mean annual cycles of monthly cumulated fog-water amounts (CFW) in the central Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (MIP), highlighting the interplay between meteorological conditions, topography, and geographic location. Seasonal asymmetry in fog-water collection is evident, with summer exhibiting higher fog collection frequency but lower water volumes. In contrast, non-summer seasons feature lower frequency but higher intensity fog events.Tropospheric circulation anomalies at mid- and low-tropospheric levels reveal that fog-water collection is influenced by moisture transport from the Mediterranean, particularly during high fog-collection months. Positive specific humidity anomalies near coastal areas, driven by southeasterly wind anomalies, are crucial for frequent fog formation, while broader, less concentrated anomalies characterize higher-intensity fog events. These findings align with prior research emphasizing the role of cyclonic conditions and maritime moisture advection in enhancing fog-water collection yields.Additionally, seasonal variations in tropospheric circulation anomalies are linked to large-scale teleconnection patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia (EAWR) patterns. These modulate moisture advection, precipitation anomalies, and low-level winds that drive fog formation and collection. In summer, subtropical high-pressure weakening contributes to increased fog-water cumulates, while winter anomalies highlight the impact of quasi-stationary cyclonic circulations and autumn anomalies, positive NAO/AO phases.These results underscore the climatic importance of fog-water collection for water resource management in drought-prone regions and provide a foundation for future climate monitoring and prediction under anthropogenic radiative forcing. The study's insights have practical implications for enhancing water availability through fog collection in Mediterranean ecosystems."
