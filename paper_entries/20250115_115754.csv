10.1088/1748-9326/ad9c98,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文利用MODIS卫星数据研究了吉尔吉斯斯坦2001年至2021年期间雪盖季节性的变化。文章关注的是雪季开始日期、结束日期、持续时间和积雪日数四个指标，分析了不同海拔高度和行政区域的趋势。研究发现，低海拔地区雪季开始日期提前，但雪季持续时间变长，这与预期结果有所不同。研究方法上，采用了非参数方法来分析趋势，并设置了严格的标准来减少假阳性结果。总的来说，这项研究利用遥感技术，定量分析了气候变化对山区积雪的影响，为理解气候变化和水文循环提供了重要信息。,"['snow cover', 'snow seasonality', 'satellite observation', 'MODIS', 'remote sensing', 'climate change', 'Kyrgyzstan']",Geoffrey M Henebry;Monika A Tomaszewska,Snow-cover seasonality in Kyrgyzstan: variation and change over 20 years (2001–2021) as observed by the MODIS Terra snow product,"Snow seasonality is expected to change as a result of planetary warming. Yet, how the timings of snow seasons have already shifted in mountain environments can be counterintuitive. Here, we update our 2018 analyses of snow seasonality in Kyrgyzstan (KG) using more data and improved methods. Using two decades of MODIS snow-cover data, we investigated trends in four snow seasonality metrics: first date of snow (FDoS); last date of snow (LDoS); duration of the snow season (DoSS); and snow-covered days (SCDs). Our novel but conservative nonparametric approach analyzed trends within elevation ranges at two administrative levels: oblast and rayon. To attenuate the risk of false-positive trends, we reported as ‘notable’ only those significant (p < 0.05) nonparametric trends that were also (i) strongly asymmetric (at least twice as many significant pixels in one direction) within an elevational range of the oblast or rayon and (ii) covering at least 5% of the elevation range in oblast or rayon and more than 10 pixels. We used both simple and advanced snow-cover metrics, with the latter exploiting the within-composite chronobyte detail available in the MOD10A2.061 product. We found notable trends to earlier FDoS below 3000 m in western KG and more SCD between 1500–3500 m in western KG. We also found the expected notable trends towards earlier LDoS at both oblast and rayon levels. In northwestern KG, DoSS was notably longer <3000 m, but notably shorter at 3500–4000 m. In our 2018 analyses, we found at the national level 160% more area trending to earlier FDoS than to earlier LDoS. Our comprehensive updated trend analysis was designed to be more conservative. It revealed more area (106%–130%) trending to earlier FDoS than earlier LDoS, reinforcing the counterintuitive finding of longer snow seasons starting earlier at lower elevations."

However, during the transition to a clean energy system, the production of H2 with electrolysis runs the risk of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions if the electricity system is still partly based on fossil fuels. The European Union has set ambitious targets for the production of H2 and defined strict rules in delegated acts to the renewable energy directive, when H2 produced with public grid electricity can be counted as renewable. This paper analyzes two grid criteria central to these rules, renewable energy share and CO2 emission intensity, in several future scenarios of the European energy system. By uniquely focusing on the impact of H2 production from the perspective of EU grid criteria, this study offers a novel assessment of how these regulations interact with the evolving energy landscape. Fulfillment of the renewable H2 grid criteria strongly depends on the future build-out of renewable energy resources, electricity demand, and amount of domestically produced H2. In a scenario with ambitious renewable build-out until 2030, represented by current drafts of national energy and climate plans, many countries will meet the stated criteria. However, adding a high amount of domestically produced H2 partly cancels out this effect. In a scenario with reduced renewable build-outs, comparable to historically achieved renewable resource additions, many fewer countries achieve the grid criteria. Finally, net CO2 emission reductions are analyzed by comparing power sector emission changes with the opportunity emissions that result from fossil fuels replacements with H2. The results indicate that using H2 in CO2 intensive use cases can lead to emission reductions, even if grid criteria are below the thresholds defined in the delegated acts. However, reduced renewable energy expansion poses the risk of not achieving any emission reductions at all with the produced H2."

This study investigates spruce forest productivity using in-situ field observations (DendroNetwork) and satellite remote sensing (RS) data in the Czech Republic during the past two decades. Tree growth index and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer net primary productivity were used to assess productivity at the national scale along an elevation gradient. The analyses of spatiotemporal variation in carbon dynamics indicate a decreasing trend in productivity in 51% and 80% (2800 km2 and 4200 km2) of the spruce stands from the RS and in-situ data, respectively. The increasing trend is particularly evident in montane regions, where satellite data identified an elevation threshold around 900 m a.s.l. while in-situ data 700 m a.s.l. In these energy-limited montane areas, NS may benefit from increased temperatures and may remain relatively safe from drought stress. The decreasing trends detected by both approaches indicate deteriorating conditions for NS in lower elevations. This study suggests that combining in-situ and RS data provides an efficient and robust way to estimate forest productivity at the national scale. The anticipated response of spruce forests associated with declines in productivity and growth in areas with low to moderate elevation points to the adverse effects of climate change by shifting the ecological optimum to higher elevations. We conclude that detailed mapping of forest response to changing environmental conditions is critical to support sustainable forest management and decision-making, ultimately reflecting the need to adopt adequate strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and related natural and anthropogenic disturbances."

This study, using Nepal as a case study, investigated the spatial and temporal impacts of hydro-climatic factors on leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP), as well as the coupling degree of GPP-LAI expressed as the correlation coefficient (R2) of these trends from 2003 to 2020. The results indicated both GPP and LAI increased significantly more during the dry season than the rainy season in Nepal, but the coupling degree of GPP-LAI in Nepal showed distinct seasonal and elevational differences. Relative to low coupling degree in high and low elevation regions, a higher yet gradually decreasing coupling degree was demonstrated in the mid high regions of central Nepal. By analyzing the effects of elevational profiles, this study revealed that temperature and solar radiation exhibited significant negative correlations with GPP in the southern and central forests at mid elevation, while suggesting a positive correlation in the high mountain alpine forests, which mitigated the limiting effects of precipitation constraints on GPP during the dry season. And the decreased temperature and precipitation had negative impacts on treeline deviation, which led to spatial variations in treeline deviation and coupling degree on either side of the 83°E in the Nepalese Himalayan alpine forests. Additionally, trends of shrubland in GPP and LAI growth reflected adaptations to a warmer and wetter climate. The study about spatio-temporal variation in response to warm-wetting climate, affected by seasons and elevations, offers a scientific basis for the adaptation and conservation of alpine vegetation in Nepal."

However, the potential loss of initially captured CO2 during river transport remains poorly constrained, undermining the use of this practice as a carbon mitigation strategy. Here, we present results from a first-of-its-kind dynamic river network (DRN) model designed to quantify the impact of EW on river carbonate chemistry in North American watersheds. We map key water quality parameters using machine learning and use a DRN model to simulate changes in carbon degassing during EW. Our model predicts low carbon loss (<5%) from river networks for many of the river pathways explored here, but significantly higher (>15%) carbon degassing is also observed, indicating that riverine carbon storage and the impacts of EW on river chemistry must be evaluated in a deployment-specific or regional context."

Carbon sources and transformations along the land–ocean aquatic continuum are dynamic with a complex interplay between particulate and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon pools (POC, DOC, DIC). Radiocarbon dating serves as a valuable tool, providing crucial insights into turnover and residence times within these pools. However, the myriad of carbon sources, including ancient ‘petrogenic’ OC from sedimentary rocks or freshly assimilated OC derived from aquatic in-situ production, makes it challenging to interpret 14C signatures in the context of terrestrial biospheric OC turnover and residence times. Icelandic rivers and streams offer an opportunity to examine biospheric carbon dynamics due to the virtual absence of petrogenic OC (e.g., shales, carbonates) in underlying bedrock. Our study of 43 rivers and streams, collectively draining approximately 42% of Iceland’s surface, revealed that radiocarbon signatures of POC largely align with global river patterns but lacked the presence of significantly old (14C-depleted) carbon likely reflecting the absence of ancient petrogenic OC. In contrast, DOC tended to be older compared to global rivers and the corresponding POC and DIC pools in Icelandic rivers. These observations challenge the paradigm that riverine POC generally exhibits longer turnover and residence times than DOC. After excluding other potential factors, we argue that this apparent age inversion among carbon pools in Icelandic rivers may reflect retention of DOC prior to its release to the aquatic continuum through interactions with high surface area minerals prevalent in the volcanic soils of Iceland. This finding may be relevant for other fluvial systems draining volcanic bedrock and have broader implications regarding biospheric OC dynamics in rivers and streams globally."

However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics—including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach—BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering—or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 °C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices."

Severe drought events and human activities, particularly water and land management, have led to emerging dust sources in the last few decades. This study combines spatio-temporal maps of land susceptibility to dust storm incidence with agricultural land use change data to examine the link between farming patterns and dust storm generation in the Tigris and Euphrates Basin from 2000 to 2021. Farmland and bare ground trends depend heavily on water availability, affecting land susceptibility to dust storms. We observed a direct connection between cropping regimes and high land susceptibility to becoming a dust source. Our analysis found no significant correlation between low to intermediate dust storm source (DSS) susceptibility and bare ground trends. However, we found a positive correlation between highly susceptible land and areas where bare ground showed an increasing trend, including the lands that were abandoned for more than 50% of the study period. Among the farming patterns, i.e. single and double cropping, single cropping is more prone to DSS occurrence, underscoring the importance of year-round vegetation cover and effective water management. The disturbed lands, particularly those abandoned post-cropping, show higher susceptibility to DSS incidence. Between 2008 and 2012, dust sources and land susceptibility increased substantially, alongside a significant rise in bare ground, possibly due to severe drought. We highlight cases where changes in farming patterns and land abandonment contribute to the increased or decreased susceptibility of land to being a DSS, as well as consistent susceptibility in the cases where there is no land use change. Given the broad geographical scope of the study, this research underscores the need for further investigation, combining field measurements with remote sensing to obtain a more detailed picture of the link between farming patterns, land abandonment, and dust storms."

The large-scale ability was tested on open-access ALOS-1 data, where a two-fold solution is used to address temporal gap between GEDI and ALOS data. Produced products of 30 m gridded forest height mosaics for the northeastern U.S. and China show improved accuracy at 3–4 m/ha and 20 % enhancement over interpolated GEDI maps. The prototype is promising to fuse GEDI and future NISAR data. 
 This paper presents a global-to-local fusion approach combining spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (InSAR) and LiDAR to create large-scale mosaics of forest stand height. The forest height estimates are derived based on a semi-empirical InSAR scattering model, which links the forest height to repeat-pass InSAR coherence magnitudes. The sparsely yet extensively distributed LiDAR samples provided by Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission enable the parametrization of signal model at a finer spatial scale. The proposed global-to-local fitting strategy allows for efficient use of LiDAR samples to determine adaptive model at reginal scale, leading to improved forest height estimates by integrating InSAR-LiDAR under nearly concurrent acquisition condition. This is supported by fusing the ALOS-2 and GEDI data at several representative forest sites. This approach is further applied to the open-access ALOS InSAR data to evaluate its large-scale mapping capabilities. To address temporal mismatch between the GEDI and ALOS acquisitions, the forest disturbances or deforestation areas are first identified by integrating ALOS-2 backscatter products and GEDI data. Further, a modified signal model is developed and analysed accounting for natural forest growth over temperate forest regions where the intact forest landscape along with forest height remain quite stable and only change slightly as trees grow. In the absence of detailed statistical data on forest growth, the modified signal model can be well approximated using the original model at regional scale via local fitting. To validate this, two forest height mosaic maps based on ALOS-1 data were generated for the entire northeastern regions of United States and China with total area of 18 million and 152 million hectares, respectively. The validation of the forest height estimates demonstrates improved accuracy achieved by the proposed approach compared to the previous efforts i.e., reducing from a 4 m RMSE on the order of 3–6-ha aggregated pixel size to 3.8 m RMSE at 0.8-ha pixel size. This updated fusion approach not only fills in the sparse spatial sampling of individual GEDI footprints, but also improves the accuracy of forest height estimates by 20 % compared to the interpolated GEDI maps. Extensive evaluation of forest height inversion against LVIS LiDAR data indicates an accuracy 3–4 m over flat areas and 4–5 m over hilly areas in the New England region, whereas the forest height estimates over northeastern China are best compared with small footprint LiDAR validation data even at an accuracy of below 3.5 m and with a coefficient of determination, R2, mostly above 0.6. Given the achieved accuracy for forest height estimates, this fusion prototype offers as a cost-effective solution for public users to obtain wall-to-wall forest height maps at large scale using freely accessible spaceborne repeat-pass L-band InSAR (e.g. forthcoming NISAR) and LiDAR (e.g. GEDI) data."

 This paper reports an innovative mass concentration (mascon) solution obtained with the short-arc approach, named “GCL-Mascon2024”, for estimating spatially enhanced mass variations on the Earth's surface by analyzing K-/Ka Band Ranging satellite-to-satellite tracking data collected by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Compared to contemporary GRACE mascon solutions, this contribution has three notable and distinct features: First, this solution recovery process incorporates frequency-dependent data weighting techniques to reduce the influence of low-frequency noise in observations. Second, this solution uses variable-shaped mascon geometry with physical constraints such as coastline and basin boundary geometries to more accurately capture temporal gravity signals while minimizing signal leakage. Finally, we employ a solution regularization scheme that integrates climate factors and cryospheric elevation models to alleviate the ill-posed nature of the GRACE mascon inversion problem. Our research has led to the following conclusions: (a) the temporal signals from GCL-Mascon2024 exhibit 6.5 %−20.4 % lower residuals over the continental regions, as compared with the (Release) RL06 versions of other contemporary mascon solutions from GSFC, CSR, and JPL; (b) in Greenland and global hydrologic basins, the correlation coefficients of estimated mass changes between GCL-Mascon2024 and other RL06 mascon solutions exceed 95.0 %, with comparable amplitudes; especially over non-humid river basins, the GCL-Mascon2024 suppresses random noise by 36.7 % compared to contemporary mascon products; and (c) in desert regions, the analysis of residuals calculated after removing the climatological components from the mass variations indicates that the GCL-Mascon2024 solution achieves noise reductions of over 28.1 % as compared to the GSFC and CSR RL06 mascon solutions.

As grass grid pavers have never been parameterized for microclimate model simulations with ENVI-met, a new parameterization was developed based on field measurements. To analyse the cooling potential, scenario analyses were performed for a densely developed area in Cologne. Statistically significant average cooling effects of up to −11.1 K were found for surface temperature and up to −2.9 K for 1 m air temperature. 
 Many urban areas are characterized by both a growing population and an intensification of summer heat events in the context of climate change. Thus, more and more people are exposed to heat stress and corresponding health consequences. Measures for climate change adaptation, such as unsealing strategies, are needed in the existing urban fabric to reduce sensible heat flux by increasing latent heat flux to cool down the urban environment without requiring additional space or changing the basic function of the area. Unsealing measures like grass grid pavers (GGPs) can also help to reduce flooding risks due to increased infiltration and water storage capacities. Up to now, a parameterization of GGPs for microclimatic simulations is not available. To fill this research gap, we present a new GGP model parameterization developed for the fluid dynamics microclimate ENVI-met model based on field measurements with double-ring infiltrometers, etc., which can also be implemented in other microscale models in the field of urban climatology. To analyse the microclimatic effects and the cooling potential of this GGP parameterization, scenario analyses were performed using a validated ENVI-met model setup for an urban high-density study area in Cologne, Germany. An extreme scenario was designed to address the maximum cooling potential of the GGPs in comparison to the dominant sealed asphalt surfaces in the study area, along with a more realistic scenario with a usage-compatible installation of GGPs in the model domain only in side streets and inner courtyards while main streets remain sealed. We found a maximum cooling potential of up to −20.1 K for ground surface temperature and up to −7.1 K for air temperature at 1 m above ground level for the hottest hour of a simulated 3 d heat wave in summer 2022, which represents a 20-year heat event in Cologne. On spatial average, a decrease of up to −11.1 K for surface temperature and up to −2.9 K for air temperature was determined. On temporal average for the 3 d heat event, statistically significant mean temperature differences of −5.8 K for surface temperature and −1.1 K for air temperature were simulated. Cooling effects are more pronounced during the daytime for surface temperature, especially in unshaded areas, while cooling effects for air temperature are strongest during the nighttime. Model results also show that the entire air volume in the study area is cooled down due to this adaptation measure, even in areas of the domain where no surfaces have been unsealed in the scenario design. The more realistic GGP scenario shows cooling effects of a comparable magnitude to the extreme GGP scenario. Thus, even partial GGP unsealing is an effective adaptation measure for reducing extreme temperatures in cities if water availability is not limited."

The AI-NAOS scheme considers black carbon as fractal aggregates and soil dust as super-spheroids, encapsulated with hygroscopic aerosols. Real-case simulations emphasize the necessity of accurately representing nonspherical and inhomogeneous aerosols in chemical weather models. 
 The Artificial-Intelligence-based Nonspherical Aerosol Optical Scheme (AI-NAOS) is a newly developed aerosol optical module that improves the representation of aerosol optical properties for radiative transfer simulations in atmospheric models. It incorporates the nonsphericity and inhomogeneity (NSIH) of internally mixed aerosol particles through a deep learning method. Specifically, the AI-NAOS considers black carbon (BC) to be fractal aggregates and models soil dust (SD) as super-spheroids, encapsulated partially or completely with hygroscopic aerosols such as sulfate, nitrate, and aerosol water. To obtain AI-NAOS, a database of the optical properties for the models was constructed using the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (IITM), and deep neural networks (DNN) were trained based on this database. In this study, the AI-NAOS was integrated into the mesoscale version 5.1 of Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System with Chinese Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment (GRAPES_Meso5.1/CUACE). Real-case simulations were conducted during a winter with high pollution, comparing BC aerosols evaluated using three schemes with spherical aerosol models (external-mixing, core-shell, and volume-mixing schemes) and the AI-NAOS scheme. The results showed that the NSIH effect led to a moderate estimation of absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) and obvious changes in aerosol radiative effects, shortwave heating rates, temperature profiles, and boundary layer height. The AAOD values based on three spherical schemes were 70.4 %, 125.3 %, and 129.3 % over the Sichuan Basin, benchmarked to AI-NAOS results. Compared to the external-mixing scheme, the direct radiative effect (DRE) induced by the NSIH effect reached +1.6 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and −2.9 W m−2 at the surface. The NSIH effect could enhance the shortwave heating rate, reaching 23 %. Thus, the warming effect at 700 hPa and the cooling effect on the ground were strengthened by 21 % and 13 %, reaching +0.04 and −0.10 K, which led to a change in the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) by −11 m. In addition, the precipitation was inhibited by the NSIH effect, causing a 15 % further decrease. Therefore, the NSIH effects demonstrated their non-negligible impacts and highlighted the importance of incorporating them into chemical weather models."

Thus, existing data sets are transferred into synthetic observations and can be used for satellite calibration–validation studies. 
 The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched in May 2024 carries a novel 94 GHz cloud profiling radar (CPR) with Doppler capability. This work describes the open-source instrument simulator Orbital-Radar, which transforms high-resolution radar data from field observations or forward simulations of numerical models to CPR primary measurements and uncertainties. The transformation accounts for sampling geometry and surface effects. We demonstrate Orbital-Radar's ability to provide realistic CPR views of typical cloud and precipitation scenes. The presented case studies show small-scale convection, marine stratus clouds, and Arctic mixed-phase cloud cases. These results provide valuable insights into the capabilities and challenges of the EarthCARE CPR mission and its advantages over the CloudSat CPR. Finally, Orbital-Radar allows for evaluating kilometre-scale numerical weather prediction models with EarthCARE CPR observations. So, Orbital-Radar can generate calibration and validation (Cal/Val) data sets already pre-launch. Nevertheless, an evaluation of synthetic CPR output data to accurate EarthCARE CPR data is missing."

However, their health risk evaluation is lacking. Herein, three representative LCMs were selected from 74 LCM candidates upon literature review and acute cytotoxicity evaluation, then Mus musculus were exposed to the three LCMs for 42 days at doses of 0.5 and 50 μg/kg/d to investigate hepatotoxicity and mechanisms. Phenotypic and histopathological results showed that the three LCMs (DTMDPB, MeO3bcH, and 5OCB) induced hepatomegaly, and only 5OCB induced fatty liver. DTMDPB and MeO3bcH decreased the total cholesterol (TCHO) and triglyceride (TG) content, whereas 5OCB increased the TCHO, TG, and alanine aminotransferase levels. Transcriptome and molecular docking analysis revealed that DTMDPB induced hepatotoxicity by agonizing the farnesoid X receptor, resulting in the disruption of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, ascorbic acid and antioxidant pathways, and circadian clock homeostasis. MeO3bcH promoted inflammation and altered unsaturated fatty acid, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and circadian rhythm by antagonizing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. 5OCB antagonized peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, leading to fatty liver caused by the disruption of steroid, cholesterol, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways.

However, such compound extremes have not been sufficiently studied, especially during boreal spring. Spring is an important transition season, during which the CTPEEs plays a pivotal role in plant growth and revival of terrestrial ecosystems. This study investigates the spatio‐temporal variation characteristics of spring CTPEEs in China, including warm‐dry, warm‐wet, cold‐dry, and cold‐wet combinations. The compound cold‐wet extreme events occur most frequently, followed by warm‐dry, warm‐wet, and cold‐dry events. The frequency of CTPEEs associated with warm (cold) extremes shows a marked interdecadal increase (decrease) around the mid‐to‐late 1990s. It is found that the interdecadal change in CTPEEs is primarily determined by the variation in temperature extremes. This interdecadal shift coincides with the phase transitions of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). After the mid‐to‐late 1990s, the configuration of a positive AMO and a negative IPO excited atmospheric wave trains over mid‐high latitudes, causing high‐pressure and anticyclonic anomalies over East Asia. This leads to less cloudiness, allowing an increase in downward solar radiation, which enhances surface warming and contributes to an increase (decrease) in warm‐dry and warm‐wet extremes. The above observations are confirmed by the Pacemaker experiments. The results of this study highlight a significant contribution of internal climate variability to interdecadal changes in CTPEEs at the regional scale."

However, there is still controversy regarding the 15N fractionation effects during NO3− formation, leading to uncertain source apportionment. To address this, this study introduces dual oxygen isotopes (∆17O and δ18O) to constrain the 15N fractionation (∆15N‐∆17O/∆15N‐δ18O) of NO3− formation and compare the impact of δ15N‐NOx (∆17O) and δ15N‐NOx (δ18O) on NOx/NO3− source apportionment. Results found significant differences in ∆15N‐∆17O (−3.7 ∼ +16.1‰) and ∆15N‐δ18O (+8.5 ∼ +16.2‰) in haze, reflecting the ∆15N from three pathways (NO2 + OH, NO3 + HC, N2O5 hydrolysis) and two pathways (NO2 + OH and N2O5 hydrolysis), respectively. The 15N fractionation value differences obtained by dual oxygen isotopes increases with the increase of NO3 + HC contribution (0.02–0.65). Additionally, different results of NOx/NO3− sources apportionment were obtained by δ15N‐NOx(∆ $\mathit{{\increment}}$17O) and δ15N‐NOx(δ18O) in NO3 + HC‐induced haze. For example, δ15N‐NOx(∆ $\mathit{{\increment}}$17O) identified coal combustion (46 ± 8%) and biomass burning (32 ± 3%) as major NOx/NO3− sources in Zibo haze. Conversely, δ15N‐NOx(δ18O) revealed mobile sources (55 ± 8%) and biomass burning (22 ± 5%) as main contributors. Evidence from diurnal variation of sources and characteristics of source tracers show that δ15N‐NOx(∆ $\mathit{{\increment}}$17O) analysis is more sensitive and accurate than δ15N‐NOx(δ18O). These results highlight the non‐negligible role of NO3 + HC in 15N fractionation during NO3− formation and provide insight into improving 15N tracing techniques for NOx/NO3− source identification through the constraint of dual oxygen isotopes."

Here, Zou et al. identify GGCX as a key determinant for the adaption of Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine influenza virus to receptor binding. 
 The Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV) possesses the capacity to instigate the next influenza pandemic, owing to its heightened affinity for the human-type α-2,6 sialic acid (SA) receptor. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the switch in receptor binding preferences of EA H1N1 SIV remain elusive. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen utilizing EA H1N1 SIV in porcine kidney cells. Knocking out the enzyme gamma glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) reduces virus replication in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the carboxylation modification of viral haemagglutinin (HA) and the adhesion of progeny viruses, ultimately impeding the replication of EA H1N1 SIV. Furthermore, GGCX is revealed to be the determinant of the D225E substitution of EA H1N1 SIV, and GGCX-medicated carboxylation modification of HA 225E contributes to the receptor binding adaption of EA H1N1 SIV to the α-2,6 SA receptor. Taken together, our CRISPR screen has elucidated a novel function of GGCX in the support of EA H1N1 SIV adaption for binding to α-2,6 SA receptor. Consequently, GGCX emerges as a prospective antiviral target against the infection and transmission of EA H1N1 SIV.

 Investigating the genetic factors influencing human birth weight may lead to biological insights into fetal growth and long-term health. We report analyses of rare variants that impact birth weight when carried by either fetus or mother, using whole exome sequencing data in up to 234,675 participants. Rare protein-truncating and deleterious missense variants are collapsed to perform gene burden tests. We identify 9 genes; 5 with fetal-only effects on birth weight, 1 with maternal-only effects, 3 with both, and observe directionally concordant associations in an independent sample. Four of the genes were previously implicated by GWAS of birth weight. IGF1R and PAPPA2 (fetal and maternal-acting) have known roles in insulin-like growth factor bioavailability and signalling. PPARG, INHBE and ACVR1C (fetal-acting) are involved in adipose tissue regulation, and the latter two also show associations with favourable adiposity patterns in adults. We highlight the dual role of PPARG (fetal-acting) in adipocyte differentiation and placental angiogenesis. NOS3 (fetal and maternal-acting), NRK (fetal), and ADAMTS8 (maternal-acting) have been implicated in placental function and hypertension. To conclude, our analysis of rare coding variants identifies regulators of fetal adipose tissue and fetoplacental angiogenesis as determinants of birth weight, and further evidence for the role of insulin-like growth factors.

This effect is likely to conceal anthropogenic fingerprints until the late-21st century. 
 Storage of anthropogenic heat in the oceans is spatially inhomogeneous, impacting regional climates and human societies. Climate models project enhanced heat storage in the mid-latitude North Pacific (MNP) and much weaker storage in the tropical Pacific. However, the observed heat storage during the past half-century shows a more complex pattern, with limited warming in the MNP and enhanced warming in the northwest tropical Pacific. Here, based on observational datasets, ocean model experiments, and climate models, we show that the emergence of human-induced heat storage is likely postponed in the North Pacific by natural variability until the late-21st century. Specifically, phase shifts of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation have vitally contributed to trends in the North Pacific winds during recent decades. Changes in surface winds drove meridional heat redistribution via Rossby wave dynamics, leading to regional warming and cooling structures and a more complex historical heat storage than models predict. Despite this, enhanced anthropogenic warming has already been emerging in marginal seas along the North Pacific basin rim, for which we shall prepare for the pressing consequences such as increasing marine heatwaves.

 During the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, the dominant mammoth steppe ecosystem across northern Eurasia vanished, in parallel with megafauna extinctions. However, plant extinction patterns are rarely detected due to lack of identifiable fossil records. Here, we introduce a method for detection of plant taxa loss at regional (extirpation) to potentially global scale (extinction) and their causes, as determined from ancient plant DNA metabarcoding in sediment cores (sedaDNA) from lakes in Siberia and Alaska over the past 28,000 years. Overall, potential plant extinctions track changes in temperature, in vegetation, and in megafauna extinctions at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Estimated potential plant extinction rates were 1.7–5.9 extinctions per million species years (E/MSY), above background extinction rates but below modern estimates. Major potential plant extinction events were detected around 17,000 and 9000 years ago which lag maximum vegetation turnover. Our results indicate that herbaceous taxa and taxa contributing less to beta diversity are more vulnerable to extinction. While the robustness of the estimates will increase as DNA reference libraries and ancient sedaDNA data expand, the available data support that plants are more resilient to environmental changes than mammals. Plant extinctions during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition are poorly documented in the fossil record.

Here the authors reveal MRAS, closely related to archetypal RAS, is completely deficient in GTP exchange. 
 Intense research on founding members of the RAS superfamily has defined our understanding of these critical signalling proteins, leading to the premise that small GTPases function as molecular switches dependent on differential nucleotide loading. The closest homologs of H/K/NRAS are the three-member RRAS family, and interest in the MRAS GTPase as a regulator of MAPK activity has recently intensified. We show here that MRAS does not function as a classical switch and is unable to exchange GDP-to-GTP in solution or when tethered to a lipid bilayer. The exchange defect is unaffected by inclusion of the GEF SOS1 and is conserved in a distal ortholog from nematodes. Synthetic activating mutations widely used to study the function of MRAS in a presumed GTP-loaded state do not increase exchange, but instead drive effector binding due to sampling of an activated conformation in the GDP-loaded state. This includes nucleation of the SHOC2-PP1Cα holophosphatase complex. Acquisition of NMR spectra from isotopically labeled MRAS in live cells validated the GTPase remains fully GDP-loaded, even a supposed activated mutant. These data show that RAS GTPases, including those most similar to KRAS, have disparate biochemical activities and challenge current dogma on MRAS, suggesting previous data may need reinterpretation.

 The evolutionary paths taken by each sex within a given species sometimes diverge, resulting in behavioral differences. Given their distinct needs, the mechanism by which each sex learns from a shared experience is still an open question. Here, we reveal sexual dimorphism in learning: C. elegans males do not learn to avoid the pathogenic bacteria PA14 as efficiently and rapidly as hermaphrodites. Notably, neuronal activity following pathogen exposure was dimorphic: hermaphrodites generate robust representations, while males, in line with their behavior, exhibit contrasting representations. Transcriptomic and behavioral analysis revealed that the neuropeptide receptor npr-5, an ortholog of the mammalian NPY/NPF-like receptor, regulates male learning by modulating neuronal activity. Furthermore, we show the dependency of the males’ decision-making on their sexual status and demonstrate the role of npr-5 as a modulator of incoming sensory cues.

Here, the authors demonstrate cross-feeding effects between degraders and non-degraders within such a community, indicating a role of outliers in lignin degradation. 
 Lignin, as the abundant carbon polymer, is essential for carbon cycle and biorefinery. Microorganisms interact to form communities for lignin biodegradation, yet it is a challenge to understand such complex interactions. Here, we develop a coastal lignin-degrading bacterial consortium (LD), through “top-down” enrichment. Sequencing and physiological analyses reveal that LD is dominated by the lignin degrader Pluralibacter gergoviae (>98%), with additional rare non-degraders. Interestingly, LD, cultured in lignin-MB medium, significantly enhances cell growth and lignin degradation as compared to P. gergoviae alone, implying a role of additional outliers. Using genome-scale metabolic models, metabolic profiling and culture experiments, modeling of inter-species interactions between P. gergoviae, Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila and Shewanella putrefaciens, unravels cross-feeding of amino acids, organic acids and alcohols between the degrader and non-degraders. Furthermore, the sub-population ratio is essential to enforce the synergy. Our study highlights the unrecognized role of outliers in lignin degradation.

 Uncertainties in land surface processes notably limit subseasonal heat wave (HW) onset predictions. A better representation of the uncertainties in land surface processes using ensemble prediction methods may be an important way to improve HW onset predictions. However, generating ensemble members that adequately represent land surface process uncertainties, particularly those related to land surface parameters, remains challenging. In this study, a conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameters (CNOP-P) approach was employed to generate ensemble members for representing the uncertainties in land surface processes resulting from parameters. Via six strong and long-lasting HW events over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), HW onset ensemble forecast experiments were conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The performance of the CNOP-P approach and the traditional random parameter perturbation ensemble prediction method was evaluated. The results demonstrate that the deterministic and probabilistic skills of HW onset predictions show greater excellence using the CNOP-P approach, leading to much better predictions of extreme air temperatures than those using the traditional method. This occurred because the ensemble members generated by the CNOP-P method better represented the uncertainties in important land physical processes determining HW onsets over the MLYR, notably vegetation process uncertainties, whereas the ensemble members generated by the random parameter perturbation method could not. This finding suggests that the CNOP-P method is suitable for producing ensemble members that more appropriately represent model uncertainties through more reasonable parameter error characterization."

 This literature review synthesizes the role of soil moisture in regulating carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions (CS-GHG). Soil moisture directly affects photosynthesis, respiration, microbial activity, and soil organic matter dynamics, with optimal levels enhancing carbon storage while extremes, such as drought and flooding, disrupt these processes. A quantitative analysis is provided on the effects of soil moisture on CS-GHG across various ecosystems and climatic conditions, highlighting a “Peak and Decline” pattern for CO₂ emissions at 40% water-filled pore space (WFPS), while CH₄ and N₂O emissions peak at higher levels (60–80% and around 80% WFPS, respectively). The review also examines ecosystem models, discussing how soil moisture dynamics are incorporated to simulate photosynthesis, microbial activity, and nutrient cycling. Sustainable soil moisture management practices, including conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and optimized water management, prove effective in enhancing carbon sequestration and mitigating GHG emissions by maintaining ideal soil moisture levels. The review further emphasizes the importance of advancing multiscale observations and feedback modeling through high-resolution remote sensing and ground-based data integration, as well as hybrid modeling frameworks. The interactive model-experiment framework emerges as a promising approach for linking experimental data with model refinement, enabling continuous improvement of CS-GHG predictions. From a policy perspective, shifting focus from short-term agricultural productivity to long-term carbon sequestration is crucial. Achieving this shift will require financial incentives, robust monitoring systems, and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure sustainable practices effectively contribute to climate mitigation goals."

 Under climate change, China faces intensifying compound extreme events with serious socio-economic ramifications, yet their future variations remain poorly understood. Here, we estimate historical hotspots and future changes of two typical compound events, i.e., sequential heatwave and precipitation (SHP) and concurrent drought and heatwave (CDH) across China, leveraging a bivariate bias correction method to adjust projections from global climate models. Results show substantial future increases in frequency, duration, and magnitude for both events, with the durations projected to double nationwide. The increases are more evident under higher emission scenarios, and could be largely underestimated if neglecting variable dependence during bias correction process. The projected changes will escalate socio-economic exposure across China’s major urban clusters, among which Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao will face the highest risk. Our findings underscore the necessity of carbon emission controls, and call for adaptive measures to mitigate the threats induced by rising compound hazards in a changing climate."

 El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability has conspicuous impacts on ecosystems and severe weather. Here, we probe the effects of anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases on El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability during the historical period using a broad set of climate models. Increased aerosols significantly amplify El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability primarily through weakening the mean advection feedback and strengthening the zonal advection and thermocline feedbacks, as linked to a weaker annual cycle of sea surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific. They prevent extreme El Niño events, reduce interannual sea surface temperature skewness in the tropical Pacific, influence the likelihood of El Niño/Southern Oscillation events in April and June and allow for more El Niño transitions to Central Pacific events. While rising greenhouse gases significantly reduce El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability via a stronger sea surface temperature annual cycle and attenuated thermocline feedback. They promote extreme El Niño events, increase SST skewness, and enlarge the likelihood of El Niño/Southern Oscillation peaking in November while inhibiting Central Pacific El Niño/Southern Oscillation events.

 Knowing the transport properties of iron at the Earth’s core conditions is essential for the geophysical modeling of Earth’s magnetic field generation. Besides by extreme pressures and temperatures (which cause scattering by thermal disorder to dominate), transport may be also influenced by the presence of light elements and electron-electron scattering. We used a combination of molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and dynamical mean-field theory methods to examine the impact of oxygen impurities on the electronic correlations and transport in the Earth’s liquid outer core. We find electronic correlations to be moderately enhanced by oxygen admixture. At realistic 10 atomic% of oxygen, the thermal conductivity suppression by electronic correlations (about 20%) is of the same magnitude as that due to oxygen inclusion. Hence, both play an equally important role in reducing the conductivity and stabilizing the geodynamo. We also explain the reduction of Lorenz ratio in core matter.

 Managing and controlling costly natural hazards such as floods has been a fundamental and essential issue for decision-makers and planners from the past to the present. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently proven promising to improve disaster management. There is growing interest in using AI to predict and identify flood-prone areas. However, creating accurate flood susceptibility maps with AI remains a significant challenge. Therefore, the present work endeavors to cope with this gap and produce the most efficient flood susceptibility maps employing Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithms and three system-based metaheuristic methods, including Augmented Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AAEO), Germinal Center Optimization (GCO), and Water Circle Algorithm (WCA). We selected Jahrom County, Iran, to develop machine learning-based models as our case study. We used 13 flood conditioning geophysical factors as input parameters and flood occurrence (binary classification), derived from satellite imagery, as the output. Our results show that CatBoost-AAEO performs better in flood susceptibility mapping than the other combined models, CatBoost-WCA, CatBoost-GCO, and the basic CatBoost model, which are mentioned in descending order of performance. The partial Dependence Plots (PDP) approach is used to interpret the results of the developed algorithms, highlighting that low slope, low elevation, minimal vegetation cover, flat curvature, and proximity to rivers significantly impact the performance of ML models to predict flood occurrence. The findings of this research can help planners manage and prevent floods and avoid development in sensitive areas to reduce financial losses caused by floods."

 Due to the concealment and randomness of solid waste disposal sites, the time and manpower costs for manual on-site inspections or remote sensing visual interpretation are significantly increased. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for the development of instance segmentation models for solid waste based on remote sensing imagery. However, there is currently no instance segmentation model specifically designed for solid waste. Hence, this study utilized high-resolution satellite remote sensing imagery to create a four-band sample dataset named Four-Band Solid Waste Dataset, which covers common types of solid waste in China. Utilizing this dataset, we propose a network structure called the Two-Step Detection Network (TSNET). In the initial detection step, we design an Segmentation with Feature Enhancement-YOLO (SFE-YOLO) instance segmentation model, prioritizing the instance segmentation of three categories: industrial waste, tailings ponds, and the other solid waste. In the second detection phase, we utilize the ResNet network model to reclassify the other solid waste identified in the first step, thereby distinguishing construction waste, household garbage, and mixed garbage. This approach addresses the imbalance in solid waste samples and achieves instance segmentation for various types of solid waste. Experimental validation conducted on the Four-Band Solid Waste Dataset we curated shows that our proposed TSNET model, employing the two-step detection strategy, achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 84.1% for the instance segmentation of five waste categories, with Average Precision (AP) for all types exceeding 79.0%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation models."

 Deep learning (DL) based methods have recently made remarkable progress in remote sensing (RS) soil moisture (SM) retrieval applications. However, their purely “black box” algorithms suffer from a lack of interpretability, whereas methods based solely on physical mechanisms often underperform in complex scenarios. In this study, we attempt to use an SM downscaling approach that integrates thermal inertia (TI) theory with the DenseNet deep network algorithm. This approach provides partial interpretability of the physical mechanisms while utilizing DenseNet’s superior nonlinear learning ability and feature reuse capability for downscaling the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite product, generating daily 1 km × 1 km SM. A comprehensive assessment of the downscaled results using in-situ SM acquired from 264 International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) sites densely distributed across the continental U.S. indicated that this downscaling approach had an overall high accuracy, with an average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.048 m3/m3. In addition, the downscaled SM exhibited marked improvement in spatial details over the original SMAP SM maps, providing clearer land surface features. The proposed SM downscaling approach is a valuable attempt to adopt DL methods with more practical physical meaning and more interpretability in the current RS Big Data era."

 Wildfire management and response requires frequent and accurate burned area mapping. How to map daily burned areas with satisfactory accuracy remains challenging due to missed detections caused by accumulating active fire points as well as the low temporal resolution of sensors onboard satellites like Sentinel-2/Landsat-8/9 and monthly burned area product generated from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. ConvNet-based and Transformer-based deep-learning models are widely applied to mid-spatial-resolution satellite images. But these models perform poorly on low-spatial-resolution images. Also, cloud interference is one major issue when continuously monitoring the burned area. To improve detection accuracy and reduce cloud inference by combining temporal and spatial information, we propose an autoregressive spatial–temporal model AR-SwinUNETR to segment daily burned areas from VIIRS time-series. AR-SwinUNETR processes the image time-series as a 3D tensor but considers the temporal connections between images in the time-series by applying an autoregressive mask in Swin-Transformer Block. The model is trained with 2017-2020 wildfire events in the US and validated on 2021 US wildfire events. The quantitative results indicate AR-SwinUNETR can achieve a higher F1-Score than baseline deep learning models. The quantitative results of testset which consists of eight 2023 long-duration wildfires in Canada show a better F1 Score (0.757) and IoU Score (0.607) than baseline accumulated VIIRS Active Fire Hotspots (0.715) and IoU Score (0.557) compared with labels generated from Sentinel-2 images. In conclusion, the proposed AR-SwinUNETR with VIIRS image time-series can efficiently detect daily burned area providing better accuracy than direct burned area mapping with VIIRS active fire hotspots. Also, burned area mapping using VIIRS time-series and AR-SwinUNETR keeps a high temporal resolution (daily) compared to other burned area mapping products. The qualitative results also show improvements in detecting burned areas with cloudy images."

 As internationalization and urban competition intensify, the rise in urban population size is anticipated to bring substantial benefits to cities. To better regulate population size, researchers need accurate data and predictive modeling. This paper introduced using high-resolution population density heat maps and city maps of Hong Kong as training datasets for machine learning models. We developed five advanced population density forecasting models, targeting specific demographic groups. These models were then used to plan public transportation stations, considering quantity and layout dimensions, to improve attractiveness for the residential population. Through experiments based on scenarios, we quantified the impact of the number of stations on groups of population density. The defined index represented the ratio of the number of most attractive stations to the size of the population. The results showed that when the total population of the area was 70,000 or more, the index was about 1,400-1,900; Vice versa, the index was in the range of 1,000-1,200. In the station layout experiment, we verified the impact of three variables: existing population density, service radius, and land use type on population density.

 Ship emissions may have significant influences on regional climates with growing trade around the world. Therefore, an updated regional climate model with comprehensive cloud microphysics schemes is employed to investigate the effects of shipping sulfate and primary carbonaceous aerosols on the East Asian summer climate. Investigations indicate that ship emissions have substantial influences on air quality, the radiative energy budget and regional climate change in East Asia in summer. They would directly result in an increment in aerosol surface concentration by at least 10% around the coasts and optical depth by 0.03 over East Asia, which considerably increases the cloud droplet numbers along ship lanes. Subsequently, a very negative instantaneous radiative forcing (>1.5 W/m2) at the surface is exerted, and then the dipoles of anti-cyclone and convergence anomalies might occur from the Bay of Bengal to northeast Asia due to shipping aerosols. These thermal-dynamic responses could further affect cloud formation, hence inducing heterogeneous and nonlocal responses of radiation, air temperature and precipitation. Both cloud optical depth and fraction are likely increased in southwestern to northern China but decreased in parts of southern China and northeastern Asia through shipping aerosols interacting with radiation and clouds. As a result, surface cooling and wetting (warming and drying) are found in the region with positive (negative) cloud change. The absorption of shipping BC to solar radiation could yield a substantial warming tendency, which might have significant contributions to the climate responses in central to northern China."

 Solar radiation is a significant factor affecting the concentration and dispersion patterns of photochemical pollutants in urban environments. This impact is mediated through alterations in temperature and thermally-driven airflow patterns, but the full extent of these effects has not yet been quantified.

The novelty lies in its comprehensive assessment of how solar radiation, emissions, and dynamic and chemical processes interact to affect photochemical pollution. It was found that under different radiation conditions, NOx and O3 concentrations exhibit distinct distribution patterns. Compared to the neutral condition, the decreased NOx concentrations (23%) and increased O3 concentrations (8.7%) are observed in the morning and at noon, whereas in the afternoon, NOx concentrations rises (111%) and O3 concentrations decreases (20%) in the canyon. At night, NOx accumulates at the bottom of the windward side. Through sensitivity tests, we found that the primary pathway through which solar radiation affects the dispersion of photochemical pollutants is dynamic process. The pedestrian health risks of photochemical pollutants were evaluated that NO2 health risks are more pronounced in the afternoon and at night, while O3 risks are more severe in the morning and at noon. Overall, this study quantitatively demonstrates the significant impact of solar radiation on the photochemical pollutants and identifies the pathways of influence."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121033,False,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了中国郑州这座特大城市中挥发性有机物（VOCs）来源对臭氧（O3）形成的定量影响。它使用了光化学箱模型（结合了主化学机制AtChem2-MCM）和正矩阵分解（PMF）方法，评估了不同VOCs来源对O3生成和损失的贡献，并计算了相对增量反应性（RIR）、臭氧生成潜势（OFP）、相对贡献（CTRB）和OH损失率（LOH）等指标，以确定优先控制的污染源。研究发现，混合燃烧源的RIR最高，应优先控制；而机动车排放的OFP、LOH和CTRB占比最大，应长期关注。生物排放也对O3形成有显著贡献。该研究主要关注的是地面VOCs排放及其对O3生成的影响，并未直接使用大气环境遥感技术（如卫星观测或空气质量监测传感器）进行数据采集或分析，而是依赖于地面观测数据和模型模拟。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['Ozone', 'Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)', 'Air quality modeling', 'Photochemical box model', 'Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF)', 'Megacity air pollution']",Sen Yao;Fengjuan Fan;Hongyuan Jia;Shushen Yang;Junmei Zhang;Hanyu Zhang;Wenjiao Duan,Quantitative impacts of VOC sources on atmospheric oxidation capacity and O<sub>3</sub> formation from a megacity in China,"•The effects of VOC sources on AOC were comprehensively considered. •Quantitative impacts of VOC sources to O3formation. •VOC reactivity informed short- and long-term O3strategy development. •Anthropogenic influences on O3production rose on pollution days. 
 Ozone (O3) pollution has emerged as a significant environmental concern in recent years, particularly exacerbated by enhanced atmospheric oxidation during summer. While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of precursors in O3 formation, studies focusing on the contributions of volatile organic compound (VOC) sources to O3 formation mechanisms remain limited. This study integrated a photochemical box model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism (AtChem2-MCM) with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to investigate VOC sources influences on O3 photochemistry in Zhengzhou, a megacity in China. The sensitivities of the O3-NOx-VOC sources were evaluated using the relative incremental reactivity (RIR), and priority sources for control were determined based on RIR, ozone formation potential (OFP), relative contribution (CTRB), and OH loss rate (LOH). Results showed that the reaction HO2 + NO (68.77%) dominated O3 production, whereas OH + NO2 (83.42%) was the primary pathway for O3 loss. The atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) increased from 3.72 × 107 molecules cm−3 s−1 on non-O3 pollution days to 5.69 × 107 molecules cm−3 s−1 on O3 pollution days, with corresponding O3 production and loss rates rising by 9.02 ppbv h−1 and 0.54 ppbv h−1, respectively. The RIR of mixed combustion sources (MC) was the highest among anthropogenic sources, and emergency prevention and control of O3 should first reduce MC. Meanwhile, vehicular emissions (VE) accounted for the largest proportion of OFP, LOH and CTRB, suggesting VE should be a long-term focus for O3 mitigation efforts. Biogenic emissions (BE) also contributed significantly to O3 formation and warranted attention. This integrated approach provides a robust theoretical framework for analyzing localized O3 pollution and developing targeted mitigation strategies."
None,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文的标题和摘要表明，其研究重点是沿海沙丘地区氨的干沉降过程，并结合了实测数据和模型模拟。氨是大气中重要的污染物，对空气质量和生态环境有显著影响。研究沿海沙丘地区氨的干沉降，有助于了解氨在大气环境中的传输和转化过程，以及其对当地生态系统的影响。虽然标题和摘要中没有明确提及遥感技术，如卫星观测，但这项研究的数据和模型结果可以为利用遥感技术进行大气氨浓度监测和干沉降通量估算提供参考和验证。因此，本研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['Ammonia', 'Dry deposition', 'Coastal dune', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition']",K.J.A.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.107921,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇研究论文关注的是利用多模式集合 (MME) 和多准则决策 (MCDM) 方法评估 CMIP6 全球气候模式 (GCM) 在预测布拉马普特拉河流域极端降水方面的性能。研究使用了 13 个偏差校正后的降尺度 CMIP6 GCMs，并通过 8 个统计性能指标和 5 种 MCDM 技术对这些模型进行了评估，旨在改进 MME 的性能，并预测未来极端降水的变化趋势。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。其重点在于气候模式评估和降水预测，而非大气成分的观测和分析。,[],Rishi Gupta;Prem Prakash;Vinay Chembolu,Multi criteria evaluation of downscaled CMIP6 models in predicting precipitation extremes,"•Evaluated performances of bias corrected downscaled GCMs over flood prone large river catchment. •Used 5 multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques with 8 statistical performance indicators for reliable evaluation. •Indices wise ranking was assessed against annual precipitation ranking and observed significant improvement. •Assessed the improvement for different multi model ensembles (AMME) and found AMME (8) to perform better. •Observed high predictions with best ensembles in early future (2031–2060) and low predictions in far future (2071–2060). 
 The selection of general circulation models (GCMs) is primary information required for assessing climate change impacts on the hydrological vulnerability of any region. The uncertainties associated with GCMs at the regional scale are mostly attributable to coarser representation of climatic processes, making model ranking an essential step for improving multi-model ensemble (MME) performance. The present study evaluated 13 downscaled-bias-corrected CMIP6 GCMs for eight extreme precipitation indices over the flood-prone Brahmaputra River basin. Precipitation extremes from 1985 to 2014 were employed to evaluate model performance at a grid resolution of 0.25°, while projected events were assessed for the early future (2031–2060) and far future (2071–2100). Individual rankings for precipitation indices were determined using five multicriteria decision-making (MDCM) techniques: TOPSIS, VIKOR, EDAS, PROMETHEE-II, and Performance Matrix. The Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) technique was used to assign weights to each performance indicator for indices-wise ranking. The comprehensive ranking from the various MCDM techniques was further obtained using group decision-making method. The results show that different models are better at capturing different precipitation characteristics, necessitating indices-based rankings for future estimates. The study additionally indicates that Multi-Model Ensemble, MME8, and MME5 outperformed the other ensembles in reducing simulation uncertainty in downscaled GCMs. Future projections indicate an overall increase in precipitation extremes, with the best model ensembles predicting a wetter early future and a drier far future than all model ensembles."

 This study reveals that the intensity of cold-season (October–March) extreme low-temperature events (ELTs) during 1982–2022 strengthened after the year 2000 over northern Asia, along with a decrease in their frequency. Two significant interdecadal changes in cold-season atmospheric circulations after the year 2000 were found to be associated with these changes. Firstly, there has been an increased occurrence of extremely strong blocking highs over the North Atlantic, promoting anomalous meridional circulation. Secondly, the upper-level jet stream has weakened, reducing the polar vortex and strengthening the cold polar air that erupts southward. Statistical analysis and model experiments suggest that the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation after the year 2000 may have contributed to the strengthened ELTs by causing deep warming over the North Atlantic. The direct thermodynamic effects of deep warming intensify the blocking high over the North Atlantic. Simultaneously, an anomalous easterly wind appears in the upper troposphere due to thermal wind theory, and the weakened jet stream results in a stronger meridional flow, leading to an extremely strong blocking high."
