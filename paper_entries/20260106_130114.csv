However, the indirect N2O emission factor (EF) model, applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for estimating inland water N2O emissions, is inadequate for lakes due to uncertainties in the N2O production pathways and significant spatiotemporal variations in EF values. Herein, we combined in situ N2O emission investigations, metagenomic sequencing, and isotopic mapping techniques to determine the pathway of N2O production and environmental control of EF values in shallow eutrophic lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Dissolved N2O concentration exhibited a significant correlation with nitrate (NO3−-N), coupled with a positive relationship between the (nirK+ nirS)/nosZ ratio and N2O fluxes. Furthermore, a δ15NSP-δ18ON2O mapping approach model verified that 94.0 ± 9.1% of the total N2O production was contributed by denitrification. These observations jointly demonstrated that denitrification dominated the N2O production in the studied lacustrine system. Based on these findings, the nitrogen source (NO3−-N) concentration for denitrification and the ratio of the carbon source (dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) to NO3−-N concentration (DOC/NO3−-N) were incorporated into a model, both of which showed high correlations with EF values in the studied lacustrine system and global meta-analysis dataset. This model, which provides a good fit, corrects N2O emission overestimations from IPCC models by using easily obtained water quality variables."

Academic literature exploring how people perceive and respond to wildfire smoke has grown rapidly in the past decade. We conducted this systematic review with three objectives: to characterize the topical, geographic, and disciplinary focus of existing research, examine the application of established behavioral theories to smoke protection behaviors, and identify emergent themes and research gaps. Following PRISMA standards, we systematically reviewed papers focusing on individual-level human perception or behavioral responses to wildfire smoke events. We extracted information on eight psychosocial constructs across three levels: intrapersonal (cognitive processes: emotions, threat appraisal, coping appraisal), interpersonal (social influences: social networks, social norms), and contextual factors (past experience, access to information, demographic attributes). Our review of 39 studies reveals an emerging field concentrated in the Western US and dominated by public health perspectives. Only ten studies employed explicit theoretical models. We found complex relationships between psychosocial constructs: while people generally recognize smoke as threatening, the relationship between threat perception and protective action remains complex, with mixed findings regarding past experience and coping appraisal. Social networks play a paradoxical role, providing crucial support during smoke events while being disrupted by smoke-induced isolation that prevents normal social gathering. Social norms around smoke protection remain underexplored. Socially vulnerable populations are underrepresented despite facing heightened exposure risks. We identify significant research gaps regarding emotional responses, social norms, and community-level interventions. Enhanced understanding of wildfire smoke responses can improve interventions and policies to promote public health and community adaptation to wildfire smoke."

This study examines typhoon and non-typhoon heavy precipitation over SEA during 1960–2024 using a typhoon track dataset and three high-resolution precipitation products. Results show a significant decrease in typhoon-precipitation contribution to total precipitation across the entire SEA, both in its continental and maritime regions, especially during the boreal summer half-year. This trend persists under heavy precipitation conditions (95th and 99th percentiles). In contrast, based on tracking results, non-typhoon heavy precipitation shows increases in precipitation area but decreases in lifespan intensity, yielding more total precipitation per event. Our findings indicate a shifting hazard regime: a decrease in typhoon-related rainfall is being offset by a spatial expansion of non-typhoon heavy precipitation, introducing a new regional risk. The findings provide critical insights into the change of regional precipitation patterns and have implications for disaster management and adaptation in SEA."

Chipperfield,The impact of the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation on Arctic polar stratospheric cloud occurrence,"We find that wind variations at the equator (QBO) modulate the occurrence of Arctic polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which are key contributors to ozone depletion. During westerly QBO, the PSC occurrence is significantly greater than during easterly QBO. The QBO affects PSC mainly through temperature, while H2O and HNO3 have less effect. This suggests that future climate change may affect ozone recovery if it alters the QBO pattern. This study provides a new perspective on ozone prediction. 
 Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play a critical role in stratospheric ozone depletion. Previous studies have shown that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) influences the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex and ozone, yet few studies have thoroughly analyzed the impact of the QBO on Arctic PSC occurrence. This study examines this impact using CALIPSO observations from 2006 to 2021 and SLIMCAT simulations from 1979 to 2022. The results show that the winter PSC coverage area is significantly larger during the westerly QBO (WQBO) phase than during the easterly QBO (EQBO) phase, with a zonal asymmetry in PSC occurrence frequency anomalies. The QBO influences the temperature, water vapour (H2O), and nitric acid (HNO3) in the Arctic stratosphere, which are key factors affecting PSC formation. During the WQBO phase, Arctic stratospheric temperatures show negative anomalies, with the centre of this anomaly biased towards North America. In addition, H2O shows positive anomalies in the Arctic lower stratosphere, mainly due to the stronger polar vortex preventing the transport of high-moisture air at high latitudes to mid-latitudes, causing H2O to accumulate inside the polar vortex. HNO3 shows negative anomalies, primarily caused by denitrification through nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) sedimentation. Sensitivity analyses further indicate that QBO-induced temperature anomalies are the dominant driver of PSC variability, while the direct effect of H2O anomalies on PSCs is relatively small. The reduction of HNO3 mainly affects PSCs in February and March. This work implies that future changes in the QBO may influence ozone by affecting PSCs."

By applying an advanced inversion system, we produced improved NMVOC emission inventories in 2019 and 2020. The optimized results improve formaldehyde and ozone simulations in general, and a consistency analysis is further designed to assess the reliability of these two posteriors. 
 Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are key precursors of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. As one of the world’s largest NMVOC emitters, accurate emission inventories are essential for understanding and mitigating air pollution in China. Commonly-used inventories (e.g., MEIC) are largely based on bottom-up methods, which often fail to capture the spatiotemporal variability of NMVOC emissions, resulting in significant model-observation mismatches. This study evaluates the shape factor, filtered data volume, and monthly mean biases of OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI formaldehyde products, with the latest OMPS and TROPOMI retrievals offering substantially higher effective spatiotemporal coverage. Monthly NMVOC emissions over China in 2020 are then optimized by independently assimilating formaldehyde retrievals either from OMPS or from TROPOMI, using a self-developed 4DEnVar assimilation emission inversion system. The OMPS- and TROPOMI-driven assimilation yields consistent seasonal and regional increments in NMVOC emissions in general, but distinctions are also notable. A consistency analysis is introduced to assess the reliability of these two posterior emissions. Highly consistent increments are obtained in the North China Plain (May–June), the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta (January–March, October–December), and the Sichuan Basin (January, June–December). These adjustments significantly improve surface ozone simulations, with 81.25 % of consistent cases demonstrating reduced biases and an average RMSE reduction of 24.7 %. These findings highlight the effectiveness of OMPS and TROPOMI formaldehyde assimilation, coupled with consistency analysis, in refining NMVOC emission estimates and enhancing ozone simulation accuracy. Similar promising results are achieved in the OMPS/TROPOMI-based NMVOC emission inversion in 2019."

We find that hygroscopicity depends on particle size, source-related changes, and moisture-driven processing, which distinguishes this region from other high-altitude regions and may provide key constraints for aerosol-cloud and regional climate models. 
 Understanding the hygroscopicity and mixing state of atmospheric aerosol particles is crucial for accurately assessing their role in cloud formation and subsequent climate impacts. However, measurements in the lower free troposphere – a representative atmospheric layer characterizing regional background conditions in aerosol transport and atmospheric evolution – remain sparse, especially in regions influenced by both anthropogenic emissions and long-range transported air masses. This study adds further data on size-resolved hygroscopicity and mixing state measurements of aerosols at Mt. Hua (2060 m a.s.l., central China) during October–November 2021 using a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA). Results reveal a clear size-dependence of aerosol hygroscopicity, with the mean hygroscopicity parameter (κmean) increased from 0.20 for 30 nm particles to 0.30 for 200 nm particles. The ambient submicron aerosols were primarily externally mixed, dominated by more-hygroscopic (MH) particles, with no significant diurnal variation, indicating minimal influence from boundary layer dynamics. Starting from 6 November, the combined influence of mineral dust and regional heating activities led to a notable reduction in aerosol hygroscopicity, especially in larger particles. This decline was driven by an increase in weakly hygroscopic components such as mineral dust, black carbon, and organic compounds, highlighting the impact of both long-range transport and regional emissions on aerosol composition. Notably, during episodes of striking high relative humidity (RH > 80 %) in Cluster 5, atmospheric aerosols containing mineral dust showed unexpected hygroscopic enhancement, suggesting in situ RH-driven chemical processing that increased aerosol hygroscopicity. Atmospheric aerosols at Mt. Hua displayed distinct hygroscopic properties compared to other high-altitude sites, underscoring regional differences in aerosol sources and free tropospheric processing. These findings advance our understanding of aerosol aging and processes in the lower free troposphere over central China, and offer crucial observational constraints for modeling aerosol–cloud interaction and regional climate impacts."

Results show that under comparable thermodynamic conditions, dust-laden precipitation systems have higher storm tops, broader upper-level precipitation areas with more large particles, stronger convective activities, and heavier surface rain rates than clean ones. 
 Saharan dust aerosols interacting with clouds and precipitation in the Atlantic Ocean's intertropical convergence zone can significantly impact storm microphysical and thermodynamic processes. Previous satellite research often focused on individual, km-scale rain pixels, neglecting interconnections among different locations. This study innovatively employs a clustering method to group satellite precipitation radar-observed profiles into organized precipitation systems (PSs) of varying horizontal sizes. Key features such as the mean storm top height, 85 GHz polarization-corrected microwave brightness temperature, and horizontal area with specific radar reflectivity per layer are analyzed to uncover system-level precipitation characteristics. Observations indicate that dust-laden PSs have higher storm tops, broader upper-level precipitation areas with more large particles, stronger ice scattering signals, and heavier surface rain rates than clean systems. These PSs also exhibit greater convective available potential energy (CAPE) and distinct differences in related dynamic and moisture conditions. Partial correlation and sensitivity analyses revealed that CAPE-induced changes are the primary confounding factor for dust aerosol effects. Notably, even after constraining CAPE and other thermodynamic factors, significant dust-induced changes in PS properties persist. This implies that, under comparable thermodynamic conditions, Saharan dust aerosols may enhance mid- and upper-level ice heterogeneous nucleation, thereby increasing the number of ice particles, releasing extra latent heat, and invigorating storms. Overall, this study offers a novel perspective on how dust aerosols affect organized precipitation systems."
10.5194/acp-26-59-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究了卫星数据和机器学习如何帮助理解大气中微小粒子（气溶胶）对云的影响及其亮度，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量和大气成分监测。,"['satellite data', 'machine learning', 'Nd-LWP relationship', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring']",Matthew W. Christensen;Andrew Geiss;Adam C. Varble;Po-Lun Ma,Machine learning reveals strong grid-scale dependence in the satellite Nd–LWP relationship,"We used satellite data and machine learning to better understand how tiny particles in the atmosphere affect clouds and their brightness. At higher spatial resolution, we discovered a new “M”-shaped pattern in the relationship between cloud water and droplet concentration unlike the inverted-V shape observed at coarsely gridded scales. Cloud water increases more with droplet concentration when rain is present. These findings support the development of next-generation atmospheric models. 
 The relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP) is highly uncertain yet crucial for determining the impact of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) on Earth's radiation budget. The Nd-LWP relationship is examined using a machine learning (ML) random forest model applied to five years of satellite data at grid resolutions ranging from 10° to 0.05° in 12 distinct regions. In the subtropics, the shape of the Nd-LWP relationship switches from an inverted-V at 1° grid-resolution to an “M” shape at 0.1° resolution with decreased dlnLWPdlnNd sensitivity. Tropical and midlatitude regions generally show a more positive sensitivity. Cloud sampling and filtering also influence this slope, wherein the exclusion of thin clouds, as commonly performed to reduce retrieval uncertainty, leads to strongly negative sensitivity across all regions. Precipitation is primarily responsible for driving the strength of the sensitivity, with strong positive slopes in raining clouds and negative and/or neutral responses found in non-raining clouds. A new method to compute radiative forcing from the ML model shows a robust Twomey radiative forcing across all regions and grid resolutions. However, LWP and cloud fraction adjustments to the radiative forcing, which are ∼50 % or smaller than the Twomey effect, decrease to negligible values with higher spatial resolution data. As Earth system models move toward higher spatial resolutions in the future, evaluating the LWP and CF adjustment contributions to the radiative forcing budget at these finer resolutions will be essential for evaluation and model development."
10.5194/acp-26-95-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究了黑碳和尘土在卷云冰形成中的作用，涉及大气成分分析和气候模拟，与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和卫星观测密切相关。,"['soot', 'dust', 'cirrus cloud', 'ice-nucleating particles', 'climate modeling']",Xiaohan Li;Songmiao Fan;Huan Guo;Paul Ginoux,Resolving the roles of soot and dust in cirrus cloud ice formation at regional and global scales: insights from parcel and climate modeling,"We used computer simulations to show that soot from wildfires and human activities has a bigger impact on high-altitude clouds than previously known. These particles create more ice crystals, which leads to a net warming effect on the climate in polar regions. Understanding this process is crucial for making accurate climate predictions as global wildfire activity increases. 
 Atmospheric aerosols can serve as ice-nucleating particles (INPs), influencing cirrus cloud formation and properties. While mineral dust is recognized as an effective INP, the role of soot remains less explored, limiting climate impact assessments. Here we use cloud parcel model simulations to examine the competitive ice nucleation behavior of soot and dust, alongside homogeneous nucleation. These process-level simulations reveal that dust dominates heterogeneous ice nucleation at colder temperatures (T<210 K), whereas soot becomes increasingly more important at warmer temperatures, particularly when dust concentrations are low.  To evaluate their global-scale implications, we integrate these results into the GFDL AM4-MG2 climate model. We find that dust shapes the baseline spatial and seasonal ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) patterns, while soot (represented in the model as black carbon, BC) enhances global-mean ICNC by ∼ 5 %. However, BC-driven increases in ICNC can be much larger in the upper troposphere (500–250 hPa), reaching up to 90 %. The strongest enhancements are found during boreal spring across Eurasia and the Maritime Continent, and during austral spring over South America and the South Atlantic. Radiatively, BC INPs can enhance the annual global longwave cloud radiative effect by approximately 0.24 W m−2 and cause statistically significant net warming in both polar regions during their respective winters. These results highlight the coupled roles of dust and soot in cloud ice formation, underscoring the need to assess the impacts of rising wildfire emissions on atmospheric ice processes and associated climate effects."

Here we measured the dust size distribution from fine to giant particles at an emission source during a field campaign in Jordan (J-WADI) using multiple instruments. Our findings show that large particles make up a significant part of the total dust mass. This knowledge is essential to improve climate models and to predict dust impacts on climate and environment. 
 Mineral dust particles emitted from dry, uncovered soil can be transported over vast distances, thereby influencing climate and environment. Its impacts are highly size-dependent, yet large particles with diameters dp>10 µm remain understudied due to their low number concentrations and instrumental limitations. Accurately characterizing the particle size distribution (PSD) at emission is crucial for understanding dust transport and climate interactions.Here we characterize the dust PSD at an emission source during the Jordan Wind Erosion and Dust Investigation (J-WADI) campaign, conducted in Wadi Rum, Jordan, in September 2022, focusing on super-coarse (10<dp≤62.5 µm) and giant (dp>62.5 µm) particles. This study is the first to continuously cover the full range of diameters from dp=0.4 to 200 µm at an emission source by using a suite of aerosol spectrometers with overlapping size ranges. This overlap enabled a systematic intercomparison and validation across instruments, improving PSD reliability.Results show significant PSD variability over the course of the campaign. During periods with friction velocities (u*) above 0.22 m s−1 (or ∼ 3.3 m s−1 threshold 4 m wind speed), the approximate threshold for local dust emission by saltation, both dust concentrations and the contributions of super-coarse and giant particles typically increased with increasing u*, especially under neutral to unstable atmospheric stability conditions. These large particles accounted for about 90 % of the total mass concentration during the campaign. A prominent mass concentration peak was observed near dp=60 µm in geometric diameter. While particle concentrations for dp<10 µm showed good agreement among most instruments, discrepancies appeared for larger dp due to reduced instrument sensitivity at the size range boundaries and sampling inefficiencies. Despite these challenges, physical samples collected using a flat-plate sampler largely confirmed the PSDs derived from the aerosol spectrometers. These findings help to advance our understanding of the dust PSD and the abundance of super-coarse and giant particle at emission sources."

Collocated with reference instruments over 19 months in Nicosia, results showed that CO and PM (particulate matter) sensors captured daily, hourly, and monthly spatial trends. NO2, NO, and O3 sensors were less reliable due to environmental effects. Still, all sensors tracked monthly temporal variations at the same location, with PM2.5 showing the strongest agreement with reference data. 
 Low-cost gas and particle sensors can enhance the spatial coverage of Air Quality (AQ) monitoring networks in urban settings. While their accuracy is insufficient to replace reference instruments, they may still capture spatial differences among different stations, as well as temporal trends and month-to-month variabilities at a specific location. To assess this, we conducted a 19-month study using two Vaisala AQ Transmitters-Monitors (Model AQT530), collocated with reference-grade instruments, at two AQ stations in Nicosia: an urban traffic and an urban background station. These two stations are ideal for the needs of this study considering that the reference measurements carried out there exhibit statistically significant spatial and temporal differences in pollutant concentrations when analysed over the entire period and on a monthly basis.The AQT530 air quality monitor employs Low-Cost Sensors (LCSs) for gaseous pollutants (i.e., CO, NO2, NO and O3) and particulate matter (PM). Tests of the performance of the two AQT530 monitors during an initial period when those were collocated at the urban traffic station revealed high unit-to-unit agreements for the CO, NO and PM10, and good to moderate for the NO2, O3 and PM2.5 measurements. The CO and PM10 LCS measurements also effectively captured concentration differences between the two stations when averaged over the entire study period or monthly, with some exceptions for specific months. These LCSs successfully detected spatial concentration differences (i.e., monthly, daily and hourly) as long as those were above a certain threshold. Overall, the CO and PM sensors successfully tracked month-to-month trends over the entire study period, similarly to reference instruments, whereas NO2, NO, and O3 sensors struggled due to environmental sensitivities. Despite this, all sensors identified statistically significant month-to-month variations at the same station, with the PM2.5 measurements showing the strongest agreement with reference data."

Compounds from various chemical functionalities (alcohols, acids, aldehydes), from biogenic and anthropogenic origin, were identified. Improved method performance was observed for nitro compounds, which have been associated with anthropogenic activities. 
 In this study, we present two optimized analytical methods for the quantification of molecular markers to attribute the contribution of various Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) oxidation products to Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA). Those involve Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization coupled to Ion Mobility Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-IMS-QTOFMS) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Liquid extraction was performed for both techniques, with an extra derivatization step with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) for GC-MS analysis, enhancing the compound detection capacity. Between the two techniques, 23 biogenic and anthropogenic markers were identified, with five common species detected. Recoveries between 40 % and 170 % were observed for nitro-containing compounds and between 70 % and 140 % for aromatic and non-aromatic acids except for 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid. Limits of detection <5 ng were observed by UPLC/ESI-IMS-QTOFMS analysis for 4-nitrophenol and 2-methyl-4-nitrophenol, while GC-MS (with BSTFA derivatization) analysis allowed better detection of lower mass compounds (for example limit of detection for 2-methylerythritol was 0.10 ng). While UPLC/ESI-IMS-QTOFMS allows for the analysis of high molecular weight compounds at high resolution and sensitivity, GC-MS analysis focuses on compounds of lower mass and higher polarity, together, these complementary methods provide a comprehensive tool for the quantification of organic markers arising from the airborne transformation of compounds of both biogenic and anthropogenic origins."

Christiansen,"A full year of continuous net soil and ditch CO2, CH4, N2O fluxes, soil hydrology and meteorology for a drained fen in Denmark","Quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is vital for climate mitigation. Our high-precision measurements of CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes reveal highly dynamic exchanges, especially for CO2 and N2O, driven by temperature and groundwater fluctuations across hourly to monthly scales. These insights advance understanding of wetland emission regulation and support improved biogeochemical models. 
 We present a detailed dataset (https://doi.org/10.60612/DATADK/BZQ8JE, Skov Nielsen et al., 2025) of automated greenhouse gas (GHG) net soil and ditch fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a drained fen in Denmark covering a full year. The dataset resolves small scale spatial and hourly-daily-seasonal dynamics of GHG soil fluxes. The GHG flux dataset is accompanied by simultaneous time series of soil temperature and moisture, as well as groundwater table depth and covers spatiotemporal gradients in soil hydrological and climatic variability. The GHG fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured simultaneously by a high-precision cavity ring down laser spectrometer connected with a novel automated GHG system platform called SkyLine2D (Earthbound Scientific Ltd., UK) that allowed up to 27 individual chamber measurement points along a 24 m transect. In total 47.483 chamber measurements were completed and after quality control 44.631 CO2 fluxes, 44.099 N2O and 42.515 CH4 fluxes remained.The average (±SE) net soil CO2 efflux observed at the site (2.6 ± 0.02 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 or 35 ± 0.3 tCO2 ha−1 yr−1) aligns with findings from similar drained fens in northern Europe covering substantial spatial variability. The organic soil at the site was a larger net source of N2O (8.9 ± 0.1 nmol N2O m−2 s−1 or 123 ± 1.4 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1) to the atmosphere compared to other temperate drained organic grassland soils in northern Europe with similar spatial variability as soil CO2 effluxes. However, the temporal variability of N2O fluxes were closely linked to fluctuations of the groundwater table depth with emission bursts of soil N2O emissions during low water table depth. N2O fluxes decreased to near-zero fluxes when the water table depth increased. Net soil CH4 fluxes were near-zero and the site overall acted as a smaller net source (0.18 ± 0.06 nmol CH4 m−2 s−1 or 0.91 ± 0.3 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1) compared to other drained organic grassland soils, although net uptake of atmospheric CH4 was observed as well especially in drier conditions. Compared to the peat soil, the ditch was a smaller net source of CO2 (0.94 ± 0.05 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 or 1.3 ± 0.7 tCO2 ha−1 yr−1) and N2O (0.35 ± 0.03 nmol N2O m−2 s−1 or 4.9 ± 0.4 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1). The ditch emission of CH4 (161 ± 13 nmol CH4 m−2 s−1 or 812 ± 66 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1) average of diffusive and ebullition fluxes) to the atmosphere was more than two orders of magnitude larger than the net soil CH4 emissions.The very large number of fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 for peat soils and a ditch linked to both groundwater table data, soil moisture/temperature as well as groundwater and soil physicochemical parameters are unique to northern temperate peatlands and holds a potential for exploring and testing basic hypothesis on the simultaneous regulation of these gas fluxes by both soil hydrology and temperature, including soil and groundwater chemistry. The high temporal detail also allows for time series analyses as well as investigations into diurnal and seasonal patterns of fluxes in response to physical drivers. Similarly, the high frequency of measured variables and the large number of spatial replicates are furthermore well suited for testing biogeochemical models as it is possible to have both calibration and validation dataset covering the same period. Furthermore, the surprisingly large spatial variability of flux data is ideal to include in model sensitivity tests which can aid in constraining model outputs and develop model routines."

We developed a 1995–2024 dataset that enhances satellite-based plant activity measurements by resolving data inconsistencies and improving resolution. Using advanced modeling, we harmonized signals from multiple satellites, cutting errors by 49 %. This offers clearer global photosynthesis trends, aiding climate research and vegetation monitoring. 
 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a crucial proxy of photosynthetic processes in vegetation. In recent decades, advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated long-term global SIF monitoring, significantly enhancing our understanding of vegetation dynamics on a global scale. Despite this progress, current SIF datasets face major challenges, including temporal inconsistencies among various satellite-derived products and a lack of long-term, high-resolution observations. In this study, we developed a “Long-term Harmonized SIF” (LHSIF) dataset spanning 1995 to 2024 with a fine spatial resolution of 0.05° by coordinating SIF satellite observations from GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, and OCO-2. Light use efficiency (LUE)-based spatial downscaling models were employed for each SIF product to generate fine-resolution global SIF maps. The long-term dataset was constructed using temporally corrected GOME-2A SIF (TCSIF) as a benchmark and was combined with a cumulative distribution function (CDF) normalization method for far-red SIF harmonization across satellite sensors from GOME, SCIAMACHY, and OCO-2. The resulting harmonized dataset shows a 49 % reduction in inter-sensor differences compared to the uncorrected data and exhibits a stable interannual increase of 0.31 ± 0.07 % yr−1. This result strongly aligns with the growth rate of gross primary production (GPP, 0.47 ± 0.03 % yr−1) and is consistent with ground-based SIF observations (R>0.60). Therefore, the long-term harmonized SIF dataset with a fine 0.05° resolution is valuable for estimating global photosynthesis over extended periods.

It evaluates the performance of the dataset, against in-situ snow depth observations. This dataset is found to perform well in most environments, with challenges at high elevation and some coastal areas. Assessing the quality of this dataset is necessary in order to use it as a baseline to infer future changes of extreme snow loads under climate change. 
 Large snow load events are a major hazard for both human societies, in particular buildings and transport safety, and natural ecosystems. National and European frameworks provide guidelines and standards in order to take into account extreme snow load hazard in infrastructure design. However, there is a lack of reference data for their implementation. This is even more challenging in the context of climate change, which modifies the frequency and intensity of major snow load events. In the context of the Framework Partnership Agreement on Copernicus User Uptake, we have developed a pan-European extreme value analysis of annual snow load maxima based on the Mountain Tourism Meteorological and Snow Indicators (MTMSI) dataset available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This dataset includes reanalysis data for the period 1962–2015, based on the UERRA (Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses) reanalysis and snow cover simulations, and past and future climate projections based on regional climate simulations for the period 1951–2100. Here, we describe the evaluation of the MTMSI reanalysis component in terms of annual snow depth maxima against multiple in-situ observation datasets. Results are provided at the NUTS-3 (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques) scale used in MTMSI, for multiple elevations over a large area stretching from the European Alps to the Scandinavian countries. For 75 % of the comparisons between observed and simulated snow depth maxima, we report absolute bias scores between −0.23 and 0.15 m, correlations above 0.59, and a Kling–Gupta Efficiency metric above 0.29. We identify some areas where MTMSI does not adequately portray in-situ observations of snow depth maxima, located in the Alps and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Croatia. This study thus provides background information for assessing the relevance of this pan-European dataset in terms of annual snow depth maxima, relevant for annual snow mass and snow load maxima based on complementary information derived from snow cover model output.

Here we create an automatic workflow using machine and deep learning techniques to process five years of data in the western coast of South America. This allows us to detect smaller earthquakes than before, creating a catalogue of seismicity that contains far more events than other regional catalogues. 
 In this study we process 5 years of continuous seismic data, from 2017 to 2021, recorded by networks deployed along the Chilean convergent margin of western South America. We select a set of stations so that coverage is as continuous and consistent in time as possible. Thus, changes in the catalogue are mainly due to the processes responsible for the seismicity itself and not network artifacts. For phase picking, we use the deep-learning algorithm Earthquake Transformer, PyOcto for association, NonLinLoc for location and HypoDD for relocation. To handle the large spatial extent of the study area, we create a partitioning workflow that mitigates problems that arise from associator and location codes working in cartesian coordinates. This allows us to obtain a main seismicity catalogue with over 600 000 double-difference relocated events and a completeness magnitude of ∼2.5, with events located using an existing 3D velocity model (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15284375, Riedel-Hornig et al., 2025). While this provides better location accuracy than a 1D or 2D velocity model, it limits the final catalogue to the extent of the 3D velocity model which does not cover our whole study area. Therefore, we create a secondary seismicity catalogue for the region to the south of the 3D model. Our catalogues provide a dense, high-resolution dataset, with large spatial extent, for the interpretation of seismic processes along the western South American Margin."

 We present GEMS-GER (Groundwater Levels, Environment, Meteorology, Site Properties), the first benchmark dataset specifically designed for machine learning applications in long-term groundwater level modeling in Germany. The dataset comprises 32 years of gapless weekly observations from 3207 monitoring wells, enriched with meteorological forcing variables and more than 50 site-specific static attributes. All data have undergone extensive preprocessing, including harmonization, outlier removal, and iterative imputation, to ensure high quality and suitability for machine learning applications. The wells are spatially distributed across Germany and cover diverse hydrogeological settings and aquifer types.  To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide three initial benchmark models: a single-well CNN model, a global LSTM model using dynamic inputs, and a global LSTM model incorporating both dynamic and static features. The best-performing model achieves satisfactory predictive performance (NSE > 0.5) for more than half (52 %) of the wells, which is generally considered a solid result in the context of groundwater-level modeling.GEMS-GER is openly available under an open-access license via Zenodo, accompanied by detailed documentation (Ohmer et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15530171).

By combining traditional forecasting data with actual weather observations, the AI system achieved better temperature predictions at local scales. While showed promise for temperature forecasting, it still had difficulty accurately predicting extreme rainfall events. The research advances weather forecasting capabilities, potentially helping communities prepare for severe weather conditions. 
 Sub-seasonal weather forecasting is a major challenge, particularly when high spatial resolution is needed to capture complex patterns and extreme events. Traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models struggle with accurate forecasting at finer scales, especially for precipitation. In this study, we investigate the use of 3D U-Net architecture for post-processing sub-seasonal forecasts to enhance both predictability and spatial resolution, focusing on the western U.S. Using the ECMWF ensemble forecasting system (input) and high-resolution PRISM data (target), we tested different combinations of ensemble members and meteorological variables. Our results demonstrate that the 3D U-Net model significantly improves temperature predictability and consistently outperforms NWP models across multiple metrics. However, challenges remain in accurately forecasting extreme precipitation events, as the model tends to underestimate precipitation in coastal and mountainous regions. While ensemble members contribute to forecast accuracy, their impact is modest compared to the improvements achieved through downscaling. The model using the ensemble mean and only the target variables was most efficient. This model improved the pattern correlation coefficient for temperature and precipitation by 0.12 and 0.19, respectively, over a 32 d lead time. This study lays the groundwork for further development of neural network-based post-processing methods, showing their potential to enhance weather forecasts at sub-seasonal timescales."

Pierson;Sebastian Sobek,Integration of the Global Water and Lake Sectors within the ISIMIP framework through scaling of streamflow inputs to lakes,"Climate change affect lakes by including not just the lakes themselves but also the land areas that drain into them. These surrounding areas influence how much water and nutrients flow into lakes which in turn impact water quality. Here, water fluxes from land, derived from a global hydrological model where water fluxes are modelled at the grid scale, were used to estimate streamflow inputs to lakes from their catchments. Using data from 70 Swedish lakes, we showed that our method works well. 
 Climate change impacts both lakes and their surrounding catchments, leading to altered discharge and nutrient loading patterns from catchments to lakes, as well as modified thermal stratification and mixing dynamics within lakes. These alterations affect biogeochemical processes and water quality in lakes. Coupled catchment-lake modeling provides both a holistic evaluation of the effects of climate change on lakes and a framework for explicitly assessing the importance of how catchments effect lakes. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) provides a framework for projecting the impacts of climate change across multiple sectors (e.g. water, lakes, energy, health) of the Earth System consistently, enabling integrated cross-sectoral assessments. However, climate impacts on lake dynamics are modeled in ISIMIP without consideration of the links between lakes and the surrounding catchments. This is a significant limitation, as it restricts assessments to only the direct impacts of climate change on lakes, overlooking the critical interactions between lakes and their catchment areas. In this study, we establish the first dynamic connection between the Global Water and Lake Sectors in ISIMIP, achieved by scaling the gridded modeled outputs of water fluxes from the Global Water Sector to the catchments of the representative lakes of the Lake Sector. The streamflow to the representative lake of each grid cell, as defined by the ISIMIP Global Lake Sector, was calculated based on runoff proportional to the catchment area of each representative lake. If the lake surface area was larger than the grid cell area, water from upstream grid cells was included as the corresponding proportion of river discharge. The methodology was applied to 70 lakes across Sweden covering a wide range of sizes, hydrological settings and catchment characteristics. The estimated streamflow was validated against both the streamflow outputs from the hydrological model HYPE and observed data. The comparison demonstrated good agreement in terms of long-term streamflow mean and seasonal pattern, indicating that the proposed approach is capable of producing reliable streamflow estimates without requiring high-resolution local models. This estimated streamflow, representing water flow into lakes, will provide a valuable dataset for the scientific community within the ISIMIP Lake Sector supporting hydrological and water quality modeling efforts aimed at understanding the impacts of climate change on lakes."

We proposed a dynamic density approach where a positive density-precipitation relationship emerges. This method improves spatial pattern, significantly reduces mortality, sustains productivity, and raises the aridity threshold above which frequent mortality events occur in grasslands. 
 In semi-arid regions, grasses and shrubs often form spatially heterogeneous patterns interspersed with bare soil as a strategy to optimize resource use and maximise productivity. Accurately representing the matrix of vegetation and bare soil in global land surface models is essential for advancing the understanding of the carbon, water, and dust cycles. This study focuses on grasslands using the land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms), which originally assumes a globally fixed grassland density representing a fixed number of individuals per unit of land. This assumption, referred to as the fixed density approach, limits the model's ability to capture grassland responses to environmental changes, resulting in unsustainable productivity and unrealistically frequent mortality events, particularly in resource-limited regions. To address these limitations, we introduced a dynamic density approach that simulates grassland density based on indicators of vegetation growth, such as reserve and labile carbon content in the grass. The simulated grassland density was consistent with field-based estimates from five regional case studies and showed a better representation of bare soil in grasslands than the fixed density approach. The emerging positive correlation between precipitation and simulated grassland density supported the validity of the approach. Compared to the fixed density approach, the dynamic density approach substantially reduced simulated mortality events, raised the aridity threshold for frequent mortality, improved the simulated leaf area index (LAI) both globally and in key semi-arid regions, and maintained realistic grassland productivity in regions where the presence of grassland is confirmed by remotely sensed LAI. This study not only demonstrates that simulating grassland density as a function of carbon availability improves ORCHIDEE's capacity to capture grassland dynamics under environmental variability, but also provides a promising foundation for investigating dust dynamics and subsequent land–atmosphere feedbacks in (semi-)arid regions."

SW and SML samples with saccharides, proteins, and N-osmolytes were less efficient at emitting SSA compared with waters rich in biotic material originating from lipids, such as fatty acids and polyols.

This includes systematic overviews of possible context-specific alternatives, mapping of chemical, material, and other functions, more detailed life cycle inventories, and rapid-screening assessment methods.

Fluorobenzenes and cyanobiphenyls triggered broad developmental disruptions, whereas bromobenzenes primarily impaired pigmentation and behavior. Bathocuproine caused concentration-dependent lethality and severe multiorgan edema, while fluorenes and anthracenes heightened tactile responsiveness and reduced larval body length. Notably, 22 of these compounds have been detected in environmental matrices or human biomonitoring studies at levels approaching those causing toxicity in vivo, underscoring their environmental relevance.

When transported indoors, where people spend most of their time, ozone is largely consumed through chemical reactions; yet the health effects of its major volatile products, carbonyls, remain unclear. In a panel study of 110 healthy Tibetan college students, we repeatedly measured week-long concentrations of seven selected carbonyls in participants’ dormitories and assessed biomarkers related to cardiovascular health. Carbonyl concentrations were generally higher indoors than outdoors, with the median indoor-to-outdoor ratio for decanal reaching 15. Further analyses suggest that the elevated indoor carbonyl concentrations likely result from ozone reactions, particularly with skin oil. Due to substantial ventilation variations across dormitories, indoor carbonyl concentrations showed no substantial correlations with outdoor ozone levels (r = −0.08∼0.20), enabling the evaluation of ozone-independent carbonyl health effects. Increased carbonyl exposure was significantly associated with the elevation of multiple red blood cell indices. Carbonyl associations with the red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit remained robust in ozone-adjusted models. These associations were further corroborated by additional analyses based on outdoor ozone levels and air-change rates. Increases in these red blood cell indices represent adverse cardiovascular effects in hypoxia-acclimated Tibetans and may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic mountain sickness."

Following this paradigm, we develop ENSO‐CausalNet, achieving skillful ENSO prediction of the Niño 3.4 index up to 22 months ahead. Results reveal that dominant physical processes affecting ENSO vary with lead time, elucidating distinct causal pathways through which Bjerknes feedback and extratropical Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean air‐sea interactions drive ENSO variability. When input dimensionality increases, the model may learn incomplete causal relationships, resulting in degraded prediction skill. These findings demonstrate that forecast capability depends critically on comprehensive causal understanding, confirming the model's physical validity.

The Yellow River Delta (YRD), once prograding seaward at ∼10 km2/yr, began retreating at −5.6 km2/yr following completion of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. Implementation of the Water and Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS)—a reservoir flushing program—fundamentally reversed this trend. By mobilizing trapped sediment and enhancing downstream channel scouring, the WSRS increased sediment delivery to the sea from 17.6 Mt/yr before its initiation to 178.5 Mt/yr during operation years. This renewed sediment flux restored delta growth, producing subaerial expansion of 6–7 km2/yr and significant subaqueous deposition near the estuary. These results demonstrate that the YRD has entered a new phase of evolution under active human management and highlight that sediment trapped behind dams can become a potentially important source for restoring sediment‐starved deltas worldwide."

Here, using simulations from nine‐member ensemble under three future scenarios, we project that the expected annual probability of record‐shattering CDHW events (i.e., events exceeding historical severity records by more than two standard deviations) will double between 2015 and 2040 and continue to rise throughout the 21st century under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario (0.05% per year). The mean temperature, relative humidity, shortwave radiation, and precipitation are critical drivers of CDHW severity. Record‐shattering CDHW events severely impact ecosystems, particularly in regions such as southern North America, northern South America, and southern Europe. Observational data from 1951 to 2022 indicate that compared to nonrecord‐shattering CDHW events, record‐shattering CDHW events are correlated with weaker water vapor transport, reduced convective activity, and greater ecosystem damage, resulting in an additional global mean gross primary productivity (GPP) loss of −2.76 to −3.96 g C m−2 month−1. Between 2080 and 2099, the global average GPP anomalies caused by these events are projected to range from 46% to 119% of the warm season's monthly average ecosystem carbon sink.

Despite the known link, the multi–scale spatiotemporal variations in the burden of TB attributable to long‐term PM exposure remain largely unclear in China. In this study, we conducted a nationwide, multi‐scale risk assessment of the burden of TB attributable to long‐term PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM10 exposure from 2013 to 2019, employing the multivariate distributed lag nonlinear model (MVDLNM), Lorenz curve and Gini index. Our health impact assessments indicate that PM exposure has resulted in significant increases in TB burden. Specifically, approximately $1,202 million (95% CI: 801–1,573 million), $486 million (95% CI: 398–572 million), and $944 million (95% CI: 767–1,115 million) of health economic costs could be attributed to long‐term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM10, respectively. Although the overall the burden of TB attributable to PM exposure was significantly reduced from 2013 to 2019, regional inequalities have become more pronounced. The Gini index reveals a clear disparity in the burden of TB related to PM exposure across provincial, city, and county levels. These disparities are most pronounced at the county level (0.4914–0.6801), followed by the city level (0.4135–0.6382), and are least evident at the province level (0.3672–0.6078). Overall, the regional inequalities in the burden of TB are more pronounced at finer spatial scales. Our study highlights the health impacts of long‐term exposure to PM on the incidence of TB across different spatiotemporal scales, and the findings provide strong scientific evidence for pollution mitigation and efforts to reduce regional inequality."

Levy,A Novel Method for Generating Spatially Resolved Synthetic Populations for Health Impact Assessments in Vulnerable Populations,"The spatial resolution of environmental exposure and sociodemographic population data is often mismatched given limited publicly available population data that complies with privacy requirements for individuals. To address this limitation, we developed a novel matching algorithm to construct a synthetic population at the address‐level. To demonstrate how our approach can improve environmental justice (EJ) analyses and health impact assessments (HIAs), we examined sociodemographic patterns of residential proximity to major roadways in Greater Boston (Massachusetts) and HIA results, comparing our method with a random address allocation method. The synthetic population was developed at a census tract‐level using US Census microdata and combinatorial optimization methods and then downscaled to address‐level parcels by matching building attributes to synthetic households. We designated households within 50 m of a major road “high exposure” and households below state median household income “low income”.We found misclassification for individual households (21% of the high exposure/low‐income households in the matched data set were identified as such in the random allocation data set). We found modest aggregate differences in matched allocation (3.3% of low‐income households had high exposure) compared to random allocation (3.4%). In a HIA, the difference between random and matched allocation would be stronger when there is a strong interactive effect between a sociodemographic effect modifier and exposure on the outcome. Address‐level exposure assignment based on synthetic populations can provide more significant and nuanced health impact and EJ analyses. Our novel method can be applied to other regions of the US and expanded to other dimensions of population vulnerability."

 Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas (≳107 K), forming the intracluster medium (ICM)1. Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM decline towards earlier times, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still assembling and being heated2–4. To date, hot ICM has been securely detected only in a few systems at or above z ≈ 2, leaving the timing and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain5–7. Here we report the direct observation of hot intracluster gas via its thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich signature in the protocluster SPT2349–56 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. SPT2349–56 hosts a large molecular gas reservoir and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) within an approximately 100-kpc region at z = 4.3 (refs. 8–11). The measurement implies a thermal energy of  about 1061 erg in the core, about 10 times more than gravity alone should produce. Contrary to current theoretical expectations3,4,12, the hot ICM in SPT2349–56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur very early in cluster assembly, depositing enough energy to overheat the nascent ICM well before mature clusters become common at z ≈ 2. Detection of hot intracluster gas in SPT2349−56 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array provides new insights into early cluster formation."

 The response of net forest carbon uptake to warm extremes remains elusive. The year 2023 was at the time ‘the hottest year on record’ globally, with Canada’s forests experiencing warm anomalies of above 2 °C and unprecedented drought and wildfires, providing a unique case to examine the response of boreal forest net carbon uptake to climate extremes. Here we combine satellite-based atmospheric CO2 flux inversions with ground-based in situ observations of CO2 fluxes and concentrations to investigate Canada’s forest net carbon uptake and its underlying mechanisms in 2023. We find that, compared with 2015–2022, Canada’s forest net carbon uptake was enhanced by 0.28 ± 0.23 PgC, offsetting 38–48% of Canadian wildfire emissions in 2023. This enhanced net uptake was dominated by large ecosystem respiration reductions, mainly attributable to severe root-zone soil moisture deficits and the unimodal temperature response of respiration. However, most dynamic global vegetation models failed to simulate the respiration reductions and the responses to hydrothermal conditions well. This study improves our understanding of boreal forest net carbon uptake in response to climate extremes and highlights an urgent need to improve vegetation models under global warming. The extreme hot and dry conditions of 2023 reduced soil respiration and enhanced net forest carbon sequestration in Canada, offsetting wildfire emissions, according to satellite-based and in situ observations of CO2 fluxes."

 Projections of future sea-level rise benefit from understanding the response of past ice sheets to warming during past Quaternary interglacials. Constraints on the extent of inland Greenland Ice Sheet retreat during the Middle Holocene (~8–4 thousand years before present) are limited because geological records of a smaller-than-modern phase largely remain beneath the modern ice sheet. We drilled through 509 metres of firn and ice at Prudhoe Dome, northwestern Greenland, to obtain sub-ice material yielding direct evidence for the response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to Holocene warmth. Here we present infrared stimulated luminescence measurements from sub-ice sediments that indicate that the ground below the summit was exposed to sunlight 7.1 ± 1.1 thousand years ago. This proposed complete deglaciation of Prudhoe Dome, coeval to reduced extent at other ice caps across northern Greenland, is consistent with interglacial-only δ18O values from the Prudhoe Dome ice column and ice depth–age modelling. Our results point to a substantial response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to early Holocene warming, estimated to be +3–5 °C from palaeoclimate data. This range of summer temperatures is similar to projections of warming by 2100 CE.

 Wildfires affect land surface and post-fire geomorphological activity worldwide, increasing surface runoff and soil erosion. However, a global quantitative assessment considering the cumulative effect of several wildfires is still missing. Here we present a global assessment of post-fire soil erosion, considering cumulative wildfire-driven geomorphological changes over the last two decades. We estimate global trends of post-fire soil erosion using a global database on wildfire occurrence and fire severity, and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model together with the recovery of those burned landscapes by remote sensed data. Our results show that when considering multiple wildfire events, global post-fire soil erosion accounts for 8.1 ± 0.72 Pg annually, representing 19% of the global soil erosion budget and an additional 5.1 ± 0.56 Pg soil erosion annually in comparison to pre-fire conditions. Moreover, soil erosion attributed to the first post-fire year represents 31% of the total soil erosion, whereas the remaining share can be attributed to previous wildfire occurrences. Globally, Africa is the continent that is impacted the most in terms of post-fire soil erosion, given its substantially larger burned area. Our results illustrate the magnitude of post-fire soil erosion globally and therefore support post-fire management actions towards the mitigation and restoration of affected areas and policies towards land-degradation neutrality.

 RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes cytosolic transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) essential to cellular function. However, many aspects of Pol III transcription and processing, including RNA modifications, remain poorly understood, mainly due to a lack of available sensitive and systematic methods for their analysis. Here, we present DRAP3R (Direct Read and Analysis of Polymerase III transcribed RNAs), a modified nanopore direct RNA sequencing approach and analysis framework that enables the specific and sensitive capture of pre-mature Pol III transcribed RNAs. Applying DRAP3R to distinct cell types, we identify previously unconfirmed tRNA genes and other novel Pol III transcribed RNAs, thus expanding the known Pol III transcriptome. Critically, DRAP3R also enables discrimination between co- and post-transcriptional RNA modifications such as pseudouridine (Ψ) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) at single-nucleotide resolution across all examined transcript types and reveals differential Ψ installation patterns across tRNA isodecoders and other ncRNAs. Finally, applying DRAP3R to epithelial cells infected with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 reveals an extensive remodelling of both the Pol III transcriptome and epitranscriptome. Our findings thus establish DRAP3R as a powerful tool for systematically studying Pol III transcribed RNAs and their modifications in diverse cellular contexts.

 Strike-slip restraining bends, such as the Levant Fault, belonging to push-up systems and the Jamaican fault network, belonging to duplex systems, display a diversity of fault geometries and deformation patterns that reflect distinct modes of lithospheric-scale strain localization. To investigate the origin of this variability, we develop 3D numerical models of transpressional strike-slip systems using heterogeneous simple shear boundary conditions and thermally-dependent, non-linear rheology. Unlike classical analog or numerical models that impose velocity discontinuities, our approach allows spontaneous fault localization that naturally generates transpression. We systematically explore how the position and geometry of inherited weak zones influence fault development. We show that three distinct strike-slip systems emerge: (1) push-up systems with a single strike-slip fault and outward-propagating thrusts; (2) duplex systems with interacting parallel faults connected by P-shears; and (3) systems of non-interacting parallel faults. These results highlight spontaneous strike-slip localization and how initial heterogeneities control formation and evolution of long-term lithospheric deformation.

 Whether a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine is necessary for adolescents remains controversial. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from the Immunization Information System and The National Notifiable Disease Reporting System to evaluate the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programs (universal infant hepatitis B immunization and adolescent booster) on HBV infection. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) of hepatitis B vaccine is 64.43% (95% CI 57.78% − 71.08%) within 10 years of birth, escalates to 95.36% (95% CI 94.84% − 95.88%) by 20 years, and decreases to 67.35% (95% CI 63.86% − 70.85%) by 30 years. Compared with Beijing’s birth-vaccinated-only group, the booster group showed a lower relative VE in the first 10 years but a slight increase thereafter. Compared with the national control group, the booster group maintained a relatively high relative VE with a smaller decline magnitude.

Here, authors visualize and quantify strain in layered oxides through electron backscatter diffraction imaging, revealing heterogeneous, cycle-dependent distortions that slow Li transport and limit capacity, with irreversible layer bending driving capacity fade. 
 Lattice strain critically affects electrochemical performance and durability of battery electrode materials. Here we report an electron-backscatter-diffraction-based imaging method to quantify lattice strain evolution and its spatial heterogeneity in two technologically important layered oxide cathodes (i.e. positive electrodes). Quantitative analysis is achieved by examining numerical distribution of the crystal misorientation data from thousands of positive electrode particles, which follows a positively skewed distribution. We reveal pronounced lattice strain heterogeneities both within individual grains and across different particles. These strain variations self-heal during relithiation but intensify with deeper delithiation and repeated cycling. The increased strain impedes Li-ion bulk diffusion, thereby limiting the maximum accessible capacity, especially at high current densities. Three-dimensional pole-figure analysis further identifies layer bending and layer twisting as the two major lattice distortion modes in the electrochemically cycled positive electrode particles. The accumulation of the unrecoverable layer bending governs the kinetically controlled capacity loss in the layered oxide positive electrodes. Lattice strain impacts battery cathode performance and cycle life.

Here the authors demonstrate on-demand conversion of single phonons into high-purity telecom photons with low thermal noise and MHz-scale narrow bandwidth using a quasi-2D optomechanical system. 
 Nano-structured optomechanical crystals (OMC) form an interface between mechanical modes with long coherence times and telecom optical photons, ideal for long-distance distribution of quantum information. However, the implementation of scalable quantum networks based on OMCs has been inhibited by thermal mechanical noise. Here, we overcome this limitation using a quasi-two-dimensional OMC and generate single photons via single phonon-photon conversion. In this work, we verify the low thermal noise and high purity of the generated single photons through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment with $${g}^{(2)}(0)=0.3{5}_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$$. We perform Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the emitted photons showcasing the indistinguishability and coherence with visibility V = 0.52 ± 0.15 after 1.43 km fiber delay. Lastly, we use two-photon interference to measure the temporal wavepackets of optomechanically generated single photons demonstrating narrow bandwidths as low as 10 MHz. Our results pave the way for multinode quantum networks of mechanical oscillators and hybrid entanglement generation between mechanical oscillators and telecom quantum emitters.

 Enantioselective dicarbofunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful strategy for constructing functionalized sp³-rich molecules, yet it remains challenging for unactivated substrates lacking directing groups. While asymmetric multicomponent reactions catalyzed by d¹⁰ transition metals have advanced for activated alkenes, enantioselective multicomponent cross-coupling of unactivated alkenes, particularly enabling remote functionalization to stereoselectively generate the nonadjacent stereocenters, is still underdeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium-catalyzed asymmetric migratory dicarbofunctionalization of directing-group-free, trisubstituted unactivated alkenes. This method forges remote stereogenic centers, enabling both 1,3-diarylation and 1,4-diarylation with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies indicate a chain-walking process involving irreversible Pd-H migration, rationalizing the observed regiocontrol.

 High-precision metrology has laid the foundation for semiconductor fabrication and life sciences. However, existing displacement measurement approaches are incapable of performing flexible probing within complex equipment interiors. Here, we present a in situ, non-contact nano-displacement measurement approach. Leveraging a multimode fiber probe empowered by deep learning, fine feature information can be efficiently extracted from superoscillatory speckles, achieving single-ended detection with 10 nm resolution and 99.95% accuracy. A physical model is established to correlate the displacement with higher-order modes proportion in the fiber. Sub-millimeter-sized probe enables detecting targets with different structures in confined spaces. Robust recognition is achieved through joint learning, under varying fiber bending conditions and different metal materials. With extreme compression ratios of less than 0.1%, the system delivers high accuracy, low training costs, and high-speed processing. The imaging capability of the probe is also experimentally validated, proving potential as a powerful tool in applications such as lithography, weak force sensing, and super-resolution micro-endoscopy.

Through a registered report megastudy, researchers tested the ten most-cited climate change messaging strategies published, finding that many had significant, but small, effects on climate change attitudes. 
 It is important to understand how persuasive the most-cited climate change messaging strategies are. In five replication studies, we found limited evidence of persuasive effects of three highly cited strategies (N = 3,216). We then conducted a registered report megastudy (N = 13,544) testing the effects of the 10 most-cited climate change messaging strategies on Americans’ pro-environmental attitudes and behaviour. Six messages significantly affected multiple preregistered attitudes, with effects ranging from 1 to 4 percentage points. Persuasiveness varied little across party lines, inconsistent with theories predicting heterogeneous effects for targeted messages. No message increased pro-environmental donations, suggesting costly behaviours are difficult to influence with messaging alone. Inference of mechanisms driving effects was limited as the most impactful messages influenced multiple mediating variables. Taken together, these results identify several persuasive strategies, while also highlighting the limits of short-form messages for increasing Americans’ support for action to address climate change.

A study in Nepal shows that forest governance decentralization reduces poverty but the benefits are greater for dominant ethnic and caste groups compared with minority ones. 
 Decentralized approaches to natural resource governance can promote conservation while reducing poverty in the Global South. However, the local benefits under decentralized governance are often unequal, reflecting extant social inequalities. There is a lack of rigorous evidence from national-scale studies showing how decentralization programmes affect inequality compared with what is observed in decentralization’s absence, and extant theory leads to competing hypotheses about such effects. We use data from a large-scale forestry-sector decentralization programme in Nepal during 2001–2011 to test general theories regarding the effects of such initiatives on inequality. We analyse census micro-data from two nationwide censuses, which we merge with administrative data on the implementation of decentralization and analyse through a two-way fixed-effects estimation approach. We find evidence suggesting that Nepal’s programme delivers significant poverty-alleviating benefits to the dominant ethnic and caste groups and comparatively smaller benefits to members of marginalized minority groups, resulting in apparent local increases in rural inequality associated with the programme. Thus, even relatively progressive programmes, such as Nepal’s, may lead to potential trade-offs between poverty alleviation, environmental conservation and inequality outcomes. Improved compliance with equity provisions may help to equalize effects, as could more substantial targeted benefits. Decentralized natural resource governance is thought to aid conservation and reduce poverty, but its heterogeneous local effects are under-explored. A study in Nepal shows that forest governance decentralization reduces poverty but the benefits are greater for dominant ethnic and caste groups compared with minority ones."

 Aerosols can influence vegetation through multiple processes, yet the resulting biophysical climate feedback from the vegetation response remains poorly understood. Here, using an ensemble of Earth system models and an observation-based empirical model, we show that the vegetation response to complete removal of anthropogenic aerosols can either cool or warm the local climate by up to 0.039 ± 0.020 °C (multimodel mean ± intermodel standard deviation) through altering albedo and evapotranspiration. This feedback exhibits distinct latitudinal asymmetry, resulting, on average, in cooling (–0.0083 ± 0.0070 °C) in boreal regions, moderate cooling (–0.0036 ± 0.0017 °C) in temperate zones, and slight warming (0.0007 ± 0.0011 °C) in the tropics (excluding the Amazon). Future projections suggest that stringent aerosol control could amplify the local cooling effect of vegetation across most vegetated areas. These findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway by which aerosols influence vegetation climate effects, highlighting the need for integrated policies on air quality control and vegetation-based climate solutions."

 Offline aridity and drought diagnostics typically project widespread terrestrial drying under climate change, whereas fully coupled Earth system models (ESMs) often simulate modest or regionally heterogeneous changes—and in some regions increasing—runoff. This long-standing divergence has been attributed largely to missing vegetation physiological effects and the neglect of sub-annual climate variability in offline diagnostic frameworks. Here, we show that a more fundamental issue is the violation of the diagnostic framework’s structural requirement that potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation (P) act as independent climatic constraints. Using Penman and Penman–Monteith formulations, each with and without thermodynamic deflation via the complementary evaporation principle (CEP), we demonstrate that land–atmosphere feedbacks embedded in conventional PET estimates induce strong negative P–PET correlations (−0.45 ± 0.29; mean ± standard deviation) across land surfaces, which collapse toward near zero (−0.02 ± 0.42) after CEP deflation. Preserving PET–P independence substantially reduces inflation of the aridity index and brings offline diagnostic ET trends closer to ESM projections under a strong-emission scenario (from +0.61 to +0.39 mm yr−2; ESM mean: +0.28 mm yr−2). These results indicate that structural inconsistencies—rather than missing physiological processes alone—play a central role in the mismatch between offline diagnostics and ESM hydrology. Ensuring that PET is not inflated by land–atmosphere feedbacks is therefore essential for theoretically valid offline hydrologic assessments under a warming climate."

 Freshwater salinization is an emerging and largely unregulated threat to drinking water security. We identify three dominant, seasonally distinct sources of rising sodium in a drinking water supply serving 1 million people: (1) road deicers, which elevate reservoir sodium in winter, with detectable impacts at watershed impervious cover as low as 3%; (2) reclaimed water, which increases sodium during summer low flows when dilution is minimal; and (3) the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), which adds NaOH to neutralize acidity from coagulation and in-reservoir microbial processes. In this social-ecological-technological system (SETS), salinization is tied to population growth, impervious cover, sodium-rich waste streams, nitrogen management, reservoir biogeochemistry, and DWTP operations. Framing drinking water salinization as a SETS challenge integrates behavioral and biophysical drivers with engineering and governance responses, providing a framework for adaptation in One Water systems.

 Recent counterintuitive cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific, with prolonged impacts on global climate, has perplexed the climate community regarding its underlying causes. While previous studies have proposed many potential explanations, the present study identifies a distinct and previously underappreciated driver. Here, by conducting a series of sensitivity experiments, we demonstrate that an intensified annual cycle of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic can also drive a cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific over the past decades. The intensified annual cycle significantly alters the distribution of seasonal precipitation, leading to a net reduction of annual mean precipitation in the equatorial Atlantic. This dry state is accompanied by lower-troposphere divergence, inducing easterly anomalies along the equatorial Pacific and ultimately leading to a strong Pacific cooling. Our findings unveil a previously overlooked role of the tropical Atlantic annual cycle change in regulating tropical Pacific climate and shaping large-scale climate patterns. Recent observed cooling in the Pacific Ocean is driven by an intensified annual cycle of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic altering the distribution of seasonal precipitation, according to analyses of idealized experiments and climate model simulations."

 Droughts and heatwaves are linked through different land-atmosphere coupling pathways. While high temperatures and depleted soil moisture (SM) characterize all drought-heatwave events, latent heat flux (LHF) reveals the dominant forcing mechanism driving these events. Our grid-based analysis of six drought-heatwave events since 2000 shows spatially inhomogeneous land-atmosphere coupling associated with surface flux partitioning. Atmospherically driven regimes, characterized by increased LHF following hot temperature anomalies, accounted for the majority of the 2022 East Asia event (64.8%). Land surface-driven regimes, exhibiting LHF deficits following dry SM anomalies, were most prevalent in the 2023 Central America event (45.4%). Using a medium-range forecast model, we reproduced both events and showed that the water-limited (2023 Central America) case exhibits a lead-time predictability improvement of about 2-3 days relative to the energy-limited (2022 East Asia) case. These results highlight the limits of domain-averaged coupling in the model and the potential to improve the model forecasted drought-heatwaves when incorporate regime-based characteristics.

 Desert is a crucial component of terrestrial ecosystems, and its optical reflection properties are essential for understanding land surface radiative balance. Combining the hyperspectral and angular measurements has been considered as an effective method to characterize optical reflection properties of desert surfaces. However, the ground and satellite-based instruments cannot obtain both hyperspectral and angular reflectance of desert surfaces at appropriate scales due to the limitations of their measurement configurations. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a spectrometer to perform hyperspectral BRDF measurements of six desert areas in Northwest China to overcome the limitations. In the comparison with those obtained from laboratory and satellite observations at the same geometries, it is found that UAV-measured hyperspectral reflectance has a spectral shape similar to that of spectra measured in laboratory settings, and UAV-measured angular reflectance shows a good match of BRDF characterization as the satellite observations in the hemispherical space. Moreover, we compared the modeled angular reflectance, which are derived from BRDF models, with measured angular reflectance of deserts at selected wavelengths from MODIS. The BRDF models using UAV-measured hyperspectral BRDF have superior performance in spectral BRDF simulation. The uncertainty analysis based on a Bayesian inversion further confirmed the reliability of the UAV data in effectively characterizing optical properties of the desert surface. These results demonstrate the robustness of UAV-based spectral and angular measurements in quantifying the hyperspectral BRDF, which provide comprehensive in-situ optical properties of desert surfaces. These data can serve as valuable validation for future studies on radiative balance of desert surfaces."

 The slip-surface geometry of a landslide is crucial for stability analysis and early warning, making its accurate and detailed characterization essential for hazard assessment and mitigation. However, traditional methods for obtaining slip-surface geometry are resource-intensive, requiring significant manpower and materials. Some studies have used the three-dimensional (3D) deformation from remote sensing data to infer detailed slip-surface geometry of landslides using the mass conservation method. However, this method usually requires prior data to calibrate the model parameters, and its underlying assumptions may not be valid for all landslide scenarios. In this study, we designed an Extended Vector Inclination Method (EVIM) to determine detailed landslide slip-surface geometry and established a framework for deriving landslide thickness based on 3D deformation derived from SAR and optical remote sensing data. The experiments based on actual events (Hooskanaden, Shangxintian, and Daopo landslide) and simulations demonstrate that EVIM can reliably estimate landslide thickness in a manner consistent with in-situ measurements. Furthermore, simulations indicate that the magnitude of deformation and the error in the constrained 3D deformation affect the accuracy of our method. We conclude that in cases where the mass conservation method is difficult to apply (e.g., landslides lacking prior information), the EVIM may serve as an alternative method. The proposed framework enables rapid slip-surface inversion, making it well-suited for regional-scale landslide stability assessments."

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2026.121772,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究涉及发展一个新的WRF-Chem/Fire耦合模型来研究烟雾羽流与气象的相互作用，重点关注野火排放如何通过气溶胶-气象反馈影响野火蔓延，这与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、大气成分分析）密切相关。,"['WRF-Chem', 'aerosols', 'fire spread', 'radiative effect', 'atmospheric composition']",Zhonghua He;Jie Luo;Congcong Li;Gaofeng Fan;Bin Xu;Lingxiang Wang;Zhao-Cheng Zeng;Dongmei Huang;Yuping Sun;Hao He,Fire emissions modulate wildfire spread through aerosol-meteorology feedbacks: Insights from a novel WRF-Chem/Fire coupled model,"•A coupled WRF-Chem and fire model framework is developed to investigate smoke-plume interactions. •Wildfire emissions induce a time-varying feedback, first suppressing then accelerating fire spread. •The integrated radiative effect of aerosols drives meteorology and fire spread. 
 Wildfires represent a devastating global natural hazard, with profound ecological, economic, and societal impacts. Accurate prediction of fire behavior is paramount, yet state-of-the-art models like WRF-Fire often neglect the critical meteorological feedbacks induced by fire-emitted aerosols. To address this gap, this study develops a novel modeling framework that integrates WRF-Chem with WRF-Fire to systematically quantify how smoke-radiation interactions influence near-surface meteorology and subsequent fire behavior. Through a series of sensitivity experiments, we demonstrate that fire emissions trigger a complex, time-dependent feedback loop. Initially, aerosols suppress near-surface winds and moderate temperatures in our simulations, leading to a slower Rate of Spread (ROS) and a constrained burned area. However, as the fire persists, the accumulated emissions fundamentally alter the local atmosphere, intensifying the wind field through fire-induced circulations. This results in a dramatic reversal, with the ”With Fire” scenario subsequently exhibiting the most rapid fire front propagation. Our analysis reveals that the integrated radiative effect of all aerosols, rather than the contribution of any single species like black carbon (BC) or organic carbon (OC), is the dominant driver of these meteorological perturbations. This work concludes that incorporating these dynamic, time-evolving aerosol-meteorology-fire feedbacks is not a mere refinement but a crucial necessity for advancing the predictive accuracy of wildfire models, especially for extreme events, thereby informing more effective mitigation and response strategies."
