Results showed that these variations were controlled by the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) seasonality. Compared to El Niño winters, the ISPNA exhibits a stronger early‐to‐late winter enhancement during La Niña winters. Furthermore, the MJO and the ISPNA exhibit a phase‐locked relationship, which is more pronounced and reliable in late winter. The Rossby wave activity associated with the MJO that propagates northward from the tropics toward the subtropical action center of the ISPNA indicates that increased MJO activity contributes to greater ISPNA intensity. The MJO also exhibits clear seasonality, exhibiting enhancement from early winter to late winter, which is particularly evident during La Niña winters and results in intensified ISPNA during these periods."

The winter +CG PBs can be characterized with an initiation height from 0.9 to 4.4 km, a propagation distance from 0.2 to 2.6 km, a propagation speed from 3.5×105 $3.5\times {10}^{5}$ to 5.4×106 $5.4\times {10}^{6}$ m/s without significant differences between upward and downward PBs. The time interval and the 2D displacement distance from the PB initiation to the first RS range from 6.1 to 603.7 ms, from 0 to 39.2 km, respectively. Return strokes with strongest intensities tend to have shorter intervals and 2D displacements between PB and RS. We also found some weak correlations between the PB characteristic parameters. All 60 +CGs involved multiple charge regions with opposite polarities and small separations. Finally, we have discussed our findings."

Van Roozendael,Atmospheric HONO Observed Over Global Biomass Burning Regions Using Satellite Observations of TROPOMI and GEMS,"Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key tropospheric species primarily due to ist role as a source of the hydroxyl radical (OH), which is pivotal in breaking down pollutants and greenhouse gases and is also a key ingredient to photochemical air pollution. Recent HONO measurements from space in fresh biomass burning plumes offer the potential to inform about HONO formation mechanisms globally. However, research is needed to further develop, interpret, and evaluate the satellite retrievals. Here, we present a new global HONO column data set of 5.5 years from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We leverage the Covariance‐Based Retrieval Algorithm to significantly improve the sensitivity to weak HONO signals over all biomass burning regions. Radiative transfer simulations for retrieving HONO columns indicate a strong dependence on plume height and smoke aerosols. Such information is mostly inaccessible from space for thick plumes but can be obtained from suborbital measurements during dedicated campaigns. We compare the TROPOMI HONO columns to aircraft observations from the BB‐FLUX campaign. When explicitly accounting for aerosols, the satellite and aircraft data are in good agreement albeit with significant comparison uncertainty. We also evaluate the TROPOMI retrievals against HONO columns measured by IASI and discuss the differences. Next, we demonstrate the potential of geostationary satellites like the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer to provide temporally resolved information on pyrogenic HONO. Finally, we find a close relationship between satellite HONO detections and fire intensity both in space and time, highlighting the likely dominance of HONO production during the flaming phase of the fires."

Projected changes in carbonaceous aerosols during the summer will impact atmospheric chemistry and climate, but our understanding of these processes is limited by sparse observations. Here, we characterize carbonaceous aerosol in Alaska, USA: Toolik Field Station in the Interior and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement facility at Utqiaġvik on the Arctic coast, during the summers of 2022 and 2023. We estimated PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using laser light scattering (PurpleAir sensors) and examined total carbon (TC) and its organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) fractions in total suspended particles (TSP). We investigated the dominant sources of carbonaceous aerosol using air mass backward‐trajectories from the NOAA HYSPLIT model and radiocarbon source apportionment of TC. TC concentrations were about twice as high in the Interior compared to the coast, with contemporary sources dominating at both Toolik (95%–99%) and Utqiaġvik (86%–89%) over minor contributions from fossil sources. Elevated PM, TC, OC, and EC concentrations coincided with major boreal forest fire activity in North America that brought smoke to the region. The radiocarbon signature of EC measured at Toolik during these wildfire events indicated that over 90% of the EC came from contemporary sources. Our measurements demonstrate the potential for Arctic aerosol concentrations to respond significantly to climate warming‐induced changes to the landscape and emphasize the need for continuous atmospheric monitoring to advance our understanding of this rapidly changing environment."

McFarquhar,Marine Boundary Layer Cloud Condensation Nuclei Bias Over the Southern Ocean: Comparisons Between the Community Atmosphere Model 6 and Field Observations,"Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds play a crucial role in regulating radiative balance in the atmosphere. Previous studies identified that MBL cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is underestimated by a factor of 2 over the summertime Southern Ocean (SO) close to the Antarctic coast in many models. Here, comparisons between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) observations from field campaigns during the 2017–2018 Austral summer over the Australasian sector of the SO and simulated CCN from the Community Atmospheric Model 6 (CAM6) are presented. Modeled MBL CCN number concentration (NCCN) is underestimated, by close to 100% at latitudes south of 55°S with the NCCN bias (a) largest close to the Antarctic Plateau during summer, implying the biased CCN type has seasonal and latitudinal variation and, (b) three times larger over sea ice than over open water, implying sea spray CCN are better simulated compared to secondary CCN. Assessments of aerosol size distributions indicate an underestimation of accumulation‐mode‐aerosols (Ac) with diameters 70 nm < D < 100 nm. CCN supersaturation spectra indicate that the observed CCN had lower hygroscopicity compared to simulated CCN, implying differences in CCN chemical composition. With secondary aerosols including sulfate being less hygroscopic than sea salt CCN, the CCN activation ratio derived using bulk hygroscopicity kappa in the Abdul‐Razzak function leads to an underestimation of critical supersaturation south of 62°S. The biases reported here highlight important shortfalls in simulated CCN that can be important to the well‐documented underestimated Nd by Earth System Models, a key feature and uncertainty of pre‐industrial conditions."

Recently the inclusion of anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor into similarity theory of near‐surface turbulence has been proposed. Anisotropy is quantified through the eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor, which can be visualized by geometric shapes. We conduct a systematic investigation of velocity variances and covariances conditional to this geometric shape with the purpose of identifying common patterns. We discuss the influence of eigenvectors' directions on turbulent transport in relation to the streamline coordinates defined along the mean wind vector. Eigenvectors' direction identifies the orientation of anisotropic shapes, and this geometric approach is meant to investigate if physical constraints on orientation exist, as these could inform turbulence parameterizations. Two data sets are used for the analyses, one from a relatively flat terrain and one from a glacier site. Results show that it is not possible to identify a unique orientation for each anisotropy. Geometric shapes span a broad range of inclinations in the vertical, not strongly constrained by height or atmospheric stability. However, anisotropic turbulence is shown to have shallower inclination than isotropic turbulence. One‐component states, ubiquitous under stable stratification, are well described by the orientation of the dominant eigenvector in the horizontal, characterized by large horizontal covariance, or large variance which aligns anisotropy in the streamwise/spanwise direction. Results highlight that the geometric orientation of turbulence may depend on the site and future investigations will include geometric parameters characterizing the orography in the analyses."

Moreover, they tend to have a very high spatiotemporal variability. In order to understand this variability, long‐term measurements with high temporal resolution are essential. This paper presents an analysis of 3 months of online INP measurements (10 min time‐resolved), using a PINE cloud chamber (−33°C ≤ T ≤ −22°C). Measurements were made from December 2022 to March 2023 at the PUY station (France, 1,465 m a.s.l), a site exposed to a variety of air masses including free troposphere conditions. A large part of the temporal variability of INP concentrations (over four orders of magnitude at a single temperature) can be explained by air mass origin. INP concentrations measured for oceanic air masses are in the lower range (from ≈0.1 to ≈10 L−1). Those for continental air masses are in a medium range (from ≈1 to ≈100 L−1) and depend on the level of pollution of the air mass. INP concentrations measured for southern air masses show highest concentrations (from ≈10 to ≈500 L−1) and mostly depend on the amount of dust in the ambient air. Moreover, measurements were conducted during two dust events revealing INP concentrations over 1000 L−1 at −32°C. Subsequently, a set of parameterizations capable of tracing the measured INP variability were developed. This will facilitate our understanding of the impact of INP concentrations on mixed‐phase cloud properties with cloud models."

Typical amplitudes range from 1 to 5 m2s−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{2}{\mathrm{s}}^{-2}$ and are generally, though not always, out of phase with the horizontal wind consistent with wind‐induced dissipation of upward‐propagating GWs. The 2‐day wave‐modulated GW drag ranges between 20 and 140 m s−1day−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}\ {\text{day}}^{-1}$ and can amplify, damp, and alter the phase of the 2‐day wave.

Chen;C. Zhang;S. Xiao;S. Zhang,How Many Floods Have Occurred in China in the Past Decade? A Perspective From Social Media,"Global climate change has led to frequent and widespread flood disasters in China. Traditional flood disaster investigations mainly focus on major flood events, and small‐scale flood events are often overlooked. This study utilized the Sina Weibo social media platform to detect flood events in 370 cities in China from 2012 to 2023. We downloaded 73.52 million Weibo posts and developed a two‐step flood detection algorithm. In the first step, the algorithm initially identifies 956 flood events based on changes in posting frequency. In the second step, an LDA topic model is used to detect topics for these flood events and automatically filter out false events, resulting in 729 flood events. Verification of these events confirmed that 629 of the 729 were real flood events, achieving a detection accuracy of 86.28%. In the end, after excluding all false flood events and reinstating the mistakenly removed real ones, we obtained a total of 674 verified flood events. Among these 370 cities, 194 cities experienced flood disasters, accounting for 52.43% of the total. Additionally, we compared our findings with online news reports, as well as the flood data sets from the GDACS and EM‐DAT. We found that our study had a high detection rate for urban waterlogging events. However, there were cases of missed detection for flash floods and small watershed flood disasters. Nevertheless, this study represents the most comprehensive publicly available detection of flood events in China to date, which is of great significance for the government's flood management and decision‐making."

While sustained global emission controls have yielded significant environmental benefits, the associated climate penalty from complex radiative effects has induced additional warming, raising public concern. Our study reveals that increased coarse particles enhance fine particle coagulation, contributing to higher coarse particle levels and a reduction in coarse particle peak size, thereby scattering more solar radiation and mitigating the warming from reduced fine particles in Europe. From 1999 to 2021, changes in coarse particles offset 24.6% (26.3%) of the reduced cooling effect at the top (ground) of atmosphere from fine particle reductions. Our findings highlight the complex but significant role of aerosol size changes in influencing solar radiation budget, offering potential relief for global warming concerns and bolstering emissions reduction efforts, with important global and European implications amid ongoing and expected anthropogenic emission cuts."

Here, Spahn et al. show that the Escherichia coli nucleoid adopts a condensed, membrane-proximal configuration during rapid growth, with transcription and translation acting as main drivers of nucleoid organization. 
 Bacterial chromosomes are spatiotemporally organized and sensitive to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying chromosome configuration and reorganization are not fully understood. Here, we use single-molecule localization microscopy and live-cell imaging to show that the Escherichia coli nucleoid adopts a condensed, membrane-proximal configuration during rapid growth. Drug treatment induces a rapid collapse of the nucleoid from an apparently membrane-bound state within 10 min of halting transcription and translation. This hints toward an active role of transertion (coupled transcription, translation, and membrane insertion) in nucleoid organization, while cell wall synthesis inhibitors only affect nucleoid organization during morphological changes. Further, we provide evidence that the nucleoid spatially correlates with elongasomes in unperturbed cells, suggesting that large membrane-bound complexes might be hotspots for transertion. The observed correlation diminishes in cells with changed cell geometry or upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Replication inhibition experiments, as well as multi-drug treatments highlight the role of entropic effects and transcription in nucleoid condensation and positioning. Thus, our results indicate that transcription and translation, possibly in the context of transertion, act as a principal organizer of the bacterial nucleoid, and show that an altered metabolic state and antibiotic treatment lead to major changes in the spatial organization of the nucleoid.

 People routinely choose between options varying on multiple attributes – homes to rent, movies to watch, and so on. Here, we test how much awareness people have of the mental processes underlying these choices. We develop a method to quantify awareness of value-based multi-attribute choice processes that accounts for diverse choice strategies. Across five studies, participants make choices and then report how they believe they made them. We use computational modeling to identify the process revealed in their choices, and compare it to their self-reports to quantify individuals’ accuracy about their choice process. While we observe substantial variation in accuracy, participants are often highly accurate about their choice process – more accurate than predicted by a sample of decision scientists – and more accurate than informed third-party observers, suggesting evidence for introspection. These results challenge notions that we are strangers to ourselves and instead suggest that people often know how they made value-based choices.

 Advances in Artificial Intelligence envision a promising future, where the personalized Internet of Things can be revolutionized with the ability to continuously improve system efficiency and service quality. However, with the introduction of laws and regulations about data security and privacy protection, centralized solutions, which require data to be collected and processed directly on a central server, become impractical for personalized Internet of Things to train Artificial Intelligence models for a variety of domain-specific scenarios. Motivated by this, this paper introduces Cedar, a secure, cost-efficient and domain-adaptive framework to train personalized models in a crowdsourcing-based and privacy-preserving manner. In essentials, Cedar integrates federated learning and meta-learning to enable a safeguarded knowledge transfer within personalized Internet of Things for models with high generalizability that can be rapidly adapted by individuals. Through evaluation using standard datasets from various domains, Cedar is seen to achieve significant improvements in saving, elevating, accelerating and enhancing the learning cost, efficiency, speed, and security, respectively. These results reveal the feasibility and robust-ness of federated meta-learning in orchestrating heterogeneous resources in the cloud-edge-device continuum and defending malicious attacks commonly existed in the Internet, thereby unlockingthe potential of Artificial Intelligence in reforming personalized Internet of Things.

 Breast and cervical cancers are important causes of disability and premature death among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Previous research has linked girls’ education to cancer service access. Here, we examine the causal effect of girls’ educational attainment on cancer screening practices by means of a natural experiment in Lesotho. In particular, we exploit variation in educational attainment among women that was introduced by an educational policy (a school-entry age cut-off). Data on awareness towards breast cancer, knowledge of Pap smear, breast self-exam, breast clinical exam, and having received a Pap smear is extracted from the Lesotho Demographic and Health Surveys 2009-10 and 2014 (N = 7971). Each additional year of schooling caused by the education policy increases awareness of breast cancer by 4.7 percentage points (p = 0.014, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.0, 8.5), awareness of Pap smear by 5.9 percentage points (p = 0.001, 95% CI: 2.3, 9.5), and engagement in Pap smear by 3.5 percentage points (p = 0.004, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.8).

 Calorie restriction (CR) provides anti-aging benefits through diverse processes, such as reduced metabolism and growth and increased mitochondrial activity. Although controversy still exists regarding CR-mediated lifespan effects, many researchers are seeking interventions that mimic the effects of CR. Yeast has proven to be a useful model system for aging studies, including CR effects. We report here that yeast adapted through in vitro evolution to the severe cellular stress caused by loss of the Ulp2 SUMO-specific protease exhibit both enhanced growth rates and replicative lifespan, and they have altered gene expression profiles similar to those observed in CR. Notably, in certain evolved ulp2Δ lines, an increase in the auto-sumoylation of Ubc9 E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme results in altered regulation of multiple targets involved in energy metabolism and translation at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. This increase is essential for the survival of aged cells and CR-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, we suggest that high Ubc9 auto-sumoylation exerts potent anti-aging effects by promoting efficient energy metabolism-driven improvements in cell replication abilities. This potential could be therapeutically explored for the development of promising CR-mimetic strategies. Calorie restriction (CR) offers anti-aging benefits via diverse mechanisms.

 Subsurface technologies including Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage, geothermal systems, and hydrogen storage face persistent technical-economic barriers in monitoring precision and cost-effectiveness. Here we present a DNA sequencing method to track microbial communities in subsurface fluid flow. It addresses three main challenges: the lack of large-scale time-lapse monitoring, the absence of microbial tracer selection, and the oversight of front propagation velocity. The method is applied across all stages of a reservoir’s circulating water injection lifecycle, including initial injection, ongoing circulation, post-injection monitoring, and production. The injection and production well samples are analyzed to select stable microbial tracers, enabling flow-front velocity-integrated mapping of subsurface fluid pathways via principal coordinate analysis. The accuracy is validated through physical simulation experiments and the Kalman filter method, enabling 44-day time-lapse, large-scale dynamic monitoring of 1300m-deep subsurface fluid flow pathways. This study helps reduce uncertainties in geoenergy development, supporting the goal of a net-zero emission world.

 Boreal drained-peatland forests provide diverse, interlinked ecosystem services (ESs), critical for informed decision-making in forest management. We mapped five ESs: bilberry yield, visual amenity, biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and timber production using Landsat 8–9, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope data. By combining these five ESs variables, we calculated a summed-ESs variable to capture overall ESs in drained peatland forests. Our objectives included assessing the influence of sensor resolution, auxiliary data, and the feasibility of scaling ESs predictions across varying canopy covers (closed, partial, and open). Using spectral bands and indices, we applied random forest regression, achieving explained variances (R2) of 13–75 % for single ESs and 58–67 % for summed ESs. Sensor performance varied, with Landsat (R2 22–69 %), Sentinel-2 (R2 25–75 %), and PlanetScope (R2 13–65 %). Incorporating auxiliary variables from seven-year-old LiDAR data improved model R2 value by 1–24 %.

 This study introduces a flood index-enhanced deep learning model for coastal inundation mapping leveraging dual-polarization and bitemporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The proposed model, FIE-Net, introduces two key innovations to improve flood mapping accuracy. First, it integrates the Ratio Image (RI), a primary flood index derived from bitemporal SAR data, which provides a reliable reference for precise inundation area delineation. The index offers a clear, flood-specific signal that enhances segmentation precision. Second, the model employs a dual-branch U-Net framework, augmented with specialized modules to enhance feature extraction and better integrate diverse data sources. This combination enables the model to handle complex flood scenarios more effectively, thereby boosting overall performance. Using data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, 16 pairs of representative SAR images from Madagascar’s Tropical Cyclones 2018 AVA and 2023 Cheneso were collected under various terrain conditions. After semi-automatic labeling and cropping, 4350 sample pairs were processed, with 2784/696/870 used for model training/validation/testing. The proposed model achieved the highest Intersection over Union (IOU) of 79.44%, outperforming the state-of-the-art models across all evaluation metrics. The experiments also demonstrate that each introduced innovation contributes to improved accuracy, with the flood index making the most significant impact. Furthermore, the model’s applicability was further confirmed with three independent flooded areas (689 samples, not included in training) from the event Cheneso. IOUs in all three scenes consistently exceeded 75%, underscoring the model’s reliability and robustness in real-world scenarios."

 This study comprehensively analyzes trends in tropospheric ozone precursors over the Indian region from 2018 to 2024, focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and glyoxal (CHOCHO), using TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite datasets. Our results reveal contrasting trends: while HCHO and CHOCHO show consistent increases, NO2 exhibits a slight decrease over the past few years, likely reflecting the impact of emission control measures. The mean growth rate calculated for HCHO Vertical Column Density (VCD) is ∼1.7 % yr−1 and ∼2 % yr−1 for CHOCHO, whereas tropospheric NO2 VCDs show a slower growth rate of ∼ −0.21 %yr−1, indicating a reduction in NOx emissions over recent years. The growth rate of HCHO is consistent with findings from previous studies. However, unlike earlier long-term studies, a recent decline in NO2 has been observed. Long-term OMI dataset measurements are used to corroborate these findings. Analysis of the formaldehyde-to-nitrogen ratio indicates that the Indian mainland region is mostly NOx-limited in nature, and further shifts toward highly NOx-limited ozone production are observed in most parts of the study area. Seasonal patterns show pronounced peaks in NO2 during winter and HCHO and CHOCHO during pre- and post-monsoon seasons, underscoring the significant influence of biomass burning and agricultural activities on precursor levels. The seasonal variation in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and fire density was analyzed to assess emissions from biogenic and pyrogenic sources. These findings emphasize the complexity of ozone precursor dynamics in India, highlighting the need for targeted emission controls to mitigate regional ozone pollution."

 Ambient atmospheric aerosol particles consist of primary particles that are directly emitted and secondary particles that are formed through nucleation or chemical reactions. The number concentration of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, which has a significant impact on air quality and climate, is largely influenced by secondary particles formed through nucleation. Therefore, a precise understanding of nucleation is essential. Homogeneous nucleation is a mechanism in which new condensed-phase substances, aerosol particles, are generated through the phase transition of vapor under conditions of vapor supersaturation. Several theories have been proposed to explain nucleation processes, including H2SO4-H2O binary homogeneous nucleation, H2SO4-H2O-NH3 ternary homogeneous nucleation, and ion-mediated nucleation. In practice, many air quality models including Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling system (CMAQ) still use only H2SO4-H2O binary homogeneous nucleation module to calculate nucleation rates. The comparison and validation of different nucleation theories in the polluted regions of South Korea has never been conducted. In this study, we used CMAQv5.2 to simulate the aerosol number concentration at Seoul Olympic Park during the KORUS-AQ campaign. The results revealed that the model underestimated the aerosol number concentration by approximate a factor of 10 compared to observations. This is primarily due to nucleation rates, which raises the need for an alternative module with higher accuracy. To simulate nucleation rates and aerosol number concentrations, we applied five different nucleation modules to a box model Korea Air quality observation-based Box model (KAB) as well as a 3-dimensional chemical transport model CMAQ. Based on the KAB modeling results, the ion-mediated H2SO4-H2O binary nucleation module resulted in a significantly higher nucleation rate compared to the calculations from the existing modules (0.06 cm−3s−1 vs. 1.16 cm−3s−1), providing values closer to the observed nucleation rates. And according to the CMAQ modeling results, ternary H2SO4-H2O-NH3 homogeneous nucleation module gave the calculated aerosol number concentration the closest to the observed value. Such comparisons between modules are expected to be useful for selecting the most suitable nucleation module for the atmospheric conditions in South Korea."

 Heatwaves are becoming more intense, frequent, and prolonged due to global warming, posing significant risks to ecosystems and human societies. Despite their profound impact, detailed regional assessments of extreme heat events remain limited, particularly in India. This study addresses the gap by systematically investigating the 2024 extreme heat event in India. We evaluated the performance of various land surface schemes in simulating heat extremes using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and also assessed the accuracy of Global Forecast System (GFS) forecasts. Our analysis reveals a strong co-occurrence of drought and heat stress during the extreme heat event. This combination results in increased fire risk and negative impacts on vegetation productivity in regions affected by both drought and heat stress highlighting the severe consequences of this compound event. We compare different land surface models (RUC, Noah, Noah-MP, Noah-MP with dynamic vegetation, CLM) against India Meteorological Department (IMD) observations. We observe that Noah is optimal for reducing bias and RMSE, while Noah-MP with dynamic vegetation is most accurate for simulating extreme heat, with the highest hit rate and threat score for the 90th percentile threshold. Additionally, GFS maximum temperature forecasts for 1–3 day lead times perform well at short lead times, especially in Southern India but overestimate temperatures in heatwave-prone regions like the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Our findings highlight the importance of enhancing land surface models and forecasting systems to better predict extreme heat events, which is crucial for localized hazard and risk assessments and improving disaster management efficiency."

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and snowfall over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are key factors influencing interannual climate variability, and the relationship between ENSO and TP snowfall exhibits interdecadal variability. However, the types of El Niño events have undergone changes around 2000s, and it remains unclear whether these changes in El Niño event types influence the relationship with snowfall. In this study, we examine the relationship between El Niño events and winter snowfall over the TP using HadISST, and ERA5 reanalysis datasets as well as numerical experiments. Our results show the eastern Pacific El Niño (EPE) events are typically linked to positive winter snowfall anomalies over the TP, while the mixed-type El Niño (MPE) events are associated with negative anomalies, whereas the response of winter snowfall during the central Pacific El Niño (CPE) events exhibits considerable uncertainty. EPE events are associated with an anomalous deepening of the East Asian winter trough, while MPE events typically induce an anomalous atmospheric circulation wave pattern from the North Pacific to the TP, thereby altering the winter temperature structure and winter snowfall over the TP. This study highlights the impact of EPE and MPE events on TP snowfall and provides insights into the underlying atmospheric processes, offering a foundation for future research on their broader climatic implications."
