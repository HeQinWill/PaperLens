FNC contributed about twice as much as BNC to SOC in both systems, with higher contributions overall in agricultural soils. Soil C/N and clay content mainly drove FNC and BNC contributions, while elevation primarily influenced the FNC/BNC ratio. 
 Soil carbon (C) plays an essential role in regulating global C cycle and climate. Microbial necromass is an important component of soil C, and yet the relative contribution of microbial necromass in shaping the global C stocks in agricultural and natural ecosystems worldwide remains virtually unknown. In this study, we compiled data on fungal and bacterial necromass along with soil organic carbon (SOC) from the 0–20 cm soil layer across 486 study sites (145 agricultural and 341 natural ecosystems) to evaluate the relative contribution of fungal necromass C (FNC) and bacterial necromass C (BNC) to SOC and the FNC/BNC ratio, after accounting for other biotic and abiotic factors. Our results indicated that, in both agricultural and natural ecosystems, the contribution of FNC to SOC significantly exceeded that of BNC, with FNC contributing approximately twice as much as BNC to SOC. However, the contributions of FNC and BNC to SOC were markedly higher in agricultural ecosystems than those in natural ecosystems, with a contrasting trend in the FNC/BNC ratio. Soil physicochemical properties (C/N and clay) were the most important predictors of the contributions of FNC and BNC to SOC in both ecosystems, while geographical factor (elevation) was the most important predictor of the FNC/BNC ratio. Our study enhances the current level of understanding regarding microbially mediated biogeochemical cycling and SOC dynamics, underscoring the critical role of microbial necromass in the global C cycle."

By applying a deep learning model trained on both observational data and model simulations, we improved the representation of interannual variability and more accurately captured ocean responses to climate events like El Niño. This work supports global efforts to understand the ocean’s role in the carbon cycle and its response to climate change. 
 The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change, with the spatial distribution and temporal variations of ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 (spCO2) directly determining the air-sea CO2 flux. However, constructing a global spCO2 data product that is able to resolve interannual and decadal variability remains a challenge due to the spatial sparsity and temporal discontinuity of observational data. This study presents an approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, combining high-quality observational data from the CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) with multiple advanced global ocean biogeochemical models results to reconstruct a global monthly spCO2 dataset (SJTU-AViT) at 1° resolution from 1982 to 2023. The approach employs the self-attention mechanism of the ViT model to enhance the modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of spCO2, as well as incorporates physical-biogeochemical constraints from the derivative of spCO2 with respect to key controlling factors as additional features. The incorporation of advanced ocean biogeochemical models during the training process allows the ViT-based model to capture more accurate spCO2 variability in these data-sparse regions. Evaluations demonstrate that the new data product effectively captures spCO2 variability at both global and regional scales, showing good consistency with SOCAT observations, long-term ocean station data, and global atmospheric CO2 trends. The reconstructed spCO2 demonstrates strong capability in reproducing spCO2 anomalies during El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, particularly in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where it shows a correlation of 0.81 with the Niño 3.4 index and demonstrates high consistency with cruise data. Based on the SJTU-AViT dataset, the estimated global air-sea CO2 flux patterns are consistent with known regional features such as strong uptake in the Southern Ocean and outgassing in the tropical Pacific. This study not only provide a new 42-year data product for advancing understanding of the ocean carbon cycle and global carbon budget assessments, but also introduces a new Transformer-based deep learning framework for Earth system data reconstruction. The data product is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15331978 (Zhang et al., 2025) and will be updated regularly."

Our approach addresses underestimations in prior studies that rely heavily on slum geometry. Our dataset offers the first comprehensive inventory in data-sparse settings. This research offers valuable insights to support sustainable urban development goals, inform humanitarian aid distribution, and enhance the well-being in underserved communities. 
 Slums are a visible manifestation of poverty in Global South countries. Reliable estimation of slum population is crucial for urban planning, humanitarian aid provision, and improving well-being. However, large-scale and fine-grained mapping is still lacking due to inconsistent methodologies and definitions across countries. Existing datasets often rely on government statistics, lacking spatial continuity or underestimating slum population due to factors such as city image and privacy concerns. Here, we develop a standardized bottom-up approach to estimate slum population at the neighborhood level (~6.72 km resolution at the equator) for 129 Global South countries in 2018. Leveraging the Sustainable Development Goals 11.1 framework and machine learning, our estimation integrates household-based surveys, satellite imagery, and grided population data. Our models explain 82 % to 96 % of the variation in ground-truth surveys, with a root mean squared error of 4.85 % to 10.47 %, outperforming previous benchmarks. Cross-validation with independent data confirms the reliability of our estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive geospatial inventory of slum populations across Global South countries, offering valuable insights for advancing urban sustainability and supporting further research on vulnerable populations.

10.5194/gmd-18-3081-2025,False,Geoscientific Model Development,该论文介绍了一个名为SURFER v3.0的简单气候模型，用于评估二氧化碳和甲烷排放对全球温度、海平面和海洋pH值的影响。该模型考虑了碳循环过程，并经过校准，适用于数十年到数百万年的时间尺度。虽然该模型与大气成分（如CO2和CH4）有关，但它主要关注气候变化和地球系统建模，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。,"['climate modeling', 'CO2 emissions', 'CH4 emissions', 'sea level rise', 'ocean pH', 'carbon cycle', 'ice sheet dynamics']",Victor Couplet;Marina Martínez Montero;Michel Crucifix,SURFER v3.0: a fast model with ice sheet tipping points and carbon  cycle feedbacks for short- and long-term climate scenarios,"We present SURFER v3.0, a simple climate model designed to estimate the impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions on global temperatures, sea levels, and ocean pH. We added new carbon cycle processes and calibrated the model to observations and results from more complex models, enabling use over timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. SURFER v3.0 is fast, transparent, and easy to use, making it an ideal tool for policy assessments and suitable for educational purposes. 
 Simple climate models that are computationally inexpensive, transparent, and easy to modify are useful for assessing climate policies in the presence of uncertainties. This motivated the creation of SURFER v2.0, a model designed to estimate the impact of CO2 emissions and solar radiation modification on global mean temperatures, sea level rise, and ocean pH. However, SURFER v2.0 is unsuitable for simulations beyond a few thousand years because it lacks some carbon cycle processes. This is problematic for assessing the long-term evolution of the Earth system, particularly the dynamics of ice sheets and the resulting sea level rise. Here, we present SURFER v3.0, an extension to SURFER v2.0 that allows for accurate simulation of the climate, carbon cycle, and sea level rise on timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. We incorporated a dynamic cycling of alkalinity in the ocean, a carbonate sediments reservoir, and weathering fluxes into the model. With these additions, we show that SURFER v3.0 reproduces results from a large class of models, ranging from centennial Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projections to 1 Myr runs performed with the cGENIE model of intermediate complexity. We show that compared to SURFER v2.0, including long-term carbon cycle processes in SURFER v3.0 leads to a stabilisation of the Greenland ice sheet for the middle of the road emission scenarios and to a significant reduction in the sea level rise contribution from Antarctica for high-emission scenarios."

It enables efficient execution on multi-core personal computers. Simulations in the Yellow River basin demonstrate its consistency with WRF-Hydro outputs, providing a reliable alternative to the original Noah-MP model. 
 The community Noah with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) land surface model (LSM) is widely used in studies ranging from uncoupled land surface hydrometeorology and ecohydrology to coupled weather and climate predictions. In this study, we developed NMH-CS 3.0, a hydrological model written in C# (pronounced C sharp). NMH-CS 3.0 is a new model developed by faithfully translating Noah-MP, written in Fortran, from the uncoupled WRF-Hydro 3.0, and it is coupled with a river routing model. NMH-CS has the capacity to be executed on Windows systems, utilizing the multi-core CPUs commonly available in today's personal computers. The code of NMH-CS has been tested to ensure that it produces a high degree of consistency with the output of the original WRF-Hydro. High-resolution (6 km) simulations were conducted and assessed over a grid domain covering the entire Yellow River basin and most of northern China. The spatial maps and temporal variations in many state variables simulated by NMH-CS 3.0 and WRF-Hydro/Noah-MP demonstrate highly consistent results, occasionally with minor discrepancies. The river discharge for the Yellow River simulated by the new model with various scheme combinations of six parameterizations exhibits general agreement with the natural river discharge at the Lanzhou station. NMH-CS can be regarded as a reliable replica of Noah-MP in WRF-Hydro 3.0, but it can leverage the modern, powerful, and user-friendly features brought by the C# language to significantly improve the efficiency of the model's users and developers."
10.5194/gmd-18-3131-2025,False,Geoscientific Model Development,该研究论文主要关注全球陆地生态系统中土壤的氧化亚氮（N2O）排放及其驱动因素，特别是农业用地。它使用生态模型来模拟和分析N2O的排放量，并探讨了肥料使用、气候变化和二氧化碳浓度等因素对排放的影响。虽然N2O是一种温室气体，与大气环境有关，但该研究的重点在于土壤排放过程和陆地生态系统的碳氮循环，而非使用遥感技术进行大气成分的监测或分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['Nitrous oxide emissions', 'Soil emissions', 'Greenhouse gas', 'Ecological modeling', 'Fertilizer use', 'Climate change', 'Plant nitrogen uptake']",Jianyong Ma;Almut Arneth;Benjamin Smith;Peter Anthoni;Xu-Ri;Peter Eliasson;David Wårlind;Martin Wittenbrink;Stefan Olin,Soil nitrous oxide emissions from global land ecosystems  and their drivers within the LPJ-GUESS model (v4.1),"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas mainly released from natural and agricultural soils. This study examines how global soil N2O emissions changed from 1961 to 2020 and identifies key factors driving these changes using an ecological model. The findings highlight croplands as the largest source, with factors like fertilizer use and climate change enhancing emissions. Rising CO2 levels, however, can partially mitigate N2O emissions through increased plant nitrogen uptake. 
 Nitrogen (N) transformation processes by soil microbes account for significant nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from natural ecosystems and cropland. However, understanding and quantifying global soil N2O emissions and their responses to changing environmental conditions remain challenging. Here, we implemented a soil nitrification–denitrification module into the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to estimate N2O emissions from global lands. The performance of this new development is examined using observed N2O fluxes from natural-soil and cropland field trials and independent global-scale estimates. LPJ-GUESS broadly reproduces the cumulative N2O emissions under different climate conditions and N fertilizer applications that are observed in the field experiments, with some deviations in emission seasonality. Globally, simulated soil N2O emissions from terrestrial ecosystems increase from 5.6±0.2 Tg N yr−1 in the 1960s to 9.9±0.3 Tg N yr−1 in the 2010s, with croplands contributing about two-thirds of the total increase. East Asia and South Asia show the fastest growth rates in N2O emissions over the study period due to the expansion of fertilized croplands. On a global scale, N fertilization (including synthetic fertilizer and manure use), atmospheric N deposition, and climate change contribute 58 %, 46 %, and 24 %, respectively, to the simulated soil N2O emissions in the 2010s. Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere reduce the simulated emissions by 32 % through increased plant N uptake, whereas land use changes have varied spatial effects on emissions depending on N management intensity after land cover conversion. Our estimates only account for the direct soil N2O emissions, excluding those from fertilized pastures. This study highlights the importance of environmental factors in influencing global soil N2O emissions, particularly for assessing greenhouse gas mitigation potential in agricultural ecosystems."

This study employed metagenomic sequencing to investigate the airborne transmission of AMR in chicken farms (i.e., chicken feces, total suspended particles (TSP), and dust) and its exposure risks on the gut and nasal cavities of workers, office staff, and nearby villagers. Results revealed that TSP exhibited greater abundance, diversity, and transfer potential of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) compared to dust. The abundance of airborne resistome decreased with distance from the chicken house, and ARGs were estimated to spread up to 9.48 km within 1 h. While the gut resistome of workers and villagers showed limited differences, emerging tet(X) variants and high-risk dfrA remain future concerns. More nasal resistome was attributable to TSP compared to dust. Workers faced significantly higher inhalable exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and human pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (HPARB), exceeding those of office staff and villagers by an order of magnitude. We also compiled lists of high-risk and potential-risk airborne ARGs to inform monitoring. These findings highlight the need for regular air disinfection in animal farms and better protective measures for workers."

In addition to nitrogen removal, it has the potential to control trace pollutants. However, the fates of toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) on denitrification remain unelucidated. The current study focused on Paracoccus denitrificans (P. denitrificans) to investigate the response mechanisms of denitrifying microorganisms to HAAs, one of the main categories of DBPs. Upon exposure to 20 μM monoiodoacetic acid (MIAA), the number of extracellular reactive oxygen species in P. denitrificans increased to 2.7 times at 16 h. Concurrently, the specific nitrate reduction rate dropped by 9.3% and the specific growth rate declined by 26.7%, leading to the slowdown of the denitrification process. Nevertheless, P. denitrificans increased the activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport for sustainable denitrification under MIAA stress. Microbial hydrolytic dehalogenation contributed to over 70.0% MIAA removal, and it led to the release of iodine ions. MIAA was detoxified and concerted into low-molecular-weight organic acids, which then participated in carbon metabolism. The removal efficiency of different toxic HAAs was also compared to evaluate the adaptiveness of the DBP control. This research highlighted the interactions between denitrifying microorganisms and DBPs, providing new insights into the ecological safety protection of high-quality reclaimed water."

The plastic biodegradation process in sediments, a major reservoir of plastic contamination with reduced redox conditions, remains elusive. This study compared the plastisphere communities and metabolic potentials of typical polyethylene (PE) contaminants collected from the Pearl River Estuary to their counterparts in the surrounding sediments. The results revealed a distinct plastisphere community composition, with the consistent enrichment of a group of core plastisphere populations compared to those of the sediments. Functional genes related to both potential aerobic and anaerobic PE biodegradation were encoded by the core plastisphere populations. Microcosm incubations were performed to assess the PE biodegradation potentials under denitrifying conditions. The results demonstrated that the polyethylene (PE) mineralization efficiencies were comparable under aerobic and denitrifying conditions through incubations with 13C-PE. Development of functional groups on PE surfaces and the reduction in molecular weights further supported PE biodegradation under denitrifying conditions. The elevated laccase and lignin peroxidase activities implied their potential contribution to PE depolymerization under denitrifying conditions. Together, the sediment plastisphere microbiome holds the potential for plastic degradation under denitrifying conditions, which should be considered when assessing the fate of plastic contaminants."

The model parameters were calibrated and validated using monitored runoff volumes and pesticide concentrations, employing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The results indicated that the developed model performed well, matching or exceeding the performance of traditional NPS models in small urban areas. NPS pesticide pollution in this area exhibited spatiotemporal characteristics impacted by meteorological conditions. Washoff loads were positively correlated with maximum pesticide concentrations and runoff volumes but not when they were preceded by dry periods.

Among them, the 0.5Pt/CFO catalyst with 0.5 wt % Pt loading exhibited an outstanding catalytic activity, with T90 (the temperature of 90% toluene conversion) lowered to 185 °C, and displayed excellent stability and water resistance. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations revealed that an evident electron transfer occurred via the interface structure (Pt–O–Fe), producing the positively charged Pt (Ptδ+) and abundant Fe2+ species. Notably, the increased electron density around the Fe species weakened the Fe–O bond and thus activated the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt). Further, temperature-programmed desorption experiments and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results demonstrated that the electron-deficient Ptδ+ was conducive to the adsorption and activation of toluene at low temperature. Consequently, the deep oxidation of toluene was achieved with the participation of Olatt, benefiting from the Ptδ+–O–Fe2+ interfacial sites with synergistic catalysis for toluene adsorption and oxygen activation. This work provides an interesting idea to explore the relationship between the electron transfer effect and highly efficient VOC abatement."

We found granular media, membranes (microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO)), and precoat filtration to remove the most protozoa with average LRVs of 3.0 (95% CI 2.8–3.3), 5.7 (95% CI 5.4–6.0), and 4.4 (95% CI 4.1–4.7), respectively. Bacteria was removed most effectively by membrane filtration (MF, UF, RO) with average LRVs of 4.5 (95% CI 3.9–5.1) and moderately by dissolved air flotation, lime softening, and soil aquifer treatment with average LRVs of 2.7, 2.6, and 2.4 respectively. Viruses were removed most effectively by reverse osmosis membrane filtration with an average LRV of 4.9 (95% CI 4.0–5.7). This data provides valuable information on pathogen reduction and areas of needed research. The variation in results underscores the importance of further consideration when selecting technologies to use and the need for standardized reporting in both lab and field studies. It is important to consider variables in water quality and technology operation that may impact treatment effectiveness when selecting treatment options for use. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts to revise the WHO’s GDWQ, offering updated insights into LRVs for different water treatment technologies."

Various monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) protocols have been developed to assess the carbon credits of CDR projects within voluntary and compliant carbon markets. Many MRV protocols incorporate life cycle thinking, LCA methods, and data. This perspective examined recent LCA studies and MRV protocols published by main carbon registries, focusing on four critical land-based CDR methods: bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage, biochar, enhanced rock weathering, and afforestation and reforestation. We compared the carbon accounting and environmental impact assessment methods employed in these LCA studies and MRV protocols to identify their methodological similarities and differences. Our analysis reveals that the LCA community can support MRV protocols by providing critical insights into baselines, additionality, uncertainty, multifunctionality, environmental safeguards, holistic emission factors, and overlooked carbon pools. We recommend that future LCA research prioritize timing, permanence, scaling, and dynamic modeling for CDR. Addressing co-benefit and land use change impact assessment will further benefit both LCA and MRV development. Collaboration between the LCA and CDR communities is essential for developing robust frameworks to support carbon markets and policymaking."

However, the key parameters governing the reactivity of RHS via the SET pathway remain unclear. This study comprehensively investigated the SET pathway of the RHS with 51 aromatic contaminants by quantum-chemical calculations. The calculated free energy changes of the SET pathway (ΔGaq,SETR) followed the order Cl• < Cl2•– < Br• < Br2•–, which was consistent with the order of their reduction potentials. However, the free energy of activation of the SET pathway (ΔGaq,SET⧧) followed a different order of Cl• < Br• < Cl2•– < Br2•–, which agreed with the order of their rate constants. This inconsistent trend between ΔGaq,SETR and ΔGaq,SET⧧ for RHS reactions was attributed to the difference in reorganization energy, which is essentially related to the vertical electron affinity and radius of RHS. Therefore, the rate constants of SET reactions of RHS depend not only on their reduction potential but also on their vertical electron affinity and radius. These findings unravel the key factors determining the reactivity of RHS via the SET pathway and have profound implications for understanding other SET processes in water."

The aim of this study was to investigate the emissions of fine particles, coarse particles, and CO2 under realistic driving conditions. Passenger car brake control was reproduced in an indoor experiment using the Los Angeles City Transit (LACT) cycle as the test cycle. The experiments were performed in a laboratory with a brake dynamometer under realistic braking temperature conditions using one front brake of a midsize passenger car. The preliminary results indicated that particle emission factors were higher than CO2 emissions, with a driving distance-based CO2 emission factor per brake axle of 1.7 ± 0.15 mg/km/brake and a particulate matter of 10 μm or less (PM10) emission factor of 10.1 ± 2.3 mg/km/brake. Although CO2 emissions were less than PM10, the results of this study showed that CO2 emissions and nucleation-mode particles (<20 nm in diameter) are formed even at final braking temperatures of 40–90 °C, which are considerably lower than the commonly accepted critical braking temperature. This research highlights the importance of further study to establish an emission inventory and to analyze the toxic effects of brake wear particles with combustion-like brake wear processes that require consideration of the emissions of nucleation-mode particles and gaseous compounds."

Residential greenness was assessed using vegetation indices and greenspace percentages. Cox regressions and generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze associations between greenness and dyslipidemia outcomes. Over a median follow-up period of 3.21 years, 744,732 cases of dyslipidemia were observed. Greener environments were associated with a reduced risk of dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperbetalipoproteinemia (hazard ratios ranged from 0.82 to 0.96) and an increased risk of hypoalphalipoproteinemia (hazard ratios were 1.12 to 1.15). Higher greenness levels were linked to lower serum lipids. These associations were stronger among older adults and those with higher education. Mediation analyses showed that lower air pollution, temperature, and higher physical activity accounted for 2.08–33.72% of the associations between greenness and dyslipidemia.

However, emerging evidence suggests a connection between e-cigarette use or vaping and an increased risk of oral disease, particularly among minoritized populations such as Black and African Americans (AAs). AA communities have historically experienced disproportionate harm from tobacco use, which could extend to vaping. In this study, we recruited 20 AAs and 28 individuals of other races, oversampled for vapers, with no statistical differences in age, sex, sugar intake, income, or education across groups. Whole saliva samples collected at the time of the visit were processed for untargeted UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS proteomics and HPLC-MS/MS metabolomics. Our results revealed vaping preferentially impaired redox pathways and amino acid metabolism among AAs, with elevated malondialdehyde levels and an oxidized glutathione to glutathione ratio and lowered levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ascorbate. Salivary proteomics demonstrated salivary secretion was upregulated in AAs while Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, bacterial invasion defense, natural killer cell function, leukocyte migration, and phagosome function were downregulated, suggesting dysregulated innate immune function in AA vapers. Additionally, focal adhesion, cell–substrate junction, and actin cytoskeleton regulation were downregulated in AA vapers, indicating that mucous epithelium barrier integrity may be disrupted. Lastly, the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Need (CPITN), a dental assessment tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate periodontal health and determine the need for treatment, revealed that a significantly higher proportion of AA vapers had CPITN scores of 3 or higher, suggesting the need for further clinical assessment of periodontal disease.

However, a lack of efficient means and incomplete monitoring data are the main obstacles impeding soil pollution management and prevention in China. Moreover, it is rare to examine the possibility and reliability of using  field-collected earthworms to assess the pollution degree of soil heavy metals in real-world situations at a large field scale. In this study, we investigate the potential use of field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators to assess the pollution characteristics and risks of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cd, and Cr) across three typical regions (Xiaokeng Reservoir, Dabaoshan Mine, and Smelter/Steel Plants) in Shaoguan, one of six trial zones identified for the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China. Our results unveil the existence of significant differences in the spatial distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals in soils and earthworms across these regions. The average contents of Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cr, and Cd in soils were 329.7 ± 476.5, 180.9 ± 262.4, 82.9 ± 197.8, 66.6 ± 61.6, 53.3 ± 53.6, and 7.2 ± 8.2 mg/kg, while those in earthworms were 113.6 ± 112.1, 99.4 ± 106.8, 90.0 ± 126.9, 24.7 ± 30.8, 8.8 ± 9.4, and 5.1 ± 3.4 mg/kg, respectively. The internal exposure dose of heavy metals in earthworms is found to more accurately reflect their bioavailability under true environmental conditions than the external exposure dose in soils. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) exhibited the highest values for Cd (0.01–24.40), followed by those for Pb (0.06–9.94), Cu (0.12–5.23), Cr (0.02–1.90), As (0.02–1.18), and Zn (0.06–1.17). Further principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) classification ascertain that earthworms are more capable of differentiating heavy metal pollution in different regions than soil alone. Compared to the routine analysis of the total heavy metal content in soils, our novel strategy demonstrates the superiority of employing field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators for monitoring heavy metal pollution and discriminating potential sources of soil pollution in a real scenario."

Lung function parameters (FVC%, FEV1%, and FEV1/FVC) were measured, while PFAS concentrations in urine and indoor dust were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We measured the levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in urine. The results demonstrated a preponderance of short-chain PFAS in urine, with PFBS, PFPeA, and PFBA showing the highest detection rates. PFBA had the highest median concentration at 0.47 ng/mL. Similarly, in indoor dust, PFBA was the most frequently detected, followed by PFOA, with median concentrations of 0.56 and 0.44 ng/g, respectively. Multiple PFAS compounds showed significant inverse correlations with FVC% and FEV1%. PFAS exposure was associated with elevated oxidative stress biomarker levels (8-OHdG, 8-epi-PGF2α, and MDA), and their synergistic interaction aggravated the decline in lung function.

 Bacteria defend themselves from viral predation using diverse immune systems, many of which target foreign DNA for degradation1. Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene that encodes an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other related DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis. Viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell, driving abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that likely prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA by DRT9 in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers.

 The shale gas revolution has shifted propylene production from naphtha cracking to on-purpose production with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as the dominant technology1-9. Because PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures that favour sintering and coking, the challenge is to develop active and stable catalysts1-3 that are sufficiently stable10,11. Zeolite-supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been developed to balance activity, selectivity and stability12,13, and more recent work documented a PDH catalyst based on zeolite-anchored single rhodium atoms with exceptional performance and stability14. Here we show for silicalite-1 (S-1) that migration of encapsulated Pt-Sn2 clusters and hence agglomeration and anchoring within the zeolite versus agglomeration on the external surface can be controlled by adjusting the length of the S-1 crystals’ b-axis. We find that when this axis is longer than 2.00 μm, migration of Pt-Sn2 monomers during PDH results in intra-crystalline formation of (Pt-Sn2)2 dimers that are securely locked in the channels of S-1 and capable of converting pure propane feed to propylene at 550 °C for more than 6 months with 98.3% selectivity at 91% equilibrium conversion. This performance exceeds that of other Pt-based PDH catalysts and approaches that of the Rh-based catalyst. While synthesis requirements and cost are currently prohibitive for industrial use, we anticipate that our approach to controlling the migration and lockup of metals in zeolites may enable to development of other noble metal catalysts that offer extended service lifetimes in industrial applications15-17."

 The multicellular coordination that underlies tissue homeostasis and disease progression is of fundamental interest1–5. However, how diverse cell types are organized within tissue niches for cohesive functioning remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized cross-tissue coordinated cellular modules in healthy tissues, uncovering their spatiotemporal dynamics and phenotypic associations, and examined their rewiring in cancer. We first compiled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 35 human tissues, revealing substantial inter-tissue variability in cellular composition. By leveraging covariance in cellular abundance, we identified 12 cellular modules with distinct cellular compositions, tissue prevalences and spatial organizations, and demonstrated coordinated intercellular communication within cellular modules using in situ spatial and in vivo perturbation data. Among them, two immune cellular modules in the spleen showed contrasting chronological dynamics with ageing. Analysis of multicellular changes in the breast revealed a menopausal trajectory associated with fibroblast dynamics. Furthermore, interrogation across cancer types uncovered simultaneous rewiring of two types of multicellular ecosystem during tumour progression, including the loss of tissue-specific healthy organization and the emergence of a convergent cancerous ecosystem. These findings reveal fundamental organizing principles of multicellular ecosystems in health and cancer, laying a foundation for further investigations into tissue-level functional coordination across diverse contexts.

 Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) are central to physiology1,2. Excess mROS production has been associated with several disease states2,3; however, the precise sources, regulation and mechanism of generation in vivo remain unclear, which limits translational efforts. Here we show that in obesity, hepatic coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis is impaired, which increases the CoQH2 to CoQ (CoQH2/CoQ) ratio and drives excessive mROS production through reverse electron transport (RET) from site IQ in complex I. Using multiple complementary genetic and pharmacological models in vivo, we demonstrate that RET is crucial for metabolic health. In patients with steatosis, the hepatic CoQ biosynthetic program is also suppressed, and the CoQH2/CoQ ratio positively correlates with disease severity. Our data identify a highly selective mechanism for pathological mROS production in obesity, which can be targeted to protect metabolic homeostasis.

 Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission thousands of times longer than radio pulsars1–5. These findings, enabled by advances in wide-field radio surveys, challenge existing models of rotationally powered pulsars. Proposed models include highly magnetized neutron stars6, white-dwarf pulsars7 and white-dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions8. Although some models predict X-ray emission6,9, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches1–5,10. Here we report the discovery of an extremely bright LPT (10–20 Jy in radio), ASKAP J1832−0911, which has coincident radio and X-ray emission, both with a 44.2-minute period. Its correlated and highly variable X-ray and radio luminosities, combined with other observational properties, are unlike any known Galactic object. The source could be an old magnetar or an ultra-magnetized white dwarf; however, both interpretations present theoretical challenges. This X-ray detection from an LPT reveals that these objects are more energetic than previously thought and establishes a class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients with a luminosity of about 1033 erg s−1 linked to exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.

 The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability1. Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined2–4. However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals5. Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions6–8, but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.

 Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1–4. Clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) proteins, which comprise a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, have a pivotal role in the neuronal self-avoidance that is required for mammalian brain development5–7. The probabilistic expression of different cPcdh isoforms confers unique identities on neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism also exists in astrocytes remains unknown. Here we report that γC3, a specific isoform in the Pcdhγ family, is enriched in human and mouse astrocytes. Using genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that γC3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine whether γC3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of γC3 chimeric proteins that are capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expression of complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same γC3-null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric γC3 proteins individually expressed in single γC3-null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition mediated by γC3 contributes to astrocyte development in the mammalian brain. Human and mouse astrocytes express the protocadherin PcdhγC3, which promotes self-recognition of individual astrocytes, thereby contributing to normal astrocyte and brain development."

Saper,Preoptic EP3R neurons constitute a two-way switch for fever and torpor,"Neurons in the median preoptic nucleus that express the prostaglandin EP3 receptor produce prolonged hypothermic responses or hyperthermic responses, respectively, following brief activation or inhibition. 
 Many species use a temporary decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate (torpor) as a strategy to survive food scarcity in a cool environment. Torpor is caused by preoptic neurons that express a variety of peptides and receptors1–7, but no single genetic marker has been found for this population. Here we report that expression of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3R) marks a unique population of median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) neurons that are required for both torpor and lipopolysaccharide-induced fever8. The MnPO-EP3R neurons produce persistent fever responses when inhibited and prolonged hypothermic responses when activated either chemogenetically or optogenetically, even for brief periods of time. The mechanism for these prolonged responses appears to involve increases in intracellular levels of cAMP and calcium that may persist for many minutes up to hours beyond the termination of a stimulus. These properties endow the population of MnPO-EP3R neurons with the ability to act as a two-way switch for the hypothermic and hyperthermic responses that are required for survival. Neurons in the median preoptic nucleus that express the prostaglandin EP3 receptor produce prolonged hypothermic responses or hyperthermic responses, respectively, following brief activation or inhibition."

 Surface albedo greatly affects how much energy the Earth absorbs. Intensive human activities and accelerated climate change have altered surface albedo across spatial and temporal scales1–3, yet assessments of the effects of land use or land cover (LULC) and snow variations on land surface albedo are scarce at the global scale. As a result, the global land surface albedo dynamics over recent decades and their corresponding radiative forcing to the climate system remain poorly understood4–9. Here we quantify the individual and combined effects of snow cover dynamics, LULC conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 and estimate their induced radiative forcing. We show that the negative radiative forcing induced by the global land surface albedo change was −0.142 (−0.158, −0.114) W m−2 over the past two decades. The global snow-free land surface albedo increased by 2.2% (P < 0.001), with a negative radiative forcing of −0.164 (−0.186, −0.138) W m−2 (P < 0.001). The magnitude of this negative forcing is sevenfold larger than the positive forcing induced by snow dynamics, and equivalent to 59.9% of that caused by CO2 emissions from 2011 to 201910. The global radiative forcing due to albedo changes in LULC non-conversion regions is 3.9 to 8.1 times greater than that from LULC conversions. The radiative forcing induced by albedo changes highlights the important role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming. Effects of snow cover dynamics, land use or land cover conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 are quantified and their induced radiative forcing estimated, highlighting the role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming."

 Terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—formed by the accretion of smaller objects. The Earth was probably the latest terrestrial planet to form and reached about 99% of its final mass within about 60–100 Myr after condensation of the first solids in the Solar System. This Review examines the disproportionate role of the last approximately 1% of planetary growth, or late accretion, in controlling the long-term evolution of the Earth and other terrestrial planets. Late accretion may have been responsible for shaping Earth’s distinctive geophysical and chemical properties and generating pathways conducive to prebiotic chemistry. Differences in the late accretion of a planet may provide a rationale for interpreting the distinct properties of Venus and Earth (for example, tectonism, atmospheric composition, water content), the surface dichotomy of Mars and the high core-to-silicate mass ratio of Mercury. Large collisions and ensuing processes are likely to occur and modulate the evolution of rocky exoplanets as well, and they should be considered in our quest to find Earth-like worlds.

 Lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated ex vivo gene therapy for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has delivered on the promise of a ‘one-and-done’ treatment for several genetic diseases1. However, ex vivo manipulation and patient conditioning before transplantation are major hurdles that could be overcome by an in vivo approach. Here we demonstrate that in vivo gene delivery to HSPCs after systemic LV administration is enabled by the substantial trafficking of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow in newborn mice. We improved gene-transfer efficiency using a phagocytosis-shielded LV, successfully reaching bona fide HSPCs capable of long-term multilineage output and engraftment after serial transplantation, as confirmed by clonal tracking. HSPC mobilization further increased gene transfer, extending the window of intervention, although permissiveness to LV transduction declined with age. We successfully tested this in vivo strategy in mouse models of adenosine deaminase deficiency, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and Fanconi anaemia. Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer provided a selective advantage to corrected HSPCs in Fanconi anaemia, leading to near-complete haematopoietic reconstitution and prevention of bone marrow failure. Given that circulating HSPCs in humans are also most abundant shortly after birth, in vivo HSPC gene transfer holds strong translational potential across multiple diseases. In vivo gene delivery to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in newborn mice using engineered lentiviral vectors shows promise as an effective treatment for genetic diseases."

 There is ongoing debate as to when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved on Earth1,2. Geochemical data from ancient sediments indicate localized or ephemeral photosynthetic O2 production before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) approximately 2.5–2.3 billion years ago (Ga), and currently suggest Archaean origins, approximately 3 Ga or earlier3–9. However, sedimentary records of the early Earth often suffer from preservation issues, and poor control on the timing of oxidation leaves geochemical proxy data for the ancient presence of O2 open to critique10–13. Here, we report rare Earth element data from three different Archaean carbonate platforms preserved in greenstone belts of the northwest Superior Craton (Canada), which were deposited by the activity of marine photosynthetic bacteria 2.87 Ga, 2.85 Ga and 2.78 Ga. All three indicate O2 production before the GOE in the form of significant depletions in cerium (Ce), reflecting oxidative Ce removal from ancient seawater, as occurs today14. Using 138La-138Ce geochronology, we show that La/Ce fractionation, and thus Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, making these the oldest directly dated Ce anomalies. These results place the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier and bring an important new perspective on a long-standing debate regarding Earth’s biological and geochemical evolution. 138La-138Ce geochronology shows that La/Ce fractionation, and Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, placing the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier."

 Doping is a primary method to modulate the electrical properties of semiconductors, enabling the fabrication of various homojunctions/heterojunctions and complex devices1–8. For organic semiconductors (OSCs), the electrical performance has been extensively improved by developing doping methods and dopants9–13. However, compared with the state-of-the-art spatial resolution of inorganic semiconductor fabrication processes, OSCs lag far behind, limiting the construction of complex organic electronic devices5. Here we present a facile light-triggered doping strategy and develop a series of inactive photoactivable dopants (iPADs) for regionally controlled n-doping of OSCs. By converting iPADs into active dopants through ultraviolet (UV) exposure, controllable doping of various n-type OSCs with high electrical conductivity greater than 30 S cm−1 has been realized. Using iPADs can substantially improve the performances of OSCs in transistors, logic circuits and thermoelectrics. Also, regionally controlled doping is demonstrated in OSCs with a record resolution down to 1 μm. Overall, our strategy has achieved tunable doping levels in OSCs with high spatial resolution, which is expected to be highly suited for integrated circuits in both roll-to-roll and laboratory-scale environments.

Here we studied intensity fluctuations in the macroscopic polarization during the emergence of superfluorescence in a lead halide perovskite10 and showed that spontaneously synchronized polaronic lattice oscillations accompany collective electronic dipole emission. We further developed an effective field model and theoretically confirmed that exciton–lattice interactions lead to a new electronically and structurally entangled coherent extended solitonic state beyond a critical polaron density. The analysis shows a phase transition with two processes happening in tandem: incoherent disordered polaronic lattice deformations establish an order, while macroscopic quantum coherence among excitons simultaneously emerges. Recombination of excitons in this state culminates in superfluorescence at high temperatures. Our study establishes fundamental connections between the transient superfluorescence process observed after the impulsive excitation of perovskites and general equilibrium phase transitions achieved by thermal cooling. By identifying various electron–lattice interactions in the perovskite structure and their respective role in creating collectively coherent electronic effects in solids, our work provides unprecedented insight into the design and development of new materials that exhibit high-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena. Exciton–lattice interactions suppress thermal noise through vibration isolation, enabling unconventional solitonic superfluorescence at unusually high temperatures in lead halide perovskites."

 Early or sorting endosomes are dynamic organelles that play key roles in proteome control by triaging plasma membrane proteins for either recycling or degradation in the lysosome1,2. These events are coordinated by numerous transiently associated regulatory complexes and integral membrane components that contribute to organelle identity during endosome maturation3. Although a subset of the several hundred protein components and cargoes known to associate with endosomes have been studied at the biochemical and/or structural level, interaction partners and higher-order molecular assemblies for many endosomal components remain unknown. Here, we combine crosslinking and native gel mass spectrometry4–7 of purified early endosomes with AlphaFold8,9 and computational analysis to create a systematic human endosomal structural interactome. We present 229 structural models for endosomal protein pairs and additional higher-order assemblies supported by experimental crosslinks from their native subcellular context, suggesting structural mechanisms for previously reported regulatory processes. Using induced neurons, we validate two candidate complexes whose interactions are supported by crosslinks and structural predictions: TMEM230 as a subunit of ATP8 and ATP11 lipid flippases10 and TMEM9 and TMEM9B as subunits of the chloride–proton antiporters CLCN3, CLCN4 and CLCN5 (ref. 11).

 The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits1–8. Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres9,10. However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry11–22. Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.

 Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amid evolving questions, opportunities and challenges, yet the understanding of pivots between research areas and their outcomes remains limited1–5. Theories of creative search highlight the potential benefits of exploration but also emphasize difficulties in moving beyond one’s expertise6–14. Here we introduce a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing work, and apply it to millions of papers and patents. We find a pervasive ‘pivot penalty’, in which the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their previous work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across science and patenting, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. Larger pivots further exhibit weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge, lower publication success rates and less market impact. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in effectively adapting to new opportunities and threats, with implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands.

 Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells1. The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear2–4. Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour. These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain. Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue. In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.

Iestyn Woolway,Global dominance of seasonality in shaping lake-surface-extent dynamics,"Monthly mapping of multisource remote-sensing data for 1.4 million lakes reveals that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. 
 Lakes are crucial for ecosystems1, greenhouse gas emissions2 and water resources3, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations4,5. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes6–8, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001–2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user’s and producer’s accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset7. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world’s population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes9, protecting lacustrine systems10–12 and improving global climate models13,14. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.

 Cannabis sativa is a globally important seed oil, fibre and drug-producing plant species. However, a century of prohibition has severely restricted development of breeding and germplasm resources, leaving potential hemp-based nutritional and fibre applications unrealized. Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized.

 Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electronvolt (eV)-scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications1,2. A variety of such magnetic states with non-trivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d-wave, g-wave or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets3–7. Achieving voltage-based control of the non-uniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energy-efficient and compact devices for information storage and processing8,9. Spin-spiral type II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order that directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry-protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order10–14. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principles calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent an observation of p-wave magnetism in a spin-spiral type II multiferroic, which may lead to the development of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets. Experimental observations and theoretical analysis provide evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits p-wave magnetism and its spin chirality is related to ferroelectric polarization, which can be electrically controlled. "

 Water is the one of most precious resources for planetary utilisation. Lunar nearside impact glass beads (IGBs) have been demonstrated to contain abundant solar wind-derived water (SW-H2O); however, little is known about its farside counterpart. Here, we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions and their distribution in farside IGBs collected by the Chang’e-6 mission to investigate the role of IGBs in the lunar surface water cycle. Farside IGBs are found to have water abundances of ~10–1,070 μg.g−1 with hydrogen isotopes (δD) ranging from –988‰ to >2000‰ and display typical SW-H2O hydration profiles. The SW-H2O hydration depths in farside IGBs are strikingly shallower than in nearside IGBs. Moreover, the hydration profiles are only found in mare IGBs, with none observed in non-mare IGBs, indicating that SW-H2O hydration in IGBs is likely composition dependent. These findings indicate that SW-H2O storage of IGBs exhibits a dichotomy distribution in lunar soils.

 It is highly desirable that artificial circularly polarized phosphorescent materials with high luminescence asymmetry factor (glum), narrowband emission and tunable chiral phosphorescent performance can be constructed. Especially, precise control and simultaneous independent switching of circularly polarized fluorescent and phosphorescent performance for the same molecules remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to customized design of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials based on large language models and transfer learning methods, which not only enables efficient identification of suitable synthesis precursors, but also provides valuable guidance for experimental procedures. We demonstrate the significant advantages of transfer learning with limited chemical data, and precisely fabricate films with high glum (1.86), narrow full-width at half-maximum (49 nm) and customized circularly polarized phosphorescent performance with targeted spectral position. The inverse customization of materials with user-specified circularly polarized fluorescent/phosphorescent performance can be achieved, favoring their application in multicolor display and multidimensional information encryption.

 Quantifying surface energy and carbon budgets is essential for projecting Earth’s climate. Earth System Models (ESMs) typically simulate land surface processes based on plant functional types (PFTs), neglecting the diversity of plant functional traits or characteristics (PFCs; e.g., chlorophyll content and leaf mass per area). Here, we demonstrate substantial differences in modeled leaf optical properties (LOP) and surface albedo between traditional PFT-based and PFC-based approaches, particularly in tropical and boreal forests. We configure the canopy radiative transfer scheme in the Community Earth System Model using PFC-based LOP. This new configuration produces lower shortwave surface albedo in the tropics but higher albedo in boreal regions (>5 W m−2 radiative flux differences), and a weaker tropical but stronger boreal carbon sink. Through land-atmosphere coupling, the PFC-based configuration further alters atmospheric processes, leading to different temperature, cloud cover, and precipitation patterns. Our findings highlight the need to move beyond traditional PFT-based approaches in ESMs. Earth system models often categorize plants to just a few functional types, and plant characteristics are defined per type, neglecting their diversity.

Here, the authors discover that CEACAM1, an immunoglobulin-like transmembrane protein, is essential for a subset of mantle cell lymphoma through activation of the BCR. 
 B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, through a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identify carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) as an essential factor in a subset of MCL tumors. Our signal transduction studies reveal that CEACAM1 plays a critical role in BCR activation through involvement in two dynamic processes. First, following BCR engagement, CEACAM1 co-localizes to the membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) by anchoring to the F-actin cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein filamin A. Second, CEACAM1 recruits and increases the abundance of SYK in the BCR complex leading to BCR activation. These activities of CEACAM1 require its cytoplasmic tail and the N-terminal ectodomain. Considering that previous studies have extensively characterized CEACAM1 as an ITIM-bearing inhibitory receptor, our findings regarding its activating role are both surprising and context-dependent, which may have implications for BCR-targeting therapies.

 Electrocatalysis offers a promising route to convert CO2 into alcohols, which is most efficient in a two-step cascade reaction with CO2-to-CO followed by CO-to-alcohol. However, current alcohol-producing CO2/CO electrolyzers suffer from low selectivity or alcohol crossover, resulting in alcohol concentrations of less than 1%, which are further diluted in downstream cold-traps. As a result, electrocatalytic alcohol production has yet to be scaled beyond the lab (1-10 cm2). Here, we reverse the electroosmotic drag of water using a cation exchange membrane assembly, enabling the recovery of over 85% of alcohol products at a concentration of 6 wt.%. We develop a multi-step condenser strategy to separate the produced alcohols from the effluent gas stream without dilution. Scaling up this approach to an 800 cm2 cell resulted in an output of 200 mL alcohol/day.

 Chemical upcycling has the potential to turn plastic wastes into valuable chemicals and promote the circularity of plastics. Polysulfones and relevant composites are plastics with notable chemical durability, resistance and survivability. They are known as super engineering plastics, but they pose enormous challenges for reuse and upcycling. Here we develop a strategy for the chemical upcycling of polysulfones through copper-photocatalysed dual desulfonylative chlorination at ambient conditions, affording high-value-added dichlorinated diaryl ethers. The key to this strategy is cascade homolytic ipso-aromatic substitutions with high selectivity using the chlorine radical. Various types of polysulfones were successfully depolymerized and functionalized, including 12 examples of resins and eight examples of end-of-life plastics. Through gram-scale upcycling and mixed-plastic treatment, we further demonstrated the excellent compatibility and practicality of our strategy. Overall, this work establishes a viable approach for upcycling waste plastics into valuable chemicals, thus contributing to more sustainable plastic waste management and to realizing the circular economy.

 Improving the sustainability of the steel industry requires decarbonization strategies that are both technically and economically viable. The recovery of both material and heat on site is a promising approach but largely unexplored. Here we propose a scheme integrating heat recovery, carbon mineralization and the use of slag in cement production, along with the blast-furnace injection of hydrogen from off-gas. The proposed scheme, based on the synergistic use of coke oven gas and slag, can reduce CO2 emissions by 48% compared to the conventional approach. When coupled with an external gas supply from coal gasification or biomass pyrolysis, CO2 emissions can drop by 63% and 92%, respectively. The cost of avoiding CO2 emissions could be less than half the cost of conventional industrial capture and could be offset by the projected carbon price by 2030. For the steel industry in China, we find that the scheme is applicable to over 46% of existing steel mills, resulting in 16 provinces meeting the 2 °C target and 19 provinces surpassing the 50% national mitigation target.

 Large-scale atmospheric variability can be summarized by recurring patterns called weather regimes. Their properties, including predictability, have been studied using the local dimension, a geometrical estimate of degrees of freedom from multifractal theory. Local dimension estimates vary across regimes, decrease when a single regime dominates, and increase during transitions, supporting their dynamical significance. However, these variations stem not only from geometry but also from sampling density. We develop a null-hypothesis test using stochastic twins-Gaussian mixture-based surrogates matching atmospheric sampling density but with constant geometry-applied to ERA5 500 hPa fields. Density effects alone explain over 25% of local dimension variance and reproduce the dimension drop near regime peaks, indicating this behavior is density-driven, not geometric. The remaining variability is plausibly geometry-driven. This approach, applicable to any observed system with known sampling distribution, offers a new framework for interpreting local dimension estimates in atmospheric and oceanic data."

 It was found that the Central-eastern China’s summer extreme heat (CECSH) has a decadal variability with a cycle of about 70 years and is significantly positively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) core area sea surface temperature (SST; AMOCORE) and the tropical western Pacific SST (WPSST) in boreal summer. Diagnostic analyses such as synergistic diagnostic and linear baroclinic model (LBM) experiments show that the warm AMOCORE and WPSST in boreal summer can generate the localized heat dome (HD) over Mongolia to northeast China by exciting local convection and subsequent propagation, respectively, which in turn directly influences the CECSH decadal variability through compression of the atmosphere and temperature transport.

 Tropical monsoons play a critical role in shaping regional and global climate systems, with profound ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, their long-term prediction remains challenging due to the complex interplay of regional dynamics, global climate drivers, large-scale teleconnections, and inherent non-stationarities in the climate system. Here, we introduce a unified network-based framework for predicting monsoon precipitation across diverse tropical regions. By leveraging global 2-meter air temperature fields, this approach captures large-scale climate teleconnections, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Rossby waves, enabling accurate forecasts for four key monsoon systems: the South American, East Asian, West African, and Indian monsoons. Our framework achieves remarkable forecasting accuracy with lead times of 4-10 months, outperforming traditional systems such as Seasonal Forecast System 5 and Climate Forecast System version 2. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the framework offers flexibility for application to other regions and climate phenomena, advancing our understanding of global climate dynamics. These findings have far-reaching implications for disaster preparedness, resource management, and sustainable development.

 Most oceans over the globe have experienced surface warming during the past century, but the subpolar Atlantic is quite otherwise. The sea surface temperature cooling trend to the south of Greenland, known as the North Atlantic Warming Hole, has raised debate over whether it is driven by the slowing of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we use observations as a benchmark and climate models as a tool to demonstrate that only models simulating a weakened historical Atlantic overturning can broadly reproduce the observed cooling and freshening in the warming hole region. This, in turn, indicates that the realistic Atlantic overturning slowed between 1900 and 2005, at a rate of −1.01 to −2.97 Sv century−1 (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1), according to a sea-surface-temperature-based fingerprint index estimate. Particularly, the Atlantic overturning slowdown causes an oceanic heat transport divergence across the subpolar North Atlantic, which, while partially offset by enhanced ocean heat uptake, results in cooling over the warming hole region.

 Land elevation data are indispensable for topographic mapping and geological disaster monitoring. However, the existing ICESat-2/ATL08 (V04) product has a coarse resolution (≥100 m) and is characterized by high uncertainty in mountainous areas; thus, it cannot be used to describe terrain relief characteristics accurately. In this study, a new method for extracting terrain surface elevation is proposed, which uses a local statistical denoising algorithm for mountainous areas (LSDAMA) based on the raw georeferenced photon product ICESat-2/ATL03. Coarse denoising is based on performing histogram thresholding, and refined denoising is based on local slope fitting; the process of performing coarse denoising twice and then refined denoising not only improves the removal effect for noise photons but also increases the signal photon retention rate in mountainous areas. Additionally, the estimation accuracy of the terrain surface elevation can be improved by setting rectangular dynamic windows along the fitted slope direction. Using the Babao River Basin in the Qilian Mountains as the research area, a total of 137 validation points from 777 GPS CORS in 40 quadrats and UAV LiDAR measurements were used to verify the accuracy. The results showed that the terrain surface elevations estimated by the LSDAMA are more accurate than those estimated by the ATL08 official products, especially in mountainous areas with slopes greater than 20°. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the LSDAMA decreased from 2.72 m for the ATL08 product to 0.60 m, and the mean deviation (MBE) decreased from −1.27 to 0.04 m. Additionally, the LSDAMA greatly improved the signal photon retention rate and reduced the interval between adjacent elevation points from 100 m for the ATL08 product to 2–7 m; this reduced interval can be used to describe the terrain fluctuation characteristics in detail, thus providing reliable basic data for monitoring terrain surface elevation changes in mountainous areas."

 Identifying urban villages (UVs) is essential for supporting urban renewal and governance, as these informal areas present significant challenges to urban sustainability. Existing multi-modal deep-learning studies have accurately identified UVs in individual cities; however, their scalability is constrained by substantial computational demands and data availability. Currently, efficient deep-learning models tailored for large-scale, consistent UV maps using freely released Sentinel-2 data remain underexplored. Therefore, we proposed a flexible framework leveraging multiple Sentinel-2 observations and deep-learning models to cost-effectively support large-scale UV mapping. We specifically employed a dual-branch encoder to consolidate discriminative features: one branch extracted static information from annual images, while the other captured seasonal dynamics induced by building shadows across four seasonal images. These features were then jointly represented using fusion modules and used for UV identification through skip connections. The model was trained and tested on self-compiled Guangzhou-Shenzhen samples, with the Pearl River Delta serving to analyze applicability and transferability. Results demonstrated incorporating dynamic information notably enhanced the accuracy of UV identification. The proposed framework exhibited optimal performance (mIoU: 83.33 %) with robust spatial generalization, surpassing traditional methods (mIoU improvements: 0.46–12.49 %). Compared to multi-modal data-driven studies, our framework can be conveniently implemented in complex urban environments while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy in large-scale applications. This cost-effective solution offers high-quality, large-scale UV mapping, thereby advancing UV management and planning efforts."

 Accurate building damage assessment is crucial for post-disaster response, yet existing methods struggle to capture complex spatial relationships and contextual features needed for distinguishing damage levels. To address this, we propose the Gated Adaptive Multi-scale Spatial-frequency Fusion Network (GAMSF), a two-phase framework for building localization and damage classification. GAMSF integrates three key innovations: (1) Adaptive Attention (AA) to dynamically prioritize critical regions, (2) Gated Multi-scale Feed-Forward Network (GMFFN) to enhance robustness by emphasizing prominent damage features, and (3) Multi-Scale Wavelet Fusion (MWF) to extract fine-grained structural details using wavelet transforms. Rigorous evaluations on the datasets, including xBD and xFBD, demonstrates that GAMSF achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with a 1.7% improvement in F1-score, a 2.1% gain in Kappa, and a 3.7% increase in minor damage identification accuracy compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, transferability experiments on the high-resolution Ida-BD dataset validate GAMSF’s superior generalization capabilities, outperforming four advanced models. These results highlight the practical value of GAMSF in enhancing disaster management, emergency response, and resource allocation strategies."

 Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of irrigated cropland at the field scale is essential for managing irrigation water use and addressing the water-food nexus. While global and regional irrigation products exist, they often classify irrigated crops based on machine learning principles, where irrigated crops outperform rainfed ones. However, these methods typically lack mechanistic representation and are rarely applicable at the field scale over long time series. Additionally, identifying irrigated cropland in dual-season systems poses challenges due to temporal heterogeneity, leading to potential misclassification. To address these issues, we constructed a 3D canopy feature space including hydrothermal characteristics (1-precipitation/P, 2-actual evapotranspiration/AET) and spectral characteristic (3-NDVI). This approach is based on two mechanisms: the impact of irrigation on water vapor cycling and its role in promoting crop growth. We introduced a novel cross-region Slope Length Index (SLI) to map irrigated and rainfed crops at the field scale. Our method involved downscaling NDVI and AET using spectral fusion techniques (STF) on Google Earth Engine (GEE), followed by fitting a robust rainfed line (AET = −125.41 + 0.84 × P, R2 = 0.70) at the provincial scale, and calculating the SLI. Then A case of irrigation map (Irri_HNP) was generated by a threshold for crop water supply and demand, achieving ≥ 38 % accuracy improvement on overall accuracy (OA = 0.973) compared to existing products. The SLI method also exhibited strong stability when generalized to the national scope (AET = −74.41 + 0.82 × P, R2 = 0.73), maintaining robustness in both drought and humid years (AET = −177.08 + 0.82 × P, R2 = 0.69). The method’s scalability and transferability have been rigorously validated across diverse regions and environments, spanning from provincial to national scales. This validation achieved an OA of 0.922, demonstrating robust performance under heterogeneous conditions. Furthermore, the framework provides actionable insights for field-scale crop management and agricultural water governance."

 The Western Tibetan Vortex (WTV) is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern recognized from monthly data. It has a quasi-barotropic structure, with its center located over the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) and provides the leading mode of variability of the western TP atmospheric circulation. However, existing research on the WTV mainly focuses on its interannual and seasonal variability, lacking detailed examination of synoptic scale processes. We utilize the daily ERA-Interim reanalysis to assess the intrinsic timescale of WTV activity, and the lifecycle of WTV events, at the synoptic scale.We find that the temporal evolution of the WTV at the synoptic scale can be interpreted as a red-noise (First-order Markov) process with an e-folding timescale ranging from 4.6 to 6.9 days, with a relatively longer duration in spring and summer and shorter duration during autumn and winter. The composite lifecycle of synoptic WTV events is characterized by a three-center wave train-like pattern across Eurasia (Scandinavia-West Siberia-western TP) during the developing and peak phases, while transitioning to a two-center dipole pattern (West Siberia-western TP) during the dissipating phase. During the developing and peak phases, intensity changes propagate eastward, accompanied by the eastward movement of nearly all three centers. In contrast, during the dissipating phase, the intensity of the two centers shows minimal propagation, with the West Siberia center shifting westward in position. Our results indicate that wave activity may differ between the developing-peak stages and the dissipation stage. This provides a foundation for further exploration on the dynamical characteristics of the WTV."

Contrary to classical protein crystallography, which only allows probing (cryo-trapped) stable states, we have used time-resolved serial femtosecond x-ray crystallography (tr-SFX) and pump-probe techniques with various illumination and delay times with respect to photoexcitation of the parent Pfr state. Thus, structural data for seven time frames were sorted into groups of molecular events along the reaction coordinate. They range from chromophore isomerization to the formation of Meta-F, the intermediate that precedes the functional relevant secondary structure transition of the tongue. Structural data for the early events were used to calculate the photoisomerization pathway to complement the experimental data. Late events allow identifying the molecular switch that is linked to the intramolecular proton transfer as a prerequisite for the following structural transitions."

Using a mouse gambling task with a reinforcement-learning model, we described individual decision-making profiles as a combination of three archetypal strategies: Optimizers, Risk-averse, and Explorers. These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles. Hence, we propose that striatal populations from different subregions influence distinct decision-making parameters, leading to profile-dependent choices."

While the m6A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout ofFTO, but notALKBH5, significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression. Mechanistic analysis reveals that FTO heightensELK3mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner. Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppressesELK3expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy. Our findings unravel the crucial role of FTO in T-ALL and highlight the FTO-ELK3 axis as a key nodule during leukemogenesis, thereby providing a fundamental basis to harness selective FTO antagonist for T-ALL therapeutics."

Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion ofPiezo1leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs.

PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification."

To study a variety of Hamiltonians and investigate their properties, it is essential to have highly configurable and easily engineerable structures with low disorder. Here, we demonstrate in situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger topological lattice by using an open-cavity configuration with an organic polymer layer. Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue shift, and extended macroscopic coherence.

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism."

PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model.

To further understand the low current density observed in human NaV1.9, we created chimeras with NaV1.5 and identified a role for the C-tail—specifically the IQ motif and EF-hand—in regulating current densities, likely due to a weak affinity for calmodulin. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that, unlike other NaVchannel subtypes, calmodulin binding to the C-tail is likely too weak to occur under physiological conditions. Markedly, the pre-IQ region did not influence channel expression but was responsible for conferring the characteristic depolarized voltage dependency of inactivation of NaV1.9.

Since risks arise from the interaction of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, publications were first classified by risk components and then further categorized by research fields: healthcare, society, ecosystem, agriculture, infrastructure, and heritage. The analysis allowed the identification of gaps in the current research with implications for policies and practical applications of risk assessments. First, only 3.1% of the revised literature integrates all three components in risk assessments. Second, most of the literature provides average risks over several heatwave events, thus neglecting critical factors like heatwave magnitude and duration. Third, the absence of standardized indices for identifying and classifying heatwaves hinders effective comparisons of results within the same field. It is recommended that future studies in the same field adopt a common methodology and that the above gaps are taken into account as this would enable building more robust and coherent scientific evidence while reducing ambiguities and uncertainties in risk estimates. Decisionmakers may otherwise struggle to develop effective heatwave adaptation and mitigation strategies if risk assessments are inconsistent or unreliable, and fail to account for risk interdependencies across different domains. More research is needed to develop quantitative frameworks that estimate heatwave risks by summing contributions from each affected domain. This is particularly important, as most of the papers reviewed only focused on healthcare (61.1%) or ecosystems (16.3%). However, we acknowledge that this literature review may have excluded some relevant studies, such as those in the heritage field, due to the specific search string applied in our methodology."

The topics covered include flood risk perception, insurance uptake, impact on property values, public mitigation strategies, behavioral responses to flooding, fatalities, and damages. We identify important gaps in the literature related to flood insurance demand, adoption of policies that encourage private and public investment in flood management, and flood risk management impacts in disadvantaged communities.

So far, this trend has been driven by increasing coastal development. However, as the climate continues to warm, changing TC climatology may also cause large changes in coastal damages in the future. Approaches to quantifying regional TC risk typically focus on total storm damage. However, it is crucial to understand the spatial footprint of TC damage and ultimately the spatial distribution of TC risk. Here, we quantify the magnitude and spatial pattern of TC risk (in expected annual damage (EAD)) across the US from wind, storm surge, and rainfall using synthetic TCs, physics-based hazard models, and a county-level statistical damage model trained on historical TC data. We then combine end-of-century TC hazard simulations with US population growth and wealth increase scenarios (under the SSP2 4.5 emission scenario) to investigate the sensitivity of changes in TC risk across the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts. We find that not directly accounting for the effects of rainfall and storm surge results in much lower risk estimates and smaller future increases in risk. TC climatology change and socioeconomic change drive similar magnitude increases in total EAD across the US (roughly 160%), and that their combined effect (633% increase) is much higher."

We also investigate sulfate controls on methylmercury production within subalpine peatlands by amending soils with sulfate to mimic increased stream export of sulfate from the alpine zone and measuring methylmercury formation rates for different sulfate treatments. We found that subalpine peatlands have statistically significant higher methylmercury concentrations and formation rates compared to alpine, mineral-soil wetlands. Methylmercury production in subalpine peatlands also increased significantly (p < 0.05) following sulfate additions; the highest rates occurred in sediments with intermediate extractable sulfate concentrations (∼0.60–1.4 mg sulfate g−1 dry soil).

This hypothesized aridity mitigation potential (AMP) of PV arrays posits that negative effects of reduced sunlight on photosynthesis and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) are offset by improved water relations, maintaining or enhancing productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Field tests of this hypothesis are lacking, however. Here we test the AMP hypothesis in a semi-arid Colorado (USA) grassland by contrasting ANPP responses to a single-axis tracking PV array in years with above- and below average precipitation. At all sites within and outside the PV array, precipitation inputs strongly limited ANPP. But in dry years, ANPP was increased by ∼20% in the array relative to adjacent open grassland, with ANPP in some array locations (near PV panel edges) increased by ∼90%. This AMP effect was muted with average precipitation and disappeared in wet years. We conclude that with climate change projections of increased aridity and drought, PV arrays that reduce plant water stress could provide a unique opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate some of their ecosystem consequences in water-limited grasslands."

Historical and future warming rates are commonly obtained from global climate models, which exhibit considerable spread in terms of global mean and region-dependent warming rates. While the multi-model spread in global mean warming rate has been widely reported in past literature, the multi-model spread in terms of the global warming pattern and its temporal evolution remain unclear. Here, we show that the multi-model spread in the simulated global warming pattern depends closely on the level of warming. The simulated global warming pattern deviates substantially among CMIP6 models before the 2010s and converges afterwards, as the levels of global greenhouse gases and mean warming elevates. Moreover, the consistency of model-predicted future warming patterns varies by emission scenario. Models predict increasingly consistent warming patterns under intermediate and high emission scenarios during the entire 21st century; whereas under low emission scenarios, the multi-models consistency in their simulated future warming patterns reaches a hiatus around the middle of the 21st century. While our study detects a synchronism between the multi-model consistency in the global warming pattern and the global warming level, the physical mechanisms underlying such varying multi-model consistency in the warming pattern merits further investigation."

An alternative to such probabilistic assessments is identification of upper bounds that quantify the hottest surface air temperatures that can possibly be achieved by the end of the 21st century. Theory, simulations, and observational analyses support the existence of a finite upper bound for surface air temperature; however, estimates for future upper-bound values that are realistic and usable for planning remain unavailable. Here, we combine atmospheric theory with large ensembles of dynamically downscaled projections to estimate historical and end-of-century upper bounds for surface air temperatures. A number of physical mechanisms can influence upper bounds, and at the end of the 21st century, estimates based on mechanisms that yield more moderate upper-bounds produce values around C for much of the Western United States and in excess of C for the hottest parts of the domain. Even cooler high-altitude locations have end-of-century upper bounds over C. Although these upper-bound estimates might seem implausibly large, increases in the upper bounds over the 21st century are similar to increases in dynamically downscaled peak surface temperatures after adjusting those downscaled temperatures to eliminate the possibly biased model trends in surface specific humidity. While upper bound estimates are high relative to historical observations, they nonetheless suggest that heatwave intensity risk is bounded, with uncertainty dominated by projections of surface and upper-level humidity."

We examined trends in heatwave frequency (HWF), intensity, and duration at multiple spatial/temporal scales, investigating how trend patterns and magnitudes vary across different periods. Results reveal substantial spatial heterogeneity in total heatwave days, with maxima exceeding 24 d per year in the Brazilian Highlands, the west coast of North America, parts of southwest Africa, and India, while cumulative temperature anomalies are highest at high latitudes. Notably, boreal summer is not consistently the season of most extreme heatwaves; over 65% of land areas experienced maximum HWF and severity in non-summer seasons. Long-term trends reveal an accelerating increase in HWF and severity globally, with exceptions in parts of India and central North America.

Current studies on the microbiome–disease interplay are still in their infancy, and sufficient understanding of microbial heterogeneity in pathological processes is lacking. Here we investigated the microbiome in the lung and gut of patients with pneumoconiosis in comparison to healthy individuals. Our findings indicated reciprocal causation between lung injuries and microbial dysbiosis under particle exposure; pulmonary Streptococcus and Stenotrophomonas, along with intestinal Ligilactobacillus and Blautia, may represent key microbial communities influencing pneumoconiosis progression. We defined close microbiota crosstalk between the lung and gut, as evidenced by their interaction networks, implying considerable effects on the gut microenvironment through either direct microbial translocation or other mechanisms such as inflammation-driven alterations.

Machine learning (ML) has been used to uncover the impacts of these mechanisms through feature engineering, but progress is limited by the data quality for training. Herein, we developed a universal ML strategy for precisely predicting the adsorption capacity of polymers for oxyanions and identifying the adsorption driving force based on the combination of experimental and published literature data. The adsorption mechanism was explored through classification of RDkit descriptors with different SHAP importance values, and electrostatic interaction was found to be the driving force in the oxyanion adsorption process, which was further verified by theoretical calculations, adsorption experiments, and effective targeted adsorbent design. In comparison, analysis relying on a separate literature data source led to decreased model performance, some biased conclusions, and invalid targeted adsorbent design. Overall, this study proposed a strategy for data set optimization as well as dominant mechanism identification, which could shed light on better treatment of oxyanions in wastewater."

Bernard;P. A. van der Beek;V. K. Pedersen;C. Colleps,Production and Preservation of Elevated Low‐Relief Surfaces in Mountainous Landscapes by Pliocene‐Quaternary Glaciations,"Global cooling during the Late Cenozoic led to periodic glaciations in many mountain regions. The repeated waxing and waning of glaciers and ice sheets resulted in continuously changing erosion regimes that modified the underlying topography. While some studies have argued that relief increased due to glaciation, others have argued that glaciations limit relief. The (pre‐glacial or glacial?) origin of elevated low‐relief surfaces (ELRS) in mountain belts is similarly controversial. ELRS have been used to reconstruct pre‐glacial landscapes, trace patterns of glacial incision, and infer tectonic uplift; it is thus important to test to what extent, and under which circumstances, glaciations may produce ELRS. We use a glacial landscape‐evolution model to quantify the integrated effect of Pliocene‐Quaternary glaciations on the topography of a mountain range. Our simulations show that glaciations can produce ELRS by shielding bedrock under slow‐moving, non‐erosive ice at intermediate elevations, with erosion focused on ice‐free summits and at lower elevations. We term this mechanism for ELRS formation the glacial shelter effect. The final extent of ELRS strongly depends on the climatic history and the efficacy of local erosion, which affect both ELRS formation and preservation. Specifically, efficient fluvial erosion during warm interglacials may dissect previously formed ELRS. Modeled ELRS are distributed across elevations because their formation and preservation depend on ice extent rather than on the average equilibrium‐line altitude. Our model results provide a comprehensive framework for the impact of glaciations on topography that explains both the presence and absence of ELRS in glaciated areas."

However, synoptic‐scale variations in precipitation δ18O are rarely discussed. This study presents synoptic‐scale variations in precipitation δ18O induced by the Indian monsoon depression (MD) during June‐September. The MD drives intense convection and rainfall over India, playing a crucial role in upstream processes on the TP. We use daily precipitation δ18O from four sites along a south‐north profile on the southern TP, spanning 92 MD events (1997–2018), and apply machine learning to rank the influencing climate factors. Results show clear spatial differences in precipitation δ18O response to synoptic events on the TP. During the MD, precipitation δ18O decreases significantly on the southern side of the Himalayas but slightly increases on the northern side. On the southern side, lower precipitation δ18O is resulted from an increase in westward water vapor flux while higher δ18O in the north is associated with an increase in southward water vapor flux and a decrease in the intensity of water vapor flux. Precipitation δ18O strongly depends on upstream rainfall and convection during the MD events on the southern side of the Himalayas, but less on the northern side. A positive correlation between precipitation δ18O and the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation index is observed in the Asian Summer Monsoon region, though the MD activity weakens this correlation on the southern side of the Himalayas. Our findings clarify the understanding of precipitation δ18O in a synoptic scale system on the southern TP."

However, the diurnal precipitation across mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) and the factors influencing its spatial variations are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated diurnal precipitation patterns in summertime (June–August) from 2002 to 2005 over MSEA using ground‐based observations, satellite products, the global ERA5 reanalysis, and high‐resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model at 9‐ and 3‐km grid spacing forced by ERA5 hourly data on ∼0.25° grids. Various observation‐based data sets including GHCN‐Daily, Multi‐Source Weighted‐Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Asian Precipitation ‐ Highly‐Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), and Integrated Multi‐satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) were used. In evaluating daily precipitation over MSEA, MSWEP, and APHRODITE data sets show similar patterns in precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity, while IMERG tends to produce higher amounts but with less frequency. ERA5 overestimates light precipitation compared to the other data sets. The WRF simulations generally produce heavier but less frequent light precipitation, with the 3‐km simulation producing less intense precipitation than the 9‐km simulation. A k‐means classification of IMERG data revealed five distinct spatial regimes with varying diurnal precipitation cycles. The WRF simulations closely match these regimes, capturing key diurnal cycles missed by ERA5 over mountainous regions and coastlines. Additionally, convective activities and near‐surface winds influence these cycles, with WRF simulations better representing coastal and mountain precipitation patterns than ERA5. High‐resolution WRF simulations, especially the 3‐km simulation, capture diurnal precipitation more accurately than ERA5, highlighting the importance of employing convection‐permitting models to simulate precipitation diurnal cycles over complex terrain."

This study involves three experiments designed to evaluate the impacts of assimilating the polarimetric variable specific differential phase (KDP) for a squall line case in Jiangsu Province, including a control experiment without DA and two experiments with radar DA. In the first DA experiment, only conventional radar variables reflectivity and radial velocity are assimilated at 6‐min intervals, while the other DA experiment additionally assimilates KDP. Strong correlations between model variables and KDP are established based on the prior ensemble, which contributes to the positive DA effects. The assimilation of KDP leads to significant improvements in both the horizontal and vertical structures of the analyses, with stronger lower‐layer convergence and updrafts in front of the squall line. Additionally, the rainwater mixing ratio intensifies and expands in the northern part of the squall line with KDP assimilation. Consequently, the precipitable water and convective available potential energy are increased from 70 to 80 mm and from 1,559 to 2,116 J/kg, respectively, supported by higher pseudo‐equivalent potential temperatures at 925 hPa. Furthermore, the analyzed and predicted composite reflectivity is enhanced with KDP assimilation, aligning well with observations. In the 1‐hr rainfall forecast, both the location and intensity of the short‐term precipitation are improved by assimilating KDP, which is further confirmed by objective quantitative assessments."

This trend can be reversed by reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A large‐ensemble model experiment, in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations are quadrupled and then reduced to the initial state, shows an overall recovery of Arctic SIA by CO2 removal, but at a slower rate than its decline to CO2 increase. The exception is the North Atlantic, where SIA increases rapidly with decreasing CO2 concentrations. The under‐recovery of Central Arctic SIA can be attributed to a slow decrease in Arctic ocean heat storage, due to a lagged ocean cooling and heat transport, and enhanced downward longwave radiation in the Arctic atmosphere, partly due to frequent atmospheric rivers across the Arctic Circle. In contrast, the over‐recovery of North Atlantic SIA is primarily attributed to weakened ocean heat transport by a delayed recovery of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This over‐recovery is shown to be model dependent, following each model's AMOC change. Full recovery of Arctic SIA takes over 300 years after CO2 removal. This result suggests that the response of Arctic sea ice to CO2 removal may be spatially inhomogeneous, with different impacts on regional climate, potentially affecting the climate of the Northern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes."

 Modelling liver disease requires in vitro systems that replicate disease progression1,2. Current tissue-derived organoids fail to reproduce the complex cellular composition and tissue architecture observed in vivo3. Here, we describe a multicellular organoid system composed of adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells that recapitulates the architecture of the liver periportal region and, when manipulated, models aspects of cholestatic injury and biliary fibrosis. We first generate reproducible hepatocyte organoids with functional bile canaliculi network that retain morphological features of in vivo tissue. By combining these with cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts, we generate assembloids that mimic the cellular interactions of the periportal region. Assembloids are functional, consistently draining bile from bile canaliculi into the bile duct. Strikingly, manipulating the relative number of portal mesenchymal cells is sufficient to induce a fibrotic-like state, independently of an immune compartment. By generating chimeric assembloids of mutant and wild-type cells, or after gene knockdown, we show proof-of-concept that our system is amenable to investigating gene function and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Taken together, we demonstrate that liver assembloids represent a suitable in vitro system to study bile canaliculi formation, bile drainage, and how different cell types contribute to cholestatic disease and biliary fibrosis, in an all-in-one model."

 The degree to which the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) weakens over the twenty-first century varies widely across climate models, with some predicting substantial weakening. Here we show that this uncertainty can be greatly reduced by using a thermal-wind expression that relates the AMOC strength to the meridional density difference and the overturning depth in the Atlantic. This expression captures the intermodel spread in AMOC weakening, with most of the spread arising from overturning depth changes. The overturning depth also establishes a crucial link between the present-day and future AMOC strength. Climate models with a stronger and deeper present-day overturning tend to predict larger weakening and shoaling under warming because the present-day North Atlantic is less stratified, allowing for a deeper penetration of surface buoyancy flux changes, larger density changes at depth and, consequently, larger AMOC weakening. By incorporating observational constraints, we conclude that the AMOC will experience limited weakening of about 3–6 Sv (about 18–43%) by the end of this century, regardless of emissions scenario. These results indicate that the uncertainty in twenty-first-century AMOC weakening and the propensity to predict substantial AMOC weakening can be attributed primarily to climate model biases in accurately simulating the present-day ocean stratification. Observational constraints, along with a better understanding of climate model behaviour, suggest that the projected weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in the twenty-first century will be less severe than previously anticipated."

 Lung injury in preterm infants leads to structural and functional respiratory deficits, with a risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that in its most severe form is accompanied by pulmonary hypertension (PH). To identify potential cellular and molecular drivers of BPD in humans, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of preterm infant lungs with evolving BPD and BPD + PH compared to term infants. Examination of endothelial cells reveals a unique, aberrant capillary cell-state in BPD + PH defined by ANKRD1 expression. Within the alveolar parenchyma in infants with BPD/BPD + PH, predictive signaling analysis identifies surprising deficits in the semaphorin guidance-cue pathway, with decreased expression of pro-angiogenic transcription factor FOXF1. Loss of semaphorin signaling is replicated in a murine BPD model and in humans with causal FOXF1 mutations for alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACDMPV), suggesting a mechanistic link between developmental programs underlying BPD and ACDMPV and uncovering a critical role for semaphorin signaling in normal lung development.

Here the authors show that inhibiting b-catenin with lipid nanoparticles encapsulating siRNA targeting CTNNB1 impairs tumor growth and promotes anti-tumor immunity in preclinical HCC models. 
 First-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations show responses in subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Nearly half of HCCs are Wnt-active with mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for β-catenin), AXIN1/2, or APC, and demonstrate heterogeneous and limited benefit to ICI due to an immune excluded tumor microenvironment. We show significant tumor responses in multiple β-catenin-mutated immunocompetent HCC models to a novel siRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle targeting CTNNB1 (LNP-CTNNB1). Both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cellular and zonal reprogramming, along with activation of immune regulatory transcription factors IRF2 and POU2F1, re-engaged type I/II interferon signaling, and alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity upon β-catenin suppression with LNP-CTNNB1 at early- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, ICI enhances response to LNP-CTNNB1 in advanced-stage disease by preventing T cell exhaustion and through formation of lymphoid aggregates (LA). In fact, expression of an LA-like gene signature prognosticates survival for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the IMbrave150 phase III trial and inversely correlates with CTNNB1-mutatational status in this patient cohort. In conclusion, LNP-CTNNB1 is efficacious as monotherapy and in combination with ICI in CTNNB1-mutated HCCs through impacting tumor cell-intrinsic signaling and remodeling global immune surveillance, providing rationale for clinical investigations. Gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for b-catenin) leading to deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling are frequently observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Here, the authors shed light into this mechanism of chemoresistance, showing that chemotherapeutic drugs can promote the degradation of CAD following cleavage by activated caspase-3 on its Asp1371 residue. 
 Metabolic heterogeneity resulting from the intra-tumoral heterogeneity mediates massive adverse outcomes of tumor therapy, including chemotherapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms inside remain largely unknown. Here, we find that the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway determines the chemosensitivity. Chemotherapeutic drugs promote the degradation of cytosolic Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II, Aspartate transcarbamylase, and Dihydroorotase (CAD), an enzyme that is rate-limiting for pyrimidine synthesis, leading to apoptosis. We also find that CAD needs to be cleaved by caspase-3 on its Asp1371 residue, before its degradation. Overexpressing CAD or mutating Asp1371 to block caspase-3 cleavage confers chemoresistance in xenograft and Cldn18-ATK gastric cancer models. Importantly, mutations related to Asp1371 of CAD are found in tumor samples that failed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and pharmacological targeting of CAD-Asp1371 mutations using RMY-186 ameliorates chemotherapy efficacy. Our work reveals the vulnerability of de novo pyrimidine synthesis during chemotherapy, highlighting CAD as a promising therapeutic target and biomarker.

 How does the motor cortex combine simple movements (such as single finger flexion/extension) into complex movements (such as hand gestures, or playing the piano)? To address this question, motor cortical activity was recorded using intracortical multi-electrode arrays in two male people with tetraplegia as they attempted single, pairwise and higher-order finger movements. Neural activity for simultaneous movements was largely aligned with linear summation of corresponding single finger movement activities, with two violations. First, the neural activity exhibited normalization, preventing a large magnitude with an increasing number of moving fingers. Second, the neural tuning direction of weakly represented fingers changed significantly as a result of the movement of more strongly represented fingers. These deviations from linearity resulted in non-linear methods outperforming linear methods for neural decoding. Simultaneous finger movements are thus represented by the combination of individual finger movements by pseudo-linear summation. Here, the authors show that Intracortical recordings in human motor cortex during attempted multi-finger movements reveal a largely linear code with two violations: magnitude normalization and greater shifts in tuning direction for weakly represented fingers."

 AlGaN alloys with high Al content offer the possibility to create deep ultraviolet light sources emitting at wavelengths ≤ 240 nm with enhanced quantum efficiency. However, increasing the band gap when the Al content surpasses  ~80% leads to problems with n-type doping of AlGaN alloys with the standard choice of Si donors, due to the formation of the so-called negative Si DX center. In this paper, we show that the amphoteric nature of the Si dopant in AlGaN alloys is fundamentally controlled by the local environment and the ordering of the Ga and Al atoms in the vicinity of the Si atom. Our conclusions are based on advanced characterization sensitive to the local environment of defects and impurities, complemented by electronic structure calculations.

Accessions were given a future climate resilience score and a genomic adaptive capacity score using genomic estimated adaptive values generated from environmental genomic selection. We identified the best potential parents and the geographies that harbour the most promising genotypes for crop improvements, as well as more at-risk areas. Such methods may be expanded to other crops and used for decision support for future breeding.

 The physical dimension of cities and its spatial patterns play a crucial role in shaping society and urban dynamics. Understanding the complexity of urban systems requires a detailed assessment of their physical structure. Urban geography has long focused on framing typologies to represent common patterns in the urban fabric using various methodologies. However, only recent advancements in computational methods and global land cover data have enabled to comprehensively identify typologies of urban patterns at the city scale through new unsupervised approaches. Nevertheless, typologies of finer-grained patterns at intra-urban scale have not yet been explored comprehensively at a global level. In this paper, building upon these advances, we explore the intra-urban patterns of more than 1500 cities across the globe. We rely on a Local Climate Zone land cover classification to represent the multidimensional variabilities of intra-urban morphology. Adapting a deep learning based unsupervised clustering approach, we find a typology of 138 intra-urban patterns. Analyzing the results of this data-driven approach, we prove that each pattern identified is unique, i.e. statistically different, in its composition and configuration. With this study summarizing the global diversity of the urban fabric, we reveal that any city of the world can be described as a specific assemblage of a fraction of these 138 universal patterns.

 Upright maize straw left in the field during autumn and winter significantly contributes to severe air pollution in agricultural ecosystems due to burning. It is essential to obtain the spatial distribution of upright maize straw quickly and accurately for effective management and environmental protection. However, identifying upright maize straw using remote sensing is difficult because its spectral properties resemble those of other land covers like straw residue, bare soil, and sparse wheat at the same period. This study proposes a novel index for extracting upright maize straw by integrating low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) visible to near-infrared spectral bands with digital surface model (DSM) data. First, we analyzed the spectral characteristics of four land cover types: upright maize straw, straw residue, bare soil, and sparse wheat, and proposed the adjusted straw index (ASI) that leverages green, red, and red-edge bands. Next, we combined DSM data with the ASI to develop the adjusted height straw index (AHSI), considering the height of the upright maize straw. Finally, the combination of index-plus-Otsu threshold segmentation and random forest (RF) methods was applied to identify and extract the spatial distribution of upright maize straw. The results showed that our method effectively detected the main regions of upright maize straw. The two proposed straw indices achieved over 87%(ASI) and 96%(AHSI) extraction accuracies across three different study regions. The two new indices not only significantly improve the accuracy of upright maize straw identification but also provide a new approach for low-cost UAV-based identification of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV)."

 The wheat powdery mildew (WPM) is one of the most severe crop diseases worldwide, affecting wheat growth and causing yield losses. The WPM was a bottom-up disease that caused the loss of cell integrity, leaf wilting, and canopy structure damage with these symptoms altering the crop’s functional traits (CFT) and canopy spectra. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral analysis became a mainstream method for WPM detection. However, the CFT changes experienced by infected wheats, the relationship between CFT and canopy spectra, and their role in WPM detection remained unclear, which might blur the understanding for the WPM infection. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a new method that considered the role of CFT for detecting WPM and estimating disease severity. The UAV hyperspectral data used in this study were collected from the Plant Protection Institute’s research demonstration base, Xinxiang city, China, covering a broad range of WPM severity (0–85 %) from 2022 to 2024. The potential of eight CFT [leaf structure parameter (N), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll a + b content (Cab), carotenoids (Car), Car/Cab, anthocyanins (Ant), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and average leaf angle (Deg)] obtained from a hybrid method combining a radiative transfer model and random forest (RF) and fifty-five narrow-band hyperspectral indices (NHI) was explored in WPM detection. Results indicated that N, Cab, Ant, Car, LAI, and CCC showed a decreasing trend with increasing disease severity, while Deg and Car/Cab exhibited the opposite pattern. There were marked differences between healthy samples and the two higher infection levels (moderate and severe infection) for Cab, Car, LAI, Deg, CCC, and Car/Cab. N and Ant only showed significant differences between the healthy samples and the highest infection level (severe infection). As Cab, Car, and Ant decreased, the spectral reflectance in the visible light region increased. The decrease in N and LAI was accompanied by a reduction in reflectance across the entire spectral range and the near-infrared area, which was exactly the opposite of Deg. The introduction of CFT greatly improved the accuracy of the WPM severity estimation model with R2 of 0.92. Features related to photosynthesis, pigment content, and canopy structure played a decisive role in estimating WPM severity. Also, results found that the feature importance showed a remarkable interchange as increasing disease levels. Using features that described canopy structure changes, such as optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, LAI, visible atmospherically resistant indices, and CCC, the mild infection stage of this disease was most easily distinguished from healthy samples. In contrast, most severe impacts of WPM were best characterized by features related to photosynthesis (e.g., photochemical reflectance index 515) and pigment content (e.g., normalized phaeophytinization index).

 The study aimed to assess the impact of blocking situations (BS) on maximum air temperature (Tmax) and the daily sum of solar radiation (DSSR) in Poland during the summer months (June–August) from 1971 to 2023. The results indicate an increasing trend in the frequency of BS days, particularly in southern Poland, with statistically significant upward tendencies. However, multi-decadal variability is also evident, with periods of more and less frequent BS occurrences. On average, BS occurred for 3–8 days per summer, varying by region, while in extreme years (e.g., 2015), over 20 BS days were recorded in southern Poland. During all BS days, Tmax anomalies averaged up to 7 °C, and DSSR anomalies reached as high as +6 MJ·m−2·day−1 relative to multi-year averages. A strong correlation was found between the number of BS days and Tmax (r = 0.57, p < 0.001), as well as DSSR (r = 0.55, p < 0.001). Interestingly, smaller temperature anomalies were recorded near the Baltic coast, likely due to the moderating influence of sea breezes.

In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band, which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor and also distinguish a chiral from a nonchiral Δkthrough enhanced s-wave proximity. In this study, we used s-wave superconductive scan tips and detected intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2(0-11) termination surface. Imaging revealed subgap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures witha-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity signifies that Δkof UTe2is a nonchiral state:B1u,B2u, orB3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along theaaxis is internodal, then a nonchiralB3ustate is the most consistent for UTe2."

BRAF regulation, involving monomeric autoinhibition and activation by dimerization, has been intensely scrutinized, but mechanisms enabling oncogenic mutants to evade regulation remain unclear. By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix αC displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix αC in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds."

However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO2efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions."

Using ~700 accessions across Asia, we show that the initial domestication happened three to five thousand years ago in central Japan during the Jomon period, followed by a range expansion into China and secondary hybridization with Chinese wild populations. We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution (VaPAP1for loss of mottled black andVaANR1for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication."

We therefore designed a cross-species neural activity screen, applicable to humans and mice, combining precise affective behavioral measurements, clinical medication administration, and brain-wide intracranial electrophysiology. This screen revealed conserved biphasic dynamics in which emotionally salient sensory signals are swiftly broadcast throughout the brain and followed by a characteristic persistent activity pattern.

By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years.

It affects the livelihoods of people inhabiting permafrost areas and is affected by human activity within and outside of the cryosphere’s geographical span. ‘Frozen commons’ (FCs) are cryosphere resources and landscapes, defined by snow, ice, and permafrost, that are experienced, used, protected and managed by groups of people together. This paper highlights collaboration between herders and scientists aimed at improving the understanding of FCs in northern Mongolia, a region of rapid cryosphere transformation. The impact of climate change on Indigenous and pastoralist communities in Mongolia is profound, leading to the damage or loss of FCs critical to local livelihoods. Therefore, Indigenous and local knowledge becomes crucial in assessing and predicting the climate-driven dynamics of FCs. In 2022, 2023, 2024 a team of permafrost scientists, geographers, and economists conducted interviews in reindeer and cattle herder camps in Khövsgöl Aimag (Province) located in the northern part of Mongolia. Local livelihoods do not depend only on cattle, which allows us to examine a variety of animal–environment interactions and impacts on pastoralism. The analysis of interviews indicates that FCs are a vital resource for the Khövsgöl communities and holds significant importance in their daily lives. Permafrost plays a key role for herders as it provides water resources for pastures and local rivers, which is critical during dry summers. Ice and snow also have many uses, such as a source of water, winter transport and the basis of cultural events. As winters become shorter and ice conditions become less predictable, the sustainability and availability of these resources for local people are under threat. In light of these challenges, it is imperative to formulate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies through collaborative efforts that actively involve and respect the perspectives of Indigenous and local people."

Yet biodiversity data reveal more than species distributions. They reflect colonial histories, economic inequities, and cultural differences. This article argues for moving beyond ideas of ‘spatial bias’ in conservation science to highlight the colonial legacies and contemporary social forces that shape biodiversity data. Drawing on interviews with the GBIF staff and data publishers as well as critical mapping of GBIF data patterns, we visualize and analyze how and why colonial patterns persist and shift in this global biodiversity data. To explain diverse trajectories of postcolonial production of data, we identify three social forces–colonial legacies of collecting, infrastructures of international development, and contemporary data cultures–that structure biodiversity observation distributions and data ownership and availability. Together, these findings demonstrate how, even in the age of open access, colonial and postcolonial practices and politics continue to shape what we know about the natural world."

We discuss a comprehensive policy mix with four components that municipal water utilities need to address the growing water deficits as rising demands confront limited supplies: (1) reduction of nonrevenue water, (2) source diversification, (3) reduction of customer water use, and (4) establishment of financial reserves to address climate-related emergencies."

Seasonally, the positive anomalies shift from the central Arctic Ocean in summer toward the Greenland and Norwegian Seas in winter, driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The second EOF (EOF2) explains 9.5% of annual wind speed changes and consists of a meridional dipole structure, i.e. positive anomalies over the Russian Arctic seas and negative anomalies over the Greenland and Norway Seas, mainly driven by the Arctic dipole and NAO.

During this process, sufficient electron transfer from the catalyst surface to the antibonding π* orbitals of adsorbed NO and O2 is necessary to facilitate the adsorption and subsequent bond cleavage. Herein, an electronic orbital coupling strategy is applied by doping praseodymium (Pr) into a CeO2-TiO2 (CeTi) composite oxide to obtain a PrCeTi bifunctional catalyst, which has a strong interaction with NO to form NO+, further splitting with N3+ production and thereby enhancing NH3-SCR performance following the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. Meanwhile, O2 adsorbs on the PrCeTi catalyst surface to produce superoxide (O2–) and further transforms into peroxide (O22–) which, along with increased temperature, boosts the PhCH3 total oxidation. Finally, the coactivation of NO and O2 over the PrCeTi catalyst contributes to its better simultaneous removal efficiency of NOx and toluene than that of the CeTi catalyst."

Here, we observed distinct proteinuria in the mice exposed to sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS), an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate. The renal S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) level increased due to the decrease in its hydrolase adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY), and was positively correlated with the observed proteinuria. Consequently, the DNA methylation level was downregulated. Specifically, the promoter methylation of Arap3 increased, while the genebody methylation of Tiam1 decreased, thereby causing downregulation of their mRNA expressions. This further suppressed the levels of Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1, which then reduced their downstream genes Pip5k1a, Pip5k1b and Pip5k1c, and eventually inhibited Actn4 expression. Consequently, the podocyte cytoskeleton was disrupted, promoting foot process fusion and inducing proteinuria. Overexpression of AHCY in OBS-exposed mice reduced the level of SAH, restored the methylation levels and gene expressions, ameliorated the podocyte injury, and eventually reduced the level of urinary protein. Taken together, inhibition of AHCY was the molecular initiating event of OBS-induced proteinuria, which functioned through the AHCY–SAH–Arap3/Tiam1–RhoA/Rac1–Pip5k1a/Pip5k1b/Pip5k1c–Actn4 axis.

Here, we present a MoS2 modification strategy to address these challenges. MoS2-modified ZVI (MoS2-ZVI) exhibited dechlorination rate constants that are 1.25 to 54 times those obtained with ZVI, for eight representative CHCs, with significantly fewer incompletely dechlorinated products. The electron efficiency values increased to 2.7–26.5 times, with the synchronously inhibited H2 evolution possibly resulting from the increased hydrophobicity caused by MoS2 modification. While H• contributes to the reduction of certain CHCs, the enhancement by MoS2 is mainly attributed to improved electron transfer at the surface. Characterization results revealed partial integration of MoS2 with ZVI and the presence of sulfur vacancies on MoS2 surfaces in MoS2-ZVI. Electrochemical experiments with separated ZVI and MoS2bm in different compartments identified sulfur vacancies as the reactive sites. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory results demonstrated that CHCs adsorb at Mo sites exposed by sulfur vacancies, and this process is facilitated by the integrated effects of underlying ZVI. The dechlorination of CHCs subsequently occurs with the electrons transferred from ZVI to the surface-bonded CHC through the MoS2 layer. This study provides a broadly applicable modification strategy for achieving rapid, full, and selective dechlorination of a wide range of CHCs."

However, its wider use faces obstacles because of the copresence of various pollutants in wastewater and the additional requirement for magnesium to achieve proper supersaturation conditions. To address these challenges, this study developed novel mineral–hydrogel composites that can remove ammonium and phosphate simultaneously via heterogeneous struvite and calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralization in hydrogel matrices. The composites include in situ formed struvite and CaP mineral seeds, decreasing the nucleation energy barrier of struvite and CaP formation and promoting their heterogeneous nucleation kinetics even under undersaturation conditions in bulk solution. The dual struvite and CaP seeded composites can simultaneously reduce the ammonium and total phosphate concentrations up to 60% (26.3 mg of N/g) and 91% (9.54 mg of P/g), respectively. The average particle sizes in composites were increased from 6.12 to 14.8 nm after wastewater treatment. Moreover, various ions commonly existing in wastewater did not significantly interfere with the removal of ammonium and phosphate. Thus, these new mineral–hydrogel composites can provide an innovative way to lower nutrient levels before discharge to streams. Moreover, encapsulating ammonium and phosphate in mineral-hydrogel composites enables their upcycling in agricultural or biorefinery applications."

This review focuses on the key distinctions in PFAS exposure between the occupational population and the general population from different countries. A systematic summary is made from the external exposure environment, exposure pathways, internal exposure levels, and health effects of the occupational population. The manufacturing, use, and disposal processes of PFAS increase their concentration levels in the ambient environment, leading to significantly higher concentrations than background areas. Different PFAS exposure pathways may lead to different molecular initiating events and health outcomes in the occupational population and the general population. Moreover, the PFAS exposure levels of the occupational population are nearly one hundred times higher than those of the general population. Mixed exposure to more unknown PFAS is another important feature of the occupational population. Although occupational exposure to PFAS is not associated with mortality, PFAS exposure can significantly disrupt metabolic pathways and cause adverse effects on the liver, kidney, and lipid homeostasis. Therefore, more stringent occupational protections for the PFAS occupational population are necessary to reduce their health risks."

Quantifying natural mercury fluxes is essential to understanding anthropogenic perturbations and guiding effective reduction strategies. We investigate hydrothermal mercury inputs at the Tonga volcanic arc and their impact on the local ecosystem. Our results show that hydrothermal and volcanic activity in the Tonga Arc increases mercury concentrations in seawater. Comprehensive surveys identified mercury-rich plumes (up to 22.7 pmol L–1) associated with high mercury fluxes (4763 pmol m–2 day–1) reaching productive surface waters, resulting in an estimated total flux of 4.23 t y–1 for the entire Tonga Arc. Despite these significant inputs, mercury concentrations in phytoplankton remain unexpectedly low. We demonstrate that phytoplankton blooms, stimulated by natural iron fertilization from hydrothermal sources, dilute mercury at the cellular level, reducing the impact of hydrothermal mercury.

To bridge the theoretical gap, this study investigated the mechanisms of P enrichment through microbially mediated mineralization of natural P-containing DOM by adopting an approach combining comprehensive field investigation with hydrochemical and molecular biological analyses. The co-analysis of the dominant microbial community compositions and genomics revealed that the microbial metabolism pathways involved in the biodegradation of P-containing DOM were associated with the enrichment level of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Specifically, dephosphorylation was more pronounced under conditions of limited DIP, while C–P bond cleavage was the primary metabolic pathway under sufficient DIP. Co-occurrence network analysis further indicated that the substrates for DIP enrichment differed between dephosphorylation and C–P bond cleavage, namely CHONSP1 compounds in the region of highly unsaturated-low O compounds (AI ≤ 0.5, H/C < 1.5, and O/C < 0.4) and CHOP1 compounds in the region of highly unsaturated-high O compounds (AI ≤ 0.5, H/C < 1.5, and O/C ≥ 0.4), respectively.

The high Cu content mitigates the risk of SO2-induced structural degradation. A key finding is that lower regeneration temperatures can lead to more severe secondary poisoning, while high temperatures induce hydrothermal aging. Thus, controlling the regeneration temperature is critical for maintaining long-term catalyst stability. Additionally, experimental results and DFT calculations show that SO2 preferentially reacts with dimer-Cu species, especially hydrogenated dimer-Cu ([CuII2(NH3)4(OH)O]+), resulting in significant sulfate accumulation. This interaction inhibits the redox cycle of Cu+/Cu2+, thereby suppressing low-temperature activity. Overall, this work elucidates the mechanisms of SO2-induced deactivation in Cu-zeolite SCR catalysts and provides valuable insights into designing Cu-SSZ-13 catalysts with enhanced sulfur resistance through Cu-Al co-optimization."

While natural organic matter exists as a ubiquitous redox mediator, how it regulates the distance scale of •OH production in a heterogeneous system remains poorly understood. This study, for the first time, reports an unrecognized route mediated by humic acid (HA) in extending the spatial range of •OH from oxygenation of reduced hematite (rHem). The results showed that HA facilitated the spatial redistribution of •OH from the surface to the solution, posing inverse impacts on oxidation efficacies of pollutants with varying surface accessibilities. It was difficult to explain the enhanced free •OH production using electron shuttling by quinones or dissolved Fe–HA complexes. Comprehensive evidence demonstrated that adsorbed HA preferentially consumed surface-bound •OH to trigger a solid-to-liquid propagation of carbon-centered radicals (CCR•), dominantly promoting formation of secondary free •OH far from the surface. Reactive-transport simulation and in situ fluorescence results visualized interfacial and centimeter-scale long-range production of •OH mediated by CCR•. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry verified the role of surface decarboxylation of adsorbed HA in CCR• generation. These findings offer new insights into the environmental fate of •OH produced during iron redox cycling in natural and engineered systems, including those with natural organic matter."

Many emerging and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been disposed into the world’s oceans, exemplified by the recent discovery of large amounts of the halogenated pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) waste in the waters of Southern California. The biological mechanisms governing persistence and trophic transfer of marine pollutants into seafood species remain incompletely understood. Xenobiotic transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are present in all organisms and prevent the accumulation of toxic chemicals. Our previous work has demonstrated that halogenated marine pollutants can act as inhibitors of human and murine P-gp transporters by interacting with their binding site and impeding transport. Using cryo-EM, we determined the molecular interactions of DDT with P-glycoprotein from yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). The results reveal that the conformation of the transporter samples multiple degrees of widening in the absence of substrate. We also show that DDT binds in a singular, wide inward-facing conformation that could inhibit the transport cycle. This transporter inhibition may contribute to the bioaccumulation of DDT in tuna. This study highlights the capacity of persistent organic pollutants to act at multiple points in the food chain to inhibit this critical transport mechanism."

While microbial communities constitute the resilient power of lake ecosystems to CyanoHAB disturbances, the role of fungi remains underexplored. Here, the dynamics of size-fractionated fungal and associated bacterial communities were tracked across the peak and decline stages of a CyanoHAB event in shallow subtropical Lake Taihu. The results revealed that the composition of fungal and bacterial communities in separated size fractions varied between bloom stages, with enrichment patterns likely influenced by their reliance on algal-derived nutrients. Null model-based analysis revealed a shift in fungal community assembly, from dominance by dispersal limitation (44%) and drift (30%) at the peak stage to increased homogeneous selection (44%) at the early decline stage, whereas bacterial communities remained predominantly shaped by stochastic processes, highlighting their distinct responses to cyanobacterial biomass decomposition. Comparative topological analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks showed strengthened cross-kingdom fungi-bacteria interactions as the bloom declined, especially within decomposing cyanobacterial colonies, facilitating nutrient cycling and accelerating cyanobacterial biomass removal. These findings led to a conceptual model proposing fungi as critical members of the freshwater microbiome in eutrophic lakes, driving biogeochemical cycling and potentially contributing to the resilience of the lake ecosystem against CyanoHABs."

To assess the role of fire ash in altering CO2 and CH4 fluxes in aquatic sediments, we designed three mesocosm experiments that compared the changing fluxes of these gases and water quality parameters under different loads and types of ash. Black ash (char) caused substantial drops in pH and increased CO2 and CH4 emissions through abiotic and biotic mechanisms, while white ash dramatically increased pH and enhanced CH4 emissions, possibly due to inhibition of methanotrophy. White ash-driven increases in pH also instigated CO2 uptake. If this abiotically driven CO2 uptake could interact with ash-driven nutrient fertilization to synergistically enhance biotic CO2 uptake in surface waters after a fire, these initial increases in pH may represent an important priming effect. Our findings suggest that strong ash flows following fires may trigger substantial pulses of heterotrophic or abiotically driven greenhouse gas emissions or uptake in recipient lentic aquatic ecosystems, which─although they may be overshadowed by autotrophic responses─may nonetheless be central to altered lake or wetland carbon balance following a fire."

Biofiltration using adsorbents with dual adsorption–biodegradation functions, such as biological anion exchange resins (BAERs), offers a promising solution. Compared to biological activated carbon (BAC), BAERs’ adjustable skeletons enable targeted EfOM removal. This study designed two BAERs with polystyrene (PS-AER) and magnetic polyacrylic (MPA-AER) skeletons and compared them with conventional polyacrylic BAER (PA-AER) and BACs. During 12 000-bed-volume field applications, BAERs demonstrated 1.7–2.6 and 1.6–2.6 times higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 removal rates than BACs. This efficacy stemmed from the high concentration of negatively charged components, which BAERs effectively attract. Furthermore, skeleton modifications improved DOC removal by 15.3–17.2% and UV254 removal by 7.3–18.2% for PS-AER and MPA-AER, compared to PA-AER. The MPA-AER’s open pore structure enhanced diffusion of high molecular weight components, while PS-AER’s enhanced hydrophobicity improved aromatic component removal. These structural changes also influenced the biological effects of BAERs. Notably, the enhanced performance of PS-AER and MPA-AER reduced wastewater cytotoxicity and controlled the production of disinfection byproducts.

This study aimed to evaluate the adverse effects of ITs at human-relevant levels on the male mammal reproductive system. First, we employed testicular cells to determine all test ITs exerting relatively high toxicity, with 2-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT) exhibiting toxicity higher than that of other ITs. Then, the OIT was administered to mice through drinking water at nominal doses of 50 and 5000 μg/kg/day from gestational day 10. Consequently, we found that the two doses of the OIT caused retarded testis development in suckling pups, accompanied by male reproductive impairments in adulthood, including decreased sperm count and increased malformations. When receiving subsequent spermatogenic stress induced by an injection of busulfan, OIT-exposed mice exhibited more pronounced testicular abnormalities and sperm defects, indicating increased susceptibility to stress. In addition, our in vitro results of germ cell line and mouse sperm, combined with sperm defects in animals, suggest the possibility that OIT-caused testicular impairments are partly due to its binding to thiol-containing molecules. Altogether, our study for the first time shows that exposure to OIT at human-relevant levels not only impairs the male reproductive system but also induces it to be more susceptible to subsequent spermatogenic stress, which highlights reproductive health risks of OIT."

Despite extensive research, decoupling these two steps and quantifying their relative contributions remain challenging due to the lack of reliable characterization methods. Here, we develop a rapid, reproducible electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) protocol incorporating advanced electrical equivalent circuits to directly quantify partitioning and diffusion resistance. Its validity is verified through membrane filtration experiments and activation energy analysis. Our findings reveal that diffusion dominates ion transport resistance, with values 4.5 to 6.0 times higher than partitioning resistance across diverse monovalent cations. However, we discovered a critical concentration-dependent behavior where partitioning resistance becomes increasingly significant at lower electrolyte concentrations, eventually equaling diffusion resistance near 0.1 mM. We also uncovered that the anomalously low rejection of NH4+ of RO membranes stemmed from significantly reduced diffusion resistance, likely due to moderate hydrogen-bonding interactions with membrane pores or its tetrahedral geometry. This quantitative insight into transport resistance mechanisms establishes new design principles for next-generation RO membranes, enabling tailored strategies for applications ranging from high-salinity desalination to the removal of low-concentration micropollutants."

 Anthropogenic activities impose multiple concurrent pressures on soils globally, but responses of soil microbes to multiple global change factors are poorly understood. Here, we apply 10 treatments (warming, drought, nitrogen deposition, salinity, heavy metal, microplastics, antibiotics, fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) individually and in combinations of 8 factors to soil samples, and monitor their bacterial and viral composition by metagenomic analysis. We recover 742 mostly unknown bacterial and 1865 viral Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs), and leverage them to describe microbial populations under different treatment conditions. The application of multiple factors selects for prokaryotic and viral communities different from any individual factor, favouring the proliferation of potentially pathogenic mycobacteria and novel phages, which apparently play a role in shaping prokaryote communities. We also build a 25 M gene catalog to show that multiple factors select for metabolically diverse, sessile and non-biofilm-forming bacteria with a high load of antibiotic resistance genes. Finally, we show that novel genes are relevant for understanding microbial response to global change. Our study indicates that multiple factors impose selective pressures on soil prokaryotes and viruses not observed at the individual factor level, and emphasizes the need of studying the effect of concurrent global change treatments.

Data from six Phanerozoic periods suggest a ~ 4‰ rise in the δ18Oseawater since the Carboniferous. 
 The oxygen isotope composition of seawater (δ18Oseawater) is shaped by high- and low-temperature rock-water interactions, reflecting Earth system’s dynamics and evolution. The history of δ18Oseawater remains debated due partly to post-depositional imprints to all current mineral proxies. The oxygen atoms in sulfate minerals are among the most inaccessible to later exchange but often not in isotope equilibrium with ambient water. However, the δ18Osulfate may reach a plateau or approach equilibrium with the δ18Oseawater as the corresponding δ34Ssulfate increases during microbial sulfate reduction. Here we show 289 paired δ18O-δ34S values for sedimentary barite spanning six periods of the Phanerozoic Eon. The δ18O-δ34S trajectories point to variable equilibrium δ18Obarite values for different periods.

Here, the authors apply high-throughput screening to identify selective covalent inhibitors that target serine hydrolases in Staphylococcus aureus 
 Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteria-associated mortality worldwide. New tools are needed to both image and treat this pathogen. We previously identified a group of S. aureus serine hydrolases (Fphs), which regulate aspects of virulence and lipid metabolism. However, due to high structural and functional similarities, it remains challenging to distinguish the specific roles of members of this family. Here, we apply a high-throughput screening approach using a library of covalent electrophiles to identify inhibitors for FphB, FphE, and FphH. We identify selective covalent inhibitors for each target without the need for extensive medicinal chemistry optimization. Structural and biochemical analysis identify novel binding modes for several of the inhibitors. Functional studies using the inhibitors suggest that all three hydrolases likely play distinct functional roles in biofilm formation and virulence. This approach has the potential to be applied to target hydrolases in other diverse pathogens or higher eukaryotes. Covalent inhibitors that selectively target bacterial enzymes are potential antibiotic drug candidates.

 Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs) are key drivers of precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), triggering heavy precipitation both locally and in downstream regions. This work reveals that an early burst of TPVs significantly enhances the extreme precipitation over the TP in early spring. Variation in burst date of TPVs during 1979–2023 is investigated, and the underlying mechanism is explored. It is reported that the burst date of TPVs tends to be much earlier, gradually shifting from April to March. Rapid sea ice cover decline in the northern North Atlantic, under the sea surface warming context, intensifies the subsequent upward surface heat flux in the sea near Scandinavia. This process promotes the negative phase of Scandinavia teleconnection pattern (STP) in March, which benefits the genesis of TPVs by strengthening the cyclonic convergence and ascending motion over the TP."

 Ice loss from Antarctica’s vast freshwater reservoir could threaten coastal communities and the global economy if the ice volume decreases by just a few percent. Observed changes in mass balance are limited to  ~40 years, and are difficult to interpret in the context of an ice sheet with response time scales reaching centuries to millennia. To gain a much longer-term perspective, here we combine transient and equilibrium Parallel Ice Sheet Model simulations of Antarctic Ice Sheet response to glacial-interglacial warming and cooling cycles over the last 800,000 years. We find hysteresis that is caused by the long response time and by crossing of tipping points. Notably, West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse contributes over 4 m sea-level rise in equilibrium ice sheet states with little (0.25 °C) or even no ocean warming above present. Therefore, today we are likely already at (or almost at) an overshoot scenario, supporting recent studies warning of substantial irreversible ice loss with little or no further climate warming.

 Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux, or soil respiration, is a critical control on net ecosystem carbon (C) balance. Using long-term (2002-2020) measurements at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, U.S.), we show that soil respiration rates have notably increased since ~2015. In 2020, cumulative summer respiration flux was approximately 90% higher than the average summer flux over the 2002–2015 period. The increase in soil respiration cannot be explained directly by temperature or pH change alone. We also found that heterotrophic microbial C mineralization and microbial biomass C have also increased rapidly since ~2015, pointing towards an increase in the bioavailability of organic C substrates. We suggest that these observations are consistent with a hypothetical increase in plant allocation of C belowground in response to changing climatic and soil conditions. Quantification of interactions among co-occurring global change factors (e.g., warming temperatures, increasing atmospheric CO2, and nutrient limitation) is needed to predict how the soil C reservoir will continue to respond to global environmental changes.

 Spatial and temporal data gaps present a significant challenge to high-frequency surface water mapping using satellite imagery. Utilizing observations from temporally close periods and multi-modal sensors for gap-filling is of critical importance. However, discontinuous pixel values inherent to conventional water maps hinder the application of deep learning methods, which are effective and popular for relevant studies. In this study, a novel approach, termed “gap-filling of surface water probability”, is introduced to achieve seamless surface water mapping. A new fused dataset tailored for this purpose was constructed, consisting of paired synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and surface water probability data with a 10-meter spatial resolution at a 10-day interval. A Generative CNN-Transformer (GCT) for Gap-Filling (GF) of surface water probability, GCT-GF, was then proposed to integrate the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to reconstruct gapless water probability images from multi-modal and multi-temporal data. The GCT-GF employs a coarse-to-fine structure: information from different time points is initially aggregated using a branched gated inpainting module, followed by refinement and alignment of the coarse output under target SAR guidance. For adversarial learning, a branched SN-PatchGAN discriminator is introduced to adapt to the multi-temporal input. The results show that the GCT-GF surpasses the state-of-the-art relevant methods in quantitative metrics and visual perception. The fusion of multi-modal, multi-temporal inputs obvious enhance the gap-filling performance across varying gap ratios. Applied to Baiyangdian, Poyang Lake Basin and Qinghai Lake, GCT-GF demonstrates its high reliability on large scale scenes."

 The increasing complexity and scale of remote sensing datasets, coupled with the challenges of accurately estimating algorithmic time efficiency, often lead to significant resource waste or even failure when using machine learning algorithms in urgent or resource-constrained scenarios. Accurate time efficiency estimation is critical for deploying effective algorithms, yet it remains challenging due to the many factors influencing computational performance. Traditional methods of evaluating time efficiency often neglect the effects of core model parameters and complex data scales in spectral and temporal dimensions. In addition, inference time, an essential factor in real-world applications, is often overlooked. To address these limitations, we propose the Time Efficiency Assessment Framework (TEAF), a novel method for evaluating the time efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Through mathematical reasoning, TEAF models the training and inference time as functions (ψ) of complex data scales and core model parameters. The strong linear correlation between ψ and the actual runtime allows TEAF to accurately predict the time and cost of machine learning tasks with a low computational overhead before algorithm execution. To validate this framework, we derived TEAF formulations for five classical machine learning algorithms and tested them on state-of-the-art hyperspectral image datasets and Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets. The results demonstrated that TEAF could accurately predict both training and inference time for various algorithms, with a strong linear correlation between ψ and actual runtime (R2>0.942).

Remote sensing, essential for monitoring rubber expansion and supporting initiatives like REDD+ and EU deforestation regulations. However, due to the heterogeneity, dynamism, and complexity of rubber plantations, developing universal mapping algorithms remains challenging, and there is a lack of all-around reviews on remote sensing research specific to rubber plantations. Our meta-review systematically analyzes 305 peer-reviewed papers (2000–2024), synthesizing advancements in remote sensing techniques. The findings show that research is primarily focused on SEA (82 %), while regions like Africa and South America are underexplored. Optical data remains dominant (68 %), but the use of SAR has tripled, achieving up to 89 % accuracy when combined with phenological features. Additionally, deep learning improved classification accuracy by 15–20 %, especially in detecting young plantations under six years old.

The analysis shown that during the currents' attenuation stage, the temporal evolutions of the intensities of ionic and neutral atomic lines exhibited a close alignment with those of the breakdown and corona currents, respectively. The peak value of the total intensity of ionic lines were significantly larger than and ahead of that of the corresponding total intensity of neutral atomic lines. In the initial stage of the return stroke, the total intensity of ionic lines exhibits a rapid decay along the channel, approximating an exponential decay. Following the peak of the return stroke current, the total intensity of ionic lines along the channel decays slower, transitioning to a linear decay or remaining constant, and in some cases, even increasing along the channel. The total intensity of ionic lines can increase along the channel, which differs from previously reported results of the total intensity of ionic lines decaying or remaining constant along the channel. The total intensity of neutral atomic lines decays linearly with channel height in the initial phase of the return stroke, then also can increase along the channel. There is a stronger continuous radiation at the upper of the channel in the later stage of the return stroke.

This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla occupying diverse habitats, indicating that PQQ is an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies."

Growing evidence implicates a set of regions in the human parietal and frontal lobes [also known as the “physics network” (PN)] in such intuitive physical inferences. However, the central tenet of this hypothesis, that PN runs forward simulations to predict future states, remains untested. In this preregistered study, we first show that PN abstractly represents whether two objects are in contact with each other, a physical scene property critical for prediction (because objects’ fates are intertwined when they are in contact). We then show that PN (but not other visual areas) carries abstract information about predicted future contact events (i.e., collisions). These findings support the hypothesis that PN contains a generative model of the physical world that conducts forward simulations, serving as the brain’s “physics engine.”"

Acetylcholine release is controlled by distinct BFCN subtypes, modulated by excitatory and inhibitory inputs. However, the organization of the whole-brain input-output networks of these subtypes remains unclear. Here, we identified two distinct BFCN subtypes—BFCN→ACAand BFCN→BLA—innervating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) and BLA, each with unique distributions, electrophysiological properties, and projection patterns. Combining rabies-virus–assisted mapping and triple-plex RNAscope hybridization, we characterized their whole-brain input networks, identifying unique excitatory and shared inhibitory inputs for these subtypes. Moreover, our results reveal a long-range reciprocal input-output loop: BFCN→ACAneurons target the isocortex, their shared excitatory-input source, whereas BFCN→BLAneurons target shared inhibitory-input sources such as the striatum and pallidum, thus enabling dynamic interactions among these BFCN subtypes.

Using a community-based cohort of older adults, the current study characterized the neurocognitive (cognitive functioning, brain volumes, Alzheimer’s disease positron emission tomography, and plasma biomarkers) and plasma proteomic (7268 proteins) profiles of four common coronavirus and six herpesvirus antibody titers. Genetic inference techniques demonstrated the associations between viral antibody titers and neurocognitive outcomes may be attributed to altered expression in a subset of mechanistically relevant proteins in plasma. One of these proteins, IGDCC4 (immunoglobulin superfamily deleted in colorectal cancer subclass member 4), was related to 20-year dementia risk, cognitive functioning, and amyloid-β positivity using data from two independent cohorts, while its plasma and intrathecal abundance were causally implicated in dementia risk and clinically relevant brain atrophy.

Decades of evidence from surgical and endoscopic procedures bypassing the duodenum underscore the duodenum’s critical role in regulating glycemia and body weight. Although metabolic surgeries and endoscopic procedures are effective, their invasiveness, cost, and scalability limit patient access. We developed an orally administered mucin complexing polymeric (MCP) drug, designed to replicate duodenal exclusion physiology. MCPs, intended to have electrostatic and covalent cross-linkages with mucin glycoproteins, form extended network structures with resulting alteration of mucus barrier properties. Selective targeting of the duodenum is achieved via pH-based activation chemistry. Following screening for physiochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy, GLY-200 emerged as the lead drug candidate replicating duodenal exclusion physiology with improved glycemia, reduced body weight, and modulation of gut hormones in rodent models.

Clr4 is the sole known methyltransferase catalyzing H3K9 methylation inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Clr4 K455/K472 automethylation and H3K14 ubiquitination (H3K14Ub) are vital activators of Clr4, ensuring appropriate heterochromatin deposition and preventing deleterious silencing. While automethylation’s activation mechanism is uncovered, the mechanism of H3K14Ub’s significantly stronger stimulation on Clr4 remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Clr4 bound to ubiquitinated and unmodified H3 peptides at 2.60 and 2.39 angstrom, which revealed a synergistic mechanism underlying the pronounced stimulatory effect: H3K14Ub increases substrate affinity through multivalent interactions and facilitates the allosteric transition of Clr4 from an inactive apo conformation to a hyperactive “catalyzing state,” including conformational changes in the αC-SET-insertion region, autoregulatory loop, and the β9/10 loop.

Based on hierarchical large-ensemble climate model simulations, ~32 ± 28% of the surface air temperature (SAT) asymmetric trend and 16 ± 13% of the snow cover asymmetric trend between Eurasia and North America are attributable to tropical Pacific variability. Single-forcing experiments reveal that anthropogenic aerosols can induce a comparable asymmetry, accounting for 34 ± 23% (24 ± 17%) of observed SAT (snow cover) asymmetric trends.

Here, we theoretically and experimentally discover a 3D photonic AF TI protected by the combined symmetry of time reversal and half-lattice translation. By measuring both bulk and surface states, we directly observe the symmetry-protected single-Dirac-cone surface states and their remarkable robustness against random magnetic disorders.

High-pressure structural characterizations confirm the existence of stacking-dependent anisotropic compression in Au8-C and Au8-P. Under high pressure, the columnar-stacked Au8-C shrinks faster along theaaxis, increasing the aspect ratio (AR) of the fusiform Au8core. However, the layered Au8-P is compressed faster along thecaxis, reducing the AR and leading to a flatter Au8core.

However, the stereoselective conversion of planar indole rings into three-dimensional indoline skeletons bearing multiple stereogenic centers remains a persistent challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe an intermolecular catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of simple indoles via a palladium-catalyzed three-component cross-coupling reaction. By using readily accessible diazonium salts and aromatic boronic acids as arylative reagents under a ligand-swap strategy, this method enables the efficient construction of 2,3-diarylated indolines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral BiOx ligand governs the highly stereoselective migratory insertion of the aryl-palladium intermediate into the indole’s C═C double bond with complete diastereo- and regioselectivity, whereas the achiral fumarate ligand facilitates the reductive elimination step, as corroborated by density functional theory calculations.

Paint was chosen as a permeable and reactive material, which is the most common indoor surface. It was found that paint aged indoors had lower OVOC yields than glass when exposed to O3, probably because O3 reacts with paint materials rather than with deposited organics. Many OVOCs were measured, including common skin oil ozonolysis products such as acetone, 6-MHO, and 4-OPA; however, the OVOCs with the highest yields from the apartment samples were nonanal and hexanal, with the OVOC levels highly correlated with the amount of cooking that occurred.

Herein, a charge-enhanced electrically responsive membrane with a tunable pore size is prepared to investigate the impact of the Donnan effect on ion transport in negative nanochannels of varying sizes. Both the Donnan effect and pore size changes influence ion transport within nanochannels, with an enhanced Donnan effect promoting cation transport while slowing anion permeation. The combined effect of the electrostatic interaction and steric sieving expands the membrane rejection adjustment range from 9.6% to 27.6%, as the applied voltage simultaneously decreases pore size and increases Donnan exclusion. The reduction in pore size enhances the ability of the per unit of Donnan potential to regulate ion transport, and electrostatic exclusion is more pronounced in smaller nanochannels. The same conclusion is confirmed in commercial nanofiltration membranes of varying sizes (NF270 and NF800), but as the nanochannel size decreases further (NF90), the effect of electrostatic interaction on ion transport becomes minimal. Since the nanochannels are too narrow to permit ion transport, size sieving becomes the dominant mechanism for selective separation.

SbNF integrates biological detoxification and nutrient accumulation, enabling plant colonization and ecological restoration of degraded habitats. Multi-omic analyses reveal that Sb content strongly shapes the composition of Sb-oxidizing and N-fixing bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Abundant marker genes for carbon fixation (cbbL), Sb(III) oxidase (aioAB/anoA), and nitrogenase (nifH) were consistently detected in SbNF metagenome-assembled genomes. Positive correlations between gene abundances associated with autotrophic potential (aioA-cbbL) and coupling potential (aioA-nifH) were observed in the rhizoplane but not in the endosphere. In addition to genetic potentials, high-throughput cultivation of native SbNF-isolates (e.g., Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas) confirmed their rapid Sb(III) oxidation coupling autotrophic growth and nitrogen fixation. Isolates also exhibited plant growth-promoting traits, including indole-3-acetic acid production, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore secretion, providing multiple benefits to host plants. Co-cultivation of these isolates revealed minimal antagonism, suggesting the potential for designing synthetic microbial communities for sustainable phytoremediation.

This study characterizes the full distribution of river widths across all stream orders in the Mississippi River Basin using multi‐source remote sensing, field surveying, and a nested sampling approach. River widths within each stream order consistently follow a log‐normal distribution. When integrated with basin‐wide river network lengths, these width distributions combine to form an emergent Pareto distribution. Using this newfound width scaling framework for the Mississippi Basin, we estimate a sum river surface area of 17,828 ± 2,563 km2, an area broadly consistent with previous evaluations. This study's refined characterization of river widths across scales has wide‐ranging applications including a more accurate accounting of river and stream surface area with implications for global river‐atmosphere biogeochemical exchange assessments."

 Cotranscriptional RNA folding pathways typically involve the sequential formation of folding intermediates. Existing methods for cotranscriptional RNA structure probing map the structure of nascent RNA in the context of a terminally arrested transcription elongation complex. Consequently, the rearrangement of RNA structures as nucleotides are added to the transcript can be inferred but is not assessed directly. Here, we describe linked-multipoint Transcription Elongation Complex RNA structure probing (TECprobe-LM), which assesses the cotranscriptional rearrangement of RNA structures by sequentially positioning E. coli RNAP at two or more points within a DNA template so that nascent RNA can be chemically probed. We validate TECprobe-LM by measuring known folding events that occur within the E. coli signal recognition particle RNA, Clostridium beijerinckii pfl ZTP riboswitch, and Bacillus cereus crcB fluoride riboswitch folding pathways.

 With the increasing challenges posed by global warming and climate change, heat stress has become a significant threat to the sustainable production of grapevines. However, the genetic basis of grapevine thermotolerance remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide association study with transcriptomic profiling to identify TTC4 (thermotolerance on chromosome 4), a gene encoding a WRKY transcription factor, as a key determinant of thermotolerance in grapevine. TTC4 directly activates two thermotolerance-related genes, HSP18.1 and APX3. We also identify a heat-suppressed repressor SPL13 (SQUAMOSA-promoter binding protein-like 13) that cannot bind to the GTAT element (TTC4T(7631)) in intron 2 of TTC4, but can bind to the natural variant, GTAC (TTC4C(7631)). Grapevine accessions with TTC4C/C(7631) genotype exhibit significantly lower thermotolerance compared to those with the TTC4T/T(7631) and TTC4C/T(7631) genotypes. This fine-tuned regulation contributes to thermotolerance divergence among grapevine populations.

The authors show that TTYH1 mediates the endolysosomal processing of neuron-derived sphingolipids which controls autophagic flux and lipid droplet homeostasis. 
 Dynamic regulation of metabolic activities in astrocytes is critical to meeting the demands of other brain cells. During neuronal stress, lipids are transferred from neurons to astrocytes, where they are stored in lipid droplets (LDs). However, it is not clear whether and how neuron-derived lipids trigger metabolic adaptation in astrocytes. Here, we uncover an endolysosomal function that mediates neuron-astrocyte transcellular lipid signaling. We identify Tweety homolog 1 (TTYH1) as an astrocyte-enriched endolysosomal protein that facilitates autophagic flux and LD degradation. Astrocyte-specific deletion of mouse Ttyh1 and loss of its Drosophila ortholog lead to brain accumulation of neutral lipids. Computational and experimental evidence suggests that TTYH1 mediates endolysosomal clearance of ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), a sphingolipid that dampens autophagic flux and LD breakdown in mouse and human astrocytes. Furthermore, neuronal C1P secretion induced by inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β causes TTYH1-dependent autophagic flux and LD adaptations in astrocytes. These findings reveal a neuron-initiated signaling paradigm that culminates in the regulation of catabolic activities in astrocytes.

 Enhancing the durability of electrodes under high-power conditions is crucial for advancing high-power secondary batteries. Despite numerous optimization strategies proposed to mitigate electrode structural degradation, the performance of common electrodes inevitably deteriorates under high currents over extended cycling life. In this study, we report a capacity refreshing strategy for a porous organic framework electrode operating under high power conditions. By intermittently applying low currents, deactivated ions trapped within the framework can be effectively released, thus refreshing the electrode’s capacity. Importantly, this capacity refreshing can be periodically repeated. The framework electrode thus achieves an extended cycle life of over 60,000 cycles at 20 C (6 A/g) with a specific power of 28 kW/kg (based on active material). This strategy represents an alternative concept for designing organic electrodes that combine high power and long cycle life.

 The high occurrence of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHWs), driven by global climate change, poses a serious threat to humanity. However, their impacts on rural and urban populations remain unclear. This study analyzed CDHWs exposure in both rural and urban populations and found that the number of people chronically exposed to CDHWs has shown a clear upward trend over time. From 1901 to 2021, rural populations experienced 2.5 times the total exposure to CDHWs compared to urban populations. Over the past three decades, however, urban populations have experienced significantly higher exposure and a faster rate of increase than rural populations. Regionally, rural populations in Asia, North America, and Africa accounted for 41.06, 16.51, and 13.69% of the total global rural population exposure, respectively, while urban populations in Asia, North America, and Europe accounted for 32.31, 18.70, and 16.85% of global urban exposure, respectively.

 Observations show an Atlantification of the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, with deeper penetration, shoaling, and ventilation of Atlantic waters in the eastern Arctic and an associated weakening of the cold halocline layer. These processes have a profound impact on the sea ice cover above and potentially on the transition of the Arctic to a seasonal ice cover. Here we show, using a coupled ice-ocean model, that a proper simulation of the landfast ice cover in the relatively small but deeper peripheral Kara Sea has a disproportionately large influence on the halocline stability in the Eurasian Basin and beyond. Specifically, landfast ice in the Kara Sea reduces ice growth and therefore salt rejection into the surface ocean. This negative salinity anomaly is advected eastward with a coastal current along the continental shelf in the Makarov Basin and then out of the Arctic through Fram Strait by the Transpolar Drift Stream on timescales of less than ten years. Global Climate Models, however, do not yet include landfast ice parameterizations. Therefore, they are missing this key process affecting the halocline stability, Atlantification of the Makarov Basin, and potentially the timing of a seasonally ice-free Arctic.

 Mangrove forests’ restoration has gained traction as a sustainable solution to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and to provide ecosystem services, such as coastal protection. Restoration projects are often informed by expert judgment rather than a quantitative understanding and have a high failure rate. Monitoring mangrove restoration performance may take decades and has a strong case study dependency. To optimise restoration strategies, we developed an individual-based mangrove and process-based hydro-morphodynamic model to simulate multi-species mangrove forest trajectories, including the physical environment’s feedback. We find a significant impact of planting zonation on the mudflat behaviour, with seaward erosion and in-forest-landward deposition. Planting mangroves close to mean sea level decreases carbon storage potential due to increased mudflat erosion. Configuring planting in multiple patches proves beneficial to mangrove biomass development, expansion, and sediment accumulation. Combined with sound monitoring, the developed tool can potentially optimize planned mangrove restoration strategies.

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimetry has been widely used for monitoring river water levels, especially over large and medium-sized rivers. However, challenges still remain in obtaining continuous and high-precision water levels over small rivers due to the altimeter's sparse along-track sampling, distorted waveforms, and river slopes. This study presents a new multi-parameter optimized sub-waveform (MulPOS) retracker, which retracks the waveforms across all cycles through a quantitatively considered integration of the spatial consistency and temporal continuity of water levels, river slopes, and the strong reflectivity of the river surface. Firstly, along-track sampling is increased by searching for off-nadir observations within half the sampling resolution from nadir water bodies to retrieve continuous river water levels. Secondly, waveform preprocessing, including interpolation and filtering is used to determine more accurate retracking points, and then all possible sub-waveform sets that correspond to river reflections are formed. The most likely sub-waveform sets are determined by their four-parameter weighting function, which considers spatial consistency, temporal continuity of water level variations, and the high reflectivity of the river water surface. Finally, slope corrections are computed using the robust Helmert variance component estimation method by combining the differences between water levels in adjacent cycles and along the track. The MulPOS has been applied to 290 virtual stations formed by Sentinel-3A/3B and Sentinel-6 MF over rivers in the United States (52 % of which are narrower than 100 m). For comparison purposes, six other retrackers have been used, including OCOG, ICE1, threshold, NPPTR, SAMOSA+, and MWaPP+. The results have been validated against the in-situ measurements from the United States Geological Survey, indicating that the water levels derived by MulPOS are superior to other retrackers with a median RMSE of 17.9 cm, a median relative RMSE of 7.2 %, a median correlation coefficient of 0.96, and an abnormal water level occurrence rate of 0.60 %, whereas the corresponding metrics for other retrackers are >24.2 cm, >9.8 %, <0.94, and > 2.36 %. Moreover, MulPOS achieves steady and high-precision water levels across most small rivers under varying river widths (e.g., RMSE for MulPOS is 20.9 cm vs. >29.5 cm for other retrackers over rivers narrower than 50 m), varying angles between satellite ground tracks and rivers, and complex river morphologies. MulPOS is expected to generate a dataset with continuous, high-precision water level data for more small and medium-sized rivers, and this will expand the application of altimetry to inland water monitoring."

 Vicarious calibration/validation (Cal/Val) is essential for ensuring the radiometric accuracy of spaceborne thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. Anticipating an increase in the number of TIR sensors in the near future, this study developed an automated vicarious radiometric validation method based on in situ water temperature measurements from 14 sites in lakes and bays across Japan, which are not specifically dedicated to Cal/Val of satellite sensors. In addition, we applied a contextual image classification model based on the Swin Transformer architecture to create a fully automated filtering procedure to remove cloudy data. The proposed methods were developed and evaluated using the data acquired by well-calibrated satellite sensors, namely Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Thermal Infrared Radiometer (ASTER TIR), Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), and Landsat 9 TIRS-2, as reference targets. To develop a contextual image classification model, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Swin Transformer model with our own training data comprising 921,967 chip images created from ASTER TIR band 13 and Landsat 8 TIRS band 10 images selected from global regions. The developed image classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 96.20 %. However, when applied only to the study areas, the accuracy decreased to 94.85 %, because all the target sites were exclusively located in lakes and bays. The classification model was localized to our study areas by adjusting the probability threshold. Combining contextual image classification with quantitative thresholds, the model successfully classified 90 % of the cloud-free daytime ASTER data and Landsat 8 data. The accuracy for cloud-free classification was 81 % and 86 % for nighttime ASTER data and Landsat 9 data, respectively. Consequently, 169, 58, 500, and 130 matchups were automatically identified for daytime ASTER, nighttime ASTER, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9, respectively. The in situ water temperature for each matchup was converted to top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature (TOA BT) through radiative transfer calculations. In situ-based and satellite-based TOA BT agreed very well within the residual bias error of less than ±0.4 K except for nighttime ASTER data that seemed to be affected by insufficient skin temperature correction. The correlation between in situ-based and satellite-based TOA BT was strong, with R2 values ranging from 0.97 to 0.99, for daytime and nighttime ASTER, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9. The statistically estimated offsets between the in situ-based and satellite-based TOA BT were nearly equivalent to previously reported Cal/Val result and within the acceptable range of the sensors’ requirements, indicating that our method and data are suitable for the radiometric validation of spaceborne TIR sensors."

 Building height serves as fundamental information for characterizing urban landscapes and morphology, as influencing various aspects of the urban environment. While traditional methods of obtaining building height are often limited by spatial coverage and proprietary constraints, remote sensing data provides an alternative for indirect estimation. Several height products developed across different spatial scales, yet challenges remain due to the spatial and temporal incompleteness of publicly available building height samples, which introduce inherent uncertainties in global height mapping. This study proposed an improved approach for building height sampling that combines the ALOS AW3D30 and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data. Both datasets are open-access, providing a more comprehensive and representative sample base for model construction. To address temporal discrepancies between these two data, continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm was employed to remove invalid height samples. Subsequently, we trained random forest (RF) models using a combination of multi-source remote sensing data, including radar data, optical data, nighttime light data, terrain data, and footprint data, to generate a global urban building height map for the year of 2020. Reference samples from Europe, the United States, and China were employed to validate the model, indicating a high degree of consistency between the references and estimated results (R2 = 0.55–0.75, RMSE = 4.71–10.07 m).

Validation statistics at 18,876 sample locations demonstrated strong performance for both CC (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.13) and WV (OA = 0.94, Kappa = 0.87) when using both S1 and S2 variables for prediction. The small improvement in statistical performance provided by SAR variables (typically 1–2 % for CC and WV) understated the benefits of S1 for discriminating woody vegetation and quantifying canopy cover in non-woody ecosystems (e.g., alpine vegetation, heathlands, wetlands, coastal scrub), demonstrating the complementary benefits of multi-sensor prediction. The emergence and growth of natural capital accounting and frameworks such as the Nature Positive Initiative, mean that high-quality, cost-effective spatial datasets will continue to be in demand. Our study demonstrates the potential of non-commercial, publicly accessible remote sensing imagery to improve fine-scale analyses that may otherwise be cost-prohibitive to apply at scale."

Here, we report that cellular uptake of sorbate, a common food preservative, induces lysine sorbylation (Ksor) in mammalian cells and tissue mediated by the noncanonical activities of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1-3). We demonstrated that HDAC1-3 catalyze sorbylation upon sorbate uptake and desorbylation in the absence of sorbate both in vitro and in cells. Sorbate uptake in mice livers significantly induced histone Ksor, correlating with decreased expressions of inflammation-response genes. Accordingly, sorbate treatment in macrophage RAW264.7 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation dose-dependently down-regulated proinflammatory gene expressions and nitric oxide production. Proteomic profiling identified RelA, a component of the NF-κB complex, and its interacting proteins as bona fide Ksor targets and sorbate treatment significantly decreased NF-κB transcriptional activities in response to LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells.

Developed using a new methodology to match lightning to wildfires in the boreal region, it includes 6902 fires – 4201 in Eurasia and 2701 in North America. BoLtFire provides new opportunities to model the ignition and spread dynamics of boreal wildfires and offers deeper insights into lightning-driven fire activity globally. 
 The frequency and severity of fire weather have been projected to increase under climate change, particularly in high-latitude boreal forests. Lightning, a key ignition source globally, is also expected to become more frequent with climate change and could significantly increase burn area. Current research on lightning-ignited wildfire (LIWs) has a long history in boreal ecosystems but has typically focused on North America due to better data availability, while the lack of publicly available data for Eurasia has hindered our comprehensive understanding of important characteristics of LIWs, such as holdover time, lightning ignition efficiency, frequency, and spatial distribution in boreal forests. This study introduces the temporal minimum distance (TMin) method, a novel approach to matching lightning strikes with wildfires without requiring ignition location that outperformed current methodologies. As a result, we developed a comprehensive dataset of lightning-ignited wildfires across the entire boreal forest from 2012 to 2022, encompassing 6902 fires, 4201 in Eurasia and 2701 in North America, each over 200 ha in size.

There is no evidence in the ensemble of an internally‐generated and time‐persistent signal for Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), the dominant mode on those timescales. The spatial patterns of low‐frequency variability indicate activity throughout the North Pacific, where signals persist to a greater extent after the forced signal is removed, in contrast with the NA where only the subpolar region associated with deep water formation is active.

Indeed, models with the smallest preexisting double‐ITCZ bias—aside from a few outliers—typically show the least enhancement of the double‐ITCZ feature under global warming. To investigate this further, we use CESM2 and conduct flux‐adjusted simulations that nearly eliminate the precipitation bias in preindustrial experiments, followed by CO2‐doubling simulations. Our bias‐reduced simulations show a much smaller reduction in the precipitation asymmetry index and only half the increase in rainfall in the southeastern Pacific compared to the original model.

For steady‐state mountain glaciers, it predicts a Gaussian surface‐elevation distribution, which matches 1‐d simulation results.

 This study investigates the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) heat budget over the urban and rural areas in Beijing during a heat wave (HW) event in Jun 2020, using potential temperature tendency outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Validations against observational and reanalysis data show that the WRF model effectively captured the HW event and the urban heat island (UHI) effect, and well simulated variations in ABL temperatures and winds. It is found that the turbulent diffusion primarily contributes to the daytime ABL warming, while the larger-scale advection dominates in the nighttime ABL cooling. Both the daytime turbulent diffusion and the nighttime large-scale advection are generally stronger in the urban region than in the rural region. Besides, the radiation effect also plays a significant role in the daytime ABL warming especially in the rural area. Under HW conditions, the daytime warming effect of turbulent diffusion is notably amplified, while at night, the large-scale advection cooling is substantially weakened, and the turbulent diffusion intensifies to become the dominant term, particularly in the rural area. Surface sensible heat flux responds differently to the HW event compared to the turbulent diffusion term, as the latter also includes other turbulent processes like entrainment and latent heat flux. The large-scale advection term closely matches the horizontal temperature advection, indicating that the large-scale subsidence could be negligible in the ABL heat budget compared to horizontal advection over complex urban-rural terrain."

 Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs) provide near real-time precipitation estimates on a global scale at finer spatial resolutions, facilitating data over remote and inaccessible regions. Despite the efficiency in data acquisition, the potential application of SPPs to weather monitoring, environmental surveillance, and disaster response is still challenging due to systematic and random errors. This paper proposed different bias correction techniques assimilating the inherent attributes of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching, wavelet decomposition, Copula and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Daily precipitation over 10 temporally coherent clusters in South Peninsular India (SPI), estimated by four multisatellite products such as CMORPH, IMERG-E, IMERG-L and IMERG-F were bias corrected with high-resolution reanalysis dataset known as IMDAA from 2001 to 2020. A statistical analysis of before-corrected SPPs displayed an overestimation of 200 % by IMERG products in most of the clusters and underestimation of around 50 % by CMORPH. Post bias-corrected SPPs portrayed a significant reduction in bias to an average of 5 % and root mean square error of 12 mm/day declined to 1.5 mm/day on average across clusters and methods. Furthermore, most of the methods have closely captured the distribution behaviour including wet and dry periods and extremes of the observations. The results also indicated that the performance of bias correction techniques vary depending on the elevation, terrain features and seasonal patterns within a cluster. This highlights the need to adopt cluster-specific bias correction approaches for local climatological and topographical conditions. Such tailored corrections can enhance the reliability of bias-adjusted data for hydrological applications in these regions."

We found that higher aerosol concentration reduces the likelihood and duration of fog but leads to denser fog. This overall trend was caused by multiple physical mechanisms depending on conditions. 
 One common process for marine fog formation is cloud base lowering (CBL), which is frequently observed, for example, off the coast of California and in Canada's Grand Banks, as well as other foggy ocean regions. While previous studies have extensively examined the meteorological controls on CBL fog, its microphysical characteristics have received comparatively less attention. We employ a single-column model to investigate the interplay among aerosols, microphysics, and CBL fog evolution under diverse meteorological conditions. We find that lower aerosol concentrations make fog formation more probable but that if fog does form, fog water concentrations are lower. Lower aerosol concentrations lead to earlier fog formation due to faster gravitational settling of larger droplets, which serves to flux moisture downward. Faster gravitational settling (among other mechanisms at low aerosol concentration) also suppresses entrainment at cloud top, which aids in keeping the liquid water path high. However, faster gravitational settling also limits the fog water concentration through faster liquid deposition to the surface.  It is these counteracting influences of gravitational settling that appear to cause both prolonged fog duration and suppressed fog water concentration. The relative strength of these counteracting influences depends on the environmental conditions."

 For decades, silver iodide (AgI) has been widely used for laboratory ice nucleation experiments and glaciogenic cloud-seeding operations due to its ability to nucleate ice at relatively warm temperatures (up to −3 °C). Despite being one of the most well-characterized ice-nucleating substances, gaps remain in the understanding of how its ice nucleation behavior in the laboratory translates to natural clouds. Here, we present, for the first time, measurements of the ice-nucleated fractions (INFs) of AgI-containing seeding particles, derived from in situ measurements of ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC) and seeding particle number concentrations during glaciogenic cloud-seeding experiments. The experiments were performed as part of the CLOUDLAB project, in which we used targeted cloud seeding with an uncrewed aerial vehicle to try to answer fundamental questions about ice-phase cloud microphysics. Data from 16 seeding experiments show strong linear correlations between ICNC and seeding particle concentration, indicating relatively constant INFs throughout each experiment. Median INFs (0.07 %–1.63 %) were found to weakly increase with decreasing cloud temperature at seeding height (range of −5.1 to −8.3 °C). We compare our results with previous key laboratory experiments and discuss the possible freezing mechanisms.

To fill gaps in sparse observations, we used an advanced ensemble of six machine learning models to reconstruct monthly oxygen maps from the surface down to 5902 m, covering 1960–2023. Our dataset reveals where and how fast oxygen loss is occurring, especially in deeper waters, and provides a reliable resource for studying climate impacts on oceans and guiding conservation efforts. 
 Oceanic oxygen levels, crucial for marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, have declined significantly over the past few decades, driven by climate change and posing severe environmental risks. However, historical dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements, especially below 2000 m, remain sparse, limiting comprehensive annual and seasonal analyses. Here we introduce the BEM-DOR framework, a Bayesian-optimized ensemble of six machine-learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Extremely Randomized Trees and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting) fused via dynamic weighting, to reconstruct global monthly DO distributions at 1°×1° resolution from the surface to 5902 m depth over 1960–2023. Validation against an independent dataset demonstrates that BEM-DOR outperforms existing products. Our dataset captures depth-dependent deoxygenation, with the most pronounced decline occurring between 150 and 200 m, and reveals dramatically accelerated oxygen loss in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic over the past decade. We quantify uncertainties from measurement errors, gridding processes, and model algorithms, providing the first long-term, high-resolution, uncertainty-quantified DO product from ocean surface to nearly 6000 m depth. The extension of DO data into the bathypelagic zone in this work is a significant contribution to deep ocean oxygen dynamics and global biogeochemical cycles."

The author relied on her 30 years of research experience in atmospheric numerical modelling. The presented model is the fruit of the author's research on physical processes at the surface–atmosphere interface and their numerical approximation and aims at improving numerical weather forecasting and climate simulations. 
 This work presents the land model Pochva. Pochva is a model of hydro-thermal processes at the Earth's surface and in the underlying medium. The model simulates the main hydro-thermal parameters of the surface, soil layer, vegetation, and snow cover. The soil process scheme accounts for diversity in the vertical profile of the soil physical parameters. The snow cover is processed in a multilayer scheme and its numerical algorithm allows solutions for both extremely thin and extremely thick layer cases. The model is characterized by a particular accuracy in simulating the water phase transitions in soil and snow and by the autonomy in the determination of the lower boundary condition in the soil column. The model can be used as a stand-alone land surface model driven by observed or analytical forcing data or coupled to an atmospheric model, which is either global or limited-area, in either the forecast regime or climatic regime. The results of coupling Pochva to the numerical weather prediction limited-area model Bolam are presented."

As we advance our understanding of natural systems, however, there is the need to develop yet more complex models and codes. In this work, we present a piece of software that facilitates this work, specifically with regard to reactive processes. Existing tried-and-true codes are made available via this new interface, freeing up resources to focus on the new aspects of the problems at hand. 
 Alquimia v1.0 is a generic interface to geochemical solvers that facilitates development of multiphysics simulators by enabling code coupling, prototyping and benchmarking. The interface enforces the function arguments and their types for setting up, solving, serving up output data and carrying out other common auxiliary tasks while providing a set of structures for data transfer between the multiphysics code driving the simulation and the geochemical solver. Alquimia relies on a single-cell approach that permits operator splitting coupling and parallel computation. We describe the implementation in Alquimia of two widely used open-source codes that perform geochemical calculations: PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow. We then exemplify its use for the implementation and simulation of reactive transport in porous media by two open-source flow and transport simulators: Amanzi and ParFlow. We also demonstrate its use for the simulation of coupled processes in novel multiphysics applications including the effect of multiphase flow on reaction rates at the pore scale with OpenFOAM, the role of complex biogeochemical processes in land surface models such as the E3SM Land Model (ELM) and the impact of surface–subsurface hydrological interactions on hydrogeochemical export from watersheds with the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS). These applications make it apparent that the availability of a well-defined yet flexible interface has the potential to improve the software development workflow, freeing up resources to focus on advances in process models and mechanistic understanding of coupled problems."

For instance, the European Commission is considering implementing the “essential-use” concept in the REACH Regulation to guide decision-making for phasing-out the use of the most harmful chemicals. By assessing 34 existing cases under the Stockholm Convention and 45 restrictions and 544 applications for authorization under the REACH regulation (as of November 2023), this study aims to capture how the essential-use concept may inform decision-making on exemptions and provide insights on its implementation.

Moreover, it is contributing to increased wildfires, which pose a distinct threat to cardiovascular and respiratory health, especially in the presence of other stressors. Living conditions can be a significant nonchemical stressor that alters physiology and impacts wildfire smoke responsiveness, especially when combined with ambient heat. To determine the combined impact of housing and temperature on behavioral health and the cardiopulmonary response to wildfire smoke (WS), female mice were split into enriched (EH) and depleted housing (DH) at normal (NT) and high temperatures (HT) for 20 weeks and assessed at baseline and after a single filtered air (FA) or WS exposure. Separate radiotelemetered mice were similarly housed for 4 weeks and then exposed to FA sham and then WS. EH mice had higher activity and body temperature and lower heart rate at NT, and these effects were blocked at HT. HT-DH mice had an increased heart rate variability following WS and increased arrhythmias. Interestingly, HT-EH caused increased anxiety-like behavior. Thus, although EH likely protects cardiopulmonary health, it might also negatively impact the behavior at HT in mice. As such, the living temperature and housing conditions should be carefully considered when assessing susceptibility to disease and environmental exposures."

Inhalation is a major exposure route, as evidenced by their detection in human lungs, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) among the most abundant particles in respiratory airways. However, the harmful effects of particle bioaccumulation remain unclear, as chronic effects are understudied. To assess long-term effects, specifically carcinogenic effects, BEAS-2B cells were exposed to PET-NPLs for 30 weeks. Genotoxicity, carcinogenic phenotypic hallmarks, and a panel of genes and pathways associated with cell transformation and lung cancer were examined and compared across three exposure durations. No significant effects were observed after 24 h or 15 weeks of exposure. However, a 30-week exposure led to increased genotoxic damage, anchorage-independent growth, and invasive potential. Transcriptomic analysis showed the upregulation of several oncogenes and lung cancer-associated genes at the end of the exposure. Further analysis revealed an increase in differentially expressed genes over time and a temporal gradient of lung cancer-related genes. Altogether, the data suggest PET-NPLs’ potential carcinogenicity after extended exposure, highlighting serious long-term health risks of MNPLs.

Operando spectroscopy and multiscale modeling uncover key synergistic effects that govern the system’s enhanced performance. Vacancy-mediated charge redistribution strengthens metal–support interactions and structural durability, while LDH-derived atomic hydrogen species exhibit prolonged lifetimes through CuSA coordination, which facilitates efficient hydrogenation of nitrogen intermediates.

However, the mechanisms driving antibiotics-induced nanoplastics aggregation under environmentally relevant conditions remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on the aggregation of four environmentally relevant nanoplastics (pristine and aged polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene). At pH 5.0, both CIP and SMX significantly promoted nanoplastics aggregation, with CIP being more potent. CIP enhanced nanoplastics aggregation through charge shielding driven by electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding (HB), and charge-assisted HB (CAHB), whereas SMX promoted aggregation solely through molecular bridging involving HB and CAHB. At pH 7.0, only CIP facilitated aggregation, while neither antibiotic induced aggregation at pH 9.0. Aged polystyrene aggregated more readily than pristine polystyrene due to increased surface functional groups. Polyethylene and polypropylene showed weaker aggregation due to fewer surface functional groups. High organic matter (OM) levels (1.65 mg/L TOC) inhibited antibiotics-induced aggregation, whereas low OM levels (16.5 μg/L TOC) were more conducive. These findings highlight that antibiotic characteristics, pH, OM levels, plastic types, and environmental aging collectively influence nanoplastics aggregation, and improve the understanding of the fate and risk of nanoplastics in natural waters."

Floating dust frequency (FDF), blowing dust frequency (BDF), dust storm frequency, and related meteorological data were analyzed to assess dust activity from 1960 to 2020. Dust events decreased significantly from 1960 to 2020, and the BDF had the greatest rate (−0.13 d y−1), while the FDF had the greatest mean frequency (4.349 d y−1). The frequency of dust events (FDE) was two orders of magnitude greater in the cold desert climate when compared with the other climate zones, although the annual wind speed was not always greater. The FDE in the nondry climate zones ranged from 0.005 d y−1 in the Aw (tropical savanna climate) to 12.34 d y−1 in the ET (polar tundra). As a nondry climate zone, the ET had more frequent dust activity than some of the other dry climate zones. Dust events were generally most active in March, April, and May. However, the most active month could occur as early as January (e.g., 1963) and as late as June (e.g., in 1967).

We use a comprehensive observational data set for a nearly two‐year long period to analyze the wind system and boundary layer evolution in this high‐altitude valley and determine the reason for this early wind reversal. Days with short UV wind predominantly occur during the warm season when the valley floor is free of snow and the convective boundary layer (CBL) grows well above the height of the surrounding ridges. UV wind persists throughout the day only on a few days during the warm season. We link differences in valley wind evolution to wind direction at upper levels at and above ridge height and propose forced channeling mechanisms to describe coupling between valley and upper‐level wind when the CBL grows above ridge height. The frequency distribution of upper‐level wind direction is such that channeling in the DV direction is favored, which explains the predominance of days with short UV wind. The deep CBL is supported by the presence of a deep weakly stably stratified residual layer with high aerosol content, which is regularly present over the mountain range during the warm season. On days when the CBL does not grow above ridge height, for example, when the valley floor is covered by snow, thermally driven UV wind is able to persist throughout the day independent of upper‐level wind direction."

Quantifying potential future hazards to dunes, which are influenced by both erosional wave‐driven and accretional wind‐driven processes, is complicated by an inability to forecast the exact sequencing and magnitude of future oceanographic and meteorological forcings. Here we use a stochastic weather emulator capable of generating time series of wind and wave properties to force a reduced complexity morphologic model to assess potential accretional and erosional dune volume changes over the next century. Stable beaches with low shoreline change rates are predicted to have net accretional dunes over the next century on average. Inclusion of background beach erosion rates and sea level changes instead drives more frequent net volumetric dune erosion. At decadal scales, volume changes of the dune are shown to be dominated by the magnitude of shoreline change rate in locations that are rapidly retreating. For stable and mildly eroding shorelines (<∼ $\ \sim $ −0.3 m/yr), both shoreline changes and changes in the still water level influence timescales of dune destruction. Sets of probabilistic simulations are used to show that gradual wind‐driven sediment gains can compensate for episodic wave‐driven losses over the long term. However, in the case of higher sea levels, more frequent dune collision results in less time for dune recovery in between major storms in which case tipping points in future dune states can occur."

The Three River Source Region (TRSR) is known as the “water tower of Asia” and is an important water source region for much of southeast Asia. Spatial and temporal distributions of water balance across the TRSR have been affected by recent changing climatic conditions. However, the status and variation of water balance under the influence of environmental factors remain unclear. We employed SOILWAT2, a daily time step ecosystem water model, along with 35 years of climate data from 29 meteorological stations to characterize the hydrological dynamics of the region. Our results revealed that 15 of the sites exhibited evidence of a net water source (precipitation > actual evapotranspiration) between 1981 and 2015. These stations were predominantly located at intermediate elevations (3,400–4,100 m) and low latitudes (<34°N), while stations at lower and higher elevations as well as higher latitudes were not sources because of moisture limitations by a dry climate. In contrast to a strong spatial pattern, we found no obvious temporal trend of the net water source. The interannual and seasonal variability of the net water source is dependent on the temporal fluctuations in potential evapotranspiration and precipitation. We therefore conclude that there is an elevation and latitude dominated spatial pattern of the water balance on the TRSR, with important implications for the availability of water resources."

 Flash droughts—characterized by their rapid onset—can cause devastating socioeconomic and agricultural damage. During such events, soil moisture depletion is driven not only by precipitation shortages but also by the elevated atmospheric moisture demand arising due to extreme heat. However, the role of extreme heat in shaping the evolution of flash droughts and their ecological impacts remains uncertain. Here we investigate the processes involved by analysing global reanalysis data from 1950 to 2022. We find that, when flash droughts are accompanied by extreme heat, they exhibit 6.7–90.8% higher severity and 8.3–114.3% longer recovery time than flash droughts without extreme heat. The presence of extreme heat during flash droughts accelerates soil moisture drawdown over high latitudes, where wet soils and enhanced radiation foster evapotranspiration. By contrast, it slows the absolute onset speed in subtropical transitional climate zones owing to evapotranspiration throttling. Our machine learning approach further reveals that hot flash droughts lead to sharper declines in ecosystem productivity, particularly in croplands, thereby threatening global food security. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced infrastructure and ecosystem resilience to hot flash droughts in a warming future.

 Metamorphic soles beneath ophiolites are thought to record subduction initiation. However, there is ambiguity about the tectonic and thermal mechanisms operative during subduction initiation, arising partly from uncertainty in the duration of sole metamorphism. Here we use chemical mapping and diffusion speedometry of garnet crystals from the metamorphic sole of the Samail Ophiolite (Oman and United Arab Emirates) to show that high-temperature (≥750 °C) metamorphism was rapid, lasting ≤1 Myr (potentially ≤100 kyr) at peak temperature conditions. The short durations are supported by zircon U–Pb ages and new garnet–whole-rock–zircon Lu–Hf data from the same rocks, contrasting with previous inferences for ≥8 Myr metamorphic durations. These observations are nominally consistent with the spontaneous sinking of a dense lower plate. However, the rapid metamorphic timescales cannot be accounted for solely by conductive thermal equilibration with juxtaposed oceanic mantle. One potential explanation is dissipative heating driven by relative motion across the nascent plate interface. This interpretation accounts for the timescales, the spatial pattern of metamorphism and the global similarities in sole pressure–temperature conditions independent of other geodynamic variables.

 TIM3, a T-cell inhibitory receptor, is expressed on exhausted T cells in the TME. Progressive loss of IL2-secretion is an early sign of diminished effector function in TILs, which raises the possibility of IL2 loss driving exhaustion of TILs. We show that endogenous IL-2 is required for the antitumor effect of anti-TIM3. Selective delivery of IL-2 to TIM3high TILs via an engineered anti-TIM3-Pro-IL2 fusion enhances anti-TIM3 efficacy, while reducing IL2 toxicity. IL2 activity is inhibited at the acidic pH of the TME, thus an IL2 mutein (IL2V2) with sustained activity at low pH is integrated into the construct. Mechanistically, TIM3-ProIL2V2 not only reactivates TIM3+ TILs but also facilitates the activation and expansion of TIM3- TILs, which in turn provide a sustained source of effector T cells. TIM3-ProIL2V2 is efficient in multiple tumor models, including tumors in humanized mice. TIM3-ProIL2V2 has the potential to overcome anti-PD-1/L1 resistance in cold cancers.

 Energy efficiency and quantum advantage are two important features of quantum devices. We here report an experimental realization that combines both features in a quantum engine coupled to a quantum battery that stores the produced work, using a single ion in a linear Paul trap. We begin by establishing the quantum nature of the device by observing nonclassical work oscillations with the number of cycles as verified by energy measurements of the battery. We moreover apply shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques to suppress quantum friction and improve work production. While the average energy cost of the shortcut protocol is only about 3%, the work output is enhanced by up to approximately 33%, making the machine significantly more energy efficient. We additionally show that the quantum engine consistently outperforms its classical counterpart in this regime.

 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an essential RNA modification that regulates gene expression and influences diverse cellular processes. Yet, fully characterizing its transcriptome-wide landscape and biogenesis mechanisms remains challenging. Traditional next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods rely on short-reads aggregation, overlooking the inherent heterogeneity of RNA transcripts. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) platforms offer direct RNA sequencing (DRS) at the resolution of individual RNA molecules, enabling simultaneous detection of RNA modifications and RNA processing events. In this study, we introduce SingleMod, a deep learning model tailored for precise detection of m6A modification on individual RNA molecules from DRS data. SingleMod innovatively employs a multiple instance regression (MIR) framework, leveraging extensive methylation-rate labels provided by the quantitative NGS-based method, and achieves ROC AUC and PR AUC of ~0.95 for single-molecule m6A prediction. Applying SingleMod to human cell lines, we systematically dissect the transcriptome-wide m6A landscape at single-molecule and single-base resolution, characterizing m6A heterogeneity in RNA molecules from the same transcript. Through comparative analyzes across eight diverse species, we quantitatively elucidate three distinct m6A distribution patterns correlated with phylogenetic relationships and suggest divergent regulatory mechanisms. This study provides a framework for understanding the shaping of epitranscriptome in a single-molecule perspective.

 Widespread expansion of agriculture and forestry has altered the surface of the Earth, the composition of the atmosphere, and as a result, the climate. Here we quantify the radiative forcing caused by the historical deforestation of an ecoregion in the U.S. Upper Midwest and the adoption of eight nature-based climate solutions. We combined regional forest inventory data with over three decades of remote sensing and in situ data from a replicated land use change experiment. Deforestation of the region caused net global warming (1626 ± 44 µW m-2), mainly from the 76 % reduction of ecosystem carbon stocks, but also from the 84 % reduction of the soil methane sink and the 115 % increase in soil nitrous oxide emissions. The associated albedo increase offset 24 % of this greenhouse gas induced warming. For the adoption of nature-based climate solutions, we found that conservation agriculture can provide -39 to -76 ± 31 µW m-2 of climate mitigation over a 100-year time period while short/medium length forestry rotations can provide more at -296 to -881 ± 44 µW m-2 and natural forest regeneration can provide the most at -1555 ± 44 µW m-2. As the impacts of climate change on nature and society intensify, consideration should be given to the climate mitigation, habitat, and ecosystem services that nature-based climate solutions can provide.

 Global surface air temperature change versus preindustrial level is a primary metric of global warming. Its 20-year mean serves as the indicator of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to monitor threshold crossings like of the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement. Here we introduce a new benchmark timeseries 1850–2024 and projection to 2034 for this key metric, which shows a clear exceedance of 1.5 °C in 2024 by the annual mean (1.62 [1.55–1.69] °C).

 Deforestation from artisanal, small-scale gold mining is transforming large regions of the tropics, from lush rainforest to barren collections of tailings and ponds. Natural forest regeneration is slow due to dramatic soil changes, and existing reforestation strategies are failing. Here we combine remote sensing, electrical resistivity imaging, and measurements of soil properties to characterize post-mining areas in the Madre de Dios region, Peru. We find that the post-mining landscape has dramatically changed water infiltration dynamics, driving decreases in subsurface water availability and presenting a major barrier to revegetation. Mining tailings are extremely hydraulically conductive, allowing for 14.76 m day−1 infiltration relative to 0.074 m day−1 in primary forest soils, leading to lower average soil moisture and extreme temperatures (60 °C). Electrical resistivity imaging reveals a highly resistive, 1.5–2 m deep layer of dry sand across the mining landscape. Areas close to the water table (e.g., pond edges) show higher soil moisture, lower temperatures, and greater natural regeneration compared to topographically elevated tailings. Our results suggest that access to water should be prioritized when targeting reforestation sites, potentially requiring large-scale geomorphological reconfiguration. As gold mining is expected to expand, responsible practices and remediation strategies must account for the critical yet often overlooked role of water.

 The July 2021 floods in Europe stand out as one of the most devastating flood-related disasters to impact the continent in recent years, affecting multiple countries at once. As climate change intensifies, such cross-border disasters are expected to become more frequent. Here we use unique cross-country survey data from flooded homeowners to understand the patterns and limits of how households in different nations respond to shared flood crises. We find evidence of financial, institutional, and psychological limits to household adaptation. Insurance compensation is associated with private adaptation actions shortly after flooding. Households that suffered flood damage are more likely to mitigate future risks to their homes. Yet, this intention encounters limits for extreme flood damage. Once experienced flood damages exceed a threshold of around 60% of the home reconstruction value, homeowners begin to view private adaptation efforts as less effective, prompting a shift toward relocating to safer areas. Homeowners are more likely to take flood adaptation measures after experiencing damage, mainly when supported by insurance, and this effect weakens with extreme damage, according to an analysis that uses survey data from 719 flooded homeowners in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany."

 Retreat of continental ice sheets exposes comminuted sediment in disequilibrium with non-glacial conditions. Weathering of this sediment may create climate feedbacks by altering exchange of greenhouse gases between atmosphere and landscapes. Here we show in a partially deglaciated watershed in southwest Greenland that glacial meltwater contains low concentrations of reactive dissolved organic carbon that enhances weathering of freshly comminuted sediment causing net sequestration of carbon dioxide. In contrast, soil water reactions enhance methanogenesis and carbon dioxide production and create greenhouse gas sources as organic carbon is remineralized. We suggest that a change from greenhouse gas sinks in glacial meltwater to greenhouse gas sources in soil water creates a switch from a negative to positive warming feedback during glacial-interglacial transitions, but a negative warming feedback may return with future anthropogenic warming, glacial retreat, and increased meltwater production. We anticipate changing weathering reactions following exposure also alter nutrient and radiogenic isotope exports.

This study examines the response of TC precipitation due to increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs) using convection-permitting model simulations. The sensitivity of key TC rainfall metrics, including the azimuthally averaged maximum precipitation rate were examined. The amount of scaling of precipitation with SST depends on the chosen TC precipitation metric and mostly surpasses the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relationship. The azimuthally averaged maximum precipitation rate (Pm) exceeds twice the rate expected under the CC relationship (2CC). By decomposing the scaling rates into thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using a physical diagnostic method, we demonstrate that dynamic changes primarily (about 73%) drive the scaling of Pm. The available moisture plays a much smaller role than expected and scales surprisingly at less than CC. The dynamic contribution is always large for all precipitation metrics. The combination of increased moisture and updrafts enhances moisture convergence, thereby intensifying precipitation and ultimately leading to a super-CC relationship. The ‘exceeding 2CC’ behavior is attributed to the dominance of dynamic effects, particularly enhanced upward motion near the TC inner core. Accurate projections of future changes in TC precipitation therefore depend critically on accurate projections of changes in TC dynamics."

Our findings reveal strong increases in hot–dry events across all individual breadbasket regions between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C of global warming, with ensemble mean probabilities indicating that occurrences more than double in South Asia and triple in East Asia. Moreover, the likelihood of multiple breadbasket regions experiencing extreme events simultaneously increases significantly between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C of warming. Scenarios that were historically considered virtually impossible and very unlikely under 1.5 ∘C, such as at least four regions being affected by hot–dry events in the same growing season, could occur with a 1-in-14 year likelihood under 2 ∘C of warming. We find that, among the breadbasket regions, Central Europe, East Asia, and Central North America most often experience these events simultaneously within the same growing season.

The contribution of internal variability is even larger for runoff than for precipitation or evapotranspiration over northern, western and central Europe. The inter-member differences in runoff changes are mainly explained by precipitation changes and indirectly by changes in sea level pressure. In potential disagreement with observational studies, no apparent teleconnection between runoff multi-decadal variability and the Atlantic multi-decadal variability is generally found in climate models. This misrepresentation of teleconnections might affect the multi-decadal variability of annual precipitation and therefore runoff over the Mediterranean.

The EUDR requires national-scale information on deforestation prevalence as one component of deforestation risk assessments, with additional traceability and risk assessment requirements at the parcel scale for exports to the EU to comply with the regulation. To better understand potential implications of this policy and evaluate relevant monitoring data, we estimate area converted from forest to agricultural land use in the United States (US) using three authoritative data sources from US Department of Agriculture statistical programs: the Nationwide Forest Inventory, National Resources Inventory, and Crop Sequence Boundaries Data. Results from all three datasets consistently indicate that agriculture-driven gross deforestation has been minimal over the past decade in the US, averaging 0.01%–0.04% of forested area annually. Most of this land-use change is occurring in the Southeastern US with conversion to pasture being the most common agricultural conversion subcategory. The rarity of agriculture-driven deforestation results in high levels of uncertainty in county-scale estimates due to the low sample size and potential misclassification errors in modeled data. Nevertheless, comparing results from these three complementary datasets can provide greater confidence in fine-scale spatial patterns of past deforestation. This analysis highlights several challenges associated with implementing and enforcing trade policy based on land use categories. Given the low rate of agriculture-driven deforestation and potential difficulties with identifying land-use change at small spatial scales, trade policies focused solely on land use categories may have a limited benefit in countries such as the US where agriculture is not a major driver of deforestation."

The study presents automatic shape recognition tools developed with machine learning techniques and adapted for this type of image. Applied on a recent field campaign, these tools produce morphology-specific size distributions that can be compared across four instruments covering different size ranges. The analysis show that the tools are performing well and are consistent across the different instruments. 
 This study addresses the challenges of ice particle morphology classification from images of optical array probes (OAPs) and proposes a more refined processing to enable better interpretation of observational data. The convolutional neural network methodology is applied to train classification tools for hydrometeor images from optical array probes. Two models were developed in a previous work for the Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP) and 2D Stereo (2D-S). In addition, three new models are introduced in this study: one for the Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP), one for the High Volume Particle Spectrometer (HVPS), and a global model trained on a data set that merges all available data from the above four instruments. The methodology of retrieving morphology-specific size distributions from OAP data is provided. Size distributions for each morphological class, obtained using both the specific and global classification models, are compared for the data set of the ICE-GENESIS (Creating the next generation of 3D simulation means for icing) project, where all four probes were operated simultaneously. The reliability and coherence of these newly obtained machine learning classification tools are clearly demonstrated. The analysis shows significant advantages of using the global model compared to the specific ones. The presented methodology retrieves morphology-specific crystal size distributions that effectively allow systematic identification of microphysical growth processes from OAP data sets mainly collected on research aircraft during measurement campaigns. By combining the quantitative reliability of OAP-derived total number and mass size distributions with advanced machine learning morphological individual crystal classification, this approach establishes a foundation for investigations on past OAP data sets to be reinterpreted."

This field campaign was unique because there was a wide-ranging suite of instruments capable of observing all phases of precipitation co-located with comparable measurements. The observations provide an opportunity to verify and understand complex winter precipitation events through satellite data, microphysical processes, and numerical model simulations. 
 Winter precipitation forecasts of phase and amount are challenging, especially in Northeast United States where mixed precipitation events from various synoptic systems frequently occur. Yet, there are not enough quality observations of winter precipitation, particularly microphysical properties from falling snow or mixed phase precipitation. During the winters of 2021–2022, 2022–2023, and 2023–2024, the NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Ground Validation (GV) program conducted a field campaign at the University of Connecticut (UConn). The goal of this campaign was to observe various phases of winter precipitation and winter storm types to validate the GPM satellite precipitation products. Over the three winters at UConn, a total of 40 instruments were deployed across two observing sites that captured 117 precipitation events, including 19 phase transition events as indicated by the PARSIVEL2. These instruments included scanning and vertically pointing radars, along with suites of in-situ sensors. In addition, an unmanned aircraft system has been deployed in 2023–2024. Here, an overview of the different field deployments, instrumentation, and the datasets collected are presented. To showcase the observations, this article features a wide-ranging set of measurements collected from the instrument suite for the 28 February 2023 storm, during which six to eight inches of snow accumulated at the two different observing sites. Also included is a discussion on how these observations can be combined with other datasets to validate ground-based and remote sensing measurements and highlight important atmospheric processes that impact winter precipitation phase and amount."

Gilbertson,A Liposomal Carrier to Reduce Leaching of Ionic Nutrient Loads in Agricultural Soils,"The use of inorganic nutrient fertilizers in crop agriculture is often inefficient due to rapid leaching of nutrients with percolating water in soil. To address this, a liposomal carrier was developed to slow transport and reduce leaching of inorganic nutrient loads within agricultural soils. Liposomes, spherical lipid bilayers, have been widely used in medicine but remain under-characterized for agricultural applications. Their biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and stability under certain compositions and environmental conditions suggest they could effectively deliver agrochemicals to crops. We present soil column experiments to evaluate the ability of a liposomal carrier to reduce the transport of an ionic tracer load, sodium bromide, under varying soil and water saturation conditions. Results from saturated column experiments demonstrate that encapsulation in liposomes slowed tracer transport and reduced leachate concentrations in sand and silty clay loam soils. Reduction in tracer leachate was also observed for unsaturated column experiments in silty clay loam soil. Subsequent experiments suggested a combination of processes (i.e., attachment, aggregation, physical exclusion, and biogenic immobilization) were responsible for the observed behavior of liposome encapsulated tracer in the soil column experiments. These findings support the use of liposomes as an effective carrier of inorganic nutrients to reduce leaching."

Microorganisms drive Mn(II) oxidation, but traditional cultivation-dependent identification methods are inefficient and error-prone. To overcome these limitations, we developed MnOxGeneTool, a bioinformatics tool for identifying and quantifying Mn(II)-oxidizing genes from genomic and metagenomic data. MnOxGeneTool consists of three main components: (1) a curated database of known Mn(II)-oxidizing proteins and their homologues, (2) a hidden Markov models (HMMs) database derived from this protein data set, and (3) a computational pipeline that integrates bioinformatics tools (e.g., HMMER and BLASTX) to identify and quantify Mn(II)-oxidizing genes. We assessed the accuracy and sensitivity of these HMMs through cross-validation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying Mn(II)-oxidizing genes in bacterial genomes. Using MnOxGeneTool, we explored the phylogenetic diversity of Mn(II)-oxidizers and identified 824 bacterial genera containing Mn(II)-oxidizing genes, significantly expanding previous knowledge in this field. Additionally, we analyzed metagenomic data from various environments to explore environmental drivers of Mn(II)-oxidizing genes, identifying two potential drivers: oligotrophic conditions and alkaline environments. These findings enable targeted discovery of novel Mn(II)-oxidizers and genetic determinants through identification of their ecological niches and expression optima, thereby expanding MnOxGeneTool’s predictive coverage of uncatalogued Mn(II)-oxidizing proteins. By providing an innovative bioinformatics tool that enables efficient identification and quantification of Mn(II)-oxidizing genes from both genomic and metagenomic data, this study offers significant advancements in the research of biogenic Mn(II) oxidation.

Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) and stream-vulnerability scores for PFAS were determined for the Potomac River watershed in the eastern United States. Approximately 15% of stream reaches contained municipal and/or industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges that are presumptive PFAS sources, comprising from <1 to >90% of streamflow. Mean annual PEC, based on the summed concentrations of eight PFAS detected in WWTP effluents (ΣPFASPEC), for all stream reaches in the watershed was 3.8 ng L–1, and stream reaches impacted by WWTP had perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) PEC of 0.39 and 0.14 ng L–1. For locations where measured-environmental concentrations (MEC) were determined, municipal and industrial WWTP contributed 7.8% (0 to 65%) of the total annual streamflow and MEC were greater than PEC in 99% of the samples, indicating additional potential PFAS sources. The mean ΣPFASPEC was 9.1 ng L–1 compared to a mean sum of PFAS MEC of 34 ng L–1.

Among environmental factors, the widespread use of chiral pesticides has raised ecological concerns, yet their enantioselective impacts on ARG propagation remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate how chiral pesticides influence microbial ARG dissemination at the enantiomeric level. Using flurtamone as a model, we successfully separated and quantitatively analyzed its enantiomers (R-flurtamone and S-flurtamone) and evaluated their effects at environmentally relevant concentrations (0–80 μg/L). Remarkably, R-flurtamone significantly enhanced the horizontal transfer of ARGs, surpassing the effects of Rac-flurtamone, whereas S-flurtamone exerted a negligible influence. Mechanistic insights revealed that R-flurtamone is more easily recognized by bacterial cells and induces more cellular stress responses. Additionally, R-flurtamone induced an increase in cell membrane permeability, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, SOS responses, and boosted ATP levels, further accelerating ARG propagation. By integrating experimental findings with molecular simulations, we elucidated the enantioselective mechanisms underpinning ARG transfer. This study highlights the overlooked risks associated with racemic chiral pesticides at the enantiomeric level and provides a foundation for mitigating ARG dissemination in agricultural and environmental systems."

However, the role of primary degraders initiating decomposition of complex biopolymers in As methylation and the underlying driving mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This study uncovers a direct metabolic connection between chitin, a major component of particulate organic matter in the soil, and As methylation facilitated by specialized aerobic chitin-degrading bacteria. Chitin markedly enhanced As methylation and its volatilization in paddy soils under aerobic conditions, resulting in 2.9- and 25-fold higher increases compared with the treatments with lignocellulosic residue and components, respectively. Chitinophagaceae members were enriched in the presence of chitin, with bacteria related to Chitinophaga likely serving as the key contributors. The direct coupling between As methylation and chitin hydrolysis was further confirmed using a representative Chitinophaga strain isolated from a paddy soil, which produced dimethylarsenate and trimethylarsenate as the major MeAs products. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that a considerable proportion of Chitinophaga found diverse soil environments possess complete functional genes for As methylation and chitin utilization, highlighting their potential for regulating As cycling broadly. These findings emphasize the chitin degradation-associated As methylation as a previously overlooked contributor to MeAs fluxes, enhancing our understanding of the interconnected biogeochemistry of As and carbon in soils."

Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model, indicating that the adsorption process is governed mostly by chemisorption. Adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating that uptake proceeds until roughly monolayer adsorption. Detailed characterization revealed Pb(II) was adsorbed as single atoms with complex inner-sphere binding modes that varied across different facets, indicating that adsorption is both structurally and energetically facet-dependent.

Variations in the b‐value (slope of the frequency‐magnitude distribution) of induced and natural seismic events are thought to reflect the stress state, although recent laboratory results suggest that fault roughness also contributes. In nature, stress, fault roughness, and pore‐pressure effects can rarely be disentangled. Here, we investigate these effects and their relative contributions to b‐value variation in the laboratory and compare them with hydro‐shearing in Enhanced Geothermal System reservoirs. Spatial‐temporal variations in b‐values stem from three distinct factors: (a) Increasing differential stress shows an inverse linear relationship with b‐value, with a steeper slope at high pore pressure. (b) Higher pore‐pressures, on average, lead to lower b‐values. (c) Spatial variations during injection are potentially structurally controlled so that high‐damage zones promote higher b‐values. We conclude that b‐value variations outside the lab require cautious interpretation because of these multiple underlying causes."

Galkin,Using Ionosondes for Lower‐Ionosphere Remote Sensing,"Ionosondes are primarily used to measure the electron densities of the ionosphere's E and F‐region via frequency‐range analysis of the probing signal returns. The amplitude of the returning signal has often been ignored, however, and may allow estimates of other propagation effects such as D and E‐region absorption. We introduce a methodology to extract this information from amplitude data and view results in ensemble with Very Low Frequency‐derived, D‐Region absorption estimates. This comparison allows us to infer what portion of High Frequency (HF) attenuation is due to D‐region versus E‐region absorption. The attenuation observed by both methodologies are congruent with each other in the diurnal cycle across HF frequencies between 2.5 and 4.5 MHz. This technique may extend the utility of ionosondes beyond their traditional applications."

Refilling may occur in stages, and studying this process is important to understanding how the ionosphere couples to the magnetosphere. This study examines the two‐stage refilling process of the plasmasphere using data from 42 geomagnetic storms observed during the Van Allen Probes era. We find that two‐stage refilling is characterized by an initial stage of low density plasma which refills slowly, followed by a second stage where the density increases and shows very high variation. We observe two‐stage refilling 40% of the time in events where the plasmasphere was significantly depleted. We find that two‐stage refilling is not strongly correlated with global geomagnetic indices (DST, AE, and Kp), but it is highly dependent on local time and rarely occurs in the noon and afternoon sectors."

To address this issue, we have developed a method for calculating geostrophic wind speed, which has been used as the reference to perform homogeneity detection and adjustment for the SWS at stations in China. Here, the method is applied to homogenize annual mean SWS from more than 3,600 stations over global land from 1973 to 2022. Although further confirmation from the metadata is required, the homogenization significantly reduces statistical inhomogeneity (p = 0.01) in the raw SWS. The results show that about 35% of the global stations exhibit inhomogeneities in SWS, and this phenomenon is more pronounced over North America and Europe. The homogenization has a minimal impact on the global average trend of SWS, but has major impacts on regional trends, especially in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. Compared with the raw SWS, the trend of homogenized SWS from 1973 to 2022 changed from −0.052 to −0.027 m s−1 per decade in Europe, and from −0.066 to −0.033 m s−1 per decade in Asia.

Here, we use seven ensemble averaging methods including simple average, regression, Support Vector Regressor, Bayesian model average (BMA), Random Forest (RF), Artificial neural network (ANN) and Long‐short term memory to derive the ensemble mean of eight process‐based crop models for global maize yield projections. Results show that the choice of ensemble averaging methods has a large impact on the projection of long‐term mean yield and year‐to‐year yield variability, with a range of −19.79%–16.62% and −47.92%–55.39% for the globe, respectively. Regionally, the largest uncertainties from the choice of ensemble averaging methods are observed in Indonesia and Canada. Further uncertainty decomposition analysis shows that ensemble averaging methods contributes to 39%–87% of total uncertainties for global yield projections, which is even higher than climate models. These results imply that although using an ensemble of crop models is valuable for informing risk‐based policy‐makings, how we choose to combine and derive the best estimates of crop model ensembles has large influence on the assessment outcomes. This study highlights an important but not well recognized uncertainty source for global yield predictions which arises from the choice of ensemble averaging methods."

Hot and dry conditions harm crops and vegetation, while hot and humid conditions are particularly dangerous for human health. Whether a place tends to experience heat waves that are hot and dry, hot and wet, or both, depends on the local correlation between temperature and humidity. This paper uses reanalysis, observational data, and climate models to show that the global temperature‐humidity correlation has steadily declined since 1981 at a somewhat faster rate than climate models simulate. This decline in the temperature‐humidity correlation has occurred because humidity is increasing less quickly (or decreasing) on days with high dry‐bulb temperatures as compared to days with high wet‐bulb temperatures. The relative drying of hot and dry days is associated with those days warming faster than hot and humid days. Overall, the decline in the temperature‐humidity correlation has exacerbated the risk from hot and dry conditions while slightly slowing increases in hot and humid conditions."

Despite China hosting one of the largest dryland areas globally, limited studies have quantified its biomass carbon storage and sequestration potential. Here, we divided China's drylands into ecological types and climate zones and employed random forest models to estimate biomass carbon carrying capacity and carbon sequestration potential. The results showed that the carrying capacity of China's drylands is 7.1 Pg C, with ∼4.1 Pg C (∼58%) already stored and an additional 3 Pg C potentially sequesterable. Regions with the highest carbon sequestration potential are concentrated in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, the Northeast China, the northern part of Xinjiang, and the Huang‐huai‐hai region. Forests showed the highest total carbon carrying capacity (4.2 Pg C) and carbon sequestration potential (2.1 Pg C), followed by grasslands with a carbon carrying capacity of 2.7 Pg C and sequestration potential of 1.6 Pg C. Carbon sequestration thresholds varied across land use change types and aridity gradients. The identified hotspots in our study where vegetation has not yet reached its full potential should be the main target of future restoration projects. It should be noted that these estimates are based on historical climate conditions and land cover patterns, and may vary under future climate change and land use transitions. Therefore, these figures should be interpreted as conditional estimates, reflecting the limitations of using static climatic baselines."

Specialized research frameworks can help interdisciplinary teams organize and visualize complex exposure‐health pathways, identify knowledge gaps, and enhance coordination and communication across diverse groups of stakeholders. This article describes the development and application of a conceptual framework for wildfire‐related exposures and human health outcomes. This framework serves as a tool for integrating data resources and mapping known and hypothesized connections, between complex wildfire exposures and human health outcomes, across the lifecycle of a wildland urban interface (WUI) fire. We also demonstrate the utility and flexibility of this framework for disaster research settings through two example applications. The first demonstrates an application for studying WUI fires and respiratory health outcomes, and the second example shows how the framework can be expanded to visualize exposure and health modeling with potential biomarkers of exposure and effect. Our GeoHealth Framework for WUI Fires illustrates complex linkages between wildfire related exposures and health outcomes and highlights areas for future study. Given the destruction and complexity of WUI fires, this framework provides an important resource that can assist with evaluating these complex exposure‐health relationships, guiding and coordinating data collection, and informing communities and decision‐makers to improve response, recovery, and future preparedness for such events in the United States and globally."

 Structural designs inspired by physical and biological systems have been previously utilized to develop mechanical metamaterials with enhanced properties based on clever geometric arrangement of constituent building blocks. Here, we use the DNA origami method to realize a nanoscale metastructure exhibiting mechanical frustration, a counterpart of the well-known phenomenon of magnetic frustration. By selectively actuating reconfigurable struts, it adopts either frustrated or non-frustrated states, each characterized by distinct free energy profiles. While the non-frustrated state distributes the strain homogeneously, the frustrated mode concentrates it at a specific location. Molecular dynamics simulations reconcile the contrasting behaviors and provide insights into underlying mechanics. We explore the design space further by tailoring responses through structural modifications. Our work combines programmable DNA self-assembly with mechanical design principles to overcome engineering limitations encountered at the macroscale to design dynamic, deformable nanostructures with potential applications in elastic energy storage, nanomechanical computation, and allosteric mechanisms in DNA-based nanomachinery.

 Pluripotent stem cells have long been used to produce knockout mice via germline chimera technology. However, aside from the rat, this approach has not been successfully applied to other mammals. Here, we demonstrate that rabbit induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be reprogrammed using KLF2, ERAS and PRMT6, enabling them to efficiently colonize embryos. These chimeric embryos can develop into fetuses and newborn rabbits, with iPSCs contributing up to 100 % to certain organs. Notably, female rabbits generated through this method are healthy and transmit the iPSC genome to their offspring with a high efficiency, demonstrating germline chimerism. This advancement establishes a foundation for developing rabbit models of human disease with complex genetic traits.

 Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide and water oxidation are promising technologies to mitigate environmental problems. A critical bottleneck, however, is the significant energy loss that arises from the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with its sluggish kinetics and reliance on scarce noble metals. It is therefore essential to develop earth-abundant and efficient OER catalysts. Here we report the reactive diiron electrocatalyst [Fe2(µ-O)(µ-OH)(L1)2], where L1 is a nitrogen-based ligand, which exhibits an outstanding performance—achieving a turnover frequency of 20.2 s−1 at 1.580 V and a low overpotential of 184 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2—and exceptional stability over 1,000 h. This diiron electrocatalyst is formed via a spin crossover-driven dimerization mechanism, where the resulting diiron atomic configuration promotes strong metal–ligand covalency and facilitates the formation of key intermediates that are essential for efficient OER catalysis. Our findings offer a promising strategy for the design of high-performance catalysts for water oxidation and sustainable electrocatalysis.

 Damming-induced fragmentation is arguably the most pronounced anthropogenic disturbance of global river systems, yet its spatio-temporal evolution remains poorly understood due to constraints in dam information, particularly in rapidly developing regions like China. Here we establish a spatially and temporally explicit inventory of Chinese riverine reservoirs and assess the long-term trajectory of damming impacts on river fragmentation during 1970–2020. We find that the number of dams rocketed from 1019 to 17,414, promoting a nearly-fourfold rise in total capacity. Consequently, ~62% of the main rivers, accounting for 90% of the total river discharge in China, have become fragmented. In particular, intensified dam construction in the 1980s and early-21st century substantially altered the free-flowing conditions of main rivers in China, including the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Over five decades, free-flowing main rivers in China decreased by 38.9%, weakening fluvial ecosystems and threatening long-distance migratory fish species. Notably, our fine-resolution results show that small rivers are fragmented at lengths 3-16 times greater than previously reported, revealing the ongoing river fragmentation spreading to fragile high-altitude headwaters. This underscores the urgent need to consider the societal and eco-environmental effects of such a severely fragmented river system, and aligns with the UN SDGs in promoting sustainable practices.

 Coastal flooding is occurring more frequently due to global sea-level rise, among other factors. However, current understanding of coastal flood frequency and sea-level rise impacts is predominantly based on tide gauges, which do not measure water levels on land. Here, we present data from a novel network of land-based flood sensors in the state of North Carolina, USA. We demonstrate that tide-gauge data are poor indicators of flooding: floods occur 26–128 days annually, an order of magnitude greater than what regional tide gauges suggest in some places. Improving the accuracy of coastal flood measures is critical for identifying the impacts of sea-level rise and developing effective adaptation strategies.

 Snow algae, microscopic organisms thriving in snow-covered environments, significantly affect snow albedo and broader climatic processes. This study introduces the Algae Presence Index (API), a novel spectral tool using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to detect and classify red and green algae on King George Island, Antarctica. From 2019 to 2023, we analyzed temporal and spatial variations in algae presence during austral summers and observed corresponding reductions in surface albedo, demonstrating how algal blooms influence snowmelt. Green algae showed a stronger albedo reduction (up to 8.46 %) compared to red algae (5.33 %), emphasizing their greater role in accelerating snowmelt. The API outperformed traditional indices, such as the red/green band ratio and Red-Green Normalized Difference. It eliminated spectral overlap and accurately distinguished algae types from algae-free snow. These findings underscore the critical role of snow algae in climate feedback mechanisms and highlight the importance of monitoring their growth during Antarctic warming.

 Canopy chlorophyll content per ground area (CCC, g·m−2) is tightly related to vegetation photosynthesis and is a promising indicator of photosynthetic capacity. However, a global operational CCC product is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed a two-step upscaling method to estimate global CCC from Sentinel-3 OLCI top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. In the first step, a physically-based PROSAIL-D inversion model produced accurate CCC maps from over 20,000 high-spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral images collected across 50 sites within the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) between 2019 and 2021. The validation against ground CCC measurements showed an R2 of 0.89 and an RMSE of 0.30 g·m−2. In the second step, these high-resolution CCC maps were resampled or upscaled to a spatial resolution of 300 m, and combined with Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance images to train random forest (RF) models. The RF model demonstrated robust performance with leave-one-site-out cross-validation, yielding an R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.14 g·m−2. The two-step method also showed minimal sensitivity to angular effects and land cover variations, underscoring its robustness. In comparison, the traditional direct inversion method (the one-step method) led to underestimation of CCC by 0.16 g·m−2 and a moderate estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.30 g·m−2). We generated a long-term global OLCI CCC product using Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance data from 2016 to 2024, which can also be continuously updated using current data. This global CCC product can provide important plant physiological information, for parameterizing terrestrial biosphere models and capturing spatiotemporal photosynthetic patterns, thereby advancing research on vegetation carbon dynamics cycles at the global scale."

 Machine learning models have steadily improved in estimating inherent optical properties (IOPs) from remote sensing observations. Yet, their generalization ability when applied to new water bodies, beyond those they were trained on, is not well understood. We present a novel approach for assessing model generalization across various scenarios, including interpolation within in situ observation datasets, extrapolation beyond the training scope, and application to hyperspectral observations from the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) satellite involving atmospheric correction. We evaluate five probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), including novel architectures like recurrent neural networks, for their ability to estimate absorption at 443 and 675 nm from hyperspectral reflectance. The median symmetric accuracy (MdSA) worsens from ≥25% in interpolation scenarios to ≥50% in extrapolation scenarios, and reaches ≥80% when applied to PRISMA satellite imagery. Across all scenarios, models produce uncertainty estimates exceeding 40%, often reflecting systematic underconfidence. PNNs show better calibration during extrapolation, suggesting an intrinsic awareness of retrieval constraints. To address this miscalibration, we introduce an uncertainty recalibration method that only withholds 10% of the training dataset, but improves model calibration in 86% of PRISMA evaluations with minimal accuracy trade-offs. Resulting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates enable reliable uncertainty propagation for downstream applications. IOP retrieval uncertainty is predominantly aleatoric (inherent to the observations). Therefore, increasing the number of measurements from the same distribution or selecting a different neural network architecture trained on the same dataset does not enhance model accuracy. Our findings indicate that we have reached a predictability limit in retrieving IOPs using purely data-driven approaches. We therefore advocate embedding physical principles of IOPs into model architectures, creating physics-informed neural networks capable of surpassing current limitations."

 The increasing availability of remotely sensed data has enhanced our ability to monitor coastal evolution, yet extracting reliable time series for long-term analysis remains a challenge. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Isoradiometric shoreline extraction Method in producing consistent time series data across different spatial and temporal scales. We applied the method to about 150 multispectral satellite images spanning 40 years, covering two sandy beaches along Sicily’s coast in the central Mediterranean Sea. Our validation approach focused on assessing method consistency across datasets with different spatial resolutions and revisit times. By comparing Landsat and PlanetScope data, we demonstrated that while high-resolution products capture greater variability in shoreline position, lower-resolution but longer time-span observations effectively identify underlying evolutionary trends. The analysis revealed that manual digitization captures instantaneous swash positions, while the Isoradiometric Method consistently identifies stable morphological features between the low tide terrace and berm, providing more reliable indicators of actual coastal change. This multi-resolution approach proved effective in distinguishing between method-related outliers and paroxysmal events, with the latter typically detected across multiple datasets at corresponding timeframes. The systematic application of the Isoradiometric Method successfully characterized both natural variability patterns and anthropic impacts, providing quantitative baselines for interpreting Quaternary coastal processes while offering practical insights for shoreline monitoring and coastal management strategies. Moreover, we calculated the shifts’ gradient to quantify the rate of change in shoreline position. These results demonstrate: i) the necessity of creating shoreline time series as a tool for geological interpretation through the principle of actualism and as a framework for rationalizing contemporary shoreline monitoring approaches; ii) the Isoradiometric Method enables accurate Earth Observation image processing for this purpose."

 As China’s rural population continues to decline and urbanisation accelerates, the number of vacant courtyards (VCs) has steadily increased. Existing methods for detecting VCs in China face significant challenges regarding data availability, spatial scale, resolution, and reliability, which hinder accurate assessment. This study establishes an innovative approach that evaluates courtyard utilisation status by integrating visual features from horizontal and overhead imagery, distinguishing it from traditional methods that rely solely on remote sensing textures or geometric information. We constructed a systematic set of visual features and employed an interpretable machine learning (XGBoost model) to detect courtyard utilisation status. We identified an optimal model comprising four primary features: from an overhead perspective, plants condition, enclosing wall edge cleanliness, and presence of solar water heaters; and from a horizontal perspective, door and window condition. The research further reveals the asymmetric relationship between these features and courtyard utilisation status, and the spatial heterogeneity underlying this relationship. The model significantly outperforms existing research, achieving an F1 score of 0.834 on the test set while maintaining high accuracy on the external validation dataset. This demonstrates the considerable advantages and potential of this relatively low-cost approach for rapidly detecting VC, providing theoretical support and reliable technical backing for implementing courtyard utilisation monitoring based on image data and sustainable development goals across a broad range of rural areas in the future."

 The difficulty of accurately detecting lichens in Antarctic landscapes, due to their fine-scale spatial patterns and low spectral contrast, drives the need for high-resolution drone-based remote sensing imagery to develop and validate robust mapping methods. Few studies have explored the use of remote sensing and deep learning (DL) techniques for mapping and monitoring lichen density in Antarctic regions. This study aims to fill this gap by using multispectral (MS) cameras onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and DL to detect and map Antarctic lichen through a workflow that enhances detection using a semi-automatic labelling technique based on vegetation indices (VIs). This methodology was validated through a data collection campaign at Robinson Ridge, Windmill Islands, Antarctica in January 2023. Two DL methods were evaluated to classify and map Usnea spp., Umbilicaria and Pseudephebe species (black lichen), moss and non-vegetation: method (1) standalone DL model fitting, namely fully convolutional network (FCN), U-Net, and Deeplabv3+, with semi-automatic labelling thresholding using VIs; and method (2) ensemble stacking by using eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) as the input model, whose predictions are used as features for training a U-Net model. In Method 1, U-Net exhibited the best performance over the other models. Specifically, for Usnea spp., the results demonstrate an intersection over union (IoU) of 84%. Also, the black lichen class obtained an IoU of 86%. In contrast, Method 2, which employed the ensemble stacking technique, demonstrates an IoU of 71% for Usnea spp. and IoU of 75% for black lichen. This study provides promising evidence that using MS cameras on UAVs combined with DL models is an effective approach for detecting and mapping lichen density in Antarctica, though further exploration across diverse regions is recommended to validate its scalability and adaptability."

 The pre-monsoon season (March–May) in Bangladesh is the most hazardous period for lightning-related human casualties, particularly during morning and afternoon hours. This heightened risk is primarily associated with labor-intensive manual agriculture on smallholder farms. This study investigates the atmospheric conditions corresponding to the 50 most active and 50 least active pre-monsoon lightning days between 2015 and 2020. Analysis of sounding and reanalysis data reveals distinct differences across nearly all dynamic, thermodynamic, surface, and upper-air composite parameters. On the most active lightning days, the environment typically features a SWEAT index exceeding 230, a mixed-layer mixing ratio above 15 g kg−1, and high values of the most unstable convective available potential energy (≥1580 J kg−1), along with elevated instability—all conducive to thunderstorms with heavy rainfall. Notably, on 20 % of these active days, storm-relative environmental helicity reaches between 300 and 485 m2 s−2, indicating a high potential for supercell thunderstorms and intense lightning activity. In contrast, the least-active lightning days are characterized by weaker storm systems. These variations are primarily driven by strong, warm, moist southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, which enhance horizontal temperature gradients and atmospheric instability. Regression models identified potential instability, cloud ice water content, and cloud liquid water content as strong synoptic-scale predictors of lightning activity. Principal component analysis (PCA) further highlighted the critical role of cloud-scale thermodynamic and kinematic variables in distinguishing lightning intensity. These findings provide a foundation for developing daily lightning forecast systems, with potential benefits for public safety and protection of lightning-sensitive infrastructure."

 On-road vehicle emissions play a crucial role in affecting fine-scale air quality and exposure equity in traffic-dense urban areas.

With the deployment of traffic cameras and big data approaches, we established a bottom-up model that employed interpolation to obtain a spatially continuous on-road vehicle emission mapping for the main urban area of Jinan, revealing fine-scale gradients and emission hotspots intuitively. The results show that the hourly average emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and fine particulate matters from on-road vehicles in urban Jinan were 345.2, 789.7, 69.5, and 5.4 kg, respectively. The emission intensity varied largely with a factor of up to 3 within 1 km on the same road segment. The unique patterns of road vehicle emissions within the urban area were further examined through time series clustering and hotspot analysis. When spatial hotspots coincided with peak hours, emissions were significantly enhanced, making them key targets for traffic pollution control.

Cziczo,Ice-nucleating properties of glassy  organic and organosulfate aerosol,"Atmospheric ice formation is initiated by particulate matter suspended in air and has profound impacts on Earth's climate. This study focuses on examining the effectiveness of ice formation by a subset of particles composed of organic matter and sulfate. We used experiments and computer modeling to obtain the result that these particles are not effective ice-nucleating particles, suggesting that molecular structure is important for ice formation on these types of particles. 
 The role of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in atmospheric ice nucleation is not well understood, limiting accurate predictions of aerosol indirect effects in global climate simulations. This article details experiments performed to characterize the ice-nucleating properties of proxy SOA.  Experimental techniques in conditioning aerosol to glass transition temperatures (Tg) as low as −70 °C using a pre-cooling unit are described. Ice nucleation measurements of proxy organosulfates (i.e., methyl, ethyl, and dodecyl sulfates) and citric acid were performed using the SPectrometer for ice nucleation (SPIN), operating at conditions relevant to upper-tropospheric cirrus temperatures (−45 °C, −40 °C, −35 °C) and ice saturation ratios (1.0<Sice<1.6). Methyl, ethyl, and dodecyl sulfates did not nucleate ice, despite dodecyl sulfate possessing a Tg higher than ambient temperature. Citric acid nucleated ice heterogeneously at −45 and −40 °C (1.2<Sice<1.4) but required pre-cooling temperatures of −70 °C, notably colder than the lowest published Tg. A kinetic flux model was used to numerically estimate water diffusion timescales to verify experimental observations and predict aerosol phase state. Diffusion modeling showed rapid liquefaction of glassy methyl and ethyl sulfates due to high hygroscopicity, preventing heterogeneous ice nucleation. The modeling results suggest that citric acid nucleated ice heterogeneously via deposition freezing or immersion freezing after surface liquefaction. We conclude that Tg alone is not sufficient for predicting heterogeneous ice formation for proxy SOA using the SPIN."

It contains cell fractions of wetland extents per class at a grid cell resolution of ~500 m. The total combined extent of all classes including all inland and coastal waterbodies and wetlands of all inundation frequencies – that is, the maximum extent – covers 18.2 × 106 km2, equivalent to 13.4 % of total global land area. 
 In recognition of the importance of inland waters, numerous datasets mapping their extents, types, or changes have been created using sources ranging from historical wetland maps to real-time satellite remote sensing. However, differences in definitions and methods have led to spatial and typological inconsistencies among individual data sources, confounding their complementary use and integration. The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), published in 2004, with its globally seamless depiction of 12 major vegetated and non-vegetated wetland classes at 1 km grid cell resolution, has emerged over the last few decades as a foundational reference map that has advanced research and conservation planning addressing freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions, land surface processes, hydrology, and human health. Here, we present a new iteration of this map, termed GLWD version 2, generated by harmonizing the latest ground- and satellite-based data products into one single database. Following the same design principle as its predecessor, GLWD v2 aims to avoid double counting of overlapping surface water features while differentiating between natural and non-natural lakes, rivers of multiple sizes, and several other wetland types. The classification of GLWD v2 incorporates information on seasonality (i.e., permanent vs. intermittent vs. ephemeral); inundation vs. saturation (i.e., flooding vs. waterlogged soils), vegetation cover (e.g., forested swamps vs. non-forested marshes), salinity (e.g., salt pans), natural vs. non-natural origins (e.g., rice paddies), and stratification of landscape position and water source (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine, coastal/marine). GLWD v2 represents 33 wetland classes and – including all intermittent classes – depicts a maximum of 18.2 ×106 km2 of wetlands (13.4 % of the global land area excluding Antarctica). The spatial extent of each class is provided as the fractional coverage within each grid cell at a resolution of 15 arcsec (approximately 500 m at the Equator), with cell fractions derived from input data at resolutions as small as 10 m. The upgraded GLWD v2 offers an improved representation of inland surface water extents and their classification for contemporary conditions (∼ 1984–2020). Despite being a static map, it includes classes that denote intrinsic temporal dynamics. GLWD v2 is designed to facilitate large-scale hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical, and conservation applications, aiming to support the study and protection of wetland ecosystems around the world.

Treat,An expert survey on chamber measurement techniques and data handling procedures for methane fluxes,"Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, but we do not fully understand how much is released from natural sources like wetlands. To measure methane over large areas, many measurements are needed, often from small chambers that are placed on the ground. However, different researchers use different measurement setups, making it hard to combine data. We surveyed 36 researchers about their methods, summarized the responses, and identified ways to make the data more comparable. 
 Methane is an important greenhouse gas, but the magnitude of global emissions from natural sources remains highly uncertain. To estimate methane emissions on large spatial scales, methane flux data sets from field measurements collected and processed by many different researchers must be combined. One common method for obtaining in situ methane flux measurements is flux chambers. We hypothesize that considerable uncertainty might be introduced into data synthesis products derived from chamber measurements due to the variety of measurement setups and data processing and quality control approaches used within the chamber flux community. Existing guidelines on chamber measurements promote more standardized measurement and data processing techniques, but, to our knowledge, so far, no study has investigated which methods are actually used within the chamber flux community. Therefore, we aimed to identify the key discrepancies between the measurement and data handling procedures implemented for chamber methane fluxes by different researchers.We conducted an expert survey to collect information on why, where, and how scientists conduct chamber-based methane flux measurements and how they handle the resulting data. We received 36 responses from researchers in North America, Europe, and Asia, which revealed that 80 % of respondents have adopted multi-gas analyzers to obtain high-frequency (< 1 Hz) methane concentration measurements over a total chamber closure time of, typically, between 2 and 5 min. Most but not all of the respondents use recommended chamber designs, including features such as airtight sealing, fans, and a pressure vent. We presented a standardized set of methane concentration time series recorded during chamber measurements and derived CH4 flux estimates based on the processing and quality control approaches suggested by the survey participants. The responses showed broad disagreement among the experts concerning the processes that they consider to be responsible for non-linear methane concentration increases. Furthermore, there was a tendency to discard low or negative CH4 fluxes. Based on the expert responses, we estimated a variability of 28 %, introduced by different researchers deciding differently on discarding vs. accepting a measurement when processing a representative data set of chamber measurements. Different researchers choosing different time periods within the same measurement for flux calculation caused an additional variability of 17 %. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the processes causing the patterns in CH4 concentrations visible from high-resolution analyzers, as well as the need for standardized data handling procedures in future chamber methane flux measurements. This is highly important to reliably quantify methane fluxes all over the world.The survey results, as well as the questionnaire, are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.971695 (Jentzsch et al., 2024b)."

Using machine learning methods that combine multiple models, we produced accurate maps showing livestock distribution across seasons. This helps track seasonal changes in grazing and supports better land use, animal health, and climate-related planning. 
 Understanding the spatial-temporal distribution of grazing livestock is crucial for assessing livestock system sustainability, managing animal diseases, mitigating climate change risks, and controlling greenhouse gas emissions. In China, grazing ruminants are predominantly distributed across vast grasslands in semi-humid and alpine regions. However, existing gridded livestock distribution datasets fail to distinguish between grazing and other livestock production systems and do not simultaneously account for long-term and seasonal dynamics. This study introduces CLRD-GLPS, a comprehensive dataset mapping China's ruminant livestock distribution in grazing livestock production systems from 2000 to 2021. Our approach addresses limitations in existing datasets by integrating interpretable machine learning methods to segment grazing livestock from total livestock populations and generate seasonal grazing pastures with dynamic grazing suitability masks. We developed a stacking-based ensemble methodology that enhances predictive performance while providing insights into distribution mechanisms. The stacking ensemble models demonstrate robust performance through 5-fold cross-validation, with R² values ranging from 0.909 to 0.967 for cattle and 0.874 to 0.914 for sheep and goats. Validation results demonstrated the high accuracy of CLRD-GLPS across multiple spatial scales. At the county level, it strongly agreed with census data, effectively capturing grazing livestock distribution. City-level validation confirmed strong agreement (R² = 0.691–0.881), while grid-level validation using independent observations yielded R² = 0.79, further confirming the accuracy of fine-resolution predictions. The CLRD-GLPS dataset provides essential information for understanding grazing ruminant dynamics and developing targeted livestock management policies. Furthermore, our methodological framework offers a template for creating similar livestock distribution datasets for other regions and livestock production systems."

It evaluates the performance of the dataset, against in-situ snow depth observations. This dataset is found to perform well in most environments, with challenges at high elevation and some coastal areas. Assessing the quality of this dataset is necessary in order to use it as a baseline to infer future changes of extreme snow loads under climate change. 
 Large snow load events are a major hazard for both human societies, in particular buildings and transport safety, and natural ecosystems. National and European frameworks provide guidelines and standards in order to take into account extreme snow load hazard in infrastructure design. However, there is a lack of reference data for their implementation. This is even more challenging in the context of climate change, which modifies the frequency and intensity of major snow load events. In the context of the Framework Partnership Agreement on Copernicus User Uptake, we have developed a pan-European extreme value analysis of annual snow load maximum based on the Mountain Tourism Meteorological and Snow Indicators (MTMSI) dataset available on the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This dataset includes reanalysis data, based on the UERRA (Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses) reanalysis and snow cover simulations, and past and future climate projections based on regional climate simulations. Here we describe the evaluation of the MTMSI reanalysis component in terms of annual snow depth maxima against multiple in-situ observation datasets. Results are provided at the NUTS-3 (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques) scale used in MTMSI, for multiple elevations, over a large area stretching from the European Alps to the Scandinavian countries. We highlight satisfactory skills of MTMSI annual snow depth maxima on most NUTS-3, based on the Kling-Gupta Efficiency metric, correlation, and bias scores. We identify some areas where MTMSI does not adequately portray in-situ observation of snow depth maxima, located in the Alps, and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Croatia. This study thus provides background information for assessing the relevance of this pan-European dataset in terms of annual snow depth maxima, relevant for annual snow mass and snow load maxima based on complementary information based on snow cover model output.

Over two decades, these restored lands captured 21.77 million metric tons of carbon, Grasslands contributed over 80 % of this carbon storage, highlighting their critical role in climate mitigation. 
 The soil organic carbon pool is a crucial component of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key role in regulating the carbon cycle and mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. To combat soil degradation and enhance soil organic carbon sequestration on the Loess Plateau, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) has been implemented. Accurately quantifying carbon capture and storage (CCS) resulting from farmland retirement is essential for informing land use management. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of retired farmlands on the Loess Plateau was analyzed using Landsat imagery from 1999 to 2021. To assess the effects of the length of farmland retirement, climate, soil properties, elevation, and other factors on CCS, climate-zone-specific linear regression models were developed based on field-sampled soil data. These models were then used to map the dataset of CCS across the retired farmlands. Results indicate that a total of 39,065 km2 of farmland was retired over the past two decades, with 45.61 % converted to grasslands, 29.75 % to shrublands, and 24.64 % to forestlands. The length of farmland retirement showed a significant positive correlation with CCS, and distinct models were developed for different climatic zones to achieve high-resolution (30 m) CCS mapping. The total CCS from retired farmland on the Loess Plateau was estimated at 21.77 Tg in carbon equivalent according to the dataset, with grasslands contributing 81.10 %, followed by forestlands (11.16 %) and shrublands (7.74 %)."

This dataset is filtered and optimized for agricultural applications and meets the operational needs of the systems for early warning, and crop yield forecasting. We have generated a VIIRS-FPAR timeseries, corrected over the MODIS-FPAR data, to guaranty timeseries continuity beyond 2030, thanks to the future VIIRS missions. Data are freely available. 
 Climate change and extreme weather events pose challenges to food security, emphasizing the need for reliable and timely monitoring of crop and rangeland conditions. For this purpose, long-term consistent Earth Observation datasets on vegetation conditions are typically used in early warning and crop yield forecast systems. However, the near-real-time (NRT) production of high quality datasets and the need to guarantee long-term records present various challenges. To address these, we present a NRT global dataset of Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) at 500 m resolution, optimized for agricultural applications. Our dataset combines MODIS-FPAR (Collection 6.1) and VIIRS-FPAR (Collection 2) data, ensuring continuity from 2000 to well beyond 2030. We applied a robust filtering approach based on the Whittaker smoother to produce reliable FPAR estimates in NRT, accounting for sparse and irregular spaced observations due to cloud cover. The dataset is composed of two 10-day filtered timeseries: 1) MODIS-FPAR for 2000 to 2023, being the reference dataset, and 2) intercalibrated VIIRS-FPAR for 2018 onward. While several methods can effectively smooth and gap-fill FPAR data (i.e., using observations before and after the estimation date), our method is designed for optimal filtering in NRT (i.e., using only prior observations). Our approach yields six successive estimates of the same FPAR data point with increasing quality: a inital estimate immediately after the 10-day reference period, four subsequent estimates every 10 days using new observations, and a final consolidated estimate 90 days later. The implemented filtering ingests the available FPAR observations and their original quality assessment (QA) layers. To avoid unrealistic extrapolation when observations are sparse, we impose constraints, season and location specific, to FPAR estimates. We then intercalibrated the VIIRS-FPAR with the MODIS-FPAR filtered timeseries, using a mean difference correction approach, to ensure consistency between both series. This paper describes the filtering and intercalibration method used, the quality assessment of resulting timeseries, and details the obtained products and the corresponding QA layers.

A linear positive correlation was obtained between average MP abundance (items/individual) and average shell length of bivalves, while a negative exponential relationship between average MP abundance (items/g) and average shell length of bivalves was found.

Developing energy-efficient and sustainable desalination methods is crucial to addressing the global water crisis. In recent years, hydrogel-based desalination has emerged as a promising approach due to the excellent water absorption capacity and stimuli-responsive properties of hydrogels. However, conventional dewatering methods for recovering water from hydrogels often suffer from low efficiency and poor stability. To address these challenges, a novel approach using ammonia gas to dewater poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) hydrogels was investigated, achieving significantly higher dewatering rates (up to 110 gH2O/ghydrogel/h), among the highest reported, with water production rates ranging from 600 to 1140 LH2O/kghydrogel/day and an average salt rejection of around 60% for both synthetic and real seawater water. The process also demonstrated excellent stability, maintaining a consistent performance over 100 cycles. This technology shows great potential for desalinating brackish water for agricultural irrigation or integration with reverse osmosis systems for seawater desalination, significantly reducing energy consumption and capital costs.

However, the existing toxicokinetic modeling for dietary uptake of PFAS is limited. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to diet-borne PFAS with diverse structures for 3 days, followed by a 12 day depuration. The PFAS levels in zebrafish were monitored and predicted by toxicokinetic models. The experimental results showed intermittent feeding caused a peak PFAS level during feeding intervals. A two-compartment model considering intermittent feeding can accurately describe the dietary uptake kinetics of PFAS and provide a robust estimation of assimilation efficiency. The extent of PFAS level fluctuation is determined by the elimination rate constant in the whole body. Subsequently, a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model considering intermittent dietary uptake was developed to predict the internal body burden and tissue distribution of PFAS in zebrafish. The incorporation of intermittent feeding into the PBTK model significantly enhanced the model performance and provided PFAS level estimates within a factor of 2 for most of the experimental measurements during exposure. This study underscores the significant influence of intermittent dietary uptake on the internal body burden of PFAS in fish and advocates for its integration within the toxicokinetic model framework."

After 28 days of aerobic incubation, the predominant arsenic species inside the algae were phosphate arsenosugars (89.1%), while dimethylarsonic acid (83.8%) was the major species under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, the analysis of the bacterial community structure revealed that different bacteria were enriched under anaerobic (Pseudoalteromonas) and aerobic conditions (Pir4_lineage).

Woodchips from upstream portions of the reactor exhibited the greatest degradation, probably due to greater DO exposure, and degradation was localized to a 100 to 200 μm thick surface layer that was also associated with higher concentrations of Fe and Mn. Greater degradation was associated with faster nitrate removal. μXANES analysis of Fe and Mn in the surface layer indicated the presence of a microenvironment in which oxygenation reactions of Fe(II) and Mn(II) could contribute to the formation of reactive oxidants involved in the degradation of lignocellulose. Our results provide new insight into biogeochemical properties that influence wood decomposition in WBRs at both micro- and macroscales and how these wood degradation processes are coupled with denitrification."

Current geochemical models do not account for complexity in mineral assemblages, such as metal substitution or the role of nanoscale crystallite sizes. In this work, we studied mineralogically complex systems where Pu(V) was the sorbate and Al-substituted or nanoscale iron (oxyhydr)oxides were the sorbents. Using M4-edge and L3-edge high-energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption near-edge structure (HERFD-XANES) spectroscopy, we probed the electronic configuration of Pu, quantified the extent of Pu surface-mediated reduction, and explored Pu speciation. Our results indicate that nanoscale iron oxides exert a greater degree of control over the redox behavior of Pu than Al-substituted iron (oxyhydr)oxides under circumneutral pH and oxic conditions. This is due to the dependence of Pu surface-mediated reduction on an initial sorption step, which is greater with the increased specific surface area and reactivity of nanoscale crystallites."

This challenges the assumption of a direct relationship between metal concentrations in organisms and environmental levels, a premise commonly used in biomonitoring programs. However, deciphering the complex drivers of metal allometry is difficult because size and age often confound each other. In this study, we took advantage of a natural experiment provided by populations of oysters of known ages that exhibited substantial size variation within the same age cohorts. Using a stable metal isotope tracer technique, we examined the bioaccumulation of six metals (60Ni, 65Cu, 68Zn, 107Ag, 114Cd, 206Pb) under both dissolved and dietary exposures. Our results indicate that bioaccumulation efficiency primarily drives the allometric patterns of metal concentrations with age exerting a more pronounced influence than size. Older oysters showed a diminished bioaccumulation capacity, leading to negative correlations between the metal concentration and size. Meanwhile, indirect factors, such as growth dilution, played a minor role, and exposure duration had a negligible effect. This study enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms governing metal bioaccumulation in marine organisms and provides critical insights into improving the interpretation of biomonitoring data."

Mitigating I-THMs remains challenging due to the complex interactions among water quality parameters, disinfectants, and iodine sources, compounded by the difficulty of predicting their formation under varying treatment conditions. This study leverages a data set of 1534 samples from published studies to predict I-THM formation using machine learning (ML). Among five evaluated ensemble models, CatBoost Regression achieved the best performance. Incorporating domain-specific features (iodine/DOC and oxidant/DOC ratios) improved model accuracy and interpretability. Recursive feature elimination revealed that nearly half of the features could be excluded without compromising performance, simplifying model development and reducing experimental effort, an advantage often overlooked in prior research. Feature analysis identified key predictors and mitigation strategies, including minimizing iodine and bromide concentrations, reducing iodine/DOC, UV254 and SUVA levels, and optimizing chlorine dose. The model further enabled rapid identification of the optimal chlorine dose to minimize I-THMs using incremental and Bayesian optimization. Achieving an R2 of 0.67 on an external validation data set, the model demonstrated strong generalizability.

Previous characterizations of the drydown patterns assume a static linear relationship between water‐limited transpiration and available moisture. However, ecohydrological studies show that vegetation exhibits a spectrum of responses to water availability, suggesting that soil moisture loss functions may be nonlinear. To represent these dynamics, we introduce a nonlinearity parameter to the loss function. Our analysis shows that the nonlinear loss model improves the characterization of the satellite‐observed soil moisture drydowns. Globally, functional responses of drydowns are dominated by convex nonlinearity, showing less ecosystem water loss in dry soils than the linear loss function predicts. We find distinct degrees of nonlinearity among different vegetation types; areas with non‐woody vegetation more frequently exhibit a concave nonlinearity, the signature of aggressive water‐use strategies. We propose the nonlinear loss function as a continuous and dynamic framework to represent vegetation water‐use under changing water availability."

We analyzed the grain size, branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), and leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (δDwax) of sediments from Lake Tianchi in the ISM region, to reconstruct the temperature and monsoon history for the past 23 kyr. The results reveal a notable negative correlation between the abundance of brGDGT‐IIIa and grain size, indicating the non‐negligible influence of soil‐derived brGDGTs on temperature. Using the grain size‐brGDGT‐IIIa relationship, we assessed the contribution of soil‐derived brGDGTs and corrected the temperature accordingly. The results reveal a ∼6°C warming from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 23–20 kyr) to the mid‐Holocene (∼8–6 kyr), punctuated by several millennial‐scale events, including Heinrich event 1 (H1; 16.5–15 kyr), the Bølling‐Allerød (B/A; 15–12.8 kyr), and the Younger Dryas (YD; ∼12.8–11 kyr), with H1 being the coldest interval. The δDwax records show that H1 was the driest interval, with a drier LGM and YD and a wet B/A and early‐ to mid‐Holocene. Furthermore, the δDwax records display a pattern of variation similar to the interhemispheric temperature gradient, indicating that the intensity of this gradient is the primary factor controlling the ISM precipitation. Given the significant influence of Antarctic ice on the interhemispheric temperature gradient, the anticipated loss of half of the Antarctic sea ice by 2100 would lead to the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and associated drought in the ISM region."

As a robust climate indicator, lake ice phenology responds sensitively to these changes. Beyond climate conditions, lake ice is also influenced by lake properties, which have also been changing rapidly. However, their impact on lake ice has been understudied due to limited data. Therefore, we used Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 brightness temperature data and daily air temperature data to obtain the ice phenology for 182 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau from September 2012 to August 2022. Using this new data set, we examined the impacts of climate change and lake expansion on lake ice dynamics and their future changes. Our findings indicated that lake ice phenology on the Tibetan Plateau was strongly influenced by multiple factors. Freeze‐up dates were primarily affected by lake properties such as latitude, volume, and area, whereas break‐up dates were dominated by air temperature. Using random forest regression, we projected future declines in lake ice under the SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios. Additionally, lake expansion could further delay freeze‐up dates. By the end of this century, freeze‐up dates are expected to be delayed by 3–11 days, while break‐up dates could advance by 2–20 days, depending on the climate scenario.

The LCC over the TPLG in the summer of 1979–2020 exhibited a sudden shift of increased interdecadal variation in 1995. The abnormal increases in evaporation and whole‐layer specific humidity, and the abnormal convergence of 400 hpa water vapor flux, led to an increase in water vapor over the TPLG, which increased the LCC. The water vapor budget shows that the increase is the most significant along the southern boundary. The cyclonic circulation anomaly in the southwest of the TPLG can transport water vapor to the region. The southerly wind and upward wind anomalies in the south favored water vapor transport through the climbing effect. The water vapor budget at the eastern boundary of the TPLG had the highest correlation coefficient with LCC on the interdecadal scale. The anticyclonic circulation anomaly over Lake Baikal inhibited the outflow of water vapor across the eastern boundary. The anticyclonic circulation was associated with the Rossby wave train. The interdecadal warming of sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean‐Black Seas played roles in the maintenance of the Rossby waves. The Rossby wave train propagated upward and eastward from the low layer to 200 hpa in the positive anomaly area of the Rossby wave source.

However, previous studies on forest carbon potential have primarily foucused on afforestation, while natural forest restoration‐recognized for its superior carbon sequestration potential‐remains underexplored. This study integrates historical restoration trends with future climate scenarios to quantify the spatial patterns and aboveground carbon (AGC) storage potential of natural forest restoration in China, addressing key knowledge gaps. We first examined the relationship between natural forest restoration patterns in China and climatic factors, revealing that the Mean Diurnal Range was the most positively correlated factor influencing restoration, while the Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter had the most substantial negative impact. Based on future climate scenarios (SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5, SSP3‐7.0, and SSP5‐8.5), we predicted potential regions for natural forest restoration and estimated their AGC storage potential.

Remote sensing and reanalyzed data products offer the potential for capturing crop growth dynamics and understanding their drivers. However, the impacts of cropland masks on relative yield anomalies (RYA) and the contributions of variables across Africa and crops remain unclear. This study explores the explanatory power of air and land surface temperatures (AT and LST), precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture on maize, millet, and sorghum RYA in Africa for 2001–2020 under seven cropland masks with distinct configurations for temporal, crop type, and water supply systems. Results indicate that (a) North Africa was particularly affected by soil moisture variation and evapotranspiration, West Africa was strongly impacted by precipitation, Central and East Africa were highly influenced by mean AT and total precipitation, and South Africa was mainly affected by high LST, mean evapotranspiration, and precipitation variation. (b) Interactions between precipitation and LST improved the explanatory power of the multiple stepwise regression model from 67% to 73%, while that of the random forest model considering complex variable interactions reached 83%. (c) Variables with high contributions were less impacted by the choice of masks.

High‐income districts in NYC had high green cover and experienced the highest increase of UG, in contrast to high green cover in areas with low population density and the greatest increase of UG in high‐income areas for Beijing, respectively. The inequitable distribution of UG resulted in a high level of mismatch in supply demand of ES, revealing a pattern of distributional ecological injustice within city. We also found more ecological supply was provided in the areas having less vulnerability, indicating that social vulnerability remained in a lower greenspace exposure after greening implementation in both cities.

Accurately predicting mosquito abundance and dispersion remains a challenge. Complex interactions between mosquito dynamics and various environmental factors, notably hydrology, contribute to this challenge. Existing models typically focus on precipitation and temperature and often overlook further impacts of hydrological variables within mosquito modeling. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence‐based model for mosquito dynamics, explicitly accounting for different hydrological variables, such as precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow. Using Toronto, Canada, as a case study, we identified causal relationships between changes in mosquito populations, hydrological factors, vegetation (e.g., leaf area index), and climate variables (e.g., daylight length, precipitation, and temperature). We embedded these relationships into a Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network Model capable of accurately detecting mosquito dynamics across annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales. The LSTM is able to explain, on average, approximately 40% of the variance in the observed mosquito abundance data. Using the calibrated model, we predicted that the summer season mosquito abundance would increase by ∼16% and ∼19% under an intermediate greenhouse emission scenario, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2–4.5, and a high greenhouse emission scenario, SSP5‐8.5, respectively.

We report on health‐related Quality of Life (QoL) and functioning in the population affected by the 2021 flooding in Germany using an empirical survey data set. Health‐related QoL and functioning are represented by two scores–(a) The EuroQoL 5D Visual Analog Scale (EQ‐5D VAS) and (b) The 12‐Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0), respectively. By applying an incremental linear regression model and Machine Learning models, we infer that health‐related QoL and functioning are strongly negatively related to the psychological burden from those being affected by the flooding. This includes how often they think about the traumatic event. Home owners were found to have worse QoL and functioning than tenants. Household income and the status of repair/reconstruction of flood damages—in specific, insurance benefits, private donation and satisfactory claims compensation are associated with high health‐related QoL and functioning. These findings highlight the importance of strengthening the health‐related QoL of flood affected populations and emphasizes the strong association between recovery and health‐related QoL and functioning of flood‐affected populations."

 Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality1–10. Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 bce. Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology11, not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems.

We first construct a simple variational circuit that prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics by means of a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen11,12. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a new set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.

 Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere1,2. Until now, CO2 and CH4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration3–6. Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4. Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year−1, similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models. Using a global database of the radiocarbon content of rivers combining new and published measurements, isotopic mass balance suggests that about 60% of river CO2 emissions are derived from millennial or older carbon sources."

 Drought is one of the most common and complex natural hazards affecting the environment, economies and populations globally1–4. However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends4–6, and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901–2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy offers a promising approach against cancer1–3. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA–CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.

 Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm1–5. However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited6–9. Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes.

 Cancer cell plasticity enables the acquisition of new phenotypic features and is implicated as a major driver of metastatic progression1,2. Metastasis occurs mostly in the absence of additional genetic alterations3–5, which suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are important6. However, they remain poorly defined. Here we identify the chromatin-remodelling enzyme ATRX as a key regulator of colonic lineage fidelity and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Atrx loss promotes tumour invasion and metastasis, concomitant with a loss of colonic epithelial identity and the emergence of highly plastic mesenchymal and squamous-like cell states. Combined analysis of chromatin accessibility and enhancer mapping identified impairment of activity of the colonic lineage-specifying transcription factor HNF4A as a key mediator of these observed phenotypes. We identify squamous-like cells in human patient samples and a squamous-like expression signature that correlates with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis. Collectively, our study defines the epigenetic maintenance of colonic epithelial identity by ATRX and HNF4A as suppressors of lineage plasticity and metastasis in colorectal cancer. The chromatin-remodelling enzyme ATRX and the transcription factor HNF4A are identified as pivotal regulators of colonic epithelial identity, with roles in metastasis in colorectal cancer."

 Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed-matter systems. Recently, this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons1 and phonons2, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits2,3. In principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB cm−1 level for phononic waveguides, whether topological4–7 or not8–19. Here we combine advanced dissipation engineering20—in particular, the recently introduced method of soft clamping21—with the concept of valley-Hall topological insulators for phonons22–26. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses due to dissipation of 3 dB km−1 at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. The low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in topological phononic waveguides, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120° bend with a 99.99% probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. Our work will inspire new research directions on ultralow-loss phononic waveguides and will provide a clean bosonic system for investigating topological protection and non-Hermitian topological physics.

 To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behaviour can be learned through reinforcement learning1, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents2–5 and at characterizing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain6–8. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single timescale, known as the discount factor. Here we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopaminergic neurons in mice performing two behavioural tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks, suggesting that it is a cell-specific property.

 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space around the brain drains to lymph nodes in the neck, but the connections and regulation have been challenging to identify1–24. Here we used fluorescent tracers in Prox1–GFP lymphatic reporter mice to map the pathway of CSF outflow through lymphatics to superficial cervical lymph nodes. CSF entered initial lymphatics in the meninges at the skull base and continued through extracranial periorbital, olfactory, nasopharyngeal and hard palate lymphatics, and then through smooth muscle-covered superficial cervical lymphatics to submandibular lymph nodes. Tracer studies in adult mice revealed that a substantial amount of total CSF outflow to the neck drained to superficial cervical lymph nodes. However, aged mice had fewer lymphatics in the nasal mucosa and hard palate and reduced CSF outflow to cervical lymph nodes. Superficial cervical lymphatics in aged mice had increased endothelial cell expression of Nos3, encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but had less eNOS protein and impaired nitric oxide signalling. Manipulation of superficial cervical lymphatics through intact skin by a force-regulated mechanical device doubled CSF outflow and corrected drainage impairment in aged mice. This manipulation increased CSF outflow by compressing superficial cervical lymphatics while having little effect on their normal spontaneous contractions. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of superficial cervical lymphatics for CSF outflow and the potential for reversing CSF drainage impairment by non-invasive mechanical stimulation. The outflow pathway of cerebrospinal fluid into lymph nodes in the neck and how non-invasive mechanical stimulation can enhance drainage and restore impaired outflow in aged mice are explored."

 North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature patterns profoundly influence global and regional climate across all timescales, from synoptic1 to seasonal2–4, decadal5, multidecadal6,7 and beyond8,9. During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation10,11. Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen. Atmospheric reanalyses combined with ocean observations and model simulations show that the extreme 2023 North Atlantic heatwave was primarily driven by anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling mixed layers, with a smaller contribution from clearer skies."

 Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is the most common somatic alteration in men and is associated with higher mortality from epithelial cancers1–3. In tumours, epithelial LOY is also associated with poor survival4–7. This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality.

 Microangiopathy is a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the acute and chronic complications of the disease1. Endotheliopathy and dysregulated blood coagulation are prominent in COVID-19 and are considered to be major causes of microvascular obstruction1,2. Here we demonstrate extensive endothelial cell (EC) death in the microvasculature of COVID-19 organs. Notably, EC death was not associated with fibrin formation or platelet deposition, but was linked to microvascular red blood cell (RBC) haemolysis. Importantly, this RBC microangiopathy was associated with ischaemia–reperfusion injury, and was prominent in the microvasculature of humans with myocardial infarction, gut ischaemia, stroke, and septic and cardiogenic shock. Mechanistically, ischaemia induced MLKL-dependent EC necroptosis and complement-dependent RBC haemolysis. Deposition of haemolysed RBC membranes at sites of EC death resulted in the development of a previously unrecognized haemostatic mechanism preventing microvascular bleeding. Exaggeration of this haemolytic response promoted RBC aggregation and microvascular obstruction. Genetic deletion of Mlkl from ECs decreased RBC haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and reduced ischaemic organ injury. Our studies demonstrate the existence of a RBC haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs, functioning independently of platelets and fibrin. Therapeutic targeting of this haemolytic process may reduce microvascular obstruction in COVID-19, and other major human diseases associated with organ ischaemia.

 Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are used in many applications in the global energy transition, including for lightweighting aircraft and vehicles and in wind turbine blades, shipping containers and gas storage vessels1–4. Given the high cost and energy-intensive manufacture of CFRPs5–7, recycling strategies are needed that recover intact carbon fibres and the epoxy-amine resin components. Here we show that acetic acid efficiently depolymerizes both aliphatic and aromatic epoxy-amine thermosets used in CFRPs to recoverable monomers, yielding pristine carbon fibres. Deconstruction of materials from multiple sectors demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, providing clean fibres from 2 h reactions. The optimal conditions were scaled to 80.0 g of post-consumer CFRPs, and demonstrative composites were fabricated from the recycled carbon fibres, which were recycled two more times, maintaining their strength throughout. Process modelling and techno-economic analysis, with feedstock cost informed by wind turbine blade waste generation8, indicates this method is cost effective, with a minimum selling price of US$1.50 per kg for recycled carbon fibres whereas life cycle assessment shows process greenhouse gas emissions around 99% lower than virgin carbon fibre production. Overall, this approach could enable recycling of industrial CFRPs as it provides clean, mechanically viable recycled carbon fibres and recoverable resin monomers from the thermoset.

 RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters1–7. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)8–11 and elongation complex (EC)12–16 have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4–13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6–13). Together with KMnO4 footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC–EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA–DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC–EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation–elongation transition for an RNA polymerase.

 Chromatin remodellers are pivotal in the regulation of nucleosome dynamics in cells, and they are important for chromatin packaging, transcription, replication and DNA repair1. Here we show that the human chromatin remodeller SMARCAD1 exhibits a substrate preference for subnucleosomal particles over the canonical nucleosome. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of SMARCAD1 bound to the nucleosome and hexasome provide mechanistic insights into the substrate selectivity. SMARCAD1 binds to the hexasome through multiple family-specific elements that are essential for the functions in vitro and in cells. The enzyme binds to the canonical nucleosome in an inactive conformation, which accounts for its diminished activity towards the nucleosome. Notably, the histone chaperone FACT complex acts synergistically with H2A–H2B to promote the activity of SMARCAD1 in nucleosome remodelling. Together, our findings reveal an avenue for chromatin regulation, whereby subnucleosomes are remodelled through an ATP-dependent process.

 Lactobacillus displacement from the vaginal microbiome associates with adverse health outcomes and is linked to increased risk of preterm birth. Glycans mediate bacterial adhesion events involved in colonisation and infection. Using customised glycan microarrays, we establish glycan interaction profiles of vaginal bacteria implicated in reproductive health. Glycan binding signatures of the opportunistic pathogens Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus agalactiae to oligomannose N-glycans, galactose-terminating glycans and hyaluronic acid, respectively are highly distinct from Lactobacillus commensals. Binding to sulphated glycosaminoglycans by vaginal bacteria is pH dependent, as is binding to neutral and sialic acid-terminating glycans by F. nucleatum. Adhesion of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, S. agalactiae and F. nucleatum to vaginal epithelial cells is partially mediated by chondroitin sulphate. S. agalactiae binding to chondroitin sulphate C oligosaccharides is inhibited by L. crispatus.

 The design and control of atomic-scale spin structures constitute major challenges for spin-based quantum technology platforms, including quantum dots, color centers, and molecular spins. Here, we showcase a strategy for designing the quantum properties of molecular spin qubits by combining tip-assisted on-surface assembly with electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM): We fabricate magnetic dimer complexes that consist of an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule and an organometallic half-sandwich complex formed by the FePc ligand and an attached iron atom, Fe(C6H6). The total complex forms a mixed-spin (1/2,1) quantum ferrimagnet with a well-separated correlated ground state doublet, which we utilize for coherent control. As a result of the correlation, the quantum ferrimagnet shows an improved spin lifetime ( > 1.5 μs) as it is partially protected against inelastic electron scattering. Lastly, the ferrimagnet units also enable intermolecular coupling, that can be used to realize both ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic structures. Thus, quantum ferrimagnets provide a versatile platform to improve coherent control in general and to study complex magnetic interactions. Molecular complexes can function as spin qubits, and like other qubit architectures, making molecular spin qubits more resilient against interactions is vital for their use.

 Single-shot terahertz (THz) spectroscopy probes sub-picosecond, non-repetitive events by combining the advantages of laser absorption with phase-sensitive interferometry. However, its usage as a quantitative tool is hindered by the chirp penalty of the spectral encoding scheme, where a narrow probe bandwidth distorts THz signals, limiting the bandwidth and spectral resolution of THz measurements. In this work, we introduce Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS), a method that leverages a broadband supercontinuum probe to overcome these challenges. SETS is shown to increase the usable bandwidth from 1.5 to 2.3 THz (based on the chirped pulse width and supercontinuum bandwidth), reduce signal distortion by 50%, and mitigate null frequencies. Experiments on argon plasma and water vapor, supported by modeling, show SETS enables simultaneous measurement of electron density, collision frequency, and absorption spectra. By mitigating core limitations of single-shot diagnostics, SETS offers a scalable path for quantitative, high-resolution measurements in dynamic, reactive media.

Here, the authors use piezoelectric materials as mechanochemical redox catalysts with 9-phenyl-dihydroacridine as a sacrificial electron donor, enabling efficient consecutive electron transfer. 
 Mechanical-force-induced redox catalysis has emerged as a green and expeditous approach in synthetic chemistry, relying on single-electron transfer from polarized piezoelectric materials to substrates initiated by mechanical agitation. However, the piezoelectric potential generated can sometimes be insufficient to activate the electron transfer process, similar to the limitations observed in photocatalytic reactions. In this work, we introduce a catalytic strategy employing a consecutive mechanical-force-induced electron transfer (ConMET) strategy. This strategy uses piezoelectric materials as mechanochemical redox catalysts with 9-phenyl-dihydroacridine as a sacrificial electron donor, enabling efficient consecutive electron transfer. Our method effectively reduces aryl iodides, bromides, and even electron-rich aryl chlorides, which possess reduction potentials as high as −2.8 V (vs. SCE), leading to the formation of aryl radicals. Ultimately, this strategy facilitates anti-Markovnikov hydroarylation of alkenes and dehalogenative deuteration of aromatic halides under mild conditions.

 Infancy is a critical window for the colonization of gut microbiome. However, xenobiotic impacts on gut microbiome development in early life remain poorly understood. Here, we recruit 146 mother-infant pairs and collect stool samples at 3, 6, and 12 months after delivery for amplicon sequencing (N = 353), metagenomics (N = 65), and metabolomics (N = 198). Trace elements in maternal hair samples (N = 119) affect diversity and composition of the infant gut microbiome. Shannon diversity in 3 month-old infants is correlated positively with selenium and negatively with copper, and relative abundance of Bifidobacterium increases under high exposure to aluminum and manganese. During the first year of life, infants and their paired mothers have distinct microbial diversity and composition, and their bacterial community structures gradually approach. here are 56 differential metabolites between the first and second visit and 515 differential metabolites between the second and third visit. The typical profile of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) significantly differs between infants and their mothers.

 Mitophagy, the selective autophagic elimination of mitochondria, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality and cell homeostasis. Impairment of mitophagy flux, a process involving multiple sequential intermediates, is implicated in the onset of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Screening mitophagy inducers, particularly understanding their impact on mitophagic intermediates, is crucial for neurodegenerative disease treatment. However, existing techniques do not allow simultaneous visualization of distinct mitophagic intermediates in live cells. Here, we introduce an artificial intelligence-assisted fluorescence microscopic system (AI-FM) that enables the uninterrupted recognition and quantification of key mitophagic intermediates by extracting mitochondrial pH and morphological features. Using AI-FM, we identify a potential mitophagy modulator, Y040-7904, which enhances mitophagy by promoting mitochondria transport to autophagosomes and the fusion of autophagosomes with autolysosomes. Y040-7904 also reduces amyloid-β pathologies in both in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer’s disease.

This study uncovers modular mechanisms independently controlling embryo size and shape in avian gastrulation—a model for early human development. 
 Embryonic tissues undergo coordinated flows during avian gastrulation to establish the body plan. Here, we elucidate how the interplay between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues affects the chick embryo’s size and shape. These two distinct geometric changes are each associated with dynamic curves across which trajectories separate (kinematic repellers). Through physical modeling and experimental manipulations of both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, we selectively eliminate either or both repellers in model and experiments, revealing their mechanistic origins. We find that embryo size is affected by the competition between extraembryonic epiboly and embryonic myosin-driven contraction—which persists when mesoderm induction is blocked. Instead, the characteristic shape change from circular to pear-shaped arises from myosin-driven cell intercalations in the mesendoderm, irrespective of epiboly. These findings elucidate modular mechanisms controlling avian gastrulation flows and provide a mechanistic basis for the independent control of embryo size and shape during development.

 Identifying crops with novel and climate resilience traits is imperative to ensure food security. Without a basic understanding of the genomes and genomic diversity of these crops they will remain underutilised or could even become lost. Kersting’s groundnut [Macrotyloma geocarpum (Harms) Maréchal & Baudet] is one such crop, regarded as a useful, drought tolerant and sometimes valuable legume.

Four candidate genes involved in pathways relating to pigments or flavonoids are revealed.

 Adhesives are ubiquitous in industries and daily life. However, conventional fossil-derived adhesives pose substantial health and environmental risks during manufacturing and utilization. The development of nontoxic high-performance adhesives from renewable feedstocks is therefore highly desired but remains technically challenging. Here we report a high-performing hot-melt adhesive—glue that is applied in a hot molten state—derived from a byproduct of the pulp industry, xylan, a type of hemicellulose. Under optimal conditions, the lap-shear strength between wood chips can reach approximately 30 MPa, surpassing that of classic epoxy resins and far exceeding that of a commercial hot-melt adhesive (ethylene vinyl acetate). Furthermore, the xylan hot-melt adhesive exhibits excellent reusability for multiple applications, retaining more than 100% of its original adhesion strength even after ten reuse cycles. Toxicity tests show good biocompatibility for xylan hot-melt adhesive. Overall, this work provides useful insights into the design of high-performance, reusable, bio-based adhesives for enhanced sustainability.

Such TC activity changes are attributed to the development of WNP anticyclonic circulation in the ramp-down period, in association with an El Niño-like delayed response in sea surface temperature.

 Forest fires can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins, affecting short-term flood propensity and long-term water resource availability until vegetation is reestablished. While basin-level studies have extensively investigated these impacts, regional and global-scale assessments remain limited. Here we use a comprehensive global dataset of river discharge observations to systematically assess the hydrological response to wildfires for a range of hydrologically homogenous world regions and biomes.

 Seasonal vertical migration of large lipid-rich copepods is often described as a mass descent of animals when primary production ceases, with important implications for mesopelagic food webs and global carbon sequestration. This view ignores the existence of surface-resident individuals, but here we show that non-migrants can form a substantial part of the populations of polar migrant species. In the Central Arctic Ocean, the biomass-dominant Calanus hyperboreus was evenly distributed throughout the water column from November 2019 to March 2020, with ~20% of subadults and adult females remaining in the upper 200 m and ~41% migrating to 1000–2000 m. These vertical positions aligned with differences in the copepods’ cholesterol content, which can enhance the tissue density at higher temperatures. Gonad development and the vertical distribution of their offspring indicate that both non-migrant and migrant females contribute to the population recruitment. We reinterpret copepod seasonal migration as a bet-hedging strategy that balances nutritional benefits near the surface with survival benefits at depth, and thereby contributes to the species’ resilience under climatic change.

 The export of organic carbon from terrestrial ecosystems by erosion may play a central role in balancing the geological carbon cycle and Earth’s climate over millennial timescales. However, constraints on organic carbon yields have come from sampling modern rivers that don’t capture variation over decades to millennia driven by changing hydroclimate and erosion during extreme events. Here we use volumetric reconstructions of lake sedimentary fills to generate timeseries of sediment and organic carbon yields from two catchments draining the Southern Alps, New Zealand over the last millennium. The reconstructed yields indicate that earthquake-induced landslides significantly increase sediment and organic carbon yields, contributing to pulsed export that accounts for ~40% of the total. Between extreme events, organic carbon export increased twofold during centuries with a wetter reconstructed climate. Our findings suggest that the link between hydroclimate and organic carbon export may act as a negative feedback in the longer-term carbon cycle.

Here we propose a UNIversal, easy-To-usE Data-driven (UNITED) method for angular normalization of directional LSTs across global cities, integrating advanced machine learning techniques with multi-source remote sensing and reanalysis data. We applied this method to normalize directional urban LSTs from all available wide-swath polar orbiters (Aqua MODIS, Terra MODIS, Suomi-NPP VIIRS) on Google Earth Engine, leveraging their full archives of multi-angle observations (2003–2024 for MODIS and 2012–2024 for VIIRS). The method's high accuracy in normalizing these three products was rigorously validated using quasi-simultaneous, near-nadir LSTs from various satellite platforms (e.g., Landsat) across tens of millions of urban pixels worldwide under diverse spatial, temporal, and angular conditions. For example, for Aqua MODIS observations with viewing zenith angle exceeding ±55°, angular normalization reduces the root mean square error and bias relative to nadir VIIRS LSTs (used as the reference) from 5.71 °C and −4.92 °C to 2.43 °C and −0.40 °C, respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of the UNITED method in harmonizing directional urban LSTs. Our study holds significant implications for advancing urban thermal remote sensing."

 In September 2023, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) released the TanDEM-X 30 m Edited DEM (TDX30) and DEM Change Map (DCM). Although the improved resolution has garnered interest within the scientific community, the presence of artefacts—such as discontinuous terrain representation, abnormal values, and extensive noise—remains underreported in the literature. Artefact regions are typically small, but terrain analysis results within these regions are fundamentally incorrect, necessitating attention. Moreover, the quality mask provided by DLR cannot accurately reflect the extent of artefacts. To address this limitation, a novel artefact detection framework integrating multiple terrain features was proposed. Specifically, twelve terrain features (including slope, roughness, second-order derivatives, etc.) were selected for their ability to discriminate artefacts, and a CatBoost model is implemented for artefact detection. The proposed method was tested in the Loess Plateau. Contrary to expectations, over the Loess Plateau, the higher-resolution TDX30 resulted in a nearly 80 % increase in artefact areas compared to the TanDEM-X 90 m DEM (TDX90) (from 195.84 km2 to 355.21 km2), highlighting a quality degradation issue associated with resolution enhancement. However, the artefact area of TDX30DCM (i.e., DCM-updated TDX30) was reduced to 162.63 km2, demonstrating a significant suppressive effect. A fundamental relationship between artefacts and satellite observation geometry was identified: artefact occurrence frequency was notably higher on east–west slopes compared to north–south slopes, with concentrations in the 35°∼55° slope range, corresponding to TanDEM-X’s polar orbit and right-looking observation mode. Validation results demonstrated strong detection accuracy of the proposed method across each DEM: 96.84 % for TDX90, 98.44 % for TDX30, and 97.18 % for TDX30DCM. This study establishes a scalable artefact detection framework and offers significant scientific and practical value for facilizing the quality improvement of global DEM products."

 Vegetation resilience is crucial for understanding the self-repair and adaptive capacity of regional ecosystems. Opencast coal mine dumps, typical targets for ecological restoration, exhibit highly unstable vegetation ecosystems after restoration, making them prone to state shifts. However, existing studies have limitations in capturing vegetation resilience characteristics and its climatic driving mechanisms. This study addresses these deficiencies by focusing on the Pingzhuang West Opencast Coal Mine dumps, utilizing Critical Slowing Down (CSD) theory and long-term Landsat remote sensing data from 2008 to 2024. We propose ’MultiRes’, a pixel-level (30 m) method to calculate vegetation resilience. Unlike traditional fixed-window approaches, MultiRes offers adaptive window sizes with a wide range of stability. We analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation resilience after restoration, evaluated the effectiveness of vegetation restoration, and quantitatively assessed the impact of key climatic drivers across different phases. Results reveal that: (1) After restoration, vegetation resilience at each dump experienced three phases: initial enhancement, decline, and renewed enhancement. (2) Vegetation resilience improved significantly compared to the initial fragile ecosystem, with over 88 % of the area showing improvement, especially at Taipingdi, where the enhancement rate reached 99.85 %. (3) The influence of key climatic drivers remained consistent within each dump across all phases, particularly in the first and third phases. Areas dominated by a single climatic driver generally showed more significant changes than those influenced by combined drivers. These findings demonstrate that vegetation resilience captures stage-specific ecological patterns that NDVI alone cannot detect, thereby supporting adaptive restoration and climate-informed management in mining environments."

 Shallow water areas need to be protected and continuously monitored as a habitat for diverse flora and fauna. These environments are subject to changes caused by both local phenomena, such as tides, and global phenomena, such as global warming. Efficient measurement techniques are needed to optimize the cost and time of data collection and processing.

 Deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) is a rock mass wasting process featuring a slow movement rate at the mountain scale. In Taiwan, DSGSD has often been reported in the slate belt of Taiwan’s backbone Range because of the inherent cleavage characteristic. When a slate slope undergoes the DSGSD process, it can accumulate large deformation displacements and transform into a rockslide. In this circumstance, the slope movement could change from the cleavage orientation-dominated to the downslope direction, such as in the famous case of the Lushan North Slope. A critical issue for Taiwan’s authority in dealing with hazards associated with DSGSD is the efficient identification of hidden active DSGSD within the wide mountainous area for further detailed investigation/monitoring. This study aims to detect DSGSDs and zonate the present-day slope activity at the regional scale. Based on the Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technique, we propose a hot-spot-like DSGSD mapping and zonation approach. The analysis was applied to Sentinel-1 radar data acquired in ascending and descending orbits between 2018 and 2020 centered on the Chingjing region, Taiwan. Combined with LiDAR terrain data and optical images, we recognized five DSGSD domains with higher deformation kinematics, which include a site that has yet to be investigated/monitored as DSGSD by relevant government agencies. In addition, we calculated the decomposed displacement vectors from two acquisition MT-InSAR data to establish each domain’s geometrical and kinematical model. Combined with borehole interpretation, inclinometer data, and simplified mechanical simulation, the models characterize the present-day moving phenomena and driving mechanisms for the observed DSGSDs. Overall, the MT-InSAR technique can aid the region-wide hazard assessment for the DSGSD in slate slopes regarding mapping and zonation. The results also highlight the potential of InSAR-assisted observation for understanding short-term movement kinematics and formulating a site-specific monitoring strategy."

 The study of drought and precipitation evolution due to global warming has garnered significant attention from the scientific community in recent years. The Loess Plateau (LP), a typical dryland agricultural area, has its agricultural development influenced by precipitation. However, given its location in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, the complex terrain, and the severe lack of rain gauges, the region faces challenges in accurate precipitation measurement. Multi-satellite precipitation products (MPPs), with their wide coverage and high resolution, can potentially address this deficiency, making it crucial to assess their applicability on the LP. This study evaluates the results of the inversion of LP precipitation changes by MPPs, the factors influencing the precipitation changes, and the dynamical mechanisms affecting LP precipitation evolution. The findings indicate that the CPC is the most suitable product for inverting daily precipitation on the LP, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.774 between CPC and observations, and the highest Probability of Detection of 0.667. This is attributed to the stable data sources and excellent algorithms used by CPC. Furthermore, the LP has exhibited a significant upward trend in precipitation since 2000, with the thermal term playing a significant role in the humidification of the LP. The analysis suggests that global warming increases atmospheric moisture content, and enhanced westerly jet and near-surface easterly anomalies transport warm, humid air from the North Atlantic and the eastern China Sea into the LP. Clarifying the precipitation trends and dynamics in the LP can provide valuable policy support for agricultural development."

 Optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are two of the most widely used remote sensing data sources, providing complementary but structurally consistent information. This complementarity has inspired significant research on their fusion. However, due to the huge difference in image representation between optical and SAR data, this difference will lead to inaccurate information expression when using the same structure to extract features, resulting in poor performance in classification tasks. Therefore, in the feature extraction stage, we analyze the respective advantageous features of optical and SAR images and propose a heterogeneous dual-branch network framework. Our framework exploits the rich local features of optical images and the global structural features of SAR images by using CNN and VMamba as their respective feature extractors. This heterogeneous feature extraction strategy effectively captures the complementary features of different modalities and provides a solid foundation for subsequent feature fusion. Second, in the feature fusion stage, we introduce a global-local dynamic gating fusion module. The use of multi-scale feature extraction and self-attention mechanism ensures comprehensive feature capture, while the dynamic gating mechanism enhances the integration of cross-modal complementary information. Finally, our method achieves excellent performance on medium and high-resolution datasets, showing robustness and adaptability at different resolutions. Notably, it significantly improves the overall classification accuracy while maintaining the accuracy of individual categories. For challenging categories such as roads, our method achieves significant improvements of about 15%."

We perform numerical simulations to test under what conditions may lateral compression initiate subduction in Europa’s ice shell. We demonstrate that subduction-like recycling can occur only for shells of thickness≲10 kilometers, transporting the surface ice into the subsurface ocean. We further show that compression large enough to initiate subduction-like behavior in a thin shell is achieved during brief periods of enhanced eccentricity, implying increased hydrothermal activity at the seafloor. Together with the subduction-like transport of surface oxidants, such conjunction should favor chemical disequilibria in the ocean, increasing its astrobiological potential."

We previously reported elevated HDAC7, a class II histone deacetylase, in ccRCC. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC7 promotes aggressive phenotypes and in vivo tumor progression in RCC. HDAC7 suppresses the expression of genes mediating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism. Notably, lower expression of BCAA catabolism genes is strongly associated with worsened survival in ccRCC. Suppression of BCAA catabolism promotes expression of SNAIL1, a central mediator of aggressive phenotypes including migration and invasion. HDAC7-mediated suppression of the BCAA catabolic program promotesSNAI1messenger RNA transcription via NOTCH signaling activation. Collectively, our findings provide innovative insights into the role of metabolic remodeling in ccRCC tumor progression."

Color consistency in computer vision, color constancy in human perception, and color accuracy in biomedical imaging are intertwined, complicating digital color–based diagnostics. Existing color reference charts and correction algorithms are inadequate for mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine in digital health applications where detecting subtle color changes is critical. We present a machine reading and learning platform for color recognition and quantification to extract diagnostic information from colors. A unique combination of spectroscopic gamut determination, reference color optimization, nonsubjective quantification metrics, and neural network–based color recovery retrieves absolute colors of biological tissue. Studies on inflammation bioimaging of photocarcinogenesis and mHealth blood hemoglobin assessment demonstrate accuracy and precision in color recovery across diverse acquisition scenarios. The reported framework overcomes limitations of conventional colorimetric detection, enabling machine-compatible color-based bioassays and bioimaging, advancing digital diagnostics."

Yet, little is known about whether and, if yes, how social investigation is encoded in a specific type of cortical neurons. Here, we generated a computer vision tool to track social behavior of naïve mice and categorized them as high versus low social states. We integrated a genetically guided TRAP2 strategy with single-cell Ca2+image and found that activity dynamics of serotonin receptor 2c (Htr2c)–expressing neurons in the prelimbic cortical layer 5 encode high social states. We uncovered a long noncoding RNA Lrhcn1 that controls Hcn1 transcription and regulates ensemble activity of Htr2c neurons, and this regulation motivates social investigation. Htr2c neurons directly and functionally project to nitric oxide synthase (Nos1) neurons in the hypothalamic nucleus.

While splenic FRCs are thought to support antiviral T cell responses, their role remains unclear. Here, we found that ablation of splenic FRCs impaired virus-specific CD8+T cell responses during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed that FRCs promote CD8+T cell clustering with type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) in the T cell zone before migration to the infected marginal zone. Without FRCs, T cells instead clustered with cDC1 and virus-infected cells in the marginal zone, leading to suboptimal priming. Mechanistically, FRCs coordinated early viral replication and the inflammatory milieu for optimal DC activation, and an intact FRC network was crucial for generating effector T cells and maintaining protective memory T cells. Thus, splenic FRCs provide essential lymphoid niches for antiviral T cell responses."

While membranes can decarbonize H2/CO2separation, their moderate H2/CO2selectivity requires secondary H2purification by pressure swing adsorption. Here, we report hyperselective carbon molecular sieve hollow fiber membranes showing H2/CO2selectivity exceeding 7000 under mixture permeation at 150°C, which is almost 30 times higher than the most selective nonmetallic membrane reported in the literature. The membrane is able to maintain an ultrahigh H2/CO2selectivity over 1400 under mixture permeation at 400°C. Pore structure characterization suggests that highly refined ultramicropores are responsible for effectively discriminating the closely sized H2and CO2molecules in the hyperselective carbon molecular sieve membrane. Modeling shows that the unprecedented H2/CO2selectivity will potentially allow one-step enrichment of fuel-grade H2from shifted syngas for decarbonized H2production."

Here, we evaluated whether low-dose radiation delivered by radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), known to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibitors, can synergize with CRISPR-edited GD2TRAC-CAR T cells to improve outcomes in neuroblastoma. We found that in the localized model of neuroblastoma, low-dose radiation delivered by177Lu-NM600, an alkylphosphocholine mimetic RPT agent, followed 9 days later by GD2TRAC-CAR T cells led to complete tumor regression. Irradiation of neuroblastoma before GD2TRAC-CAR T cells enhanced the release by CAR T cells of perforin, granzyme B, tumor necrosis factor–α, and interleukin-7 while abrogating transforming growth factor–β1. Low-dose RPT up-regulated the death receptor Fas on neuroblastoma, potentially enabling CAR-independent killing. This suggests that low-dose RPT can enhance suboptimal CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors. However, optimization of radiation dose and timing may be needed for each patient and RPT agent to account for varied tumor radiosensitivity and dosimetry."

This dynamic nature of lactation makes it challenging to study under controlled conditions. Given the health benefits of human milk, models of secretory mammary tissue would offer opportunities to study factors that influence this important food source. First, 3D models of the mammary duct/alveoli (D/A) were designed inspired by shapes found in vivo. Photoresins based on mammary decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) were optimized to match the mechanical properties of native breast tissue. Next, these D/A models were printed with a volumetric printer and seeded with human milk-derived mammary epithelial cells (MECs). MECs formed stable epithelial layers on the printed surfaces and secreted the β-casein and milk fat globules.

Nevertheless, the fundamental, molecular-level mechanisms governing ion selectivity are still not fully understood. This study explores ion selectivity in polyamide desalination membranes, focusing on the partitioning and diffusion mechanisms of co-ions and counterions. Our experimental and molecular simulation results reveal that electrostatic interactions play a key role in impeding co-ion partitioning while enhancing their diffusion. The results further suggest that ion selectivity is predominantly controlled by the partitioning step, particularly the selective partitioning of co-ions. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on ion partitioning at the water-membrane interface to improve membrane ion-ion selectivity. In addition, our results point out to a trade-off between partitioning and diffusion, requiring careful tuning of these processes.

However, the mechanism underlying the former remains contentious, as direct population to the C state by light fields is forbidden by electron spin constraints. In this work, we investigate the mechanism of air fluorescence from excited neutralN2molecules by carrier-envelope phase–stabilized sub–4 femtosecond pulses. Our results show that fluorescence fromN2+ions reaches a maximum with cosine-like pulses, while fluorescence from excited neutralN2molecules peaks with sine-like pulses. In addition, by scanning the chirp of the driving pulse, we find that ionic fluorescence is maximized with chirp-free pulses, whereas neutral fluorescence favors negatively chirped pulses. These observations, supported by classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations, support the mechanism of intersystem crossing from excited spin-singlet states, which are populated via recollision-induced strong-field excitation."

Here, we develop a biplasmonic heterostructure in which CuS and Au nanoparticle layers, separated by an alumina spacer of variable thickness, exhibit enhanced second- and third-harmonic generation due to dipole-dipole coupling between Au and CuS plasmons, as seen in the characteristic inverse sixth-power dependence of their separation in the measured harmonic enhancement and confirmed by numerical simulations of near-field CuS-Au nanoparticle coupling. Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster relaxation in Au/CuS (690 femtoseconds) compared to CuS heterostructures (929 femtoseconds). Moreover, nonlinear absorption measurements provide evidence for harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer between the narrow Au and broad, tunable CuS plasmon resonances.

Here, we describe a previously unidentified aspect of coronaviral infection, whereby the master transcriptional activator of lysosomal homeostasis—TFEB—is targeted for proteasomal-mediated degradation upon viral infection. Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased small interfering RNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. We derive a series of novel small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit virus-induced TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad antiviral activities including attenuating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in two animal models. Together, these results delineate a virally triggered pathway that impairs lysosomal homeostasis in the host.

Using a 160-year documentary record, historical reanalysis datasets, and statistical modeling, we examine the climatic and hydrological controls of ice-jam floods in the lower Yellow River, one of the world’s most flood-prone rivers. Our findings show that ice-jam floods are strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric teleconnections, including the Arctic Oscillation, Siberian High, and Ural Blocking, which regulate regional thermal contrasts and cold-air intrusions. Over the past century, ice-jam flood frequency has declined, with hot spots shifting toward the river estuary due to weakening upstream-to-downstream temperature gradients under climate warming.

While stimulation of vagal efferent neurons is known to reduce maladaptive host responses during endotoxemia, only selective vagal afferent neuron stimulation inhibited TLR7-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment to the lung. These anti-inflammatory actions are dependent on adrenal gland–derived epinephrine, as adrenalectomy or inhibition of epinephrine production eliminated the protection afforded by VNS. Selective afferent VNS induced activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of neuronal activity in this brain region that controls peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity rendered VNS ineffective. Activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is critical for innate immune cell suppression, as the anti-inflammatory effects of VNS were eliminated in β2AR knockout mice and with pharmacological inhibition of the β2AR.

We designed these inhibitors with a combinatorial chemistry approach fusing selective LRRK2 type I and promiscuous type II inhibitors using iterative cycles of synthesis supported by structural biology and activity testing. Our lead compounds are selective and potent toward both LRRK2 and LRRK1, a close relative of LRRK2.

Here, we embed genome-scale models within a state-of-the-art ESM to deliver an integrated understanding of how gradients of nutrients modulate the molecular physiology of various plankton. In particular, when applied toProchlorococcus, we find that glycogen and lipid management can be interpreted in terms of acclimation to different environments. Generalized to other phytoplankton such as the diatomThalassiosira, we estimate the production of 39 metabolites that constitute hot spots of dissolved organic carbon described by their amount of carbon produced and their diversity of associated metabolites in ESMs. This modeling approach shows how genome scale–enabled ESMs have the potential to advance our understanding of microbial ecosystem functioning in ocean biogeochemical processes."

Here, by diagnosing historical simulations from multiple coupled climate models, we find that ocean heat transport is not the only pathway through which the AMOC modulates sea surface temperature variability. A weakened AMOC is also associated with colder, drier lower atmospheric conditions, which lead to a reduction in surface warming expected from increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases by reducing downward clear-sky longwave radiation at the surface. This radiative pathway and the oceanic processes contribute equally to the North Atlantic cold blob.

Our results identified the key emitters and highlighted the spatial and temporal patterns of vanadium release. 
 Anthropogenic activities are the major contributor to vanadium pollution in surficial environment, but quantitative assessment of anthropogenic vanadium emission across environmental receptors remains scarce. This study develops a nationwide vanadium emission inventory in China for 2015–2019, covering five major anthropogenic sources: coal combustion, stationary oil burning, transportation, industrial production, and waste handling. A cumulative flux model reveals emissions of 211 095, 3725, and 0.1 t of vanadium into the atmosphere, soil, and water during 2015–2019, respectively, highlighting the atmosphere as the primary vanadium receptor. Coal combustion (46.7 %) and stationary oil burning (40.1 %) are the largest vanadium contributors. The emission pattern is mainly shaped by regional activity levels, with Shandong, Liaoning, Hebei, and Guangdong contributing 35.8 % of national inventories. Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, designated as energy-producing bases, dominate coal-combustion-related emission. Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei achieves significant emission reductions due to coal restriction policies and adoption of cleaner energy and an advanced end-of-pipe system. In economically developed coastal regions, coal consumption has decreased, while oil consumption makes a greater contribution due to industrial modernization. Moreover, steelmaking operations account for 88.2 % emission in industrial production, and this continues to increase nationwide. Emissions induced by vanadium mining show remarkable spatial heterogeneity, with 66.1 % of output in southwestern China. Inventory uncertainties are driven by insufficiently resolved activity data, poorly characterized emission factors, and variability in vanadium content in raw materials, particularly in coal combustion, transportation, and waste disposal sectors. These findings underscore the atmosphere as the main vanadium receptor and identify the primary contributors, which is helpful to develop targeted mitigation strategies."

Utilizing a novel approach that combines machine learning with physical constraints, our model generates more accurate and physically reasonable estimates compared to existing datasets. This advancement enables improved understanding of ocean-atmosphere interactions, which are crucial for monitoring Earth's energy and water cycles and enhancing climate change projections. 
 Air-sea turbulent heat fluxes, including the sensible heat flux (SHF) and latent heat flux (LHF), along with the Bowen ratio (β, ratio of SHF to LHF), are crucial for understanding air-sea interaction and global energy and water budgets. However, the existing products, primarily developed using the semi-empirical bulk aerodynamic methods and data-driven machine learning approaches, are often weak in accuracy and physical rationality, due to the uncertainties in the environmental forcings and inappropriate parameterizations. In this study, we generated a global daily 0.25° product of air-sea turbulent heat fluxes using the Bowen ratio-constrained Neural Network (NN) model (referred to as the BrTHF model) that could coordinately estimate the SHF and LHF, along with the observations from 197 globally distributed buoys and multi-source remote sensing and reanalysis forcings. The spatial ten-fold cross-validation results showed that the BrTHF model, achieving root mean square errors of 6.05 W/m2, 23.67 W/m2 and 0.22 and correlation coefficients of 0.93, 0.91 and 0.25 for the SHF, LHF and β, respectively, outperformed the physics-agnostic NN model and seven widely used air-sea turbulent heat flux products (including JOFURO3, IFREMER, SeaFlux, ERA5, MERRA2, OAFlux, and OHF). Furthermore, the inter-comparison of the spatial distribution of multi-year means, as well as intra-annual and inter-annual change patterns showed that the BrTHF product reliably simulated global SHF, LHF and β, in contrast to the machine learning-based OHF product that failed to replicate these patterns. The main advantage of the BrTHF model lies in its improved rationality of β estimates, successfully eliminating the outliers observed in the physics-agnostic NN model and the seven typical products. The improved SHF, LHF, and β estimates can allow for more accurate quantification of the global air-sea energy and water budgets, enhance our understanding of air-sea interaction, and improve projections of climate change under global warming.

Numerical methods typical of weather and climate models are used, with no explicit subgrid scheme. Results highlight some advantages (e.g. large time steps) and disadvantages (e.g. weak vertical fluxes near the surface) of this approach. 
 A new computational fluid dynamics code for large eddy simulation (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer and convection is presented and made available. A key novelty is that moist thermodynamics is formulated in terms of thermodynamic potentials, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Despite the apparent complexity of the thermodynamic potential approach, the model's performance demonstrates that it is feasible and effective at reasonable computational cost for three-dimensional simulations. Semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian numerical methods are used; such methods are unusual for simulating boundary layer and convective flows and are more typical of global atmospheric models. Moreover, the model includes no explicit scheme to represent subgrid-scale fluxes of scalars and momentum but relies instead on the mixing and dissipation resulting from the numerical methods used; in other words, it employs implicit LES (ILES). Sample results from several standard LES test cases show that the model's ability to capture the main aspects of the flows is comparable to other LES models. At the same time, the results highlight limitations of the ILES approach near the bottom boundary and suggest that ILES might need to be augmented in some way, for example, by distributing the convergence of surface fluxes over several model layers. Also, results for a marine stratocumulus case show a significant sensitivity to different options for the numerical methods and parameters used. Further development and application of the code would benefit from a deeper understanding of both the bottom boundary behaviour and the sensitivities to numerics."

The statistical model is first built with observations and then applied to the simulated environment to generate possibly observed fluxes. This novel method provides insight into differently evaluating the numerical formulation of turbulent heat fluxes with a long period of observational data. 
 This study proposes using a data-driven statistical model to freeze errors due to differences in environmental forcing when evaluating surface turbulent heat fluxes from weather and climate numerical models with observations. It takes advantage of continuous acquisition over approximately 10 years of near-surface sensible and latent heat fluxes (H and LE respectively) together with ancillary parameters at the Météopole flux station, a supersite of the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure in France (ACTRIS-FR), located in Toulouse. The statistical model consists of several multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with the same architecture. A total of 13 variables characterizing environmental forcing in the surface layer on an hourly timescale are used as input parameters to estimate the observed H and LE simultaneously. The MLPs are trained using 5-year observational data under a 5-fold cross-validation. The remaining data are used to test the estimates under unknown conditions. The performance of the statistical model ranges within the state-of-the-art surface parameterization schemes on hourly and seasonal timescales. It also has a good generalization ability, but it hardly estimates negative H and large LE. A case study is conducted with data from a regional climate simulation. The statistical model is used to evaluate the simulated fluxes in the simulated environment to better examine the flaws of their numerical formulation throughout the simulation. Comparison of simulated fluxes with observed and MLP-based fluxes shows different results. According to MLP-based fluxes in the simulated environment, the land surface scheme of this climate model tends to underestimate large sensible heat flux. Thus, it incorrectly partitions between surface heating and evaporation during the late summer. Our innovative method provides insight into different techniques for evaluating simulated near-surface turbulent heat fluxes when a long period of comprehensive observations is available. It can usefully support ongoing efforts to improve surface parameterization schemes."

Recent studies have shown that Mn-oxidizing bacteria can harbor multiple Mn oxidases, but environmental controls on the regulation of these enzymes are unknown. Here, we examine the activation of the genes encoding for MnxG and McoA, two Mn oxidases in Pseudomonas putida GB-1, in response to varying Mn(II) concentrations. Using reporter gene fusion strains, we found that mnxG and mcoA are activated only by a fraction of the cells in the population and at different threshold Mn concentrations, with an increasing proportion of cells expressing mnxG (<10 μM) and then mcoA (>10 to 500 μM). Kinetic modeling showed that coexpression of mnxG and mcoA not only alleviates substrate saturation and inhibition of MnxG at high Mn(II) concentrations but also results in an 8-fold increase in the initial rate of Mn oxidation in the wild type compared to strains lacking mnxG or mcoA.

This study investigated the potential influences of DOM and POM on multiphase distribution process and migration of PFAAs. Results indicated that the origin and humification degree of DOM and POM were different, leading to distinct effects on the partitioning and migration of PFAAs. Overall, DOM inhibited adsorption of PFAAs to SPM, while POM promoted it, with protein-like components playing a more significant role than humus-like components. As the humification degree of DOM increases, its inhibiting effect decreases due to a reduced affinity of DOM components for PFAAs. In contrast, this effect is less pronounced in POM due to its higher humification degree. Furthermore, during the sedimentation of particulate PFAAs, wind can shift their pollution hotspots away from the emission source, probably increasing the spread of ecological risks. These findings indicate that DOM and POM may alter the fate of PFAAs by changing their partitioning, highlighting the need for strategies to prevent potential risks in practice."

Compared with arsenite (As[III]), arsenate (As[V]), and dimethylarsenate (DMA), DMMTA exhibited markedly higher toxicity to rice primary root growth, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 1 order of magnitude lower. Rice roots took up DMMTA approximately 10 times more efficiently than DMA. DMMTA was converted to DMA prior to xylem translocation to rice shoots. DMMTA exposure at the rice booting stage induced severe symptoms of straighthead disease, with a potency being >5 times of DMA exposure. Most of the arsenic accumulated in the husks of DMMTA-exposed plants was in the form of DMA. Application of silicon decreased the uptake of DMMTA and alleviated straighthead disease. This study underscores the significant threat posed by DMMTA to rice reproduction and food safety, emphasizing the need for increased attention to this overlooked arsenic species in paddy soil environments."

J. Alvarez;Caroline A. Masiello,Environmentally Persistent Free Radicals in Biochar: Environmental Context and Future Research Needs,"Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are produced during biochar pyrolysis and, depending on biochar application, can be either detrimental or beneficial. High levels of EPFRs may interfere with cellular metabolism and be toxic, because EPFR-generated reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydroxyl radicals (•OH)) attack organic molecules. However, •OH can be useful in remediating recalcitrant organic contaminants in soils. Understanding the (system-specific) safe range of EPFRs produced by biochars requires knowing both the context of their use and their overall significance in the existing suite of environmental radicals, which has rarely been addressed. Here we place EPFRs in a broader environmental context, showing that biochar can have EPFR concentrations from 108-fold lower to 109-fold higher than EPFRs from other environmental sources, depending on feedstock, production conditions, and degree of environmental aging. We also demonstrate that •OH radical concentrations from biochar EPFRs can be from 104-fold lower to 1017-fold higher than other environmental sources, depending on EPFR type and concentration, reaction time, oxidant concentration, and extent of environmental EPFR persistence. For both EPFR and •OH concentrations, major uncertainties derive from the range of biochar properties and  the range of data reporting practices. Controlling feedstock lignin content and pyrolysis conditions are the most immediate options for managing EPFRs. Co-application of compost to provide organics may serve as a postpyrolysis method to quench and reduce biochar EPFRs."

Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to phthalate esters (PAEs) could play a role in this trend. However, the relationship between PAE exposure and pubertal development in Chinese girls remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to address this issue by investigating the link between levels of urinary phthalate ester metabolites (mPAEs) and the risk of early puberty among 546 Chinese girls (6–8 years old) over a two-year monitoring program. Poisson regression, restricted cubic spline models, weighted quantile sum regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression were used to assess both individual and combined effects of PAEs on pubertal development. Significant links were found between urinary concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, the total of low molecular weight mPAEs, the total of nine commonly detected mPAEs, and the total of all mPAEs with the risk of early breast development (all P-trend < 0.05). Furthermore, levels of MnBP, MiBP, low molecular weight mPAEs, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate were positively associated with early menarche. Mixture effect analysis revealed incidence rate ratios of 1.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–2.45) for early breast development and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.22–4.45) for early menarche. Short-chain mPAEs, particularly MiBP and MnBP, were identified as the major contributors to this combined effect. The present study demonstrated that exposure to PAEs, particularly short-chain PAEs, could lead to the early onset of puberty in Chinese girls."

Here, we aim to estimate the long-term association between exposure to PM2.5 and depressive symptoms in China utilizing longitudinal models for prolonged exposures as well as a quasi-experimental design utilizing data from 23151 participants over 4 longitudinal waves that occurred in 124 cities in China between 2011 to 2018. Mixed-effects models as well as distributed lag nonlinear mixed models were fitted to assess the relationship between PM2.5 and depressive symptoms. We also assessed the effect of the Clean Air Policy (CAP) based on a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DID) design. The overall average PM2.5 concentrations generally declined with time from 59.40 to 39.35 μg/m3.

In this study, we employed a longitudinal approach, capitalizing on multitime-point evaluations of exposure to OPEs  and two-stage assessments of children’s brain development. The study included 508 mother-child pairs. We measured seven OPEs in maternal serum throughout pregnancy and assessed children’s mental health and developmental milestones at the age of 2 and 5. The group-based trajectory model identified pregnancy exposure trajectories. Generalized estimated equations and quantile-based g-computation were employed to evaluate the effects of OPEs on children’s brain development. Four OPEs, including 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), were detected in over 50% of the maternal samples. Each ln-unit increment of EHDPP was associated with an increased peer problem scores (IRR: 1.104, 95% CI: 1.038–1.174) in mental health. Regarding development milestones, EHDPP was related to lower scores in communication, gross motor, personal-social, and total score of the ages and stages questionnaires (ASQ) (IRR: 0.963–0.976). Trajectory analysis confirmed these associations. Notably, boys were more affected in terms of mental health, while girls were more vulnerable in terms of developmental milestones.

In this study, we assessed the internal exposure of pregnant women to 20 emerging and legacy TNOCs by analyzing urine samples after deconjugation (n = 400). The results revealed a frequent detection of TNOCs (median ΣTNOCs: 34.7 ng/mL, adjusted by specific-gravity), with 2-hydroxy-benzothiazole (2-OH-BTH), N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPD-Q), and tolyltriazole (TTR) being the most common.

Comparative analyses suggest higher BTH, 2-thiocyanomethylthio-benzothiazole (TCMTB), and xylyltriazole (XTR) in frequent commuters compared to infrequent ones (P < 0.05), implying their traffic-related origins. Seasonal variations pinpoint higher TNOC exposure burden generally during the winter, possibly due to the increased leaching from winter tires. Moreover, the median daily urinary excretion of ΣTNOCs in pregnant women was estimated to be 978 ng/kg bw/day. Such exposure burden including for 6PPD, 1,2,3-triphenylguanidine (TPG), and 2-OH-BTH had negative associations with fetal birth weight (P < 0.05), suggesting developmental adversity.

Despite growing concerns, the pathways through which ARGs migrate from environmental reservoirs to animal microbiomes are poorly understood. In this study, we raised mice from birth in pig manure-fertilized red (Ultisols) and black (Mollisols) soils or unfertilized controls, sampling their gut microbiomes at 8 weeks, to show that early life exposure to manure-fertilized soil profoundly shapes the gut antibiotic resistome in mice. Application of organic manure significantly enriched tetracycline-resistant ARGs in both red and black soils. Mice living in these environments harbored markedly higher abundances of ARGs, particularly the tet(Q) gene, compared to those in nonfertilized environments. Notably, Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae were identified as key hosts of tet(Q), with evidence suggesting a horizontal gene transfer between these families. These findings indicate that manure fertilization not only increases ARG abundance in soils but also facilitates its transfer to animal microbiomes, thereby amplifying the risk of AMR dissemination.

The derived IMF properties were compared with the simultaneous IMF measurements by MAVEN, which showed good agreements with each other with the accuracy comparable to most previous IMF proxies based on MAVEN data. This new IMF proxy does not require any magnetic field data and hence can be applied to the long time period prior to the MAVEN mission."

Using California as an example, we investigate how seismic monitoring capability, particularly the completeness magnitude (Mc ${M}_{c}$), influences the inferred proportion of mainshocks with foreshocks (Pf ${P}_{f}$). We test four foreshock identification methods, namely the fixed‐window, nearest neighbor clustering, empirical statistical (ES) methods and the epidemic‐type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. The fixed‐window method shows Pf ${P}_{f}$ decreasing with higher Mc ${M}_{c}$ due to the misclassification of background events as foreshocks. In contrast, clustering and ES methods yield relatively stable Pf ${P}_{f}$ across different Mc ${M}_{c}$ values. The ETAS model suggests that many foreshocks in California are associated with aseismic driving processes, but the identification of the processes diminishes at high Mc ${M}_{c}$. These results show that improved seismic monitoring capability does not significantly increase Pf ${P}_{f}$ but is crucial for distinguishing processes driving foreshocks."

However, their feedback processes remain poorly understood during boreal spring. In April–May 2024, South China experienced record‐breaking extreme rainfall in the decaying phase of the El Niño event. This extreme event is driven by significant crossing‐time scale interactions, which offers a unique opportunity to evaluate their subseasonal predictability in dynamic models. Our results reveal that the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) enhanced by El Niño decaying represents the response to slowly varying oceanic forcing. In contrast, quasi‐biweekly Rossby wave trains in the extratropics and the eastward‐propagating Tibetan Plateau vortex reflect the atmospheric initial conditions. These extratropical atmospheric disturbances reduce the anomalous WPSH via positive advection of anomalous vorticity, thus offsetting the influences of oceanic forcing. Although the anomalous WPSH and above‐normal rainfall pattern exhibit high predictability on the monthly timescale, the skillful forecasting of the three extreme rainfall events is less than 1 week. These findings suggest that the extratropical atmospheric disturbances, as initial conditions, can undermine the predictability stemming from tropical air‐sea interactions. The forecast skill of the extreme rainfall process in spring is limited by the memory of initial atmospheric states and the intrinsic constraints of weather predictions."

In such a future, naturally occurring VRE droughts need to be evaluated for their potential impact on grid reliability. This study is the first of its kind to examine the impacts of compound VRE energy droughts in the Western U.S. across a range of potential future climate and infrastructure scenarios. We find that compound VRE drought severity may increase significantly in the future, primarily due to the dramatic increase in wind and solar generation needed in some future infrastructure scenarios. We find that in our future climate scenario, the variability of energy drought severity increases, which has implications for sizing energy storage necessary for mitigating drought events. We also examine the spatial patterns of compound VRE drought events that effect multiple regions of the grid simultaneously. These co‐occurring events have distinct spatial patterns depending on the season. We observed overall fewer connected events in the future with the combined effect of potential climate and infrastructure changes, although in the fall we observe a climate‐induced shift toward events which impact more regions simultaneously."

However, projecting future MCS behavior remains challenging due to the limitations of regional models and the inadequate representation of MCSs in coarser climate models. In this study, we use GFDL's global storm‐resolving model (GSRM), X‐SHiELD, to explore the response of global MCSs to both increased sea surface temperatures (SST) and elevated CO2 levels using three sets of unique two‐year‐long warming simulations. We find that SST warming leads to an increase in MCS occurrence over ocean regions while reducing it over land, whereas elevated CO2 results in an overall increase over ocean and land. When SST and CO2 increases are combined, their impacts on MCS changes are generally additive. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, we identify the key environmental drivers of these changes across five MCS hotspots, highlighting the regional variability in MCS responses. Furthermore, MCS‐associated precipitation and its contribution to total rainfall are shaped by changes in both MCS frequency and the precipitation intensity within each event. By utilizing the explicit MCS‐resolving capabilities of GSRMs, this study provides critical insights into future changes in MCS characteristics and their implications for global precipitation patterns."

Thus, our study aimed to estimate the effects of intensified Patagonian dust inputs, warming and acidification on the growth, composition and production of phytoplankton assemblages in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and the High‐Nutrient Low‐Chlorophyll (HNLC) region of the Indian sector of the SO during the austral summer 2022. Natural phytoplankton communities were incubated for 5‐day under 4 scenarios (present and future conditions, and 2 intermediate scenarios). In the PFZ, +3°C and acidification stimulated the growth of phytoplankton, mainly cyanobacteria, while intensified dust inputs alone did not have notable impact. Conversely, in HNLC waters, the addition of Fe‐dust alone increased the total chlorophyll a of diatoms (mainly F. kerguelensis), whereas the negative effect of acidification and +3°C counteracted the positive impact of dust input on the diatoms. In these waters, future conditions benefited smaller species (haptophytes and cyanobacteria). The net particulate organic carbon production (POC) was also unaltered by future conditions, suggesting that primary production may not change in the future SO. However the increase in the length and number of long‐chain diatoms under future HNLC conditions may indicate that POC export could intensify in the future."

The compound (joint) occurrence of different climate‐related hazards and impacts can further exacerbate the detrimental consequences for society.

These are: river floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, tropical cyclone‐induced winds and crop failures. In line with the existing literature, we find sharp increases in the occurrence of many individual hazards and impacts, notably heatwaves and wildfires. Under a medium‐high emission scenario, many regions worldwide transition from chiefly experiencing a given category of hazard or impact in isolation to routinely experiencing compound hazard or impact occurrences. A similarly striking change is projected for the future recurrence of compound hazards or impacts, with many locations experiencing specific compound occurrences at least once a year for several years, or even decades, in a row. In the absence of effective global climate mitigation actions, we may thus witness a qualitative regime shift from a world dominated by individual climate‐related hazards and impacts to one where compound occurrences become the norm."

Land use in the U.S. will be affected directly by local and regional forces and indirectly through international trade. In order to investigate the effects of several potential forces on land use changes in the U.S., we advanced capabilities in representing the interactions between natural and human systems by linking a multisectoral and multiregional socio‐economic model of the world economy to a model that downscales land use to a 0.5°grid scale. This enables us to translate regional projections of future land use into higher‐resolution representations of time‐evolving land cover (effectively spatially explicit land use transitions). We applied the framework over the U.S., with a particular interest in the Mississippi River Basin and its four sub‐basins, to consider how a range of global drivers affect land use and cover in the target regions. Our results show that under scenarios of high pressure on the world food system a comparative advantage in livestock production amplifies the recent trend toward less cropland and more pastures in the U.S. Under low pressures on the world food system agricultural land is used less intensively. However, there can be key differences among the various land‐use transitions at the sub‐ basin scale. Overall, these results highlighted the need for high resolution details to explicitly understand the implications of land use change on environmental impacts such as carbon storage, soil erosion, chemical use, hydrology, and water quality."

 Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination1,2. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe2+-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc—which is required for iron incorporation—in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes.

 Supported metal catalysts that integrate atomically dispersed species with controlled structures lie at the forefront of catalytic materials design, offering exceptional control over reactivity and high metal utilization, approaching the precision of molecular systems1–3. However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure–activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications1,2. Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that 195Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures.

 Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons1. When quark–antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. Although these phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task2. Here we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays3–5. We show that a (2 + 1)-dimensional LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry6, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade7. Long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses and the string tension. We experimentally probe string breaking in equilibrium by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, distinguishing regions within the confined phase dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string-breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work provides opportunities for exploring phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.

 The development of life on Earth has been enabled by its volatile-rich surface. The volatile budget of Earth’s surface is controlled by the balance between ingassing (for example, via subduction) and outgassing (for example, through magmatic and tectonic processes). Although volatiles within Earth’s interior are relatively depleted compared to CI chondrites, the total amount of volatiles within Earth is still substantial due to its vast size. However, the relative extent of diffuse degassing from Earth’s interior, not directly related to volcanism, is not well constrained. Here we use dissolved helium and high-precision argon isotopes combined with radiocarbon of dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwater from the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer (Washington and Idaho, USA). We identify mantle and crustal volatile sources and quantify their fluxes to the surface. Excess helium and argon in the groundwater indicate a mixture of sub-continental lithospheric mantle and crustal sources, suggesting that passive degassing of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle may be an important, yet previously unrecognized, outgassing process. This finding that considerable outgassing may occur even in volcanically quiescent parts of the crust is essential for quantifying the long-term global volatile mass balance.

 Same-dip double subduction systems influence plate kinematics, geometry and mantle flow within the region bounded by the two subduction zones. However, whether these effects extend to nearby plate margin tectonics remains an open question. Furthermore, the range of geodynamic processes operating in these margins and driving non-collisional orogeny (that is, the formation of Andean-type mountain ranges) is not yet fully understood. Here we explore the potential geodynamic connection between the tectonic evolution of northeast Japan and the development of the Ryukyu/Izu–Bonin–Marianas same-dip double subduction using three-dimensional geodynamic models. We find that this same-dip double subduction drags the Pacific trench westwards, resulting in northward-propagating trench advance and compression affecting the northeastern Japan arc and back-arc. We thus propose that the dynamics of the Ryukyu/Izu–Bonin–Marianas same-dip double subduction over the past ~10–5 Myr drove the enigmatic plate kinematics responsible for non-collisional orogeny and back-arc subduction initiation in northeast Japan since ~6–3.5 Myr ago, which has made this region prone to catastrophic earthquakes. We also suggest that same-dip double subduction explains various ancient episodes of widespread non-collisional orogenesis and represents a mechanism through which subduction zones establish the plate kinematic conditions necessary for non-collisional orogenesis. The mountain ranges of northeast Japan were formed by the Ryukyu/Izu–Bonin–Marianas same-dip double subduction system in a process that may have driven other non-collisional orogens, according to geologically constrained three-dimensional geodynamic simulations."

 Frequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in vulnerable populations has raised concerns that this may contribute to T cell exhaustion, which could negatively affect the quality of immune protection. Herein, we examined the impact of repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on T cell phenotypic and functional exhaustion in frail older adults in long-term care (n = 23), individuals on immunosuppressive drugs (n = 10), and healthy adults (n = 43), in Canada. Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels did not decline in any cohort following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, nor did the expression of exhaustion markers on spike-specific or total T cells increase. T cell production of multiple cytokines (i.e. polyfunctionality) in response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not decline in any cohort following repeated vaccination. None of the cohorts displayed elevated levels of terminally differentiated T cells following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Thus, repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased T cell exhaustion in older frail adults, immunosuppressed individuals, or healthy adults.

Here, the authors demonstrate that a molten NaNO3 shell enables selective oxygen permeation, suppressing hydrocarbon over-oxidation in chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. 
 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has the potential to reduce significantly the energy demand of propylene production. However, low propylene selectivity and the need for expensive air separation hamper its commercial implementation. In the herein presented chemical looping-based scheme for propylene production, gaseous oxygen is supplied in situ by a perovskite oxygen carrier (Sr1−xCaxFeO3−δ) while propane is dehydrogenated over a physically separated catalyst (VOx/SiO2), thus allowing for high systematic flexibility, as each component can be optimized individually. To prevent over-oxidation of propane to COx at the gas-oxygen carrier interface, a NaNO3-based surface modification is developed, which melts under operating conditions and wets the surface of the oxygen carrier, forming a non-porous diffusion barrier for gaseous hydrocarbons, thereby completely inhibiting over-oxidation. We demonstrate stable operation over 250 redox cycles at 500 °C (14.5% propane conversion at 68% propylene selectivity), matching the performance of the benchmark VOx/SiO2 with co-fed oxygen.

 Metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a tumor type with frequent lung metastases, we conduct an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identify HLF as a potent suppressor of lung metastasis. HLF depletion enhances ccRCC cell migration and lung metastasis, whereas HLF overexpression abrogates these effects. In ccRCC patients, HLF expression is reduced at metastatic sites and associates with epigenetic silencing mediated by the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1. HLF levels negatively correlate with migration potential in collagen. Mechanistically, HLF regulates LPXN expression, modulating the integration of collagen’s mechanical cues with the actin cytoskeleton through Paxillin, thereby suppressing cancer cell migration and lung metastasis. Overexpression of HLF or pharmacological inhibition of BRG1 reduces cell invasion across multiple cancer types. Our findings suggest that targeting the BRG1-HLF axis offers a promising therapeutic strategy for combating metastatic cancers.

 The exploitation of the strong light-matter coupling regime and exciton-polariton condensates has emerged as a compelling approach to introduce strong interactions and nonlinearities into numerous photonic applications. The use of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots with strong three-dimensional confinement as the active material in optical microcavities would be highly advantageous due to their versatile structural and compositional tunability and wet-chemical processability, as well as potentially enhanced, confinement-induced polaritonic interactions. Yet, to date, exciton-polariton condensation in a microcavity has neither been achieved with epitaxial nor with colloidal quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature polariton condensation in a thin film of monodisperse, colloidal CsPbBr3 quantum dots, placed in a tunable optical resonator with a Gaussian-shaped deformation serving as wavelength-scale potential well for polaritons. The onset of polariton condensation under pulsed optical excitation is manifested in emission by its characteristic superlinear intensity dependence, reduced linewidth, blueshift, and extended temporal coherence.

 Nighttime light (NTL) imagery remotely sensed from outer space has been suggested to be a suitable proxy to investigate socioeconomic dynamics. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many studies have used NTL imagery to estimate the impacts of the pandemic.

In this study, we estimate the fine-grained NTL dynamics before and after the COVID-19 surge in the city of Shanghai during the second quarter of 2022 using SDGSAT-1 GIU nighttime imagery. To distinguish the different behaviors among urban functional entities, categorized Point of Interest (POI) data are adopted. The estimation is conducted in three progressive levels: city-level, POI-class-level, and POI-object-level. To characterize each urban objects from multiple angles, two additional NTL indices, NTL and luminous area ratio composite index (NTL-CI) and NTL background relative activeness index (NTL-AI) are introduced and estimated. On the basis of raw NTL, NTL-CI further considers the change of luminous area and NTL-AI further considers the relative change to the average standard. Moreover, detailed visual observations at typical POI objects are conducted, for instance, the Shanghai Disney Resort, the Shanghai Tesla Gigafactory, and multiple cabin hospitals temporarily converted from large stadiums and exhibition centers. This study aims to present a comprehensive investigation of the socioeconomic influence of COVID-19 in Shanghai from the perspective of NTL changes in multiple granularities, and the utility of SDGSAT-1 GIU nighttime imagery in supporting SDG 3 (The Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health and Well-Being) is also demonstrated with this set of quantitative analytics."

 Plant water use strategies play a crucial role in regulating soil moisture, mediating plant-climate feedbacks, and influencing species competition and symbiotic relationships. However, the lack of long-term and large-scale studies on plant water sources has significantly limited comprehensive estimations of the spatiotemporal variations in plant water sources and their impacts on ecohydrological processes. To address this challenge, this study compiled literature data from 210 study regions across China and applied a multivariate random forest model to generate a 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution map of plant water source distributions in China from 2001 to 2022. The model estimated the proportions of water uptake by plants from different soil depths and groundwater, and analyzed the variations in water sources across different vegetation types, as well as the key factors influencing plant water sources. The model results aligned well with existing experimental studies, demonstrating their reliability in capturing the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of plant water sources. Nationally, plants derived on average 34.64 ± 6.45 % of their water from shallow soil (0–30 cm), 24.60 ± 3.42 % from middle soil (30–60 cm), 32.68 ± 6.74 % from deep soil (>60 cm), and 8.08 ± 4.7 % from groundwater. Significant differences in plant water sources were observed between southern and semi-arid northern regions of China, with plants in the southern regions predominantly relying on shallow and middle depth soil water, while those in the northwestern regions showed a greater dependence on deep soil water and groundwater. The correlation between soil water content and precipitation with variations in plant water sources was found to be more pronounced. Specifically, shallow soil moisture content and precipitation were positively correlated with the proportion of water absorbed by plants from shallow soil, but negatively correlated with the proportion of water absorbed from deep soil. From 2001 to 2022, there was a nationwide trend of an increased proportion of plant water uptake from shallow and deep soil layers, while the proportion from middle and groundwater decreased. This study fills a critical gap in the large-scale integrated study of plant water sources in China, providing valuable data and methodological references for related scientific research. The results of this study also contribute to the understanding of the ability to enhance vegetation adaptation to environmental changes, provide important driving data for ecohydrological model simulations and important data to support a more accurate assessment of ecosystem adaptation and water resource changes in the context of current extreme climate change."

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a pivotal role in representing ground energy balance and understanding climate change. LST over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) significantly influences regional climate and environmental dynamics. Accurate LST data in the TP is vital for ecological monitoring and climate studies. However, most retrieval algorithms assume a flat-surface thermal infrared radiation transfer equation (TIRTE), which introduces inevitable topographic induced in the TP’s complex terrain. Additionally, the limited and sparse ground stations hinder pixel-level error analysis. These limitations restrict accurate characterization of topographic effects on LST errors and impede the effective application of current LST datasets. This study proposed a method to quantify the LST retrieval errors at a pixel level and innovatively introduced the radiation-topographic bias correction term (RTBC). The effectiveness of RTBC in reducing LST retrieval errors with only one atmospheric parameter was demonstrated theoretically. Random forest (RF) models were employed to assess the contribution of topographic effects to these errors. The sky view factor (SVF) was employed as an indicator of surface ruggedness. The results demonstrated that LST retrieval errors were predominantly due to topographic effect when surface ruggedness was high (SVF ≤ 0.25), with an R2 value reaching up to 0.86. RTBC emerged as the primary factor influencing LST retrieval errors at SVF ≤ 0.25. In-situ LST analysis showed that when SVF decreased to 0.738, RTBC effectively reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) and by an average of 1.2 K and 1.1 K, respectively.

 Although the coupled climate models experienced significant improvement over the past few decades, they continue to suffer from common biases in the representations of tropical intraseasonal to synoptic variabilities interacting with organized tropical convection. This study presents a quantitative assessment of convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) over the tropical ocean, as simulated by 20 coupled climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6). The standard deviation of filtered daily precipitation anomalies as well as the spatial–temporal spectrum are used to evaluate the performance of the amplitude of eastward propagating CCKWs. By comparing the observations from the Global Precipitation Climate Program, CMIP6 models are classified into good and poor categories. Good models can well simulate the spectral coverage and the spatial characteristics of CCKWs, while poor models underestimate the CCKWs’ activity. Good models generally illustrate the seasonal evolution of CCKWs, with non-negligible deviations during boreal early spring. In contrast, poor models failed to reproduce the seasonal migration between the Southern and Northern hemispheres of CCKWs. Moreover, both good and poor models exhibit remarkable biases in CCKW activity over the Maritime Continent and equatorial South America. The simulation bias of CCKWs is correlated to the strength of the background precipitation rate in association with the North Pacific intertropical convergence zone. Further analysis suggests that the CCKWs simulation skill is positively correlated to the convective precipitation fraction which is related to convective parameterization schemes."

Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual."

However, thriving populations of aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in AMZs challenge this assumption and remain unexplained. Using theory and modeling, we show how periodic oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic NOB in AMZs alongside more competitive aerobic heterotrophs. Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change."

Most investment focused on reactive law enforcement—rangers, tracking dogs, access controls, and detection cameras—which helped achieve >700 poacher arrests. Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching). By contrast, reducing poacher reward through dehorning (2284 rhinos across eight reserves) achieved large (~78%) and abrupt reductions in poaching using 1.2% of the budget. Some poaching of dehorned rhinos continued because poachers targeted horn stumps and regrowth, signaling the need for regular dehorning alongside judicious use of law enforcement."

Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations inG protein–coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45)that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited Gαsto increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R+neurons caused obesity.

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures.

We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity."

The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states.

Newly available 30 m albedo retrievals derived from imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite, analyzed at 273 652 field plots monitored by the United States Forest Service, suggest that large areas of the US Inter-Mountain West’s forests have a net warming impact on the planet’s surface energy balance. For the conterminous US, the impacts of albedo offset approximately half of the recognized non-soil forest carbon storage benefit. The emerging capacity to resolve albedo evolution at the scale of a large number of inventory plots also provides unprecedented empirical evidence that albedo impacts vary strongly as a function of both tree age and species group. This research highlights a correctable source of uncertainty in operational monitoring of forest-climate interactions, and it may temper expectations for forest establishment as a means of mitigating global climate change."

In this study, we developed a 586 year regional tree-ring width chronology using standard dendrochronological techniques on Picea smithiana (Wall.) Boiss, samples collected from lower elevations in the Chara and Naltar valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. Correlation analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between tree growth and summer precipitation as well as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (p < 0.01), while a negative correlation was observed with summer temperatures. We used a linear regression model to reconstruct the summer (June–August) PDSI for the period 1431–2016 CE based on the relationship between regional chronology and climate data. This model accounted for 37.6% of the actual PDSI variation observed during the calibration period from 1956 to 2016 CE. The reconstruction identifies key hydroclimatic events, notably an extended severe drought from 1601 to 1608 (−0.87 ± 0.31), and a prolonged drought interval 1537–1549 (−0.61 ± 0.18). An extreme wet period was recorded in 1522–1533 (0.91 ± 0.32), whereas repeated decadal drought events were observed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Spatial correlation analyses demonstrate the impact of large-scale climatic drivers, such as sea surface temperature anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and underscore the significance of monsoon variability in determining regional moisture patterns. Our reconstruction, derived from the multitaper spectrum and Morlet wavelet spectrum analysis, exhibited significant periodicities of 47.9, 27, 21.8, and 2–3 years. The three periodicities likely correspond to the Pacific decadal oscillation or the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, whereas 2–3 cycles is strongly linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

Although short-term interactions between fire and vegetation are well-documented, long-term dynamics remain underexplored. This study examines fire regimes, vegetation dynamics, and its biodiversity over the past 17 000 years in southwest Tanzania, using sedimentary charcoal and pollen. Major ecological transformations of vegetation and fire regimes were recorded, with vegetation changes consistently preceded shifts in fire regimes. Increased grass pollen correlated with more frequent or larger fires, while high tree cover in Miombo woodland reduced fire activity. Interestingly, pollen evenness was a precursor to major ecological transformations as peaks preceded changes in ecosystem states. Changes in precipitation and moisture seems the major top–down drivers of these changes in vegetation and fire. Fire regimes were indirectly controlled by water availability, and vegetation exhibited resilience to fire at centennial timescales before reaching ecosystem shifts at 12 400 and 1700 cal BP. Our results emphasize the critical role of tree and grass cover in shaping fire regimes and highlight the interplay between climate, vegetation structure, and fire in East African ecosystems."

While individual climate variables like temperature, precipitation, and radiation are well-studied drivers of NEE, their interactions in multivariate contexts remain poorly understood. This study leverages the O-Information framework to disentangle the synergistic and redundant contributions of temperature, precipitation, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), terrestrial water storage, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to NEE variability. Analysing global and regional dynamics, we reveal the nature of multivariate interactions governing NEE. Globally, pairs like VPD-PAR consistently exhibit synergy, underscoring their complementary roles in driving carbon exchange, while T-VPD and T-terrestrial water storage interactions are predominantly redundant. Regional analyses highlight distinct patterns of information sharing: temperate forests and semiarid regions are synergy-dominated, whereas tropical ecosystems and Arctic regions exhibit unique spatial variability in synergy and redundancy. These findings advance our understanding of how complex climate-ecosystem interactions shape carbon fluxes and offer insights for improving predictive models of NEE under changing climatic conditions."

Urban land teleconnection approach,"Confronted by climate change, enterprises are increasingly launching afforestation initiatives to develop carbon sinks and enhance their environmental, social, and governance performance. Due to the limited availability of land in urban areas—where most corporate headquarters are located—many firms rely on rural and overseas regions to implement these projects. This phenomenon reflects a form of urban land teleconnection (ULT), a key concept in urban sustainability that emphasizes the spatial and functional linkages between urban activities and land-use changes in geographically distant areas. This study investigates ULT through the lens of corporate afforestation behavior in Taiwan. A theoretical framework, supported by empirical analysis, is developed to explain how urban-based corporations influence land use beyond their municipal boundaries. The findings indicate that corporates in urban areas, particularly those with substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, actively compensate for local land constraints by investing in afforestation in less urbanized domestic areas and abroad. Notably, Taipei City records the highest level of corporate GHG emissions in 2022, totaling 73.94 MtCO2e—equivalent to 42.4% of the total among publicly listed firms (174.39 MtCO2e). Given severe land scarcity, Taipei-based enterprises engage in afforestation activities on 256.6 hectares domestically (55% of domestic corporate afforestation) and 29 446 hectares internationally (99% of overseas afforestation). These results underscore the growing reliance of high-emission urban corporations on external land resources and highlight their critical role in reshaping regional and transboundary land-use dynamics under emerging net-zero governance frameworks."

These strategies may differ in their associated feasibility challenges, mitigation co-impacts, and ultimately their relative societal desirability. Understanding these scenario characteristics is therefore crucial when scenarios are used to inform strategic decisions. One approach to enhance this understanding is to establish scenario archetypes and select contrasting illustrative scenarios from a larger ensemble. We present a new multidimensional framework for the systematic comparison of scenarios at the global or regional level. We illustrate the framework with comparisons in seven dimensions: economic feasibility, mineral resource availability, impacts on societal resilience, near-term scenario robustness, environmental sustainability, interregional fairness, and speed of societal transformation. Using cluster analysis, the framework can be used to select a group of illustrative scenarios with contrasting scores across the dimensions. Beyond the selection of scenarios, our exploration and evaluation framework also allows the identification of gaps in the scenario space that may be of interest but are not covered by the literature. We demonstrate these use cases by applying our framework to a set of mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 1.5 °C. Our results show our framework systematically selects contrasting scenarios, with our illustrative pathways having diverging energy mixes and uses of carbon dioxide removal. Further, we highlight considerable regional differences in the distribution of indicator and dimension scores as a key area for further investigation."

This study investigates the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) in this extreme event and its impact on crop yields, using a 525-member ensemble from the HadGEM3 atmospheric model and the WOFOST agricultural model, respectively. Observational results indicate that the area-averaged surface air temperature anomaly (TAS) was 1.4 °C higher than usual, and the percentage of anomalous precipitation was nearly 33% below normal, making both metrics the most extreme since 1960. The hot event was predominantly driven by ACC, contributing about 60% to the TAS strength and increasing its likelihood 7 fold. In contrast, internal climate variability appears to have been the primary trigger of the severe drought, although ACC significantly increased its likelihood by 9 fold. When these two extreme conditions are considered together as a concurrent hot-drought event, ACC increased its probability by about 3 fold. An attribution analysis of crop yields in the area was also conducted, revealing that ACC significantly shifts the probability distribution westward and reduces yields for both the winter wheat and rapeseed. Specifically, based on the simulated 2023 crop yield results driven by ERA5 as a proxy for observations, the likelihood of achieving the yield for winter wheat would have decreased by a factors of about 2 under ACC, while that for winter rapeseed is close to 1, despite its better simulation performance in the historical context. This underscores the challenge of accurately modeling and projecting crop yields under changing climate conditions. Additional analysis emphasizes the role of land–atmosphere interactions in amplifying the hot-drought event, as early-season soil moisture deficits reduced evapotranspiration and increased sensible heat flux, thereby intensifying local temperature extremes. Overall, global warming caused by anthropogenic activities has significantly increased the frequency of extreme hot drought events in Southwestern China, posing a severe threat to agricultural productivity."

Potential future changes in the frequency or intensity of such compound flood events are therefore of utmost importance. To assess such changes, large and consistent ensembles with storm surge and hydrological models are needed, but are hardly available. Often the occurrence of compound flood events is linked to the presence of certain atmospheric circulation types. Future changes in the frequency of such patterns can be directly inferred from available climate simulations. A frequently used classification of atmospheric circulation types are the so-called ‘Großwetterlagen’ by Hess and Brezowsky. In this study, possible future changes in the occurrence of these ‘Großwetterlagen’ were analysed using data from 31 realisations of CMIP6 climate simulations for the emission scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Given the subjective nature of the classification, a deep learning ensemble for the automatic classification was developed and applied. In winter, a higher frequency of the atmospheric pattern Cyclonic Westerly towards 2100 could be inferred as a robust result among all models and scenarios. As this circulation type is potentially associated with compound flooding in some parts of the European coasts, this points towards potentially increasing risks from compound flooding in the future."

This study first introduces novel growth models grounded in the concept of accumulation phenomena, providing a new perspective while achieving a balanced integration of model accuracy and complexity. Second, by combining MaxEnt model with the growth model, we project the future dynamics of forest carbon in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), considering forest aging, climate-induced forest loss and shifts in forest compositions. Our findings reveal a consistent upward trend in total aboveground biomass (AGB), but the potential increase is limited, with AGB projected to rise by only 11.6% to 14.0% by 2080 compared to 2020. The characteristics and dominant limits of AGB potential vary across different regions of the CONUS. For instance, the West region exhibits the highest resilience to climate change, with AGB potential increasing by 37.4% to 38.3% in 2080 compared to 2020. However, the AGB potential is approaching saturation due to the aging forest structure. The Midwest region demonstrates heightened vulnerability to climate change, with AGB projected to decline nearly 22%–25% by 2080 compared to 2020. This projected decline is primarily due to the Midwest region undergoing the most severe plot loss and shifts in forest composition among all regions, with a changed plot rate of 40.7% to 47.3% in 2080.

This study presents a novel approach to constrain variability in projection simulations over Eurasia by exploiting the spatial patterns of teleconnection between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the near-surface air temperature (SAT). The constraint evaluates simulated and observed NAO-temperature teleconnection patterns during 20 year windows prior to making predictions. The resulting top ranking members are used to make predictions for the next 10 years. We find here that the constrained ensemble is skillful in predicting winter SAT on multi-annual to decadal timescales over Eurasia. We also find that the constrained multi-annual predictions yield higher correlation skill compared to both the unconstrained ensemble and the initialized predictions, especially up to 5 year mean winter SAT predictions. Therefore, we argue that for the Eurasia region, the constraint could provide skillful winter SAT predictions on multi-annual timescales with minimal cost compared to the state of the art initialized decadal climate predictions for which added value from initialization wanes quickly after the first forecast year."

This study examines the responses of heavy precipitation, represented by the maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day), over China under an idealized CDR scenario using five models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6). The results reveal an asymmetric response, indicating that China may experience more severe heavy precipitation events compared to the pre-industrial (PI, 1850–1900) period, even if CO2 concentrations are reduced to PI levels. From June to September, the increase in Rx5day across most of China relative to the PI stage is primarily driven by upward air motions and the convergence of water vapor flux. The regions with overshoot are linked to southward movement of westerly jet, as well as shifts in vertical motion. A moisture budget diagnosis demonstrates that the thermal term plays a dominant role in promoting water vapor convergence across most of China, while the dynamic term leads to water vapor divergence in specific areas. These results in corresponding increases and decreases in extreme precipitation, respectively. Specifically, water vapor advection associated with the thermal term, along with the convergence and divergence linked to the dynamic term, serves as the principal determinants influencing the distribution of water vapor changes in China from June to September. Our study highlights the need for further investigation into more effective mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of CDR."

While many studies rely on remote sensing-based ecological indices, biophysical modeling of ESs remains limited, despite its importance for guiding sustainable solar farm development and regional ecological security. This study used process-based ES models, spatiotemporal trend analysis, and the propensity score matching method to assess changes in carbon sequestration (CS), sand fixation (SF), and soil retention (SR) around the world’s largest Talatan solar farms across pre-construction, construction, and post-construction phases (2011–2020). The main results were as follows: (1) From 2011 to 2020, CS, SF, and SR within the solar farm increased by 71.1%, 81.4%, and 32.1%, respectively, indicating an overall enhancement following construction. In the post-construction phase, the increase in CS was more pronounced within the solar farms, while improvements in SF and SR were greater in the surrounding buffer zone. (2) When focusing on the solar farms’ impact, both SF and SR exhibited clear thresholds around 400–500 m during construction and post-construction phases, while CS showed spatial differentiation mainly after construction, indicating that the most pronounced positive impacts were confined within this range. (3) Environmental factor including soil moisture index and land surface temperature were found to significantly influence these trends, reflecting the changes in ESs primarily driven by water and thermal conditions. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating both temporal and spatial perspectives when assessing the ecological impacts of solar energy development, to better guide future projects towards optimizing ecosystem benefits."

Both oxypurinol and metformin enter the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in high loads, but information about their potential environmental risks remains scarce. This study systematically investigated the occurrence, emission, removal rate, and environmental risks of oxypurinol and metformin in effluents from 88 and 65 WWTPs across Australia in 2016 and 2021, respectively. Oxypurinol and metformin were frequently detected in effluents (>90%), with concentrations reaching up to 233 μg/L. The estimated per capita emissions of oxypurinol were 12 and 15 mg·day–1·capita–1, and those of metformin were 2.7 and 2.0 mg·day–1·capita–1 in 2016 and 2021, respectively. Both compounds were detected in effluents at concentrations up to 166 times above their respective PNECs. On average, dilution factors of 3.5 and 10 for metformin and 34 and 405 for oxypurinol are required for being released into river and ocean environments, respectively. During wastewater treatment, oxypurinol exhibited high persistence, with 54% of the WWTP sites showing no observed removal, whereas metformin showed an average removal rate of 88%. These findings provide valuable evidence of oxypurinol and metformin emissions and their environmental risk in Australia."

Given the impact of 6PPDQ on aquatic life in urban streams, we addressed the acute toxicity of 6PPDQ exposure on coastal cutthroat trout (CCT) (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), a species sympatric with coho salmon in natal watersheds. Using static exposures coupled with analytical chemistry, we determined the 24-h LC50 values for alevin (297.2 ng/L), swim-up fry (39.6 ng/L), 5-month parr (103.3 ng/L), and 13-month juveniles (185.9 ng/L)─values similar to toxicity observed in coho salmon. Additionally, the 96-h LC50 (77.6 ng/L) was 2.4 times more lethal for juvenile CCT. We assessed potential effects of sublethal 6PPDQ exposure on disease resistance to infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN), an endemic viral disease of Pacific salmon, and to swimming performance. Sublethal 6PPDQ (53.6 ng/L) did not affect survival of parr exposed to IHN virus compared to virus alone. Conversely, 6PPDQ exposure as low as 72.2 ng/L significantly reduced 15- and 24-month juvenile swimming performance, and 120.5 ng/L 6PPDQ increased blood hematocrit. Overall, CCT are the second most sensitive species tested to date for 6PPDQ sensitivity which further emphasizes the need for identifying alternatives to 6PPD."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain a mystery. Here, maternal mice were exposed to As via drinking water. Subsequently, the hippocampi of their offspring were collected at different developmental stages to explore the dynamic changes during hippocampal maturation and the effects of As. Time-series RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant temporal correlation between As neurodevelopmental toxicity and the mRNA expression profile of the hippocampal region during critical postnatal developmental windows. Further, downregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and telomere maintenance was observed. Notably, dynamic changes in hippocampal telomeres were observed in response to As exposure, with critically shortened telomeres inhibiting neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, impairing neuroblast maturation, and reducing the number and size of neurospheres. Additionally, the populations of BrdU+ and MAP2+ cells were decreased while GFAP+ cells were increased, indicating a decline in NSCs stemness. Furthermore, As exposure significantly impaired dendritic complexity in the hippocampus of mice, altered dendritic spine morphology, and disrupted synaptic ultrastructure, ultimately leading to cognitive impairment.

It is missing the narrow, magma‐rich morphology observed in the Main Ethiopian Rift that cuts through the Ethiopian Plateau. Instead, diffuse faulting and isolated volcanic centers are widespread over several hundred kilometers. Turkana has also experienced less magmatism over the last 30 Myr than adjacent plateaus, despite having a thin crust and residing above a mantle that is inferred to be hot and partially molten. We hypothesize that lithospheric weakening has been the key control on magma transport across the lithosphere in the Turkana Depression and subsequent rift development. Using poro‐viscoelastic–viscoplastic models of melt transport, we show that magma extraction across a thin, weakened lithosphere is slower than across a thick, elastic lithosphere. Our results suggest that pre‐rift lithospheric strength can explain the magma‐poor character of Turkana for most of its tectonic history."

Reid;Sophie Allen;Emil Tolgambayev,Sensitivity of Future Projections of Atmospheric Rivers Over Australia to the Choice of Thresholding Method,"Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow regions of strong water vapor transport in the atmosphere that can cause beneficial and hazardous hydrological impacts. One of the challenges of evaluating future AR projections is in defining future Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT) thresholds to use to identify ARs. The two main methods are to use a percentile of IVT based on the historical climate (fixed) or a percentile based on the future climate (relative). Although most global studies of future ARs use a fixed method, the choice of thresholding method can lead to different future projections. This study assesses the sensitivity of future projections (2080–2100) of AR frequency and precipitation impacts over Australia to the IVT thresholding method using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 data under a moderate (SSP245) and high (SSP585) emissions scenario. We found that both thresholding methods lead to an increase (or no change) in AR frequency but there is considerable variation in the magnitude of the projected increase in AR frequency. Both methods suggest that heavy AR‐associated precipitation will increase along with the occurrence of no rain during AR events over southeast Australia, whereas there may be a reduction in both light and heavy AR precipitation over southwest Australia. Using a fixed method leads to a drier projection for AR‐associated precipitation and identifies weaker ARs. As the driest inhabited continent, understanding future precipitation and how rain‐bearing weather systems, such as ARs, may change in a warmer climate is important for managing risk to Australia's future water availability."

However, photovoltaic (PV) plant constructions may affect regional climates by altering surface properties and the energy balance. This study applies an advanced “space‐and‐time” method combined with high‐quality satellite products to comprehensively assess the impacts of 57 PV plants for different land cover types in China. The results indicate an overall surface albedo decrease (−0.025; −10.9%) due to PV constructions, with the largest decrease in barren lands (−0.03; −12.2%) and more pronounced variation in winter. Moreover, the decreases in direct and diffuse albedo caused by PV installations are comparable. PV‐induced surface broadband emissivity (BBE) changes vary in sign, with plants in barren lands exhibiting a relatively consistent pattern (1.7 × 10−3; 0.2%). The combined effect of PV‐induced surface albedo and BBE changes contribute to surface land surface temperature (LST) variations. Daytime LST decreases more markedly (–0.36 K) with greater seasonal variation than nighttime LST (−0.07 K), dominating the daily mean LST changes (−0.23 K). Correlation analysis indicates that PV plants exhibit different cooling mechanisms during the day and night. Changes in surface ET caused by PV constructions reflect variations in vegetation, with croplands experiencing the strongest reduction (−2.13 mm/year; −1.0%), particularly in summer.

 How does the brain convert visual input into specific motor actions1,2? In Drosophila, visual projection neurons (VPNs)3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain5. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.

 Midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) signal reward-prediction errors that teach recipient circuits about expected rewards1. However, DANs are thought to provide a substrate for temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning (RL), an algorithm that learns the mean of temporally discounted expected future rewards, discarding useful information about experienced distributions of reward amounts and delays2. Here we present time–magnitude RL (TMRL), a multidimensional variant of distributional RL that learns the joint distribution of future rewards over time and magnitude. We also uncover signatures of TMRL-like computations in the activity of optogenetically identified DANs in mice during behaviour. Specifically, we show that there is significant diversity in both temporal discounting and tuning for the reward magnitude across DANs. These features allow the computation of a two-dimensional, probabilistic map of future rewards from just 450 ms of the DAN population response to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, reward-time predictions derived from this code correlate with anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that similar information is used to guide decisions about when to act. Finally, by simulating behaviour in a foraging environment, we highlight the benefits of a joint probability distribution of reward over time and magnitude in the face of dynamic reward landscapes and internal states. These findings show that rich probabilistic reward information is learnt and communicated to DANs, and suggest a simple, local-in-time extension of TD algorithms that explains how such information might be acquired and computed. An algorithm called time–magnitude reinforcement learning (TMRL) extends distributional reinforcement learning to take account of reward time and magnitude, and behavioural and neurophysiological experiments in mice suggest that midbrain dopamine neurons use TMRL-like computations."

 Building a useful photonic quantum computer requires robust techniques to synthesize optical states that can encode qubits. Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4–11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.

Here, authors demonstrate a compact photonic chip-based interleaver multiplying pulse rates of mode-locked lasers to 14 GHz, significantly enhancing microwave power and reducing phase noise. 
 Optically generated microwaves exhibit unprecedented low noise, benefiting applications such as communications, radar, instrumentation, and metrology. To date, the purest microwave signals are produced using optical frequency division with femtosecond mode-locked lasers. However, their typical repetition rates of hundreds of MHz require multiplication methods to reach the microwave domain. Here, we introduce a miniaturized photonic integrated circuit-based interleaver, achieving a 64-fold multiplication of the repetition rate from 216 MHz to 14 GHz in Ku-Band. With the interleaver, the generated microwave power was improved by 35 dB, with a phase noise floor reduced by more than 10 folds by alleviating photodetector saturation. Based on a low-loss and high-density Si3N4 waveguides, six cascaded stages of Mach-Zehnder interferometers with optical delay lines up to 33 centimeters long are fully integrated into a compact chip.

A mechanically gated transistor with nonvolatile, multi-level states shows promise for tactile-sensing applications. 
 Beyond conventional electrical modulation, flexoelectricity enables mechanical control of ferroelectric polarizations, offering a pathway for tactile-responsive ferroelectric systems. However, mechanical polarization switching typically requires substantial static threshold forces to overcome the significant energy barrier, resulting in material fatigue and slow response that compromises reliability and hinders practical applications. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing an imprint field through asymmetric electrostatic boundary design with distinct work functions. This built-in electric field stabilizes the energy landscape, effectively lowering the polarization switching barrier. Subsequently, nonvolatile polarization switching with a low threshold force of 12 nN·nm−1 is achieved in CuInP2S6 without material damage. Surpassing the limitations of slow static force controls, our work marks the first experimental demonstration of fast mechanical control of polarization switching with 4 millisecond-long low force pulses. To further highlight the potential of this rapid, low-force mechanical control, we propose a van der Waals heterostructured mechanically gated transistor with asymmetric electrostatic boundary, which exhibits gate force pulses-controlled multi-level, nonvolatile conductance states. Our findings establish a paradigm for next-generation ferroelectric electronics that integrate responsiveness to mechanical stimuli.

 Visible-light-absorbing semiconductor nanocrystals have shown great promise as photocatalysts for promoting photoredox chemistry. However, their utilization in organic synthesis remains considerably limited compared to small molecule photosensitizers. Recently, the generation of hot electrons from quantum-confined systems has emerged as a powerful means of photoreduction, yet the efficiencies remain limited under mild conditions. In this study, we present an efficient hot-electron generation system facilitated by the spin-exchange Auger process in Mn2+-doped CdS/ZnS quantum dots.

Notably, these reactions accommodate substrate reduction potentials as low as −3.4 V versus the saturated calomel electrode. Through two-photon excitation, we achieve the generation of a “super” photoreductant using visible-light irradiation power that is only 1% of that previously reported for molecular and quantum dot systems. By modulating the intensity of light output, the spin-exchange Auger process enables the on/off generation of hot electrons, allowing for programmable assembly-point cross-coupling cascades.

Using poplar and lignin model compounds, the authors demonstrate that the sequential demand for surface-bound hydrogen during hydrogenolysis creates temporal windows that allow catalytic oxidation events to take place, even within an overall hydrogen-rich, reductive environment. 
 Hydrogenolysis of lignin generates a portfolio of products, the yields of which are generally calculated using a subset of phenolic monomers that are dependent on the lignin composition, product distribution, and analytical technique. Some lignins are naturally γ-acylated; poplar lignins, for example, have p-hydroxybenzoate groups on 1–15% of their syringyl subunits. Upon hydrogenolysis, it is generally assumed that the p-hydroxybenzoate is cleaved before the deacylated lignin is depolymerized. Hydrogenolysis of model γ-p-hydroxybenzoylated β-aryl ethers do not, however, produce the deacylated β-aryl ether intermediates, as was previously conjectured; products instead derive from palladium-assisted reactions on the cinnamyl p-hydroxybenzoates resulting in initial β-ether cleavage. The p-hydroxybenzoate moiety itself also undergoes carboxylate-assisted palladium-catalyzed C–H bond activation to form the 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, that subsequently converts to the 2,4-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enoate. These details underscore previously unrecognized pathways and products that are key to understanding the different hydrogenolysis product distributions from naturally acylated lignins that are prevalent biomass-conversion feedstocks.

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with the target mRNAs to induce translational repression and mRNA degradation. Interestingly, miRNAs themselves can turnover rapidly when binding to a target RNA with extensive complementarity, a phenomenon called target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD). To date, all validated TDMD “triggers” can induce miRNA degradation reside in non-coding regions of the RNA. We found that TDMD triggers placed in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter degraded miRNAs more effectively than those in the coding sequence (CDS). Inhibiting translation of the reporter enhanced miRNA degradation by the CDS trigger, indicating that ribosome-free CDS triggers are more accessible to miRNAs. By small RNA sequencing, we explored mammalian miRNAs sensitive to global translation status. Yet, no endogenous CDS trigger could be confidently assigned to these miRNAs. Our work revealed the intricate relationship between translation and TDMD, and explains the paucity of effective TDMD triggers in the CDS.

 Intensive irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP) raises environmental concerns, yet its climate impacts remain inconsistent among current modeling studies. These inconsistencies may arise from deficiencies in existing models. To better capture irrigation impact, we employed a recently improved irrigation model tailored for the NCP, which significantly enhances simulations of crop growth and irrigation application. Results reveal that irrigation exerts competing effects on precipitation: enhancing it in May and June by increasing rainfall frequency and intensity, while suppressing it in July and August by reducing intensity. Spatial precipitation changes correlate with upper-tropospheric humidity, while inter-annual changes link to geopotential height and wind anomalies. This suggests that irrigation-induced surface cooling and moisturizing modulate atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic structures, influencing convective precipitation unevenly across regions and time, leading to complex precipitation changes.

 Subseasonal prediction of Arctic sea ice and associated atmospheric conditions during the melting season remains challenging due to limited understanding of sea ice initial conditions. This study integrates sea ice assimilation into the coupled model FGOALS-f2 using the localized error subspace transform ensemble Kalman filter, and conducts subseasonal predictions starting from August 1st over 2004–2023. Results show that simultaneous assimilation of sea ice concentration (SIC) and thickness (SIT) significantly improves sea ice predictions for up to two months, while assimilating SIC alone primarily benefits one-month lead predictions. SIT assimilation provides added predictive value for surface air temperature (SAT) forecasts beyond SIC assimilation alone, effectively extending the atmospheric influence of sea ice initial conditions to two months. This improvement in SAT predictions is primarily attributed to a more realistic representation of the surface energy budget. These findings highlight the pivotal role of summer SIT assimilation to enhance subseasonal predictions in the Arctic and challenge the conventional view that initial conditions affect only short-term forecasts. This study underscores the necessity for better representation of ice–atmosphere interactions in models and advocates for enhanced observational capabilities for summer SIT to improve subseasonal predictions in the Arctic and surrounding regions."

 Clay surfaces have been invoked as crucial components in the origin of life processes due to their ability to concentrate organics and abiotically catalyse (bio)polymer production. Still, the importance of the mutual nature of organo-clay interactions and the effects of off-world organics in this interplay is a largely unexplored realm. We demonstrate a previously unrecognised phenomenon that occurs upon the transient interaction of montmorillonite clay with the meteorite-common, non-proteinogenic γ-aminobutyric acid. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction show that an irreversible structural change is induced by the off-world species. A distinct partial clay exfoliation is correlated with the formation of nanoscale cavities in the mid-layers of the original structure, observable using transmission electron microscopy. This work demonstrates that an exogenous amino acid can alter clay and introduce 3D confined nano-environments, which may facilitate compartmentalisation in prebiotic times.

 The largest Ediacaran carbon isotope excursion (the Shuram excursion, SE) has been proposed to coincide with a transient oceanic oxygenation event. However, the mechanisms responsible for the SE and the associated oxygenation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of silicate weathering during the SE by measuring Li isotope compositions from two suites of marine carbonates in the Ediacaran Doushantuo sections. Our results reveal a pronounced negative lithium isotope excursion during the SE, which cannot be attributed to mineralogical effects and argues against a diagenetic origin for the SE. Instead, box model simulations of lithium-strontium cycles suggest a pulsed phase of enhanced congruent continental weathering during the SE. This increased weathering would have significantly elevated the input of essential nutrients into the ocean, boosting primary production, which in turn led to transient oceanic oxygenation. This process may also explain the negative δ13Ccarb excursion, as it could result from the oxidation of upwelling dissolved organic carbon in shallow seawater. Continental weathering likely played a crucial role in regulating climate, seawater chemistry, and Earth’s surface oxidation state during the SE. Pulse enhanced weathering of trans-Gondwanan super mountains during the Ediacaran Shuram carbon isotope excursion, potentially increased nutrient inputs in the ocean which resulted in transient oceanic oxygenation, according to dynamic box modeling, geochemistry data, and Li isotope composition analysis of carbonate Ediacaran sections in south China."

 The Scanning Microwave Spectrometer (SCAMS) onboard the NIMBUS-6 satellite operated between 15 June 1975 and 1 June 1976. Its primary mission objective was to map tropospheric temperature profiles for improving weather predictions, measuring Brightness Temperature(s) (TBs) at five different frequencies (22.235, 31.65, 52.85, 53.85 and 55.45 GHz). However, the top-of-the-atmosphere emission measured at the 22.235 and the 31.65 GHz radiometer channels on the satellite are dominated by surface emission over polar open water and sea ice and can therefore be used for mapping sea ice concentration (SIC) on large scale (∼100 km).Here we present a SIC and ice type data set, which is based on the TB observations of the two lowest frequencies of SCAMS (center frequencies at 22.235 & 31.65 GHz). While the SCAMS channels do not completely align with the usual frequencies for sea ice retrievals (19, 22 and 37 GHz) in modern processing methods, it is still possible to apply modern techniques to reduce noise in the data. The SIC dataset provides important insights into the sea ice concentration, extent and type of the mid 1970s, where other satellite datasets e.g. the NIMBUS-5 ESMR have gaps and irregular coverage. The SCAMS data has been processed following modern methods, including a regional noise reduction over open water using a simple radiative transfer model, land-spillover corrections and estimation of uncertainties, as well as dynamical tie-points to calibrate the algorithm. The data set has been resampled into daily files with EUMETSAT’s OSI-SAF and ESA CCI compatible daily grids and land masks, for easier comparison with other data sets, such as the modern multi-frequency period starting with NIMBUS-7 SMMR in October 1978 to present and the 1972–1977 period covered by the NIMBUS-5 ESMR with some interruptions. The SCAMS TBs were processed with a hybrid SIC algorithm, combining a one and a two-channel algorithm over open water and ice respectively.We find that the SIC calculated by the two-channel algorithm has more noise over water and low SIC areas than the single-channel algorithm. However, the two-channel algorithm does not systematically underestimate SIC in regions covered by Multi Year Ice (MYI) as the single channel algorithm does. A classification of sea ice types for First Year Ice (FYI) and MYI in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) proved successful, while it was also possible to identify two surface types A and B for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, with different radiometric signatures.A comparison of monthly mean sea ice extent (SIE) with the NIMBUS-5 ESMR showed good alignment in the both hemispheres, where the SCAMS SIE is larger by 386 676 km2 and 251 304 km2 on average in the NH and SH, respectively. SCAMS fills a gap in the N5ESMR record including the Arctic SIE minimum and the Antarctic maximum in 1975."

 To assimilate passive microwave data in numerical weather prediction, a comprehensive understanding of the components of the radiative transfer equation is essential. Given the significant variability of emissivity in snow-covered regions — affected by frequency, polarisation, and the macro- and microstructural properties of snow — attention must be paid to the design of a forward model. However, existing physical models are unsuitable for global-scale studies due to their reliance on numerous inputs, such as snow grain size across different layers, which are typically unavailable at larger scales. In this study, we propose a method that utilises geophysical properties accessible at the continental scale to derive accurate emissivity values for frequencies ranging from 1 GHz to 90 GHz, in both vertical and horizontal polarisations, with a focus on the incident angles of conical scanners (approximately 50°). Our approach employs neural networks to obtain a robust forward model using geophysical variables as input data. A training dataset was developed based on satellite-derived surface emissivity from the SMOS and AMSR2 instruments by subtracting atmospheric components and surface temperature modulation. The results, which accounts for the actual geophysical state of the surface and its temporal variability, outperform the emissivity climatologies. We achieved snow-covered surface emissivities at the continental scale with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 and a RMSE below 0.02 for frequencies up to 18.7 GHz, and around 0.03 for higher frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in a typical tundra snowpack where the macro- and microstructural properties of snow can be obtained, the emissivities retrieved by our neural network-based forward model are consistent with results from the physical model (SMRT). This proposed model will also support preparations for the CIMR mission."

 Imaging spectroscopy has become a pivotal technique for estimating plant traits at the canopy scale. Accurate trait prediction is critical for biodiversity conservation, yet research on canopy traits in heterogeneous wetlands with complex species mixtures remains scarce. While the Community-Weighted Mean (CWM) method has been widely used for upscaling leaf traits to the canopy level, it often suffers from low model precision, and the suitability of alternative upscaling methods for predicting canopy mean traits using imaging spectroscopy remains uncertain. This study proposed a novel approach for calculating canopy mean traits using the geometric mean method and compared its performance to that of the CWM methods in combination with three modeling algorithms Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest regression (RF), and Support Vector Machine regression (SVM). The accuracy was evaluated by exploring the predictive ability for nine canopy mean traits by using high spatial resolution UAV multispectral data. The analysis focuses on a wetland ecosystem characterized by high species diversity and hydrological variability, where precise plant trait estimation is essential for ecological process modeling. The results demonstrated that the geometric mean method yielded the highest validation accuracy for most canopy mean traits when paired with the SVM model (e.g., R2 for N = 0.64, SLA = 0.38, and cellulose = 0.33). Notably, the geometric mean method, combined with UAV multispectral data, significantly enhanced the predictive performance for N, surpassing even that of hyperspectral data. This study underscores the potential of the geometric mean method for upscaling leaf traits to canopy traits. These findings contribute to advancing the prediction accuracy of plant functional traits through remote sensing techniques, while future studies may explore the integration of deep learning methods."

 The coastal region of Alexandria Governorate in Egypt holds significant strategic importance for trade while being susceptible to extreme weather events. It confronts a dual challenge of the rising sea levels and, as found in this study, land instability. While much attention has been rightly directed towards sea level rise (SLR), the stability of the land warrants equal consideration. Here, a comprehensive analysis of land stability is conducted in Alexandria by measuring Line of Sight (LOS) displacements and assessing their topographical, hydrological, and coastal impacts. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry technique is used to measure the LOS displacements in association with land cover classification and elevation data. Moreover, in the absence of a recent, openly accessible Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with satisfactory resolution, we developed a novel approach to update DEM using the Small Baseline Subset method. This approach enabled us to generate a projected DEM for the year 2040, facilitating the creation of a stream network based on this “future DEM”. Our observations revealed displacements ranging from −14.0 to 6.7 mm/year, predominantly occurring in low-lying and built-up areas, suggesting anthropogenic activities as a likely cause. The current and future stream networks show stream shifting and widening. Stream shifting indicates dynamic changes in topography and hydrological conditions, while stream widening suggests alterations in the hydrological network due to increased urban runoff or changes in the natural watershed. Furthermore, we found that sea surface temperature and SLR are projected to increase until the end of the century in the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria. This escalation raises the likelihood of intensified tropical-like hurricane events in the region, commonly referred to as “medicanes”. The importance of this research is in offering a framework for comprehensive land stability assessments, along with demonstrating the scalability of the applied methodologies, including our distinct approach to generating both current and projected DEM."

 Due to its complex topography, the Lake Titicaca region, located in the southern tropical Andes, presents great challenges for atmospheric modeling. This study aims to improve the representation of precipitation and air surface temperature using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at high spatial resolution (2 km), during the austral summer of 2020. We conducted 11 experiments with different configurations of topography, land use, physical parameterizations, and lake surface temperature (LST). Each experiment was evaluated considering in-situ data from the Peruvian-Bolivian region and gridded precipitation products.For precipitation, the best configuration, with an average bias close to zero mm, includes using the GMTED2010 topography (not smoothed) and the land use data of Eva et al. (2004), along with the Purdue Lin microphysics and the Grell 3D cumulus scheme. For air temperature, the best configuration, which showed an average underestimation between 0 and − 0.5 °C, included the same topography and land use, along with the parameterization of the SENAMHI Operational Model (SOM), including the WRF Single Moment 3 microphysics and the Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme.In the last experiment, the sea surface temperature (SST) was updated, resulting in an average LST increase of +1.8 °C over Lake Titicaca. This resulted in an increase in the precipitation bias (82.2 %) due to increased evaporation and convection over the lake and decreased southwestward moisture transport. These results highlight the sensitivity of the WRF model to parameterization choices and SST forcing data, emphasizing the importance of any changes in these variables."

 The decreasing magnitude of the equatorial Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the lower stratosphere has been found in observational and modelling evidence across various pressure levels. However, the origin of the QBO amplitude weakening is still not well understood, and the possible relationship between the QBO amplitude weakening and the tropical oceanic warming is seldom investigated in literature. Using the QBO and ocean surface temperature (SST) observations, this study qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes the possible relationship between synchronous SST warming across tropical oceans and the QBO weakening. As the tropical oceans warm synchronously, the QBO magnitude increases in the middle stratosphere and decreases in the lower stratosphere. Based on the continuous wavelet transform analysis, it is revealed that the QBO amplitude shows distinctive features on multiple timescales, while the main period characteristics of the QBO are relatively stable among various QBO datasets. The cross-wavelet analysis and lead-lag correlation analysis for the QBO amplitude and SSTs in different tropical oceans confirms the coupling between them. The correlation between tropical SST and QBO amplitude varies on different timescales. The modification of QBO amplitude by the tropical SSTs is more significant on longer timescales of more than 8 years than on the interannual timescales. The correlation between the tropical Western Pacific–Indian Ocean SSTs and QBO magnitude is much larger than that for the tropical Atlantic–Eastern Pacific Ocean SSTs. The trend analysis of tropical deep convection and Brewer-Dobson circulation verifies the interdecadal modulation of QBO amplitude by the tropical SSTs."

We report that the antimicrobial activity of chemokines is defined by their ability to bind phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, two anionic phospholipids commonly found in the bacterial plasma membrane. We show that only chemokines able to bind these two phospholipids kill bacteria and that they exert rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects with a higher potency than the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3. Both biochemical and genetic interference with the chemokine-cardiolipin interaction impaired microbial growth arrest, bacterial killing, and membrane disruption by chemokines. Moreover, unlike conventional antibiotics,Escherichia colifailed to develop resistance when placed under increasing antimicrobial chemokine pressure in vitro. Thus, we have identified cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol as binding partners for chemokines responsible for chemokine antimicrobial action."

Alavian,Reduced DJ-1-F1Fo ATP synthase association correlates with midbrain dopaminergic neuron vulnerability in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease,"Disruption in neuronal and synaptic metabolic homeostasis is a key driver of neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mitochondrial activity, biomass, and efficiency are critical to this balance. While activity and biomass are well characterized in PD pathology, mitochondrial metabolic efficiency remains insufficiently explored. Our previous studies showed that the protein product of PD-associated gene DJ-1 modulates metabolic efficiency through its interaction with the F1Fo-ATP-synthase β subunit (β-sub). Here, using proximity ligation assay (PLA), we compared mitochondrial DJ-1-β-sub association in distinct mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neuronal subpopulations and their intracellular compartments of PD and control postmortem brains. In PD brains, DJ-1-β-sub-PLA was lower than control in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) somata and neurites but unchanged in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. In PD and control cases, the PLA signal was reduced in distal neurites of SNpc compared to VTA neurons. These intracellular and region-specific differences suggest that impaired mitochondrial efficiency may contribute to the differential vulnerability of mesDA neurons in PD."

Viroporins constitute a growing group of virus-encoded transmembrane oligomeric proteins that allow passage of small molecules across the membrane. Despite sparsity in viroporin structures, recent work has revealed diversity in both the number of transmembrane helices and oligomeric states. Here, we provide evidence that the small hydrophobic protein (SH) from mumps virus is a pentameric viroporin. From extensive biophysical data, a HADDOCK model of full-length SH shows its intracellular C-terminal region to form an extended structure crucial to stabilization of the pentamer. Heterologous expression of wild-type SH and variants inXenopus laevisoocytes reveals the viroporin as a chloride channel, with transport facilitated by conserved hydroxyl-carrying residues lining the pore. The channel function of SH is inhibited by the small-molecule BIT225, highlighting the potential for antiviral targeting through SH."

Here, we report a small luminescent molecule, TPA2PyPh, as a potent antibacterial agent and its potential for lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer strategy in treating bacterial sepsis. Engineered macrophages, created by directly incubating TPA2PyPh with macrophages, enabled the luminogen to precisely bind to intracellular lipid droplets. Upon engulfment of bacteria, these TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages use natural lipid uptake mechanisms to deliver the luminogen to intracellular bacteria, disrupting their membranes and inserting into the bacterial DNA, thereby inducing bacterial elimination. Our findings show that the adoptive transfer of TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages substantially diminishes bacterial burden in septic mice and substantially reduces mortality rates. This study demonstrates the potential of TPA2PyPh as an effective antibacterial agent and supports the use of adoptive lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer as an effective approach for treating sepsis and managing severe infectious diseases."

During development, guided by alveolar bone–derived PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor, B polypeptide),Cd24a+/Pax9+cells gradually concentrated on the apical region during the crown-to-root transition, collectively migrated and formed dental root. Cell ablation and conditional Wnt knockout notably compromised tooth establishment. Single-cell RNA sequencing, CUT&Tag, and spatial mapping further revealed distinct features ofCd24a+/Pax9+cells and their cellular organization. Last, theCD24+/PAX9+core was also present in human teeth, suggesting it as a conserved developmental program.

Our investigation of Syx17 function inDrosophilanephrocytes and salivary gland cells revealed unexpected effects. We find that Syx17 loss induces the formation of autophagosome-lysosome clusters in a HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting)–dependent manner, entrapping this tether, autophagosomes, and lysosomes. While locked in clusters, these organelles cannot participate in other vesicle fusions, impeding endosomal progression and autophagosome secretion. Therefore, the absence of Syx17 not only inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion but also prevents HOPS release from autophagosome-lysosome tethering sites causing a “tethering lock.” Preventing autophagosome formation or removing the HOPS adaptor Plekhm1 (pleckstrin homology domain–containing family M member 1) leads to release of HOPS and lysosomes from these clusters, thus rescuing secondary effects of Syx17 loss.

Anthracene and phenanthrene were detected isomer-selectively using photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves and mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra. While phenanthrene is produced through a radical-radical recombination of the carbon-centered radicals, anthracene may plausibly be formed through an unconventional radical addition to a low spin-density fluorenyl carbon.

A notable mechanism of this nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here, we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon- and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation.

Here, we propose a strategy for synthesizing functionalized Ga-based HEOs (GHEOs) at a low temperature (400°C) by the Ga integration mechanism. The negative mixing enthalpy between Ga and other metals reduces the Gibbs free energy, enabling the creation of homogeneous GHEOs through a hydrothermal process at a lower temperature. The Ga integration mechanism is supported by thermodynamic and density functional theory analyses. In particular, the perovskite, spinel, and rock salt crystal can be precisely tuned by choosing metal ions, enabling tailored applications in electrocatalysis, energy-saving materials, and methane sensors.

The continuous transformation pathway of a-DG is characterized by distinctive heterogeneous microstructural evolutions across a wide density range. We observed anomalous thermal conductivities in a-DG, which initially decrease and then increase with the density and sp3/sp2ratio, deviating markedly from previously reported trends. This anomaly originates from changes in phonon mean free path and phonon lifetime at the medium-frequency range (7 to 30 terahertz), dictated by the unique two-stage microtopological transition.

Bulk tissueδ13C andδ15N analysis showed that fishes in kelp forests had larger trophic niches and greater interspecific niche separation than fishes on turf reefs. Moreover,δ13C analysis of essential amino acids revealed that kelp-derived energy accounted for most of the energy used by kelp forest fishes (> 50% on average), whereas fishes on turf reefs compensated for kelp decline via greater reliance on a phytoplankton-based energy channel.

This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum-mechanical benchmark calculations and applied to three prototypical light-harvesting complexes. For light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the inter-ring transfer is 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than in the classical treatment. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, the transfer rate is the same in both cases, whereas for light-harvesting complex II of spinach, the transfer is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment.

Loading single atoms is known to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, as their activity is heavily influenced by the microenvironment. Therefore, achieving precise control over the microenvironment of single atoms is crucial but remains a substantial challenge. Here, we reported a unique Pt–C/TiO2photocatalyst with Pt quantum dots (PtQD) and C-coordinated Pt single atoms (PtSA). Under the given experimental conditions, the hydrogen production rate reaches 43.2 mmol hour−1with 70 mg of the photocatalyst. Notably, the hydrogen molecules generated per incident photon (H2/photon) reach 0.92. The special coordination environment influenced by C not only provides a direct transmission channel for photogenerated electrons but also activates surrounding Ti, thus improving the separation of the electron-hole pairs and H2production performance.

Sex differences in AVS progression depend on valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activating to myofibroblasts that drive aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling. To date, no treatment strategies have leveraged cellular sex differences to determine drug combinations that target VIC myofibroblast activation.

We use global reanalysis data to provide evidence that the oscillation period is primarily modulated by seasonal variations in small-scale atmospheric wave activity. The findings have implications for seasonal and climate predictions. 
 The tropical stratosphere is characterized by a periodic oscillation of wind direction between westerly and easterly, known as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which modulates middle atmospheric circulations and surface climate on interannual timescales. The oscillation period fluctuates irregularly, ranging from 20 to 35 months. The causes of this fluctuation have long been hypothesized but lack observational evidence. This study shows that the period fluctuation is primarily driven by variability in small-scale wave (gravity wave) activity with an additional contribution from variability in tropical upwelling. Using an atmospheric reanalysis dataset, we capture temporal variations in small-scale wave activity that are coherent with the varying speed of the oscillation. This wave activity variation stems from the seasonality of tropical convection and tropopause layer wind, revealing their fundamental role in modulating the quasi-biennial period. Our findings suggest that better representing these multiscale interactions in models can enhance the accuracy of seasonal forecasts and the reliability of future climate projections."

Under high-water-activity conditions, experimental measurements and model predictions show no change when NaCl cosolute is replaced with sea salt. Model predictions show that total surfactant concentrations in the range of tens to hundreds of millimolar are required to lower the surface tension of accumulation-mode aerosol. 
 Sea spray is the largest contributor to atmospheric aerosol by mass and contains mixtures of inorganic salts and organics. The chemically complex organic fraction can contain soluble, highly surface-active organics, and field studies commonly identify ionic surfactants in aerosol samples. In macroscopic solutions, divalent cations present in sea spray can alter the partitioning of ionic surfactants. Furthermore, the high surface area-to-volume (SA / V) ratio of aerosol droplets may lead to depletion of surfactant from the bulk, requiring more surfactant, relative to its volume, to lower the surface tension of a droplet compared to a macroscopic solution. Here, we investigate the partitioning of model ionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate, an anionic surfactant, and cetrimonium bromide, a cationic surfactant) in 6–10 µm radius droplets containing glutaric acid, NaCl, or sea spray mimic cosolutes. Surface tension measurements are compared to two independent partitioning models accounting for the SA / V ratio of the droplets. Salting out of the ionic surfactants leads to strong bulk depletion in 6–10 µm radius droplets, with no observable difference in droplet surface tension between NaCl and sea spray mimic cosolutes. The total ionic surfactant concentration required to reach the minimum surface tension for these droplets was 2.0 ± 0.5 mM, consistent with previous observations in droplets containing strong surfactants. Modeling results suggest that surfactant concentrations on the order of tens to hundreds of millimolar are required to significantly reduce surface tension in 100 nm droplets.

Testing both traditional and more recent convolutional neural networks (deep learning), we find that relatively small deep networks performed best, particularly for uncommon classes, because they extract richer features. Our results indicate that such compact models are sufficient for classifying small grayscale plankton images. 
 Plankton imaging devices produce vast datasets, the processing of which can be largely accelerated through machine learning. This is a challenging task due to the diversity of plankton, the prevalence of non-biological classes, and the rarity of many classes. Most existing studies rely on small, unpublished datasets that often lack realism in size, class diversity and proportions. We therefore also lack a systematic, realistic benchmark of plankton image classification approaches. To address this gap, we leverage both existing and newly published, large, and realistic plankton imaging datasets from widely used instruments. We evaluate different classification approaches: a classical Random Forest classifier applied to handcrafted features, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of both. This work aims to provide reference datasets, baseline results, and insights to guide future endeavors in plankton image classification. Overall, CNN outperformed the classical approach but only significantly for uncommon classes. Larger CNN, which should provide richer features, did not perform better than small ones; and features of small ones could even be further compressed without affecting classification performance. Finally, we highlight that the nature of the classifier is of little importance compared to the content of the features. Our findings suggest that small CNNs are sufficient to extract relevant information to classify small grayscale plankton images. This has consequences for operational classification models, which can afford to be small and quick. On the other hand, this opens the possibility for further development of the imaging systems to provide larger and richer images."

In this study, we used 238U, 235U, and 232Th decay series to investigate U and radiogenic lead (Pb*) behavior within individual U-phosphate minerals in a wetland affected by past U-mining activities. Three groups of U-phosphates were identified using SEM-EDXS based on their U, Ca, and P contents: ningyoite-like minerals (CaUIV(PO4)2·2H2O), near-ideal Ca-autunites (Ca(UVIO2)2(PO4)2·11H2O), and Ca-depleted autunite/chernikovite-like minerals ((H3O)(UVIO2)(PO4)·3H2O). NanoSIMS analysis of (230Th/238U) activity ratios revealed substantial U losses from the ningyoite-like minerals, particularly those located in the upstream vadose zone of the wetland, likely due to their oxidative dissolution under hydrological fluctuations. In contrast, the Ca-autunites and Ca-depleted autunite/chernikovite-like minerals exhibited (230Th/238U) signatures indicative of U accumulation. This behavior, more pronounced in the vadose zone, was interpreted as various stages of dissolution–precipitation that may have occurred upon early weathering of the U-ore and/or in the wetland. Finally, 206Pb*/238U ratios and Pb zoning within the U-grains revealed Pb losses, likely due to Pb diffusion in the mineral structure. Overall, this study demonstrates the relevance of NanoSIMS to investigate U and Pb mobility within microsized U-bearing minerals in contaminated environments."

When deployed as a fixed-bed reactor, the engineered catalyst demonstrates unprecedented operational stability, maintaining >99% contaminant removal efficiency during 21-day operation (flow rate: ∼8000 L h–1 m–2; hydraulic retention time: 37.3 s). Scalability analysis reveals a remarkable monthly processing capacity of 18,086 tons at an operational cost of 1.25 CNY/ton─representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to conventional industrial systems (30–60 CNY/ton). The high conductivity, stability, and adaptability complements its excellent performance, and the method can also be extended to other metals (e.g., Fe, Co) with similarly low energy requirements.

Here, we conducted controlled incubation of river water amended with DOM extracted from wildfire-affected versus undisturbed soils to assess molecular DOM transformations and microbial responses. High-resolution mass spectrometry and substrate-explicit modeling revealed that pyDOM introduction increased refractory components (e.g., condensed aromatics and tannins) with high modified aromaticity index (AImod) and double bond equivalents (DBE). Reactomics analysis revealed that pyDOM exhibited enhanced reactivity which may be associated with alterations in macromolecular electron shuttles and water solubility. While pyDOM introduction reduced overall riverine microbial diversity and abundance, it triggered a 17-fold increase of filamentous cyanobacteria abundance, simultaneously boosting both autotrophic capabilities and the functional abundance related to nitrogen metabolism in riverine microorganisms. Genomic evidence from PICRUSt2 analysis demonstrated pyDOM-driven enrichment of denitrification pathways, particularly through upregulation of periplasmic nitrate reductase components (napA + 3.0-fold; napB + 3.1-fold), suggesting enhanced aerobic denitrification capacity.

However, its effects on gypsum and silica scaling, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain poorly understood. This study systematically investigates the effects of EMF treatment on gypsum and silica scaling in RO systems, utilizing synthetic brackish water and natural RO concentrate (ROC) from a desalination facility. For gypsum, EMF changes the crystal morphology, resulting in the formation of a porous, less compact scaling layer. It is more readily removed through hydraulic flushing (HF), enhancing scaling reversibility and water recovery. In the case of silica scaling, EMF promotes homogeneous polymerization in the bulk solution, producing larger silica particles that inhibit the formation of a dense, cross-linked gel layer on the membrane surface, mitigating flux decline. This study thus demonstrates EMF’s effectiveness in controlling gypsum scaling in undersaturated feedwaters when combined with HF and in mitigating silica scaling under both HF and non-HF conditions for supersaturated feedwaters. These findings underscore EMF’s versatility as a nonchemical approach for scale control in RO desalination and show its substantial potential to enhance membrane performance and operational efficiency in real-world water treatment applications."

The Lakes are highly efficient at bioaccumulating methylmercury, making the fish excellent sentinels for tracking shifts in atmospheric Hg deposition. Invasive mussels have altered biogeochemical processes, prey populations and fish dietary strategies asynchronously and to varied extents across the lower four lakes, impacting fish Hg exposure. To test if fish are adapting to new biogeochemical conditions, we analyzed a 40 year fish archive for carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios and amino acid-specific nitrogen isotope ratios. To assess Hg sources, we measured Hg isotope ratios. We reconstructed and compared energetic pathways that impact fish Hg concentrations to Hg-source trends. We found fish-Hg concentrations are declining but not monotonically due to ecological disturbances. Fish-Hg isotope values, unimpacted by ecological disturbance, confirm that sources of bioaccumulated Hg shift contemporaneously with changes in atmospheric Hg concentrations. Across Lakes, the degree of responsiveness to changes in atmospheric Hg concentrations mirrors the proportion of atmospheric-delivered Hg we previously modeled. Changes in both fish concentrations and fish isotope values outpace paleolimnetic reconstructions suggesting declines in atmospheric Hg concentrations impact fish Hg more than sediment."

Various HMs exerted different influences on Fe(II) oxidation, which were attributed to their intrinsic properties, such as hydrolysis constant, ionic charge, and radius. Specifically, Cu(II) or Cr(III) accelerated Fe(II) oxidation and facilitated the formation of poorly crystalline Fe oxides, with the rate of acceleration depending on their concentrations, whereas Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) showed negligible effects. Meanwhile, the sequestration efficiency of HMs followed the trend of Cr(III) > Zn(II) > Cu(II) > Co(II) > Ni(II) > Mn(II).

To better understand these dynamics, we developed a 20-year data set of phytoplankton biomass (aph(443)) using MODIS satellite data. Our analysis shows a 23.8% decline in biomass over two decades, with the most significant reductions in spring, summer, and autumn. This decline is linked to warming sea surface temperatures (SST), which limit nutrient availability by enhancing ocean stratification. In contrast, winter warming was associated with a slight increase in biomass. Using machine learning, we identified SST as the dominant driver, explaining up to 65% of the seasonal trend. These findings offer valuable insights into the complex interactions between temperature, nutrients, and phytoplankton growth, informing coastal ecosystem management under climate change."

A Consequential LCA and Scenario Discovery Approach,"At the crossroads of climate change and land competition, agrivoltaic systems (AVS) propose a land-sharing synergy between photovoltaic (PV) electricity and crop production or animal husbandry. By partially covering crops with PV panels, AVS can enhance food production by maintaining favorable microclimatic conditions and can constitute a promising adaptation to climate change. However, the AVS electric and crop production performances vary extensively across crop types, climates, panel orientations, etc. While the few existing life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies evaluating AVS’s environmental performance cover a minor part of this diversity of configurations, a planned deployment policy for AVS requires extensive knowledge on the configurations that may or may not environmentally outperform conventional alternatives, i.e., conventional PV electric and crop productions. To identify these configurations, we built a parametrized consequential LCA model that simulates an AVS driven by either electricity demand or crop demand. We then applied a scenario discovery algorithm over stochastic AVS configurations to identify groups of AVS configurations that perform better or worse than their conventional counterparts. By parametrizing the technological and agronomical contexts, the interactions between PV and crop productions, and the electricity and land markets, we provide insights regarding how AVS should be designed, promoted, or discouraged."

In this work, we explore the optimal compatibility between catalysts, with metal oxides and carbon materials as examples, and oxidants with peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate (PMS and PDS) as representatives. Metal oxides catalyze PMS effectively and exhibit an efficiency 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than when catalyzing PDS. Conversely, carbon materials catalyze PDS much more effectively, with an efficiency 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than when catalyzing PMS. The scientific mechanism behind such a compatibility is found to be attributed to the polarity-based matching effect between valence bonds on the catalyst surface and the oxidant molecules, following the polarity principle of “similarity-intermiscibility” theory. Composite materials containing metal and carbon prepared according to this mechanism demonstrate robust performance for both PMS and PDS, consistent with the predictions and validating the rationality and expandability of the compatibility principle.

This analysis evaluated around 50 estimates of anthropogenic methane emissions in the U.S. and China across all major sectors to identify areas of uncertainty and highlight opportunities for cross‐country collaboration. Shared sources of emissions with large variation in estimates and limited sector and region‐specific analyses include waste and livestock emissions, as well as abandoned fossil production sites (coal mines and oil wells), which present opportunities for knowledge sharing and joint leadership.

 Understanding waterline variability at seasonal to interannual timescales is crucial for predicting coastal responses to climate forcing. However, relationships between large-scale climate variability and coastal morphodynamics remain underexplored beyond intensively monitored sites. This study leverages a newly developed 25-year (1997–2022) satellite-derived waterline dataset along the North American West Coast. Our results reveal distinct latitudinal patterns in seasonal waterline change, with excursions exceeding 25 m in the Pacific Northwest, decreasing to less than 10 m in Southern California and farther south. Waterline fluctuations strongly follow wave power in the Pacific Northwest (R = −0.78), northern California (R = −0.75), and Baja California (R = −0.62), while Baja California Sur aligns more with sea-level variations (R = −0.42). Interannually, waterline change exhibits latitudinal dependence: south of southern California, variability is low, with major erosion confined to strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, while northern regions show mixed responses. ENSO-driven storm track shifts modulate winter wave climate, resulting in enhanced (attenuated) erosion from southern California to Baja California Sur during El Niño (La Niña). However, further north, ENSO impacts are less consistent, reflecting a complex interplay of storm track displacement and intensification. These findings highlight the spatial complexity of ENSO-driven morphodynamics and provide a framework for assessing climate-induced coastal vulnerability.

 Scoria cones are the most abundant type of volcano in the Solar System. They occur in every tectonic setting and often overlap with human populations, yet our ability to provide complete geochronology within volcanic fields remains limited. Appropriate geochronology underpins the reconstruction of size-frequency distribution and is a key input for robust volcanic hazard assessment. Morphometric data have long been used to estimate relative ages of scoria cones; however, they have only shown promise at single volcanic fields and simple cones with homogenous pyroclastics. Here, we present a new global inventory of dated scoria cones (n = 572) from 71 volcanic fields formed under diverse magmatic, tectonic and climatic regimes, and build data-driven age models for dating scoria cones using easily accessible morphometric, reflectance and climatic variables.

 Intermittently closed estuaries provide important ecosystem services but are often overlooked in coastal and catchment research and management. These estuaries are highly vulnerable to human and climate disturbances due to their episodic closure to the ocean, yet remain understudied. This study maps 2245 intermittent estuaries globally, whose catchments currently support 55 million people, with projections of up to 101 million by 2100. Analysis of three decades of scholarly literature revealed that only 7% of these estuaries have been studied. Research on intermittent estuaries comprises 0.5% of all estuarine literature, despite representing 4–5% of estuaries globally. Major research gaps exist in Asia, South America, and Africa—regions with large, vulnerable populations. Over 90% of research on intermittent estuaries is conducted in (southern) Africa, Oceania, and North America, with most studies focusing on local physico-chemical and eco-hydro-geomorphological processes.

 How microcontinents successively migrated from Gondwana to Eurasia is paramount in understanding the Mesozoic evolution of the Tethys Ocean. The rifting and collision events and their potential spatio-temporal relationship may play a key role in this evolution. We compiled available Permian-Jurassic paleomagnetic data from the Lhasa terrane, revealing that it drifted away from Gondwana ~210 million years ago, which is ~10 million years earlier than the South-North Qiangtang collision. Similarly, the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision preceded the rifting of India by ~10 million years. These age gaps of similar kinematic circuits align well with the time required for collision-induced subduction transference, whereby a new subduction zone forms outboard of the newly accreted terrane. Then, the slab-pull force can be transmitted to the southern segment of the younger Tethys slab by coupling across the oceanic ridge/transform system, such that subduction transference drives the in-sequence one-way convergence of microcontinents with Eurasia.

 The fossil record shows a prominent 60 million-year biodiversity cycle during the Phanerozoic Eon, the origin of which is still unknown. Here we use time-series analysis and correlation of empirical and model datasets of Earth’s interior and surficial processes to demonstrate that this cycle is a pervasive feature in marine animal genus-level diversity data that dominates in the Paleozoic Era. Our results suggest that extinctions are likely the primary driver of this observed cyclicity. We detected a correlatable 60 million-year cyclicity in global tectonics, and in marine 87Sr/86Sr and δ34S isotopes, all of which are dominant in the Paleozoic. We conclude that continental weathering driven by global tectonic degassing and building of continental arcs may have in turn controlled paleo-seawater redox cycling during the Paleozoic when oceans were likely less saturated with respect to oxygen. In particular, we suggest that the 60 million-year fluctuations in biotic diversity are responses of shallow marine habitats to the combined effects of continental weathering and redox cycling, under global tectonic control.

 The snow and glaciers of the Peruvian Andes provide vital water supplies in a region facing water scarcity and substantial glacier change. However, there remains a lack of understanding of snow processes and quantification of the contribution of melt to runoff. Here we apply a distributed glacio-hydrological model over the Rio Santa basin to disentangle the role of the cryosphere in the Andean water cycle. Only at the highest elevations (>5000 m a.s.l.) is the snow cover continuous; at lower elevations, the snowpack is thin and ephemeral, with rapid cycles of snowfall and melt. Due to the large catchment area affected by ephemeral snow, its contribution to catchment inputs is substantial (23% and 38% in the wet and dry season, respectively). Ice melt is crucial in the mid-dry season (up to 44% of inputs). Our results improve estimates of water fluxes and call for further process-based modelling across the Andes.

 Under optimal growth conditions, net primary productivity (NPP) is a product of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (Ipar) and maximum radiation use efficiency (RUEmax; conversion of Ipar to biomass). The objective of this study was to improve and validate the RUEmax-based Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) for the determination of grassland NPP by canopy multispectral reflectance collected at field (handheld sensor) and airborne (UAV) scale considering environmental constraints. The analysis was based on multi-year field experiments on sandy loam soil in Denmark, measured shoot and estimated root biomass to calculate NPP, long-term meteorological data, and daily NPP estimated from CO2 flux chamber measurements for deriving environmental constraints.The results derived from CO2 flux data showed that NPP and plant respiration were higher in the middle of the season before the second harvest when temperature was also high. The daily maximum air temperature optimal for grass biomass production was 16.5 °C. The improved CASA model built in this study was accurate for modeling NPP at both daily (nRMSE decrease of 9 %) and seasonal (nRMSE decrease of 8–34 %) scales when considering the best environmental constraints such as maximum air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, cloudiness, and water stress, compared to no constraints. Maximum air temperature and water stress were the most important environmental constraints to the grass RUEmax. Seasonal RUEmax for modeling NPP after considering best environmental constraints was 1.9–2.7 g C MJ−1 for ryegrass and 1.9–2.2 g C MJ−1 for grass-legume mixture using the two remote sensors for measuring spectral reflectance. Over the whole growing season, tall fescue (3.1 g C MJ−1) and festulolium (2.9 g C MJ−1) obtained higher RUEmax than perennial ryegrass (2.3 g C MJ−1).This study highlights the practical implications of using the CASA model improved by maximum temperature and water stress functions for real-time, remote sensing-based assessments of grassland productivity."

 Accurate and reliable ship target detection is of great significance for the sustainable development goals of ocean management. With the development of remote sensing technology, satellite imagery provides strong support for space-based tiny ship detection. However, remote sensing images have complex backgrounds, and it is challenging to separate and locate different numbers of small ship targets in different scenarios. The thermal infrared bands can capture the temperature differences between ships and the surrounding marine environment, enabling effective detection. Therefore, this study used the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) thermal infrared spectrometer (TIS) to develop a three-channel infrared small target detection (IRSTD) dataset with pixel-level annotations for all bands (SDG-IRSTD). The dataset contains 329 images from the SDGSAT-1 TIS and 3492 targets. Then a hierarchy features attention network (HFA-Net) for space-based tiny ship detection was proposed. The network generates enhanced feature maps of different scales through the multi-level detail enhancement module (MLDEM), employs a multi-level large kernel attention module (MLLKAM) which integrates the multi-scale mechanism with large kernel attention (LKA) to effectively model long-range dependencies on feature maps with different scales, and finally achieves feature fusion and interaction of different scales through the multi-level feature fusion module (MLFFM). In addition, the HFA-Net model improved intersection over union (IoU) and probability of detection (Pd) by 2.35 % and 3.97 %, respectively, and reduced false alarm rate (Fa) by 3.29 × 10−6, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) IRSTD methods. It can achieve target localization while obtaining the overall shape of the ship, providing important support for sustainable marine safety."

 Methods based on upward canopy gap fractions are widely employed to measure in-situ effective LAI (Le) as an alternative to destructive sampling. However, these measurements are limited to point-level and are not practical for scaling up to larger areas. To address the point-to-landscape gap, this study introduces an innovative approach, named NeRF-LAI, for corn and soybean Le estimation that combines gap-fraction theory with the neural radiance field (NeRF) technology, an emerging neural network-based method for implicitly representing 3D scenes using multi-angle 2D images. The trained NeRF-LAI can render downward photorealistic hemispherical depth images from an arbitrary viewpoint in the 3D scene, and then calculate gap fractions to estimate Le. To investigate the intrinsic difference between upward and downward gaps estimations, initial tests on virtual corn fields demonstrated that the downward Le matches well with the upward Le, and the viewpoint height is insensitive to Le estimation for a homogeneous field. Furthermore, we conducted intensive real-world experiments at controlled plots and farmer-managed fields to test the effectiveness and transferability of NeRF-LAI in real-world scenarios, where multi-angle UAV oblique images from different phenological stages were collected for corn and soybeans. Results showed the NeRF-LAI is able to render photorealistic synthetic images with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 18.94 for the controlled corn plots and 19.10 for the controlled soybean plots. We further explored three methods to estimate Le from calculated gap fractions: the 57.5° method, the five-ring-based method, and the cell-based method. Among these, the cell-based method achieved the best performance, with the r2 ranging from 0.674 to 0.780 and RRMSE ranging from 1.95 % to 5.58 %. The Le estimates are sensitive to viewpoint height in heterogeneous fields due to the difference in the observable foliage volume, but they exhibit less sensitivity to relatively homogeneous fields. Additionally, the cross-site testing for pixel-level LAI mapping showed the NeRF-LAI significantly outperforms the VI-based models, with a small variation of RMSE (0.71 to 0.95 m2/m2) for spatial resolution from 0.5 m to 2.0 m. This study extends the application of gap fraction-based Le estimation from a discrete point scale to a continuous field scale by leveraging implicit 3D neural representations learned by NeRF. The NeRF-LAI method can map Le from raw multi-angle 2D images without prior information, offering a potential alternative to the traditional in-situ plant canopy analyzer with a more flexible and efficient solution."

 Since shifting sands pose a serious threat to surrounding areas, it is important to forecast their spatial trends in desert regions for better management of these areas. Given the importance of this issue, this study develops a hybrid approach to distinguish sand dunes from other desert features with deep neural networks and remote sensing techniques at different scales in the Nafud Desert in Saudi Arabia and the Registan Desert in Afghanistan. The study also models shifting sand dunes by combining morphometric features and infrared waves to predict their spatial boundary changes and associated risks. Moreover, the analysis of the relationship between morphometric features and climate parameters forecasts future spatial shifts of sand dunes. The results show that the hybrid deep learning model of Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) and Laplacian effectively enhances image resolution for precise sand dune boundary extraction. Furthermore, the integration of topographic and spectral features into a new hybrid model, TPI, and K-Mean++ enables accurate prediction of spatial boundary changes in desert areas. The combination of deep neural networks and multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) identifies the optimal scale for sand dune separation as 90 and 100 m. Moreover, the analysis of spectral reflectance combined with the CA-Markov model and climate parameters indicates that infrared waves can predict shifting sand dunes with high accuracy and highlight them as a potential threat to surrounding lands. Morphometric-climate analysis further reveals how these shifts may evolve, aiding future hazard mitigation. This integrated approach advances our understanding of sand dune-climate interactions and offers a robust framework for managing desertification threats in vulnerable regions."

 Accurate assessment and monitoring of stand volume (SV) and above-ground biomass (AGB) in mixed mountain forests is crucial for sustainable forestry, ecosystem service assessment, and climate change mitigation. While airborne multi/hyper-spectral and LiDAR sensors have been proven effective for SV and AGB retrieval, the potential of spaceborne systems remains understudied. This study evaluates the capability of NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) hyperspectral data, combined with canopy height metrics derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data, to retrieve SV and AGB in two heterogeneous mountain forests in Italy. We compared EMIT with Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data as model inputs, with and without GEDI data integration, using five Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We then applied the top-performing models to generate spatially explicit SV and AGB maps. Results demonstrated that EMIT-GEDI integration enhanced SV estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.75 RMSE = 75.48 m3 ha−1, GPR model) compared to S2-GEDI (R2 = 0.69 RMSE = 84.48 m3 ha−1, ANN model). AGB was retrieved with significantly lower accuracy than SV, and S2-GEDI models outperformed EMIT-GEDI ones, likely because of the higher S2 spatial resolution better capturing AGB variability associated to different tree species. GEDI LiDAR proved to be a necessary input for accurate SV and AGB retrieval, and GPR was the best-performing ML algorithm. The resulting spatial maps were artifact-free and successfully delineated ecological gradients and management patterns. This study underscores the promise of spaceborne hyperspectral-LiDAR data integration for SV and AGB mapping in mixed mountain forest ecosystems, However, it also emphasizes trade-offs between sensor spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions, thus the importance of upcoming hyperspectral missions, such as CHIME, combining hyperspectral capabilities with high spatial resolution and regular data acquisitions at global scale."

 Precipitation systems passing over cities can be modified by urban impacts. Compared with urban impacts on less-organized convective precipitation systems, urban modification of highly-organized or strongly-forced precipitation systems remains less understood. In this study, we examine urban impacts on a cold-frontal precipitation system passing over the Seoul metropolitan area, South Korea. For this, three sets of urban ensemble simulations with diurnal-mean anthropogenic heat intensities and urban momentum roughness lengths of (0 W m−2, 1 m), (45 W m−2, 2 m), and (90 W m−2, 3 m) and a set of nonurban ensemble simulations are performed. Comparisons with observations show that the characteristics and passage of the cold front are acceptably reproduced in all sets of the ensemble simulations. Precipitation is enhanced by about 20–40 % downstorm of Seoul in the urban ensemble simulations, with marginal delays in the movement of the precipitation system. The precipitation enhancement is hard to be discerned by a comparison between a single pair of urban and nonurban simulations, since the urban-induced precipitation enhancement is obscured by strong precipitation anomalies arising from different locations of precipitation cores in individual simulations. The downstorm precipitation enhancement is attributed to precipitation intensity increases in narrow cold-frontal rainband, which results from intensified frontal updrafts due to the increases in cross-frontal vorticity. The warm urban-heated air trailing the cold front after the frontal passage results in the increases in cross-frontal vorticity by decreasing temperature gradient at the frontal zone."

One notable effect associated with the hepatobiliary tropism of PltC typhoid toxin is a reduction in bile acids, consequently promotingS.Typhi pathogenicity in infected mice.

Here, we use idealized atmosphere‐ocean simulations to study the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) under equilibrated greenhouse warming. In warmer climates, the atmosphere transports energy more efficiently, smoothing the Pacific zonal temperature gradient and weakening the Walker Circulation. Since these zonal asymmetries are the source of ENSO instability, ENSO growth rates decrease in warmer climates, leading to less extreme ENSO events.

We introduce a data‐driven flux approach to incorporate more realistic diffusive flux, significantly improving the model's ability to replicate key WSA features. Simulations show that topside plasma diffusion turns downward in the evening, peaking near midnight, contributing notably to the NmF2 enhancement. Around 22:00 local time, downward plasmaspheric diffusion becomes the dominant plasma source, rivaling or exceeding local photoionization (12.08 vs. 8.50 cm−3s−1 ${\text{cm}}^{-3}{\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$ at 22:30).

Accurate estimation of ERR can help identify regions with a strong dependence on the terrestrial water cycle, offering valuable implications for land use management. However, the existing techniques for calculating ERR at continental or global scales depend on the accuracy of simulations on complicated and underlying processes, which are difficult to conduct. To address this methodological gap, we propose a novel method that integrates precipitation, surface evaporation, and water vapor flux divergence, incorporating the microphysics scheme of clouds and precipitation. This method utilizes remote sensing data, including precipitation, evaporation, specific humidity, wind speed, water vapor, water content, and other variables, without relying on complicated simulation results. It features a simple structure and low computational cost. Using this approach, we map historical ERR from 1985 to 2014 to establish a baseline for spatial distributions and driving factors. To further validate the results from this study, we calculate the response of ERR to climate change under SSP5‐8.5 and SSP1‐2.6 scenarios for the near term (2024–2040) and long term (2081–2099), and then compare our results with other existing climate change studies.

However, the drivers, impacts, and characteristics of the rapid transition in India have not been examined. Here, we use a well‐calibrated hydrological model to simulate root‐zone SM to identify rapid SM transitions in India for the 1951–2024 period. We show that rapid transition predominantly occurs during the monsoon season (June to September) in India with an average duration of two pentads. Soil moisture rapid transitions show a nonsignificant decreasing trend in transition duration and an increasing trend in intensity during 1951–2024. Most (more than 66%) of the large‐scale rapid transitions are from drought to wet phase. Only two out of six homogeneous precipitation regions in India experienced equal numbers of drought‐to‐wet phase and wet phase‐to‐drought transitions, while the other four had more drought‐to‐wet phase transitions. Long dry spells/monsoon breaks during the monsoon season and positive air temperature anomalies rapidly deplete SM resulting in droughts. On the other hand, the sudden influx of moisture into the drought‐affected region caused wet phases. The major country‐level rapid transitions from wet phase to drought occurred during the monsoon seasons of 1972, 2009, and 2023; whereas transitions from drought to wet phase occurred in 2005, 1972, 1970, and 1962.

However, existing studies on WPSH seasonal prediction have primarily focused on the recent 20–30 years, limiting our ability to assess decadal variations in prediction skill. Here, based on CSF‐20C seasonal hindcast (1901–2010), we find the prediction skill of WPSH improved post‐1960s due to increased signal‐to‐noise ratio in model, which is driven by strengthened predictable signals rather than noise reduction. Through comparative analysis of high‐skill (1961–2010) and low‐skill (1901–1950) periods, we identify three persistent oceanic predictors of WPSH variability: sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in tropical central‐eastern Pacific, tropical North Atlantic, and Indo‐Pacific. Notably, the Indo‐Pacific region's relative contribution to prediction skill increased substantially from 40% to 59%, establishing it as the dominant driver of enhanced predictability. The expansion of observational data and intensification of quasi‐biennial ENSO variability since the 1960s may be two primary factors contributing to the enhanced predictable components of WPSH. Beyond predictable signals, we also examine the unpredictable noises in both observations and CSF‐20C. For observations, unpredictable component of SST across three key oceanic regions constitutes the primary source of WPSH‐related unpredictable noises during low‐skill period. In contrast, during high‐skill period, the main contributors to unpredictable noises shift to the SST‐independent atmospheric teleconnections in mid‐high latitudes (e.g., the East‐Atlantic pattern and summer North Atlantic Oscillation), which influence WPSH by modulating the East Asian westerly jet. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms governing seasonal prediction of WPSH."

This stable stratification results in a positive lapse rate feedback, which is a major contributor to Arctic amplification. A second state, with cloudy conditions, weaker stability, and near‐zero net surface longwave flux is also observed. Previous work has shown that many CMIP5 models fail to appropriately partition water between liquid and ice phases in mixed‐phase clouds, leading to a lack of this cloudy state. In this study, we assess the representation of the Arctic winter atmospheric boundary layer over sea ice in global climate models contributing to the latest phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We compare boundary layer process relationships in these models to those in surface‐based and radiosonde observations collected during the MOSAiC (2019–2020) and SHEBA (1997–1998) expeditions, and by North Pole drifting stations (1955–1991). The majority of CMIP6 models fail to realistically represent the cloudy state over winter Arctic sea ice. Despite this, CMIP6 multimodel mean LLS falls within the observational range, and models mostly capture the observed dependence of LLS on near‐surface air temperature and wind speed. CMIP6 models predict a decline in winter LLS with Arctic warming, with mean stability falling below zero by 2100 under the SSP2‐4.5 scenario. Our results highlight the failure to accurately simulate mixed‐phase clouds as an important limitation on representing a realistic Arctic winter boundary layer in many CMIP6 models."

However, challenges persist in evaluating hydrometeor classification (HMC) algorithms, thereby impacting the accuracy of precipitation estimates. This study proposes to use full Doppler spectra in both polarizations from a Ka‐ and W‐band Doppler‐polarimetric profiler with a 45° elevation angle to provide insights into hydrometeor characteristics. A novel methodology was developed to link the observed spectra with the output of an HMC scheme. We applied the wradlib HMC scheme using C‐band weather radar data from the Netherlands for six cases (2021–2022). The HMC scheme output is used to calculate mixing ratios that are combined with the corresponding scattering properties using the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator microwave single scattering properties database (frozen hydrometeors) and T‐matrix calculations (liquid hydrometeors) to simulate Doppler spectra of polarimetric variables that would be measured by the profiler. Comparing these simulations with actual profiler measurements enables a quality assessment. The method works in stratiform cases, but convective cases reveal the influence of turbulence and wind variability. Uncertainty arises from the selection of specific parameterizations for the particle size distribution and the relationship between hydrometeor size and terminal fall velocity as well as from the derived mixing ratios. Additionally, the 45° angle complicates separating horizontal wind from hydrometeor fall velocities, although the Mie notch in the dual‐wavelength ratio can be effectively used to remove the radial wind component. Our results underline limitations that must be addressed but also show that integrating spectral and dual‐frequency observations could yield valuable insights into hydrometeor characteristics."

 Clot-induced blockage in arteries or veins can cause severe medical conditions1. Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive technique used to treat ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular disease2–4 by removing clots through aspiration5, stent retriever6 or cutting mechanisms7. However, current mechanical thrombectomy methods fail to remove clots in 10–30% of patients8–10, especially in the case of large, fibrin-rich clots11. These methods can also rupture and fragment clots12, causing distal emboli and poor outcomes13. To overcome these challenges, we develop the milli-spinner thrombectomy, which uses a simple yet innovative mechanics concept to modify the clot’s microstructure, facilitating its removal. The milli-spinner works by mechanically densifying the clot’s fibrin network and releasing red blood cells through spinning-induced compression and shear forces. It can shrink the clot volume by 95% for easy and fast removal. In vitro tests in pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in vivo experiments in swine models demonstrate that the milli-spinner achieves ultrafast clot debulking and high-fidelity revascularization, outperforming aspiration thrombectomy. The milli-spinner thrombectomy directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, improving mechanical thrombectomy success rates compared with current methods that rely on clot rupture or cutting. This approach offers a promising new direction for mechanical thrombectomy devices, especially for treating ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombosis.

 Plenty of leaf optical spectra datasets have been employed in the calibration and validation of leaf optical or empirical models. However, no experiment has been conducted that measures the true leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra while isolating chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) contributions, which results in a superimposed effect on measured reflectance or transmittance. As a result, to date, the simulated accuracy of leaf spectra in the red-edge domain remains limited due to the absence of true leaf spectra used in calibration of leaf models. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of simulating leaf spectral characteristics in the red-edge domain by combining an existing leaf physical model (PROSPECT-D) with the data-driven method that is typically used to establish leaf empirical models. A new leaf spectra dataset without ChlF contributions, including reflectance and transmittance data for 849 leaves, was first measured and replace the existing leaf spectra datasets in the modelling process. A coupled leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT-DP) was then established, in which a principal component analysis (PCA) approach was employed to model leaf spectra in red-edge domain using the spectral vectors derived from the training dataset, while the coefficients of spectral vectors were determined by leveraging the PROSPECT-D simulated leaf spectra except for the red-edge domain. Finally, validation of the PROSPECT-DP model with an independent validation dataset of 203 leaf samples showed that it performed much better than the PROSPECT-D model for spectral simulation in the red-edge domain. Furthermore, the PROSPECT-DP model exhibited better performance in leaf trait inversions with a closer relationship between measured and PROSPECT-DP-derived leaf chlorophyll a + b and carotenoid pigments compared to the PROSPECT-D model. Therefore, the novel coupled leaf model presented in this study will be highly beneficial for the integration of leaf models into canopy models and for applications in remote sensing to assess plant traits."

Large-scale nonlinear and possibly irreversible changes in system state, such as AMOC weakening or rainforest-savanna transitions in the Amazon basin, would have severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies worldwide. In order to improve future tipping risk assessments, understanding interactions between tipping elements is crucial. The AMOC is known to influence the Intertropical Convergence Zone, potentially altering precipitation patterns over the AR and affecting its stability. However, AMOC-AR interactions are currently not well understood. Here, we identify a previously unknown stabilising interaction pathway from the AMOC onto the Southern AR, applying an established causal discovery and inference approach to tipping element interactions for the first time. Analysing observational and reanalysis data from 1982–2022, we show that AMOC weakening leads to increased precipitation in the Southern AR during the critical dry season, in line with findings from recent Earth system model experiments. Specifically, we report a 4.8% increase of mean dry season precipitation in the Southern AR for every 1 Sv of AMOC weakening. This finding is consistent across multiple data sources and AMOC strength indices. We show that, predicated on recent estimates of AMOC weakening, this stabilising interaction has offset 17% of dry season precipitation decrease in the Southern AR since 1982. Our results demonstrate the potential of causal discovery methods for analysing tipping element interactions based on reanalysis and observational data. By improving the understanding of AMOC-AR interactions, we contribute toward better constraining the risk of potential climate tipping cascades under global warming."

Despite the ability of climate models to simulate LCC impacts, considerable uncertainties remain, particularly in simulations of precipitation and temperature responses. This study provides the first multidisciplinary systematic review of LCC impacts in West Africa. Data from 26 selected publications were eventually synthesized from an initial pool of nearly 6000 studies. Results indicate that deforestation generally contributes to regional warming, with significant historical temperature increases of +0.26 ± 0.12 °C and projected increases of +0.88 ± 0.25 °C under the future scenarios. Conversely, afforestation could have significantly cooled the climate, lowering temperatures by −0.24 ± 0.14 °C historically and −0.22 ± 0.14 °C in future scenarios, without even accounting for carbon sequestration. Deforestation decreases regional precipitation by 80 ± 58 mm yr−1 historically and −55 ± 102 mm yr−1 in future scenarios, while large-scale afforestation could substantially reduce droughts with increased precipitation, averaging +40 ± 67 mm yr−1 historically and 80 ± 58 mm yr−1 in future scenarios.

While melt generally scales with velocity and temperature, we find substantially enhanced melt linked with unsteady forcing. Several implementations of the three‐equation melt parameterization show melt can be predicted within a factor of 2 if the model is evaluated with peak near‐boundary velocities and flows are quasi‐steady.

In diamonds with previously reported coexisting inclusions, former bridgmanite coexists with lower Ti# CaSi‐perovskite and garnet inclusions with higher Ti# CaSi‐perovskite. This observation is consistent with published petrological experiments on mafic compositions suggesting that CaSi‐perovskite undergoes a decrease in Ti# after the post‐garnet transition. Thus variations in Ti content of CaSi‐perovskite inclusions are interpreted as differences in formation pressures."

The 2024 El Niño exhibited a wet signal over California, but it was notably weaker. Observed SST anomalies for this winter included a contribution from SST warming trends and pronounced Atlantic warming that was much larger than attributable to SST warming trends alone. Sensitivity experiments indicated that SST trends suppressed California precipitation by disrupting traditional El Niño teleconnection patterns, particularly in southern California. Atlantic warming contributed to North Pacific anticyclonic anomalies, opposing typical El Niño‐induced wet conditions. These findings highlight the role of inter‐basin SST interactions and of trends in shaping atmospheric responses and underscore the importance of regional and global SST variations in modulating ENSO teleconnections."

Using observations and state‐of‐the‐art subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) models, the influence of the MJO on total precipitation (P) and TC‐related precipitation (TCP) is analyzed across MJO phases. Results indicate that TCs significantly contribute to the MJO's modulation of precipitation, particularly in regions like the Gulf Coast, Florida, and western Mexico. The anomalous probability of extreme precipitation events associated with the MJO is strongly linked to the MJO‐TCP connection, highlighting the importance of capturing these interactions for reliable S2S forecasts of precipitation. We also show that S2S models underestimate TCP's role in total P anomalies and extreme precipitation probabilities related to the MJO. This underscores the need for improved modeling of the MJO‐TC relationship to increase subseasonal forecast skill of total and extreme precipitation in North America."

 Harmful algal blooms contaminate seafood with toxins and poison humans and wildlife upon consumption. Toxic algae niches are projected to expand in high latitudes, but how the frequency of their blooms will evolve is still little known. Here we use climate models, 14 years of observations and probabilistic models of toxic algae, to assess the frequency of harmful algal blooms in a future warmer world. The warmer ocean temperatures increase the blooms in spring and autumn. However, the blooms reduce in summer as surface waters become excessively warm. Freshening reduces the blooms of species confined to high salinity ranges and has no effect on increasing the blooms. In a 3 °C warmer world, the blooms of D. acuta might increase by 50% and A. tamarense complex reduce by 40% along the Norwegian coast.

 Reservoir drought is a valuable indicator of regional hydrological drought severity; however, it has received limited attention because of the low quality of reservoir storage data. This study proposes a Remote Sensing-Based High-Resolution Reservoir Drought Index (RS-HRDI) that integrates recent high-resolution satellite observations with historical low-resolution records to construct a long-term reservoir storage dataset. Reservoir droughts are identified by periods of abnormally low reservoir storage using a time-variant threshold. The RS-HRDI was used to detect reservoir droughts in the Yangtze River Basin, one of the most reservoir-regulated and critical river systems globally, from 2018 to 2023, including a record-breaking drought in 2022. The results indicate that the multi-satellite combination significantly improved the reservoir observation frequency from the historical monthly scale to an average of 4.3 d, enabling the detection of rapid reservoir storage reductions within days. The RS-HRDI could effectively identify droughts across various reservoirs and accurately describe their characteristics. Through comprehensive assessments of widespread reservoir networks, the aggregated RS-HRDI effectively characterized basin-scale hydrological droughts, detailing their spatial extent, intensity, and duration. Furthermore, the RS-HRDI highlighted the influence of reservoir operations on the occurrence and propagation of hydrological droughts in a river system. Specifically, upstream reservoir interception advanced downstream droughts by 2–40 d.

 Particulate organic nitrates (pON) are important nitrogen-containing compounds in ambient aerosols that have considerable impacts on air quality, nutrient inputs, and biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. pON, estimated via the fragmentation ratios of NO2+ and NO + ions detected by the quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor, was investigated at a coastal site in Shanghai. Among organic aerosols, more-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) was the dominate group throughout the whole year. pON accounted for considerable fractions of OA and the total nitrate with strong seasonal variations. Receptor modeling apportioned the nitrate-related production as the largest source of pON, indicating the significance of secondary formation pathway. Analysis of various influencing factors on pON indicated that aqueous-phase chemistry played the most significant role in the formation of pON in four seasons, while the photochemical pathway was also contributing in summer. Reactions among the nitrogenous precursors and VOCs (mainly alkanes and aromatics) facilitated by aerosol liquid water promoted the formation of pON. Under high humidity conditions, the mass yield of pON was particularly favored compared to its inorganic counterpart. This study signified the importance of accurate quantification of pON in the future research, which has scientific implications on the formation mechanisms of organic aerosols, nitrogen deposition, and biogeochemical cycle of key elements in the coastal environment."

These annual estimates of field-level water savings potential are based on locally achievable CWP values for each crop type. Our findings show considerable spatial variation in CWP and potential water savings within each sub-basin. We find that increasing CWP to peak efficiency (defined as improving fields to the 95th percentile of observed CWP) for four crops could meet up to 36% of the estimated annual overdraft in San Joaquin Valley. For comparison, fallowing 5% of the four crop type fields in the same study area could potentially reduce annual overdraft by 11%. By delivering results at the field scale, our work can inform targeted interventions by irrigation district managers and more efficient allocation of state incentives for improved water management. For example, we estimate that state grant funding for water efficiency upgrades could have amplified potential water savings threefold by targeting investments to the least efficient fields."

This is particularly the case in South America’s tropical forests and savannas, where much hope is placed in intensifying cattle production instead of further expanding it. Yet, where such an intensification is already happening and how it is associated with deforestation patterns remains elusive. Here, we pioneer the use of satellite imagery to identify areas where cattle are confined—a key indicator of intensified cattle production—across the entire 3.7 million km2 South American dry diagonal; a global hotspot of cattle production and deforestation. We subsequently use an active-learning approach to separate these confinement areas into (1) feedlots, (2) concentrated animal feeding operations, and (3) supplementary feeding areas. Our results show that confinement areas are ubiquitous in the dry diagonal. We identified 253 large, industrialized feedlots and more than 3200 medium-sized concentrated animal feeding operations—together containing an estimated 13 million cattle head—and more than 4000 supplementary feeding sites on pastures. Feedlots were found mostly in the Cerrado (n = 141), followed by Chaco (n = 93), and were less frequent in the Chiquitano and Caatinga regions. Feedlots occurred predominantly in areas of high cropland cover and low levels of deforestation, while supplementary feeding sites were associated with higher shares of deforestation. Independent validation suggests our methodology can identify confinement areas robustly (97% user’s accuracy) and separate feedlots, concentrated animal feeding operations, and supplementary feeding sites accurately (F1-score 0.91 ± 0.01). Thus, our scalable approach has the potential to provide an advancement in our understanding of the distribution of cattle production systems, the geography of ranching intensification, the environmental impacts of beef production, and the relationship between ranching intensification and tropical deforestation."

More interestingly, similar to the QBO-MJO connection, the upper TBO is also significant correlated with MJO during boreal winter and summer. The responses of the amplitude and occurrence frequency of the eight MJO phases are broadly stronger and higher during the weak TBO when compared to the strong TBO.

Natural-language processing tools facilitate data collection, extraction and analysis processes. They expand knowledge utilization capabilities by improving access to reliable sources in shorter time. They also identify patterns of similarities and contrasts across diverse contexts. We apply general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) to two case studies and we document appropriate uses and shortcomings of these tools for two tasks: classification and sentiment analysis of climate and sustainability documents. We study both statistical and prompt-based methods. In the first case study, we use LLMs to assess whether climate pledges trigger cascade effects in other sustainability dimensions. In the second use case, we use LLMs to identify interactions between the sustainable development goals and detects the direction of their links to frame meaningful policy implications. We find that LLMs are successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data helping practitioners and researchers accessing. LLMs detect strong concerns from emerging economies in addressing food security, water security and urban challenges as primary issues. Developed economies, instead, focus their pledges on the energy transition and climate finance. We also detect and document four main limits along the knowledge production chain: interpretability, external validity, replicability and usability. These risks threaten the usability of findings and can lead to failures in the decision-making process. We recommend risk mitigation strategies to improve transparency and literacy on artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to complex policy problems.

Given the significant contradictions between China’s water demand and supply, it is urgent to clarify the responsibilities for WW (RWW) in VWT. Previous studies considering this responsibility have focused solely on the absolute volume of WW; however, the disparities in water availability and economic capacity lead to differing implications of the same WW action across regions. Here, to reassess the RWW, we introduce water scarcity index and value-added to WW and propose the concept of the three-dimensional water footprint (3DWF). We reveal the distribution distinction between WW and 3DWF among China’s regions. In addition, we explore how the 3DWF is transferred within the supply chain and further reveal its inequality and the contributions of regions to the inequality. We find that the distribution of 3DWF has changed dramatically compared to WW, primarily concentrating in China’s economic center. The 3DWF inequality primarily results from the distribution of 3DWF-local, with a Gini coefficient of 0.7556. Xinjiang has only 1.8% of the population but is responsible for 22% of the 3DWF-local in China and has become the largest contributor to the inequality. Notably, this inequality is mitigated when 3DWF-non-local is taken into account.

However, analyses of recent Earth system model simulations point to substantial climatic changes over multi-centennial timescales in net-zero emissions futures. Focusing on Europe, we address the gap in characterising heat extremes in long-term net-zero stabilised climates. We quantify the long-term effects of delayed mitigation on annual maximum daily maximum temperatures (TXx) in European regions using 1000 year-long stabilised simulations with ACCESS-ESM-1.5, reaching net-zero CO2 emissions at different times over the coming decades. We evaluate ACCESS-ESM-1.5 against the ERA5 reanalysis for European maximum temperatures using rank frequency analysis and compare present-day maximum temperatures to their long-term future likelihood. Across all European regions, any delay in achieving net-zero emissions shifts the distribution to higher annual maximum temperatures, remaining elevated at the same levels for centuries. European regions show two- to five-fold frequency increases for heat events as strong as current records, while the Mediterranean region could experience 30-fold increases if emissions cessation is delayed until 2060. When comparing extreme heat distributions at global warming levels, we find substantial differences between transient and net-zero emissions quasi-stable climate states, with larger differences at higher warming levels. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of European extreme hot temperatures in net-zero stabilised climates, paving the way for further investigations of other extreme event types or regions in net-zero futures."

The U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) institutionalized public engagement in environmental review in the belief it would lead to better decisions and more sustainable outcomes. But, 50 years later, NEPA’s public comment process has been criticized as costly and slow, while doing little to change outcomes. Data science now makes it possible to track progress and evaluate the influence of public participation. We examined 108 environmental impact statement (EIS) processes spanning 22 years. Our analysis revealed that public comments resulted in substantive decision alterations in 62% of cases, with 64% showing modifications to alternatives, 42% showing modifications to mitigation plans and 11% leading to the selection of an entirely new preferred alternative. When federal agencies changed project alternatives (78 EISs), 88% of the time (69 of the 78 EISs) they credited public comments as the reason. In 45 of the 108 EISs, agencies modified mitigation plans and credited public comments as the reason 100% of the time. Agencies only occasionally selected a new preferred alternative (21 out of 104 EISs), but when they did, they credited public comments as the reason 100% of the time. As the United States and the 190+ states and countries that have adopted NEPA’s example consider how to address environmental change, it is important to assess the role of public participation in environmental decision making.

We collated fish stomach content data to improve understanding of feeding interactions for the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. To illustrate how these data can be used, we estimate species- and size-specific feeding traits, classify predators into functional feeding groups, and reveal spatially extensive temporal change in marine ecosystem structure and functioning. 
 International efforts to assess the status of marine ecosystems have been hampered by insufficient observations of food web interactions across many species, their various life stages, and their geographic ranges. Hence, we collated data from multiple databases of fish stomach contents from samples taken across the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans containing 944 129 stomach samples from larvae to adults, with 14 196 unique interactions between 227 predator species and 2158 prey taxa. We use these data to develop a reproducible data-driven approach to classifying broad functional feeding guilds and then apply these to fish survey data from the north-east Atlantic shelf seas to reveal spatial and temporal changes in ecosystem structure and functioning. In doing so, we construct individual predator–prey body-mass scaling models to predict the biomass of prey functional groups, e.g. zooplankton, benthos, and fish, for different predator species. These predictions provide empirical estimates of species- and size-specific feeding traits of fish, such as predator–prey mass ratios, individual prey mass, and the biomass contribution of different prey to predator diets. The functional groupings and feeding traits provided here help to further resolve our understanding of interactions within marine food webs and support the use of trait-based indicators in biodiversity assessments.

This model maps water depths with an accuracy of ~1 m. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing global bathymetry models in shallow regions. Our model exhibited superior performance in capturing fine-scale bathymetric features with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing essential data for marine applications. 
 Accurate shallow-water depth information for island areas is crucial for maritime safety, resource exploration, ecological conservation, and offshore economic activity. Traditional approaches such as shipborne sounding and airborne bathymetric light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys are expensive, time-consuming, and constrained in politically sensitive regions. Moreover, satellite-altimetry-predicted depths exhibit large errors over shallow waters. In contrast, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), estimated from multispectral imagery, provides a rapid, open-source, and cost-effective technique for comprehensively characterizing the bathymetry of a region. Given the scarcity of in situ water depth data for the South China Sea (SCS), a shallow-water depth model, HHU24SWDSCS (Hohai University 2024 Shallow-Water Depth Model of South China Sea), was developed using a linear band model by integrating 1298 Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) tracks with 70 Sentinel-2 multispectral images. The model covers over 120 islands and reefs in the SCS region at a resolution of 10 m. Validation against independent ICESat-2 depth data yielded a root mean square error for the model of 0.53–1.24 m (< 5 % of the maximum depth). Further validation using independent airborne lidar bathymetry data in the Lingyang Reef demonstrated an accuracy of 1.01 m. Comparisons with existing bathymetry models revealed the superior performance of the developed model. While traditional bathymetry models exhibit errors of up to tens of meters or larger over island regions and should therefore be used with caution, HHU24SWDSCS demonstrated good accuracy in shallow waters across the SCS. This model thus provides a reference for mapping shallow-water depth close to islands and provides fundamental support for research in oceanography, geodesy, and other disciplines.

 Mountain ecosystems are crucial for global biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, yet their response to environmental change remains poorly understood due to limited high-resolution, multi-element datasets. Here, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset comprising more than 1,300 soil samples collected from 166 sites across 30 mountain regions in China, spanning five major climatic zones and representative vegetation types.

 Forests in Europe are undergoing complex changes that require a comprehensive monitoring of disturbance occurrence.

The EFDA contains annual layers on disturbance occurrence, severity, and agent, as well as aggregated layers on the number of disturbances and the latest and greatest disturbance year. Based on the annual disturbance estimates (1985–2023), we quantified a total forest disturbed area of 439 000 km2, which increases to 610 000 km2 when accounting for multiple overlapping disturbance events. Map accuracies of the disturbance classification showed an overall F1 score of 0.89, with very low errors (<1 %) for the undisturbed class and with commission and omission errors for the disturbed class of 17.3 % and 22.5 %, respectively. Further, temporal validation revealed that errors decreased over time, with commission errors decreasing substantially to 10.6 % after the year 2000.

Using California as a case study, decarbonization pathways and proposed natural gas plants’ NOx and PM2.5 emissions are modeled, with a statewide target of zero grid-related CO2 emissions by 2046. The plant with the greatest environmental justice impacts is then restricted in the next iteration of capacity expansion modeling; an additional exploratory iteration investigates the impacts of restricting the facility with the greatest health burden per TWh generated. While inequities persist in the second iteration under each constraint, this methodology lays a foundation for applying environmental justice constraints in the development of equitable grid decarbonization pathways and highlights potential paths forward for more effective constraints."

However, the specific roles and mechanisms of phage communities in this process are still not fully understood. In this study, machine learning models were used to explore how micrometer-sized tire crumb rubber (mTCR) affects the transmission of ARGs via phage communities. The results showed that mTCR at environmentally relevant concentrations significantly activated prophages, promoting the spread of the ARGs. The activation mechanisms of shade- and photoaged mTCR differed, with eARGs carried by phage being more abundant in photoaged mTCR-treated sludge despite similar activation efficiencies. The random forests algorithm revealed that prophage activation induced by shade-aged mTCR was primarily driven by the metals and organic components leached from the mTCR. Antibiotic-resistant lysogens tolerated shade-aged mTCR due to their resistance to metals and organic matter, reducing internal prophage activation. In contrast, photoaged mTCR particles harbored more persistent free radicals, leading to the generation of extracellular O2•– and •OH, which damaged cell membranes and triggered prophage activation. These findings highlight the ecological risk associated with eARGs spread via prophage induction and deepen our understanding of the need to control discarded TCR."

While internal exposure assessments of PAHs have gained increasing attention, current methods lack the time resolution necessary to capture dynamic changes and chronic health effects accurately. Here, we develop an integrated approach to improve the accuracy of internal exposure assessments by combining the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model, a Physiologically Based Toxicokinetic model, and high-resolution concentrations of particle-bound PAHs. The rolling mode can calculate hourly internal exposure of particle-bound PAHs, accounting for both the temporal variations of ambient PAH concentrations and their bioaccumulation in the body. The annual hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk (CR) based on the internal exposure are 5.86 × 10–2 and 5.52 × 10–6, significantly higher than the values (1.40 × 10–3 and 4.51 × 10–8) obtained via the conventional external exposure methods. Internal exposure and health risks (HQ and CR) are subtle to time resolution, e.g., the coarser time resolution results in a smaller internal exposure, leading to an underestimation of chronic health risks by the conventional method. Our results offer a tool for accurately assessing the health risks of particle-bound pollutants, providing valuable insights for public health policies aimed at reducing environmental risks."

However, the impact of AH exposure on respiratory allergy symptoms in preschool children has not been investigated. This study conducted a cross-sectional study of 39088 Chinese preschool children to investigate the associations between multisource AH exposure (building heat, industrial heat, metabolic heat, transportation heat, and total heat) and the risks of respiratory allergy symptoms (wheezing, night-cough, and rhinitis). Exposure to higher levels of AH was associated with increased risks of wheezing (building heat, transportation heat, and total heat), night-cough (building heat), and rhinitis (building heat, metabolic heat, transportation heat, and total heat) symptoms. Exposure–response relationships demonstrated positive relationships between AH with wheezing, night-cough, and rhinitis symptoms, with nearly linear and inverted “J” shapes. Building heat contributed most to the impact of multisource AH on wheezing, night-cough, and rhinitis symptoms, with weighted quantile sum weights ranging from 0.513 to 0.887.

In this study, photothermal catalysis was innovatively applied to the NH3-SCR reaction over MoWOx/CeO2 catalysts, achieving remarkable improvements in the low-temperature performance and SO2 resistance. Under photothermal conditions, the catalyst maintained NOx conversion above 90% at 200 °C, even in the presence of 250 ppm of SO2. Comprehensive characterization revealed that light irradiation significantly enhanced the formation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface and weakened NO adsorption, indicating that the NH3-SCR reaction follows the Eley–Rideal mechanism, which contributes to its excellent low-temperature activity. Moreover, photothermal conditions reduced the chemical adsorption intensity of SO2, effectively inhibiting the formation of ammonium sulfate. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that the narrow band gap of MoWOx promotes electron transfer from the O 2p orbital to the Ce 4f orbital at the Ce–O–Mo(W) interface under light, leading to electron enrichment at active sites and suppression of SO2 oxidation. This work not only provides a novel strategy for enhancing the NH3-SCR performance but also represents a groundbreaking advancement in the design of highly efficient, SO2-resistant catalysts for low-temperature applications."

Periphyton communities on sediments play crucial hydroecological roles and serve as bioindicators of PFAS contamination. However, research on their microbial structure and ARG dissemination in response to PFAS remains limited. This study explored how PFAS stress influences periphyton communities’ ecological functions and ARGs dynamics. PFAS varying exposure inhibited communities’ formation by decreasing biomass (3.0–26.2%) and significantly reducing protein and polysaccharides (p < 0.05) of periphyton communities. Methanogenic archaea abundance increased by 4.79–159290 times, while Variovorax and Nitrospira decreased by 1266.1–2303.5 and 36.1–140.4 times, respectively. Notably, PFAS enhanced ARGs families (multidrug, aminoglycoside, and glycopeptide) and subtypes (macB, evgS, tetA58, and bcrA), strengthening correlations between the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antibiotic efflux (R2 = 0.941) or target alteration (R2 = 0.961). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by MGEs played a dominant role in ARGs dissemination compared to vertical gene transfer in periphyton communities. Mechanistic insights revealed that PFAS-induced reactive oxygen species elevation, increased membrane permeability, enhanced energy provision, and overexpression of adherent molecular genes collectively facilitated HGT-driven ARGs spread.

Under low oxidant dosages (e.g., less than ten times the pollutant concentration), the influence of common inorganic anions in wastewater cannot be ignored. However, the respective impacts of ions on the two substrates (i.e., oxidant and pollutant) have not yet been systematically studied yet. In this work, we reveal that several inorganic anions (e.g., NO3–, Cl–, HCO3–, SO42–, HPO42–), which are commonly present in water and wastewater, have much greater influences on the oxidant than on the pollutant, with notable differences among the different ions. The origin of the ion effects was investigated from the aspects of substrate adsorption-activation and interfacial electron transfer. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the solution resistance, electrostatic interactions, interfacial bonding, and electronic interactions, as well as the ions’ affinity for water, which correlates with the Hofmeister series, were collectively responsible for the ion effects. From a dual-substrate perspective, this work proposes a research paradigm that not only offers insights into the ion effects in heterogeneous chemical water treatment but also holds implications for the design of catalytic active sites and the optimization of reaction conditions in dual-reactant systems."

This study presents compelling evidence of strong convergence of MP at a small-scale surface front near the Eastern Johor Strait (EJS), a typical urbanized coast in Southeast Asia, revealing an estuary tidal intrusion front as a recurrent hotspot that concentrates MP at levels comparable to known estuarine frontal systems. Significantly elevated levels of floating microplastics (150.5 ± 19.8 MP pieces/L) were detected at the surface front compared to other surface water samples along the coast (p < 0.001; 9.2 ± 4.8 MP pieces/L). Hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate that the dynamic interplay between freshwater and seawater are the key mechanisms governing this process. The resulting convergence zones effectively trap buoyant plastics, forming quasi-persistent accumulation zones. Specifically, during ebb tide, parallel outflows from the Johor River and inner EJS amplify frontal convergence, actively trapping floating plastics at the salinity boundary. These findings highlight estuarine surface fronts as influential and previously underquantified systemic pathways influencing MP circulation and retention at marginal seas. Recognizing these traceable accumulation hotspots at ocean boundaries is an urgent priority, offering opportunities for targeted mitigation, particularly in high-leakage regions."

The present study further uncovers a new set of fine structures of magnetosonic waves, namely, each elementary rising‐tone may consist of a series of mini harmonics spaced around the O+ gyrofrequency. The measured ion distributions suggest that the proton ring distribution provides free energy to excite the waves, whilst the O+ ions suppress the wave growth around multiples of O+ gyrofrequency, resulting in the formation of mini harmonics. Further investigation suggests that the warm plasma dispersion relation, that is, the ion Bernstein mode instabilities, may contribute to the formation of mini harmonics.

This study addresses this issue by performing three semi‐idealized large‐eddy simulations. Results indicate that a nascent log layer emerges within the IBL, and its depth gradually increases from ∼60 m near the coast to ∼400 m 12 km inland, where the boundary layer transition is nearly complete. This nascent log layer is superimposed by another log layer originating from the upstream marine boundary layer. While turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is maximized near the surface over both water and land, peak TKE values over land are a factor of 2 greater due to the amplified near‐surface vertical wind shear.

Given the role glacier melt plays for water supply, ecosystem integrity and glacier‐related natural hazards, improving projections of glacier changes in the region is critical. The accuracy of global climate models in this region remains an issue as the complex terrain and climate characteristics are difficult to realistically simulate. Here, we examine historical changes of freezing level height (FLH) on four tropical Andean glaciers: Antisana 15 glacier in Ecuador, Artesonraju glacier and Quelccaya ice cap in Peru, and Zongo glacier in Bolivia. The changes in FLH at each site are estimated based on ERA5 reanalysis data and then compared with historical simulations from 35 different CMIP6 models. Constraints are then placed on future projections via correction of model bias, selection of “best‐performing” models, and excluding models with an equilibrium climate sensitivity outside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 likely range. By utilizing the significant empirical linear relationship observed between FLH and glacier equilibrium‐line altitude, we estimate the future shrinkage of the glaciers' accumulation zone under two emissions scenarios, SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5. By the year 2100, the Quelccaya ice cap will likely have passed a point of no return, committing to losing its entire accumulation zone, regardless of emission pathway. The same is true for Antisana 15‐alpha glacier under SSP5‐8.5 while a small accumulation zone remains under SSP2‐4.5. Thanks to their higher accumulation area, Zongo and Artesonraju glaciers are more likely to survive beyond 2100, albeit in a strongly reduced extent."

 Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces."

 Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into specialized cell types is essential for uncovering cell-type specific molecular mechanisms and interrogating cellular function. Transcription factor screens have enabled efficient production of a few cell types; however, engineering cell types that require complex transcription factor combinations remains challenging. Here, we report an iterative, high-throughput single-cell transcription factor screening method that enables the identification of transcription factor combinations for specialized cell differentiation, which we validated by differentiating human microglia-like cells. We found that the expression of six transcription factors, SPI1, CEBPA, FLI1, MEF2C, CEBPB, and IRF8, is sufficient to differentiate human iPSC into cells with transcriptional and functional similarity to primary human microglia within 4 days. Through this screening method, we also describe a novel computational method allowing the exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from transcription factor perturbation assays to construct causal gene regulatory networks for future cell fate engineering.

In this article, the authors show that precise retinoic acid degradation is critical for instructing regeneration of the appropriate limb segment. 
 Regenerating limbs retain their proximodistal (PD) positional identity following amputation. This positional identity is genetically encoded by PD patterning genes that instruct blastema cells to regenerate the appropriate PD limb segment. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to specify proximal limb identity, but how RA signaling levels are established in the blastema is unknown. Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.

Here, the authors show polystyrene nanoplastics disrupt intestinal integrity and gut microbiota composition by altering microRNA expression in extracellular vesicles, highlight a potential pathway through which nanoplastic exposure affects gut health. 
 Nanoplastics (NP) are emerging environmental pollutants with potential risks to human health. This study investigates how polystyrene-NP exposure disrupts the intestinal microenvironment and barrier function through bacteria-host interactions. Using in vivo models and bacterial sorting technology, we show that NP accumulation in the mouse intestine alters the expression of intestinal miR-501-3p and miR-700-5p, compromising tight junction protein ZO-1 and mucin (MUC)−13 expression, thereby increasing intestinal permeability. NP increases miR-98-3p, miR-548z, miR-548h-3o, miR-548d-3p, miR-548az-5p, miR-12136, and miR-101-3p levels in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from goblet-like cells, which can interfere with ZO-1 expression. NP also induces gut microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by elevated Ruminococcaceae abundance and altered EV characteristics from goblet cells. Lachnospiraceae internalize NP, and their EVs suppress MUC-13 expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which NP compromises intestinal integrity and indirectly alters intestinal microbiota composition, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes.

 Relativistic jets from accreting black holes radiate non-thermal emission which is highly variable in different time scales. Previous studies on black holes of different mass scales, including supermassive and stellar-mass black holes, only report flux quasi-periodic oscillations in radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. No quasi-periodic variations in polarization have yet been detected in any black hole systems. Here, we report a detection of GHz-band radio polarization oscillations in GRS 1915+105, which harbors a fast-spinning stellar-mass black hole with a relativistic jet. Our observations show that during the increasing phase of radio emission, linear polarization and flux exhibit similar oscillation periods of 17 and 33 seconds, and their variation patterns anti-correlate with each other. These rare, short-period oscillations in both polarization and flux would be important to understand instabilities and special dynamics in magnetized relativistic jets.

 Climate change assessments (CCAs) play a critical role in taking stock of the available science and other forms of knowledge and informing policy processes. As the underlying evidence base increases exponentially, the complexity also increases and challenges CCA author teams to capture all the relevant knowledge. Therefore, CCAs will need to transition from predominantly assessing primary research to focusing on the assessment and critical appraisal of knowledge syntheses of such work, alongside capturing knowledges held outside traditional scientific sources. To support this, a stronger knowledge synthesis culture is needed, and we propose key recommendations and offer guidance for producing robust, transparent, reproducible, inclusive and timely syntheses that can inform CCAs across scales.

 Atlantic Niño can influence ENSO by modulating the Pacific Walker circulation. This interbasin connection is dominated by central Atlantic Niño (CAN) events, which began to emerge around 2000. Our analysis of observational data and climate model simulations reveals that the influence of CAN on ENSO will strengthen in a warming climate due to an enhanced Pacific response. On one hand, increased variability of the eastern Pacific intertropical convergence zone leads to stronger subsidence anomalies induced by CAN; on the other hand, strengthened atmospheric variability over the North Indian Ocean enhances the region’s response to CAN-induced Kelvin waves, promoting easterly anomalies over the western tropical Pacific. These changes are further linked to the pronounced interhemispheric warming contrast projected by climate models. Our findings underscore the growing influence of Atlantic Niño on ENSO, with important implications for seasonal climate prediction and future climate change projections."

 Consecutive heatwave and heavy rainfall (HW‐HR) events are occurring with increasing frequency in a warming climate. The time interval, defined as the duration between the end of a heatwave and the onset of heavy rainfall, affects both environmental conditions and the regional recovery between two consecutive extreme events. However, the dynamics of the transition between consecutive HW-HR events remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the changes in the time interval of consecutive HW-HR events in China from 1970 to 2019, using meteorological data from over 2000 stations across mainland China. Our results reveal that the time interval has significantly shortened at 24.1% of the stations. This trend is primarily driven by an increased proportion of short-time events (STEs), defined as consecutive events with time intervals within 1–2 days. From 1970 to 2019, the proportion of STEs increased significantly, at a rate of 1.4% per decade. We also find that climate change-induced anomalies in atmospheric variables during the consecutive HW-HR events, especially convective available potential energy, 2 m temperature, and relative humidity, may contribute to this rise in the proportion of STEs. Additionally, our study assesses changes in population exposure to STEs over the past two decades. We find that the area of exposure has increased across more than three-quarters of the country, with the increases in STEs contributing to 65.3% of the overall rise in exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of prioritizing disaster response during consecutive HW-HR events and implementing effective risk management strategies to mitigate population exposure to extreme events."

 The presence and stability of brines on Mars’s surface remain a significant mystery in planetary exploration. Previous mechanisms proposed for brine formation include melting of ice-salt mixtures and salt deliquescence. However, melting lacks a recharge mechanism, and deliquescence is impeded by Mars’s extreme surface aridity. This study explores an underexplored process: the role of seasonal frost in brine formation. Utilizing meteorological data from the Viking 2 lander—the only mission, with Phoenix, to observe in situ water frost formation—I demonstrate that brines can form over approximately 30 sols at the end of winter as frost sublimates. The stable brines exhibit a water activity upper limit of 0.52, corresponding to the eutectic point of calcium perchlorate, a salt detected in various Martian regions, likely including the Viking 2 landing site. Consequently, I conclude that calcium perchlorate can generate small amounts of liquid brine in contact with frost for brief periods. The seasonal nature of frost suggests these brines recur and may leave long-term imprints. Therefore, frost-covered regions are prime candidates for future habitability and astrobiological exploration. The sublimation of seasonal frost interacting with regolith salts at the end of winter could explain the formation of the perchlorate brines observed on Mars, according to numerical modelling which uses meterological data from the Viking 2 lander."

 Emperor penguin populations are predicted to decline rapidly over the current century owing to habitat loss in Antarctica arising from warming oceans and loss of seasonal sea ice. Previous work using very high-resolution satellite imagery from 2009 to 2018 revealed a population decrease of 9.5%, characterized by a continuous decline until 2016, with a slight recovery until 2018. Our study, for the sector 0° to 90°W, includes the recent period of sea-ice loss between 2020 and 2023 and provides a regional population update for around a third of the global population. We used supervised classification of very high-resolution imagery, linked to a Markov model and Bayesian statistics. Results indicate a significant reduction in emperor penguin numbers, variance in the methodology is relatively high, but provides a best fit estimate of 22% decline over the period equating to a reduction of 1.6% per year. This decline exceeds the predictions of demographic models based on high-emission scenarios. It is unclear whether the sector analyzed here reflects conditions around the entire continent and our results highlight the need to extend the analysis to all sectors of Antarctica to determine whether these trends are reflected elsewhere.

 Enhancing sustainable rice production is crucial for global food security. Here we demonstrate that 0.1 mg kg‒1selenium-engineered nanomaterials promote rice (Oryza sativa L.) tillering and yield by optimizing the rhizosphere microbial community, improving nitrogen use efficiency, and modulating plant hormones and growth-related genes. Using pot experiments with five different soils and field trials in China, we found that soil organic carbon strongly influences nanomaterial effectiveness. Field results demonstrated a 10.7% yield increase and a 309.8% rise in grain selenium concentration, with no adverse effects on soil quality. Predictive modeling calculated that selenium-enhanced agriculture could increase profits by +$231.5 ha−1, reduce CO2 emissions by 1.12 Tons ha−1, and produce selenium-rich grains ( ~ 20 μg·100 g−1) to address dietary deficiencies.

 Soil moisture (SM) is a critical variable in land-atmosphere interactions. As an important passive microwave remote sensing dataset, the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) SM has been applied in a variety of scientific studies and applications. However, due to the discontinuous coverage of satellite revisit orbits, the FY-3B SM contains a large range of data gaps, which greatly limit the applicability. To solve this problem, we proposed a one-dimensional deep learning network-based time series reconstruction model called TTP (Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-Transformer Parallel) model, which makes full use of the TCN to capture short-term dynamic changes and the Transformer to obtain long-term dependencies, thus, extracting local and global features of the one-dimensional time series simultaneously. Based on the proposed TTP model, a global, daily, spatially seamless FY-3B SM dataset from 12 July 2011 to 19 August 2019 was generated. The performance of TTP was examined using two types of experiments: 1) in-situ data validation (the in-situ data at the same location were served as the reference); 2) original FY-3B SM validation (gaps were simulated by randomly masking the observations, with the original FY-3B SM as the reference). The TTP-based global, daily, spatially seamless dataset presents great consistency with the in-situ data, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0900 m3/m3. Additionally, the reconstructed FY-3B SM based on TTP is consistently more accurate than four benchmarks (i.e., the self-supervised learning for interpolation (SSLI), the multivariate time series imputation method (MITST), the ModernTCN, and the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS)). Moreover, the reconstructed FY-3B SM demonstrates reliable accuracy across various missing data simulated with different proportions and continuous lengths. The TTP can provide methodological support for large-scale remote sensing data reconstruction, and the generated dataset can provide data support for research in fields such as soil science and hydrology.

 Atmospheric concentrations and formation mechanisms of particulate nitrosamines and nitramines were investigated in Seoul, South Korea during spring 2019. The total concentration of seven particulate nitrosamines was 17.51 ± 16.74 ng/m3, with nitroso-dibutylamine (NDBA, 7.86 ± 8.59 ng/m3) being the predominant species, while the sum of two nitramines was 0.70 ± 0.52 ng/m3. Correlation analysis showed that nitro(so) compounds were correlated with both primary emission markers (CO, PAHs) and factors associated with secondary formation (the ratio of total nitroso compounds to PM2.5, and liquid water content). Box model simulations estimated that atmospheric reactions contributed 24.4 ± 25.2 % and 55.4 ± 27.0 % to particulate N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrodimethylamine (DMN) formation, respectively. Multilinear regression analysis identified ozone as the strongest predictor for both measured NDMA (β = 1.035, p < 0.01) and DMN (β = 0.893, p < 0.05) concentrations, although this correlation likely reflects the non-linear relationship between NOx and O3 due to O3 titration in NOx-saturated conditions rather than direct ozonation effects. Sensitivity analyses revealed that both compounds responded positively to NO2 increases through enhanced N2O3 and N2O4 formation, while NO increases showed differential effects: promoting NDMA formation while having minimal impact on DMN concentrations due to their distinct formation pathways. These findings demonstrate the complex atmospheric chemistry of nitro(so) compounds in urban environments and highlight the importance of NOx chemistry in their formation."

 In recent studies available in literature, long-range transport was suggested to play a main role in the motion of microplastics in the free atmosphere, whereas emission sources are located in the planetary boundary layer. In this framework, the Lagrangian particle dispersion model MILORD was used both in forward and in backward modes to investigate the potential effectiveness of the transport and exchange of microplastics between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere. Two pioneering case studies from the literature were considered. The first where microplastics were detected in the free atmosphere above Madrid region, the second where microplastics were collected in the air at the top-mountain site of Pic Du Midi in the French Pyrenees. The simulations showed that the long-range transport plays the main role in determining the presence of microplastics in the free atmosphere above Madrid, while the emissions from the city affect mostly the air in the boundary layer, at regional scale in the surrounding area. The long-range transport towards Pic Du Midi site pointed out also potential contributions connected to the exchange between the marine environments and the atmosphere and to possible dust events from North Africa."

 The seasonal cycle of precipitation in South America (SA) peaks in intensity during austral summer (DJF), contributing up to 80% of the total annual rainfall. This seasonality is influenced by variability at different time-scales. At the subseasonal range, there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms controlling high-frequency transients (8–20 days) of precipitation, which accounts for ∼60% of the total DJF subseasonal variance. Our results show that the observed high-frequency variability features a dipole pattern in SA, whose phase is controlled by the complex interplay between upper-tropospheric Rossby waves, remotely triggered by variability in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) convective activity, and regional low-tropospheric moisture transport and topography. The nature of the remotely-generated signal is further identified in sensitivity experiments with a Linear Baroclinic Model. Our results indicate that this teleconnection pattern can be used as a potential tool for subseasonal precipitation predictability, and that addressing model biases in simulating the spatio-temporal characteristics of SPCZ precipitation is important for near-hemispheric climate projections."

 This study investigates the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) updating strategy in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model during a heatwave event over the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea in July 2019. The MM5 revised Surface Layer and Yonsei University Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes were used and wind field at 10 m, air potential temperature, surface fluxes, and planetary boundary layer height were examined. Generally, the greatest impacts over the sea were observed within 20 km of the shoreline. We found an underestimation of the modeled SST in non-updated SST simulations during the heatwave episode that was propagated into the atmosphere, leading to a cold bias of 2-m potential temperature up to 2.5 K onshore. In heatwave conditions the most common surface layer stability class was very unstable, and its frequency increased when the SST was updated, particularly near the coast, revealing that SST updating leads to greater dominance of thermal turbulent mixing of surface fluxes in the heatwave period studied. Sensible and latent heat fluxes across stability regimes were analyzed, and latent heat flux showed greater sensitivity to SST updating and the highest magnitudes. However, PBL height variations between SST-updated and non-updated simulations presented a greater sensitivity to sensible heat flux. On average, during the heatwave period, the planetary boundary layer height in simulations with updated SST increased by 75 m onshore, compared to a smaller increase of 26 m offshore, which highlights the greater sensitivity in the onshore region and their impact on vertical modeled profiles. These results emphasize the importance of an accurate representation of boundary layer conditions on numerical weather prediction models, as well as illustrating the nonlinear behavior on the surface layer and PBL scheme, particularly important under heatwaves."

We investigate stratospheric O3 as a driver of this spread by altering its concentration by 50 % and analysing the impact on CO2 forcing. Our experiments show a significant effect on stratospheric temperature that impacts instantaneous radiative forcing, primarily due to the influence on longwave emission. However, the impact on ERF is minimal. 
 Addressing the cause of inter-model spread in carbon dioxide (CO2) radiative forcing is essential for reducing uncertainty in estimates of climate sensitivity. Recent studies have demonstrated that a large proportion of this spread arises from variance in model base-state climatology, particularly the specification of stratospheric temperature, which itself plays a dominant role in determining the magnitude of CO2 forcing. Here, we investigate stratospheric ozone (O3) as a cause of inter-model differences in stratospheric temperature, and hence its role as a contributing factor to spread in CO2 radiative forcing. We use the Norwegian Earth System Model 2 (NorESM2) to analyse the impact of systematic increases and decreases in stratospheric O3 on the magnitude of 4xCO2 effective radiative forcing (ERF) and its components. Firstly, we demonstrate that the accurate estimation of instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) requires the use of host-model radiative transfer calculations. Secondly, we show that a 50 % increase or decrease in the stratospheric O3 concentration leads to significant differences in the base-state stratospheric temperature, ranging from +6 to −9 K, respectively. These experiments impact IRF primarily due to the influence of the base-state stratospheric temperature on the emission of outgoing longwave radiation, with the spectral overlap of CO2 and O3 playing a subsidiary role. However, the impact on IRF does not result in a correspondingly large spread in CO2 ERF. We conclude that inter-model differences in stratospheric O3 concentration are, therefore, not predominantly responsible for inter-model spread in CO2 ERF."

Interfacial BOMD (Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics) simulations illustrated that FSA-mediated SO3 hydrolysis at the gas–liquid interface occurs through a stepwise mechanism and can be completed within a few picoseconds. ACDC (Atmospheric Clusters Dynamics Code) kinetic simulations indicated that FSA significantly enhances cluster formation rates in the H2SO4–NH3 system. 
 Although the nucleation route driven by sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and ammonia (NH3) primarily dominates new particle formation (NPF) in the atmosphere, exploring the role of other trace species in the H2SO4–NH3 system is crucial for a more comprehensive insight into NPF processes. Formic sulfuric anhydride (FSA) has been observed in the atmospheric environment and is found in abundance in atmospheric fine particles. Nevertheless, its effect on SO3 hydrolysis and NPF remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the enhancing effect of FSA on gaseous and interfacial SO3 hydrolysis as well as its impact on H2SO4–NH3-driven NPF occurring through quantum chemical calculations, Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) kinetics combined with Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD). Gaseous-phase findings indicate that FSA-catalyzed SO3 hydrolysis is nearly barrierless. At an [FSA] = 107 molecules cm−3, this reaction competes effectively with SO3 hydrolysis in the presence of HNO3 (109 molecules cm−3), HCOOH (108 molecules cm−3) and H2SO4 (106 molecules cm−3) in the range of 280.0–320.0 K. At the gas–liquid nanodroplet interface, BOMD simulations reveal that FSA-mediated SO3 hydrolysis follows a stepwise mechanism, completing within a few picoseconds. Notably, FSA enhances the formation rate of H2SO4–NH3 clusters by over 105 times in regions with relatively high [FSA] at elevated temperatures. Additionally, the interfacial FSA− ion has the ability to appeal precursor species for particle formation from the gaseous phase to the water nanodroplet interface, thereby facilitating particle growth. These results present new insights into both the pathways of H2SO4 formation and aerosol particle growth in the polluted boundary layer."

The sea spray aerosol generated from three natural seawater samples was found to act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) via immersion freezing. 
 Although several studies have shown that sea spray aerosol (SSA) has the potential to act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) impacting cloud formation, there is a lack of marine INP studies in tropical latitudes. This is partly due to the unavailability of local oceanographic cruises that perform aerosol–cloud interaction studies in the tropics, as well as the scarcity of appropriate aerosol and cloud microphysics instrumentation. The present study shows the development of the UNAM-MARine Aerosol Tank (UNAM-MARAT; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), a device that simulates wave breaking to generate SSA particles with the main purpose of characterizing their physicochemical properties including their ice-nucleating abilities. The UNAM-MARAT was characterized using Instant Ocean Sea Salt, and its potential to study ambient seawater was evaluated with seawater samples collected from the Port of Veracruz (PoV) in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bay of Acapulco (BoA), and the Bay of Santiago-Manzanillo (BoSM) in the Mexican Pacific Ocean. The portable and automatic UNAM-MARAT is able to generate aerosol particle concentrations as high as 2000 cm−3 covering a wide range of sizes, from 30 nm to 10 µm, similar to those found in the ambient marine boundary layer. The SSA generated from the three natural seawater samples was found to act as INPs via immersion freezing, with INP concentrations as high as 130.7 L−1. The particles generated from the BoA seawater samples were the most efficient INPs, reporting the highest ice-active site density (ns) values between −20 and −30 °C. Our results also show the direct relationship between particle size and its composition. Larger particles (> 1 µm) were found to be enriched in sodium chloride. In contrast, the fraction of Ca2+, Mg2+, and NO3- was found to increase with decreasing particle size from 10 µm to 320 nm. This suggests important differences in the presence of dissolved organic material in the submicron particles related to the sampling zone and possibly the behavior of the SSA."

 The Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) general circulation model with an upper-atmospheric extension (UA-ICON) in the configuration with the physics package for numerical weather prediction (NWP) is presented with optimized parameter settings for the non-orographic and orographic gravity wave drag (GWD) parameterizations as UA-ICON(NWP) (version ua-icon-2.1). We implemented optimized parameter settings for the GWD parameterizations to achieve more realistic mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) temperatures and zonal winds. The parameter optimization is based on perpetual January simulations targeting the thermal and dynamic states of the MLT and the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere. The climatology and variability of the Northern Hemisphere stratospheric winter circulation improve widely when applying UA-ICON with the NWP physics package compared to UA-ICON with ECHAM physics. The thermal and dynamic states of the MLT of the re-tuned UA-ICON(NWP) are likewise improved compared with UA-ICON(NWP) using default settings. A statistical evaluation of UA-ICON(NWP) reveals a slight improvement in the stratosphere–mesosphere coupling compared to UA-ICON(ECHAM). The cold summer mesopause, the warm winter stratopause, and the related wind reversals are reasonably simulated. Furthermore, the GWD parameter optimization significantly improves the frequency of major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). However, the seasonal distribution needs improvement, and the relative frequency of split-vortex SSWs is underestimated compared to reanalyses, as is the zonal wavenumber-2 preconditioning of SSWs.

In this study, we introduce a novel kinetic framework that distinguishes surface reaction kinetics (kc) from conventional solution-phase kinetics (kb), using nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) as a model catalyst with high adsorption capacity and exceptional efficacy in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. By directly analyzing the selective oxidation of fully adsorbed para-substituted phenolic compounds (p-PCs), we precisely quantified kc and established robust QSAR models with remarkable linear correlations (R2 = 0.862–0.912) to molecular descriptors such as Hammett constant (σ), highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO), and ionization potential (IP). In contrast, kb-based models showed weaker correlations (R2 = 0.363–0.551), reflecting interference from adsorption–desorption dynamics. This distinction underscores the limitations of solution-phase kinetics in systems with strong adsorption properties and highlights the enhanced mechanistic understanding and predictive power of surface-specific models. Further analysis revealed surface-selective oxidation via an electron transfer pathway, predominantly governed by the electronic properties of p-PCs rather than their adsorption affinity. These findings provide a valuable approach to accurately capture surface reactivity and predicting pollutant behavior in heterogeneous sorption–oxidation systems."

However, the complexity of the wastewater treatment processes, coupled with numerous control parameters and influencing factors, makes intelligent assessment and monitoring challenging. Traditional data mining and machine learning (ML) approaches often overlook partial multimodal factors such as applied treatment process technologies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, this study proposed a multimodal learning (MML)-based framework for predicting effluent water quality and toxicity in WWTPs. Representation fusion and decision fusion strategies were adopted to optimize the MML models’ performance. Additionally, a novel 3C-Encoding strategy was proposed to tackle the challenges of encoding process information. The results demonstrated that MML models achieved significant improvements over traditional methods (R2 increase ranging from 0.057 to 0.234). The final MML models exhibited remarkable performance with an average R2 of 0.874 for water quality and an R2 of 0.904 for toxicity.

This could overlook the sensitive toxicity end point and key toxicants due to the random experiment selection, or it might incur high expenditures due to toxicity testing of multiple end points. In this context, a key toxicity-mechanism-based new effect-directed analysis strategy was established. The strategy is based on the key toxicity mechanisms from the transcriptome to determine subsequent toxicity tests and chemical analyses to achieve the efficient, rational, and focused identification of key toxicants in mixtures. Then, this strategy was applied to the Yangtze River samples. By transcriptome testing, the nerve growth factor and neurotrophin binding pathways showed the highest detection rate, indicating that the key toxicity mechanism is neurotoxicity. Zebrafish behavior tests were further chosen for neurotoxicity effect evaluation, and they showed significant inhibition in 64% of the samples. On the other hand, 38 and 94 neurotoxicants in samples were identified via targeted and pseudotargeted screening from 3363 potential toxicants.

Using marine medaka as a model, this study investigated and compared the transgenerational and multigenerational neurotoxic effects on fish. The environmentally realistic concentration of TCS can induce hyperlocomotor activities and increase heart rate, while higher concentrations (>500 μg/L) can inhibit hatching and cause cardiovascular malformations and neurotransmitter imbalances. Parental (F0) exposure to TCS resulted in transgenerational effects on locomotor activities manifested in F2, alongside with alterations in phototransduction and cell adhesion pathways. Global DNA methylation analyses indicated that the observed transgenerational effects are mediated through relevant epigenetic changes. Multigenerational exposure to TCS increased locomotor activities from F1 to F3, which is associated with changes in the expression of genes related to eye structure, phototransduction, and lipid and retinol metabolisms, thereby affecting energy metabolism and visual function.

While rhodochrosite, a mineral commonly found in anaerobic environments, forms manganese oxide (MnOx) films upon exposure to oxygen, little is known about its role in the fate and transport of pollutants, including eARGs. This study explored how the incorporation of iron (Fe) into the rhodochrosite crystal lattice influenced its reactivity and subsequent interactions with eARGs. To this end, we systematically tuned the Fe content in rhodochrosite and compared its effect on eARG encapsulation to that of Fe-free rhodochrosite. At a Fe:Mn molar ratio of 20:80 (RCF20), the MnOx film exhibited a growth rate constant of 0.09 h–1, approximately 265 times greater than that of the Fe-free rhodochrosite. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provided in situ observation of eARGs undergoing anaerobic adsorption and aerobic encapsulation within the MnOx film. Desorption experiments confirmed the stable encapsulation of the eARGs. The incorporation of Fe into rhodochrosite enhanced the eARG encapsulation efficiency, a finding validated with three different environmental water samples. The accelerated growth of MnOx films in Fe-incorporated rhodochrosite was attributed to a reduced bandgap, facilitating faster electron transfer during oxidation. These results introduce a novel mechanism for the stabilization of eARGs in the environment through adsorption and encapsulation within oxidized mineral films. Importantly, Fe incorporation significantly enhanced this process, offering new insights into natural self-purification mechanisms for mitigating antibiotic resistance and providing a potential strategy for controlling eARG dissemination."

Herein, the selective ratio of three kinds of representative cations (alkali metal ions, bivalent cations, and polyatomic cations) and their underlying Eyring’s enthalpy and entropy of activation for transporting through regular confined channels under pressure, concentration gradient, and electric field were quantified. Compared with the diffusion-only process, the increase in the enthalpic barriers under external pressure was attributed to the increase in the degree of ion dehydration and deformation of the ion’s own structure, especially for polyatomic ions (NH4+ and TMA+) with lower hydration energies. Moreover, the splitting of the integrated ion fluxes under pressure by the DSPM-DE model further demonstrated the enhancement of ion dehydration by forced convection, which reduced the ion transport variability under steric sieving effects while increasing the ion fluxes. The ion selectivity was greatest for electromigration, but 60-fold higher voltage (about 20 V) was required for reaching equal ion fluxes as pressure-driven transport. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that compared with the ion migration alone under an electric field, osmotic pressure in concentration diffusion and cotransport of ions and water under pressure increased the transmembrane energy barriers.

However, Pt catalysts are particularly attractive, especially in sulfur-containing environments, where commercial Pd catalysts are more susceptible to sulfur poisoning. Therefore, developing highly active Pt sites and gaining a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms governing methane combustion over Pt catalysts is essential. In this study, we present a highly active stannic oxide supported platinum catalyst (Pt/SnO2) for stable low-temperature methane combustion, achieving a T90 as low as 390 °C at a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60,000 mL·gcat–1·h–1.

The superior SO2 tolerance of Pt/SnO2 was demonstrated by the stability of methane conversion at 500 °C, with only a minor reduction observed during the long-term online test. Characterization results indicate that the Pt atoms on SnO2 are electron-deficient and predominantly adopt a crowded configuration. In situ studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electron-deficient, crowded Pt atoms enhance the chemisorption of CH4 molecules by withdrawing the electrons from CH4, resulting in activated CH4 with an elongated C–H bond.

Conventional nanofiltration membranes struggle with micropollutant removal due to inadequate steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions. This study focused on regulating micropollutant interfacial partitioning by constructing an enhanced separation interface for nanofiltration membranes. Three types of amino acids were introduced into interfacial polymerization to fabricate the amino acid-modified nanofiltration membranes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed how amino acids regulate monomer diffusion and enable in situ chemical modification. Membrane performance evaluations showed an improved micropollutant removal by the modified membranes. Notably, the rejection of the modified membrane for neutral and positively charged micropollutants can reach up to twice that of the control membrane. The micropollutant interfacial partitioning behavior was elucidated through quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements and calculation analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of interface-facilitated micropollutant removal. Additionally, the modified membrane also exhibited enhanced antifouling properties, mitigating the negative impact of the fouling layer on the micropollutant rejection.

However, for the associated convective cells, WRF overestimates the 30‐dBZ echo top height, cell area, and maximum radar reflectivity compared to radar observations. This overestimation is potentially due to under‐resolved entrainment processes, an overestimated merging frequency, and the overestimation of updraft intensity. Furthermore, the model exhibits a deficiency in simulating congestus clouds, showing a more rapid transition from shallow to deep convection compared to observed behavior. Moreover, observations indicate stronger, deeper, and wider clouds when merging happens. Conversely, in simulations, the merging process does not necessarily lead to higher or longer‐lived cells, as many cases experience rapid and frequent merging and splitting which may result in more variance in convective updraft velocity during the convection lifetime."

This study attempts to throw detailed light on how spring TP warming influences EPCA, with a particular focus on the role of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) as an intermediary. Warming in central TP since 2000 has altered meridional temperature gradients at the surface and troposphere, shifting the East Asian jet northward and resulting an anomalous anticyclone over the TP and a cyclonic anomaly over western TP. Concurrently, the weakening of the Middle East jet has triggered a cyclonic anomaly over the Arabian Sea and Indian Peninsula (IP), enhancing moisture convergence and increasing precipitation over northeastern IP. The associated diabatic heating has further intensified the cyclonic anomaly over central IP, which persists into June and promotes northward moisture transportation. Combined with the anomalous cyclone over western TP, these changes have contributed to the observed increase in EPCA. In July, the cyclonic anomaly over central IP, located further west, facilitates eastward moisture transport across northern IP. These anomalies, situated west of the monsoon trough, reflect a seasonal westward shift of the ISM and a strengthening of the South Asian High (SAH). This shift drives the development of cyclonic anomalies over eastern Central Asia and anticyclonic anomalies over western Central Asia. Meanwhile, increased low‐latitude moisture transportation to the central‐western TP and Central Asia further enhances precipitation in central TP, promoting an increase in EPCA."

 The generation of self-tolerant repertoires of T cells depends on the expression of peripheral self antigens in the thymic epithelium1 and the presence of small populations of cells that mimic the diverse phenotypes of peripheral tissues2–7. Whereas the molecular underpinnings of self-antigen expression have been extensively studied8, the developmental origins and differentiation pathways of thymic mimetic cells remain to be identified. Moreover, the histological identification of myoid and other peripheral cell types as components of the thymic microenvironment of many vertebrate species9 raises questions regarding the evolutionary origin of this unique tolerance mechanism. Here we show that during mouse development, mimetic cells appear in the microenvironment in two successive waves. Cells that exhibit transcriptional signatures characteristic of muscle, ionocyte, goblet and ciliated cells emerge before birth, whereas others, such as those that mimic enterohepatic cells and skin keratinocytes, appear postnatally. These two groups also respond differently to modulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools caused by deletions of Foxn1 and Ascl1, expression of a hypomorphic variant of the transcription factor FOXN1, and overexpression of the signalling molecules BMP4 and FGF7. Differences in mimetic cell populations were also observed in thymic microenvironments reconstructed by replacement of mouse Foxn1 with evolutionarily ancient Foxn1/4 gene family members, including the Foxn4 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the Foxn4 and Foxn1 genes of a cartilaginous fish. Whereas some cell types, such as ciliated cells, develop in the thymus in the absence of FOXN1, mimetic cells that appear postnatally, such as enterohepatic cells, require the activity of the vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1. The thymus of cartilaginous fishes and the thymoid of lampreys, a representative of jawless vertebrates, which exhibit an alternative adaptive immune system10, also harbour cells that express genes encoding peripheral tissue components such as the liver-specific protein transthyretin. Our findings suggest an evolutionary model of successive changes of thymic epithelial genetic networks enabling the coordinated contribution of peripheral antigen expression and mimetic cell formation to achieve central tolerance for vertebrate-specific innovations of tissues such as the liver11,12.

 Understanding thermal transport mechanisms across material interfaces is crucial for advancing semiconductor technologies, particularly in miniaturized devices operating under extreme power densities1,2. Although the interface phonon-mediated processes are theoretically established3–6 as the dominant mechanism for interfacial thermal transport in semiconductors7, their nanoscale dynamics remain experimentally elusive owing to challenges in measuring the temperature and non-equilibrium phonon distributions across the buried interface8–11. Here we overcome these limitations by using in situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an electron microscope to nanoscale profile temperature gradients across the AlN–SiC interface during thermal transport and map its non-equilibrium phonon occupations at sub-nanometre resolution. We observe a sharp temperature drop within about 2 nm across the interface, enabling direct extraction of relative interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). During thermal transport, the mismatch of phonon modes’ thermal conductivity at the interface causes substantial non-equilibrium phonons nearby, making the populations of interface modes different under forward and reverse heat flow and also leading to marked changes in the modal temperature of AlN optical phonons within about 3 nm of the interface. These results reveal the phonon transport dynamics at the (sub-)nanoscale and establish the inelastic phonon scattering mechanism involved by interface modes, offering valuable insights into the engineering of thermal interfaces.

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early Universe, in tension with galaxy-formation models1–3. At the low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust typical in early galaxies, the formation of molecular hydrogen and its connection to star formation remain poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in predominantly atomic gas at low metallicity4,5, in contrast to molecular gas at higher metallicities6. Despite repeated searches7, cold molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% solar metallicity8. Here we report the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy Leo P (refs. 9,10) with JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) observing mode. These observations place a lower limit on Leo P’s molecular gas content, and modelling of the photodissociation region illuminated by the O star suggests a compact (≤2.6 pc radius), approximately 104 M⊙ cloud. We also report a stringent upper limit on carbon monoxide (CO) emission from a deep search with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our results highlight the power of MIRI-MRS to characterize even small ultraviolet-illuminated molecular clouds in the low-metallicity regime, in which the traditional observational tracer CO is uninformative. This discovery pushes the limiting metallicity at which molecular gas is present in detectable quantities more than a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of the interstellar medium in early galaxies.

 The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital security1,2 and applications that fairly distribute resources3,4. However, existing random number generators have limitations—the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators5 are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators6–9 can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol forms the basis for a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched10. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7,434 out of 7,454 attempts—a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error multiplied by actual success probability bounded by 2−64.

 Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs)1–4. Spatially confining charge carriers using nanocrystal/quantum dots5–9, low-dimensional perovskites10–13 and ultrathin perovskite layers14 have all been used to improve the external quantum efficiency of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). However, most strongly space-confined perovskites suffer from severe Auger recombination, ion migration and thermal instability, resulting in limited brightness and operational lifetime6,7,10–12,14–17. Here, we report an alternative strategy based on weakly space-confined, large-grained crystals of all-inorganic perovskite. Sacrificial additives, namely, hypophosphorous acid and ammonium chloride, were used to induce nucleation and crystallization of caesium lead bromide, resulting in monocrystal grains with minimized trap density and a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Benefiting from the high carrier mobility and suppressed Auger recombination, we obtained efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency reaching 22.0%, which remained above 20% at a high current density near 1,000 mA cm−2 and a brightness of over 1,167,000 cd m−2. Furthermore, benefiting from the suppressed ion migration and better thermal stability, the extrapolated half-lifetime of the weakly space-confined PeLEDs increased to 185,600 h under an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2 at room temperature. Our work is a new approach for designing efficient, bright and stable PeLEDs for real applications.

 Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important to marine life and are essential tools for studying ocean processes1. Two different frameworks have arisen regarding marine TEI cycling: reversible scavenging favours water-column control on TEI distributions2–5, and seafloor boundary exchange emphasizes sedimentary imprints on water-column biogeochemistry6,7. These two views lead to disparate interpretations of TEI behaviours8–10. Here we use rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes as exemplar tracers of particle scavenging11 and boundary exchange6,7,12. We integrate these data with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis to propose a general framework for marine TEI cycling. We show that, for elements with greater affinity for manganese oxide than biogenic particles, scavenging is a net sink throughout the water column, contrary to a common assumption for reversible scavenging3,13. In this case, a benthic flux supports increasing elemental concentrations with water depth. This sedimentary source consists of two components: one recycled from elements scavenged by water-column particles, and another newly introduced to the water column through marine silicate weathering inside sediment8,14,15. Abyssal oxic diagenesis drives this benthic source, and exerts a strong influence on water-column biogeochemistry through seafloor geometry and bottom-intensified turbulent mixing16,17. Our findings affirm the role of authigenic minerals, often overshadowed by biogenic particles, in water-column cycling18, and suggest that the abyssal seafloor, often regarded as inactive, is a focus of biogeochemical transformation19,20. Rare earth element and neodymium isotope data combined with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis suggest that the abyssal seafloor is a key driver of trace-metal biogeochemical cycles."

 Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle’ Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1–3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4–10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11–19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.

 Vision enables many animals to perform spatial reasoning from remote locations1. By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells2,3, the relationship between place cells and active visual behaviour is unknown. Here we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behaviour that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast ballistic head movements called ‘head saccades’4,5. On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that is relevant to the animal in each moment. This process allows the hippocampus to implement both local and remote spatial functions. Place cells in the chickadee hippocampus coherently represent locations in space, whether physically visited or viewed, enabling spatial reasoning at a distance through a unified process coordinated by head saccades."

 Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate1,2. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development3–9. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue’s natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development.

Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5–8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.

 Although cell-fate specification is generally attributed to transcriptional regulation, emerging data also indicate a role for molecules linked with intermediary metabolism. For example, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which fuels energy production and biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is also a co-factor for chromatin-modifying enzymes1–3. Nevertheless, whether TCA-cycle metabolites regulate cell fate during tissue homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that TCA-cycle enzymes are expressed in the intestine in a heterogeneous manner, with components of the αKG dehydrogenase complex4–6 upregulated in the absorptive lineage and downregulated in the secretory lineage. Using genetically modified mouse models and organoids, we reveal that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), the enzymatic subunit of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, has a dual, lineage-specific role. In the absorptive lineage, OGDH is upregulated by HNF4 transcription factors to maintain the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of enterocytes. In the secretory lineage, OGDH is downregulated through a process that, when modelled, increases the levels of αKG and stimulates the differentiation of secretory cells. Consistent with this, in mouse models of colitis with impaired differentiation and maturation of secretory cells, inhibition of OGDH or supplementation with αKG reversed these impairments and promoted tissue healing. Hence, OGDH dependency is lineage-specific, and its regulation helps to direct cell fate, offering insights for targeted therapies in regenerative medicine.

 Sex inequalities in cancer are well documented, but the current limited understanding is hindering advances in precision medicine and therapies1. Consideration of ethnicity, age and sex is essential for the management of cancer patients because they underlie important differences in both incidence and response to treatment2,3. Age-related hormone production, which is a consistent divergence between the sexes, is underestimated in cancers that are not recognized as being hormone dependent4–6. Here, we show that premenopausal women have increased vulnerability to cancers, and we identify the cell–cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a crucial component in the oestrogen response in various cancers, including melanoma. In a mouse model of melanoma, we discovered an oestrogen-sensitizing pathway connecting E-cadherin, β-catenin, oestrogen receptor-α and GRPR that promotes melanoma aggressiveness in women. Inhibiting this pathway by targeting GRPR or oestrogen receptor-α reduces metastasis in mice, indicating its therapeutic potential. Our study introduces a concept linking hormone sensitivity and tumour phenotype in which hormones affect cell phenotype and aggressiveness. We have identified an integrated pro-tumour pathway in women and propose that targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor with drugs not commonly used for cancer treatment could be more effective in treating E-cadherin-dependent cancers in women. This study emphasizes the importance of sex-specific factors in cancer management and offers hope of improving outcomes in various cancers.

 Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules1,2, but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees (Taxus species)3. Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research4. Within Taxus’ large, enzyme-rich genome5, we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3’-N-debenzoyl-2’-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets.

 Preventing gender disparities in mathematics is a worldwide preoccupation1,2. In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space3–8. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that ‘girls are bad at maths’. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4 months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1 year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions.

 Chest radiography frequently serves as baseline imaging for most lung diseases1. Deep learning has great potential for automating the interpretation of chest radiography2. However, existing chest radiographic deep learning models are limited in diagnostic scope, generalizability, adaptability, robustness and extensibility. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Ark+, a foundation model applied to chest radiography and pretrained by cyclically accruing and reusing the knowledge from heterogeneous expert labels in numerous datasets. Ark+ excels in diagnosing thoracic diseases. It expands the diagnostic scope and addresses potential misdiagnosis. It can adapt to evolving diagnostic needs and respond to novel diseases. It can learn rare conditions from a few samples and transfer to new diagnostic settings without training. It tolerates data biases and long-tailed distributions, and it supports federated learning to preserve privacy. All codes and pretrained models have been released, so that Ark+ is open for fine-tuning, local adaptation and improvement. It is extensible to several modalities. Thus, it is a foundation model for medical imaging. The exceptional capabilities of Ark+ stem from our insight: aggregating various datasets diversifies the patient populations and accrues knowledge from many experts to yield unprecedented performance while reducing annotation costs3. The development of Ark+ reveals that open models trained by accruing and reusing knowledge from heterogeneous expert annotations with a multitude of public (big or small) datasets can surpass the performance of proprietary models trained on large data. We hope that our findings will inspire more researchers to share code and datasets or federate privacy-preserving data to create open foundation models with diverse, global expertise and patient populations, thus accelerating open science and democratizing AI for medicine.

 Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1–3. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central nervous system4. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents—an effect that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice.

 Accurate observations of surface mass balance are pivotal for assessing the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass balance and its link to climate dynamics. Studying regional changes in surface mass balance is challenging due to limited on-site observations and the susceptibility of measurements from snow pits and ice cores to localized disturbances. Satellite data and short-term localized measurements suggest no significant changes or a possible increase in surface mass balance across the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in recent decades, but these findings lack large-scale validation. Here we use observations from mass balance stakes to show a significant negative surface mass balance trend along the inland transect from Zhongshan Station to the Antarctic Ice Sheet summit (Dome A) during the period 2005–2020. The mean surface mass balance trend for the inland section over the 15-year period is −2.01 ± 0.37 kg m−2 yr–2, indicating a 35.5% decrease. This decrease is probably linked to enhanced zonal winds in the upper atmosphere and a deepened low-pressure system in the southern Indian Ocean. The former weakens meridional air transport to Antarctica, while the latter strengthens offshore winds over the study area, reducing onshore water vapour transport. These findings can be used to evaluate and improve regional climate models and refine estimates of contemporary Antarctic mass balance trends. Mass balance measurements from inland East Antarctica suggest a negative trend in surface mass balance from 2005 to 2020, probably associated with enhanced zonal winds."

 The Mw 7.8 Kahramanmaraş/Pazarcik earthquake was larger and more destructive than was expected based on historical seismicity in southeastern Turkey in the past few centuries, raising questions about the nature of rupture initiation and propagation. Here we analyse near-field ground velocity records from seismometers to constrain the rupture propagation speed along the Narli splay fault, which hosted the initial rupture that eventually reached the main East Anatolian Fault. The measured particle velocities provide evidence for an early transition of the rupture from sub-Rayleigh to supershear behaviour, whereby the rupture speed exceeds that of the seismic shear waves. The near-in-situ field observational evidence is consistent with mechanistic understanding of supershear rupture. We estimate the instantaneous supershear rupture propagation speed to have been 1.55 times that of the shear wave speed and the sub-Rayleigh-to-supershear transition length to have been around 19.45 km. This work reveals the value of near-field instrumentation in characterizing the initiation of earthquakes along major faults.

Major inequalities exist within and across countries and by socio-economic backgrounds. 
 Many households worldwide face substantial gaps in decent living standards (DLS), universal and essential material preconditions for achieving well-being and inclusive development. Here, we use subnational Demographic and Health Survey data from 75 low and middle-income countries (1990–2021) to explore the distribution and trends of ten living standards. We estimate that 94.9% of households in our dataset lack the material prerequisites for at least one of the ten standards, and 63.6% for one-third of them. Stark inequalities persist both within and between countries, with regions in sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the most severe deprivations. Despite some improvements, progress remains limited in critical areas such as health care, sanitation, housing, and education. Within countries, rural, agrarian households with low levels of educational attainment are particularly disadvantaged. These granular findings at the subnational level can help direct policy efforts and resources towards those populations most in need.

This study shows that addressing those critiques substantially refines estimates of the places with reforestation potential. 
 Reforestation is a prominent climate change mitigation strategy, but available global maps of reforestation potential are widely criticized and highly variable, which limits their ability to provide robust estimates of both the locations and total area of opportunity. Here we develop global maps that address common critiques, build on a review of 89 reforestation maps created at multiple scales, and present eight reforestation scenarios with varying objectives, including providing ecosystem services, minimizing social conflicts, and delivering government policies. Across scenarios, we find up to 195 Mha (million hectares) are available (2225 TgCO2e (teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalent) per year total net mitigation potential), which is 71–92% smaller than previous estimates because of conservative modeling choices, incorporation of safeguards, and use of recent, high-resolution datasets. This area drops as low as 6 Mha (53 TgCO2e per year total net mitigation potential) if only statutorily protected areas are targeted. Few locations simultaneously achieve multiple objectives, suggesting that a mix of lands and restoration motivations will be needed to capitalize on the many potential benefits of reforestation.

 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic drug targets for a wide range of diseases. Upon activation, GPCRs can initiate several signaling pathways, each with unique therapeutic implications. Therefore, understanding how drugs selectively engage specific signaling pathways becomes paramount. However, achieving this selectivity remains highly challenging. To unravel the underlying multifaceted mechanisms, we integrate systematic mutagenesis of the CB2R, comprehensive profiling of Gαi2 and β-arrestin1 engagements and computer simulations to track the effects of mutations on receptor dynamics. Our research reveals multiple triggers within a complex allosteric communication network (ACN) that converge to preferential CB2R coupling by modulating evolutionarily conserved motifs. Utilizing network path analysis, we find that potent triggers are typically highly connected nodes and are located near regions of high information transmission within the ACN. Our insights highlight the complexity of GPCR signaling and provide a framework for the rational design of drug candidates tailored to evoke specific functional responses, ultimately enhancing the precision and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Nonselective engagement of GPCR signaling pathways by GPCR-targeting drugs can reduce treatment efficacy and cause side effects.

We reveal that ventral hippocampus projections to the lateral hypothalamus encode meal-related memories, and that disruption of this circuit promotes excessive eating. 
 The ability to encode and retrieve meal-related information is critical to efficiently guide energy acquisition and consumption, yet the underlying neural processes remain elusive. Here we reveal that ventral hippocampus (HPCv) neuronal activity dynamically elevates between eating bouts during meal consumption and this response is predictive of performance in a foraging-related memory test for the spatial location of a previously consumed meal. Targeted recombination-mediated ablation of HPCv meal-responsive neurons impairs meal location memory without influencing food motivation or spatial memory for escape location. These HPCv meal-responsive neurons project to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and are enriched in serotonin 2a receptors (5HT2aR). Either chemogenetic silencing of HPCv-to-LHA projections or intra-HPCv 5HT2aR antagonist yielded meal location memory deficits, as well as increased caloric intake driven by shorter temporal intervals between meals. Collective results identify a population of HPCv neurons in male rats that dynamically respond during eating to encode meal-related memories.

 Mechanisms of tumorigenesis in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) remain poorly understood due to its rarity. A subset of SNSCC is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), but it is unclear whether HPV drives tumorigenesis or acts as a neutral bystander. Here, we show that HPV-associated SNSCC shares mutational patterns found in HPV-associated cervical and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, including lack of TP53 mutations, hotspot mutations in PI3K and FGFR3, enrichment of APOBEC mutagenesis, viral integration at known hotspots, and frequent epigenetic regulator alterations. We identify HPV-associated SNSCC-specific recurrent mutations in KMT2C, UBXN11, AP3S1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5, with KMT2D and FGFR3 mutations correlating with reduced overall survival. We establish an HPV-associated SNSCC cell line, showing that combinatorial small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TAZ and PI3K synergistically suppresses clonogenicity.

Utilising the unusual sex determination system of Sciaridae flies, this study finds a slower evolution of the X chromosomes which appears to be driven by strong purifying selection. 
 Differences in transmission and ploidy between sex chromosomes and autosomes drive divergent evolutionary trajectories, with sex chromosomes generally evolving faster. Because sex-linked genes are transmitted less frequently, they are under less efficient selection. Conversely, exposure of recessive mutations on haploid sex chromosomes creates more efficient selection. In most systems, these effects occur simultaneously and are confounded. The fly families Sciaridae (fungus gnats) and Cecidomyiidae (gall midges) have X0 sex determination, but males transmit only maternally inherited chromosomes. This phenomenon results in equal transmission of the X and autosomes, allowing the effect of haploid selection to be studied in isolation. We discover that, unlike well-studied systems, X chromosomes diverge more slowly than autosomes in these flies. Using population genomic and expression data, we show that despite the X evolving more adaptively, stronger purifying selection explains slower divergence. Our findings demonstrate the utility of non-Mendelian inheritance systems for understanding fundamental evolutionary processes. X chromosomes evolve faster than autosomes, but confounding factors make this a difficult phenomenon to study.

 Green roofs are often considered barriers against polluted precipitation, but their effectiveness in capturing airborne microplastics remains unclear. Here we evaluate modular green roofs under simulated wet deposition to assess their ability to intercept and retain microplastics. We find that green roofs remove over 97.5% of deposited microplastics. In Shanghai, China, this corresponds to an annual interception of approximately 1.70 × 10¹² particles, or 56.2 tonnes. Higher rainfall intensity slightly improves capture efficiency by increasing moisture and reducing infiltration forces. Fragment-shaped microplastics are more easily retained than fiber-shaped ones. Most particles are trapped in the soil layer, while some are retained by vegetation, although air turbulence may remobilize fibers. Surface and chemical analysis reveals that plastic materials within green roofs themselves can degrade, potentially releasing microplastics in the process. These results show that green roofs can play a valuable role in reducing urban microplastic pollution and offer practical insights for designing future stormwater and air-quality management strategies.

 The Doppler shift observed by single-beam synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to retrieve the radial velocity of ocean surface currents. However, operational marine forecasting centers require full surface current vector fields for data assimilation and forecast validation. To address this need, we propose a method to reconstruct the two-dimensional surface current vector from SAR Doppler shift measurements, under the assumption that ocean mesoscale currents are quasi-geostrophic. In this approach, the known range-directed current velocity derived from SAR Doppler shift measurements is used to estimate the azimuthal component based on the geostrophic approximation. The feasibility of the proposed method is preliminarily assessed by comparing the reconstructed surface current fields with global ocean analysis and forecast products from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The results show a bias of 0.01 m/s and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1 m/s. Additionally, surface current fields in the Gulf Stream and Agulhas Current regions are reconstructed using Sentinel-1A SAR Doppler shift observations and validated against collocated drifting buoy measurements, yielding a bias of 0.05 m/s and a RMSE of 0.19 m/s.

 The importance of conservation agriculture (CA) is undeniable, both for improving soil health and offering a viable path towards achieving carbon neutrality. However, to date, survey statistics on the extent of conservation agriculture were based on farmer declarations or field inspections. This is a major impediment to the promotion or monitoring of conservation agriculture. Here, we collected the management practices of a total of 247 fields under conservation agriculture in the Walloon region of Belgium in 2020–2021, with the aim of developing a classification model for the prediction of conservation agriculture by combining remotely sensed data with census data. We identified seven variables in the model, linked to each of the three main principles of conservation agriculture (crop diversification, maximum soil cover and minimum mechanical soil disturbance). The number of different annual crops and cereals in the rotation was obtained from the agricultural census. For the extent of soil cover, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to obtain a time series of optical remote sensing images (2015–2020, Sentinel-2, Landsat-7, Landsat-8) and precipitation data. We then analyzed the variation of spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) and constructed indicators to distinguish between bare soil and cover crop. For minimum mechanical soil disturbance, in addition to the above data, radar data (Sentinel-1) were also obtained from the GEE platform to establish a tillage practice model. Subsequently, the Random Forest (RF) classification method was used to construct a classification model distinguishing fields under conservation from those under conventional practices. The results of a ten-fold cross-validation showed a good overall accuracy of 92 %. The model was utilized to classify the farming systems in all croplands of the Hesbaye region of Belgium. The results show that 15.5 % (2875 fields) out of 18,516 cropland fields can be classified as conservation agriculture.

 Understanding soil moisture dynamics in crop production is critical for optimising water resource management. The Sentinel satellite missions have significantly contributed to soil moisture monitoring by providing high-resolution, multi-sensor data. This review examines advancements in soil moisture assessment using Sentinel datasets, particularly in crop production. It highlights key challenges, evaluates their impact on monitoring accuracy, and explores potential methodological improvements. Findings indicate that Sentinel-1′s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, particularly VV and VH polarizations, and Sentinel-2′s multispectral indices, such as NDVI and NDMI, are widely integrated with machine learning algorithms to enhance soil moisture estimation. However, dense vegetation and complex topography reduce retrieval accuracy, necessitating sensor fusion and calibration for improved reliability. Sentinel-3 provides valuable surface temperature and land condition data for indirect soil moisture estimation, but its application remains limited due to higher uncertainty compared to SAR and multispectral approaches. Emerging trends suggest that machine and deep learning techniques, such as RF, SVR, and CNN, can enhance data fusion across Sentinel missions. Additionally, preprocessing steps such as RTC, speckle filtering, and the integration of multipolar and polarimetric data with physical backscattering models show promise in mitigating radar backscatter interference. Further development of robust retrieval models that incorporate topography, soil roughness, and texture are essential for improving soil moisture accuracy in diverse agricultural landscapes.

 Land degradation poses a significant threat to ecosystems and livelihoods, particularly in disaster-prone regions. In these settings, the promotion of certain agricultural practices with economic incentives, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) farming, offers a potential solution for enhancing economic stability and mitigating environmental degradation. Despite its promise, the effectiveness of sugarcane as an agricultural intervention remains understudied, especially regarding its environmental benefits. Our study evaluates the impact of sugarcane cultivation in western Nepal, a region highly vulnerable to soil erosion and riverbank degradation due to the presence of flood-prone landscapes. We conducted a geospatial impact evaluation (GIE), which integrated remote sensing data and econometric techniques, including optimal full matching (OFM) and difference-in-differences (DID). We assessed the causal impact of a program promoting sugarcane farming on its adoption and environmental outcomes, measured using multi-temporal satellite imagery, crop phenology, and clustering algorithms, along with machine learning and visual interpretation methods. Our results show that sugarcane adoption increased significantly in both treated and spillover communities, highlighting its potential as a sustainable agricultural practice. However, while uptake was evident, the expected environmental outcomes, such as soil erosion control and riverbank stabilization, did not materialize. This study demonstrates the potential of GIE in evaluating low-cost interventions for sustainable development and provides insights into the role of sugarcane cultivation in promoting climate resilience. The findings underscore the need for complementary interventions and extended timeframes to realize long-term environmental benefits, contributing valuable evidence for policymakers and development practitioners."

 Obtaining regional fine-scale daily Soil Moisture (SM) data is crucial for better understanding carbon and water cycles. Currently, downscaling from passive microwave SM products has become the most commonly utilized approach for generating regional high-resolution SM data, while retrieving SM based on disaggregated brightness Temperature (TB) data gains litter attention. Besides, the relative potentials of these two downscaling approaches remains largely unknown. Therefore, this study comprehensively compared the relatively performances of the two downscaling schemes namely the “retrieving-then-downscaling” and “downscaling-then-retrieving” over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Evaluation results showed that retrieving SM using disaggregated TB significantly outperformed the popular passive microwave SM downscaling method. The averaged R and ubRMSE metrics for downscale-first based SM were 0.62/0.74 and 0.051/0.038 m3/m3 at station/network scales, and were 0.58/0.70 and 0.056/0.041 m3/m3 for the retrieval-first based SM, respectively. Spatially, the downscale-first based SM had lower uncertainty than the retrieval-first based SM over nearly 70 % areas of the QTP. However, due to the strong vegetation scattering effect, it showed two times larger uncertainty than the retrieval-first based SM over densely vegetated regions in the east and southeast. In addition, satisfactory TB downscaling performance could be achieved by leveraging machine learning algorithms and multiple covariables, but need to further reduce additional errors. The superiority of “downscaling-then-retrieving” scheme was independent of models selected for downscaling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the great potential of “downscaling-then-retrieving” method and provides a new insight for generating regional SM data at fine scale."

 Individual trajectories offer insights into human mobility, with data either passively recorded, such as GPS, or actively recorded, such as natural language text. While the former provides detailed movement data, it lacks important context such as personal experiences, which can be obtained from the latter. Extracting trajectories from text can enhance travel experience optimization, historical analysis, and pandemic management. However, existing trajectory extraction methods rely on rule-based frameworks that fail to capture contextual semantics, resulting in limited generalizability and loss of trajectory semantics. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential for contextual reasoning capabilities, their deficient domain-specific knowledge pertinent to trajectory patterns hinders efficient and precise trajectory extraction. To address these limitations, we propose T2TrajLLM, a novel framework that fuses LLMs with domain knowledge through three components: (1) a lightweight trajectory model for structured guidance, (2) a text-to-trajectory transformation model enabling multi-step reasoning, and (3) labelled text-trajectory samples for learning domain-adaptive constraint rules. Central to T2TrajLLM is a prompt method that dynamically fuses these components with LLMs while avoids rigid rule dependency. Evaluated across three heterogeneous datasets, T2TrajLLM achieves ∼8 % higher accuracy than existing methods, demonstrating strong transferability across datasets and extensibility to diverse application requirements.

 Monitoring wildfires has become increasingly critical due to the sharp rise in wildfire incidents in recent years. Optical satellites like Sentinel-2 and Landsat are extensively utilised for mapping burned areas. However, the effectiveness of optical sensors is compromised by clouds and smoke, which obstruct the detection of burned areas. Thus, satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), such as dual-polarisation Sentinel-1 and quad-polarisation RADARSAT-1/-2 C-band SAR, which can penetrate clouds and smoke, are investigated for mapping burned areas. However, there is limited research on using compact polarisation (compact-pol) C-band RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR data for this purpose. This study aims to investigate the capacity of compact polarisation RCM data for burned area mapping through deep learning. Compact-pol m-χ decomposition and Compact-pol Radar Vegetation Index (CpRVI) are derived from the RCM Multi-Look Complex product. A deep-learning-based processing pipeline incorporating ConvNet-based and Transformer-based models is applied for burned area mapping, with three different input settings: using only log-ratio dual-polarisation intensity images, using only compact-pol decomposition plus CpRVI, and using all three data sources. The training dataset comprises 46,295 patches, generated from 12 major wildfire events in Canada. The test dataset includes seven wildfire events from the 2023 and 2024 Canadian wildfire seasons in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec and the Northwest Territories. The results demonstrate that compact-pol m-χ decomposition and CpRVI images significantly complement log-ratio images for burned area mapping. The best-performing Transformer-based model, UNETR, trained with log-ratio, m-χ m-decomposition, and CpRVI data, achieved an F1 Score of 0.718 and an IoU Score of 0.565, showing a notable improvement compared to the same model trained using only log-ratio images (F1 Score: 0.684, IoU Score: 0.557). This is the first study to demonstrate that RCM C-band SAR data and its derived features are effective for burned area mapping."

Therefore, monitoring snow geophysical parameters (SGPs), such as snow density, Snow depth (SD), and snow water equivalent (SWE), is imperative hydrological dynamics and forecasting water availability.

This density range and optimized axial ratio were used to minimise the error between CPDObs and the average CPDMod.

 This study contributes to a better understanding of past climate variability and mesoscale dynamics in the Mediterranean Basin, a region with notable sensitivity to climate change.We investigate the variations of rainfall amount and intensity by analyzing centenary time series in Italy. The study area offers an ideal setting for analyzing these dynamics due to its unique geographical position. The rainfall time series are compared to the climate indices time series to understand the influences of the mesoscale atmospheric teleconnections and of the possible changes in rainfall regimes due to an increase of the sea surface temperatures. The study is conducted by applying statistical methods on more than 100 time series. The results show that most regions of Italy have been affected by a decrease in rainfall amount and an increase in rainfall intensity over the last 200 years. This work also highlights that these patterns are correlated to positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation and to an increase in sea surface temperatures. The trends of climate indices thus suggest a decrease in the amount and an increase in the intensity of future rainfall distribution, with severe consequences in terms of water availability and geo-related risks."

 Polar amplification can exert a profound influence on global climate and extreme weather events in distant regions via teleconnections and atmospheric variability. Although previous have revealed linkages and interactions among temperature anomalies of Earth's three poles, what degree propagations of polar amplification can influence other regions is not fully understood. To fulfill this knowledge gap, we adopted a climate network-based approach to quantify the intensity and pathways of propagation, and identify sensitive regions using the Polar Amplification Index (PAI) originated from three different scenarios of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Our results indicated that the polar amplification and propagation patterns for the Earth's three poles show distinct regional and seasonal differences under different warming levels. With the warming increasing, the stronger strength of propagations tends to be concentrated on the land, and distribution patterns become more stable. Meanwhile, the length of the propagation pathway for polar amplification would be shorter with faster time and stronger strength. Furthermore, we pointed out several polar amplification-sensitive regions, including the around 30°N and 30°S, Barents Sea region near the Arctic Circle. Based on these findings, polar amplification will accelerate much more and induce drastic influences via propagation in the dynamics of global climate patterns unless warming levels are minimized. Our study highlights the significance of enhancing our understanding of projected changes in the polar regions and offers valuable insights to inform strategies for coping with climate change and extreme events."

However, crustal generation remains enigmatic with both plate tectonic and non-plate tectonic modes proposed. In this study, we show that zircons from the ~2.5–billion years ago TTGs in the Eastern Block (EB) of the North China Craton have low water contents (median of 263 parts per million) and high δ18O values (median of 6.22‰) and a negative correlation between them, which suggest a thick hybridized and hydrated mafic source. By contrast, zircon water contents of the adjoining coeval TTGs in the Trans-North China Orogen, formed in a supra-subduction zone setting, are notably higher. These results support a two-stage mantle plume-sagduction process for TTG formation. Our study suggests that Archean continental crust, such as that in the EB, most likely originated from plume-related oceanic plateaus, rather than subduction-related island arc magmatism under a plate tectonic regime."

Epitope recognition is mediated by the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR), and TCRs recognizing clinically relevant epitopes are promising for T cell–based therapies. Starting from a TCR targeting the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1157–165epitope, we built large phage display libraries of TCRs with randomized complementary determining region 3 of the β chain. The TCR libraries were panned against NY-ESO-1, which enabled us to collect thousands of epitope-specific TCR sequences.

How eosinophils populate and affect the complexSchistosomagranulomas remains unclear. Here, we mapped eosinophils across evolutional hepatic granulomas in a mouse model and in a primary wild reservoir for human schistosomiasis in Brazil (water ratNectomys squamipes). With in-depth quantitative image analysis and three-dimensional histological reconstructions of entire granulomas, we find that eosinophils are spatially organized and occupy a major, peripheral niche conserved across space and time in all granuloma stages and both experimental and natural infections. Within this niche, immature and mature eosinophils coinhabit, compartmentalize their major basic protein-1 content, robustly interact with other immune cells, and secrete through piecemeal degranulation. This unveiled niche, unrelated to parasite eggs, challenges the concept of eosinophil as a “helminth killer” cell and invigorates its view as an immunoregulatory cell of the tissue microenvironment inSchistosomagranulomas."

While they redistribute heat, salt, nutrients, and other tracers, their effects on CO2uptake remain uncertain. Using observation-based machine learning to estimate CO2fluxes throughout the lifetimes of thousands of eddies, we show that anticyclonic eddies substantially enhance CO2uptake on average, while cyclonic eddies marginally diminish it. This asymmetry yields an overall net increase in CO2absorption by 9.98 ± 2.28 and 13.82 ± 9.94% in the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream, respectively, major carbon sequestration regions. The primary driver of this enhanced uptake is the downward pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon within anticyclonic eddies. Asymmetric biological responses between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies contribute to the overall eddy-induced CO2flux imbalance. The finding suggests a potential underestimation of the ocean’s capacity for carbon sequestration because of insufficient incorporation of eddies in current observations, emphasizing the need for expanded monitoring in eddy-rich, undersampled regions."

Using high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, we found that LSCs do not form concentric rings, but complex, multilayered, and intertwining assemblies that are connected via a high density of desmosomes and gap junctions. LSCs make multiple converging contacts with the afferent axon via desmosomes. Using optogenetic manipulations of LSCs, we demonstrate not only that their activation drives reliable time-locked spiking in the axon but also that their inactivation significantly elevates the thresholds in situ and increases perceptual thresholds behaviorally.

Beginning our investigation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we identified a mechanism to explain enhanced glucose utilization in cold-adapted BAT. This was characterized by select remodeling of upper glycolysis and pentose cycling to increase oxygen consumption, likely by increasing uncoupling protein 1 activity through the production of reactive oxygen species. Cold-induced remodeling of the plasma proteome appeared to underpin the ability of BAT to modify its fuel preference, stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue and glucose production in the liver.

Caspase-1–dependent tumor pyroptosis releases several inflammatory chemokines, converting αSMA+CAF into iCAFs in a CCR6-dependent manner. This is clinically relevant, as a fibroblast gene signature driven by iCAF markers and collagen type III is enriched in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrary to the current notion, iCAFs, rather than myCAFs, produce collagen III in response to chemotherapy, supporting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs).

This uncoating step that is vital for IAV infection remains to be fully understood. The aggresome processing machinery (APM) plays a relevant but not essential role in this. Here, we reveal a mechanism in which light chain 3 proteins (LC3s) and pericentrin (PCNT) form an adaptor complex that is required for vRNPs binding to the dynein 1 and IAV uncoating at endosomes. This function of LC3s and PCNT is independent from their established role in autophagy and centrosome assembly, respectively. LC3s or PCNT depletion severely impairs IAV cytoplasm entry and infection, which can be further inhibited by additional silencing of histone deacetylase 6, an APM component. Collectively, our results show that IAV has adopted two redundant strategies to hijack the dynein biomolecular motors and facilitate VP uncoating."

To gain insight beyond the short historical record, we reconstruct changes in groundwater levels in western North America during the last glacial termination (LGT, ~20 to 11 thousand years ago) using noble gas isotopes. Our reconstructions indicate remarkable stability of water table depth in a Pacific Northwest aquifer throughout the LGT despite increasing precipitation, closely matching independent Earth system model (ESM) simulations. In the American Southwest, ESM simulations and noble gas isotopes both suggest a pronounced LGT decline in water table depth in in response to decreasing precipitation, indicating distinct regional groundwater responses to climate. Despite the hydrologic simplicity of ESMs, their agreement with proxy reconstructions of past water table depth suggests that these models hold value in understanding groundwater dynamics and projecting large-scale aquifer responses to climate forcing."

Incorporating these data into PK-PD simulations of antibiotic treatment, we find that higher mutation supply increases the probability of resistance, and early adherence to the drug regimen is critical. In vitro studies further support the finding that the second dose in a drug regimen is important for preventing resistance. This work bridges empirical fitness seascapes and computational PK-PD studies, revealing insights into drug resistance."

Here, we investigated the influence of AOM coupled with nitrate and nitrite reduction on soil N2O emissions and the associated microbial interactions. We show that AOM coupled with denitrification markedly reduces soil N2O emissions, with the type I methanotrophMethylobacterspecies collaborating with the Methylophilaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae families to perform key roles. The suppression of N2O emissions by AOM primarily stems from its role in supplying electrons and carbon sources, fueling complete denitrification by associated bacteria. In addition, we uncovered distinct microbial interaction strategies for AOM-coupled nitrate and nitrite reduction. While nitrite reduction necessitates both bacterial cooperation and extracellular electron transfer during its initial stages, nitrate reduction predominantly depends on methanotrophic bacteria alone at the outset. These findings advance our understanding of carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling and underscore AOM’s potential to simultaneously mitigate both CH4and N2O emissions."

By analyzing >2000 canyons, we show that canyon occurrence correlates with the inclination of continental slopes. Onshore orogeny and associated surface processes, long considered key controls on canyon formation, play a subordinate role. Instead, our results suggest slope inclination as the primary control on submarine canyon density. Because continental slope morphology is fundamentally shaped by marine tectonic and thermal processes, these large-scale forces indirectly govern canyon formation and distribution globally.

Here, we use the mesoscale climate model COSMO-CLM to simulate the energy production of a realistic 92 GW wind farm expansion scenario and compare it with that of the wind farm distribution in 2024. The simulations indicate that added inter-farm wakes would cause the annual energy production of 25 out of 69 operational wind farms to decline by over 5%, with 13 of them experiencing reductions exceeding 10%. These annual losses are composed of intermittent wake periods characterized by large production deficits. For instance, the planned Princess Elisabeth zone in Belgian waters is expected to reduce the output of the existing Belgian wind farm cluster by more than 15% during one out of every five 24 h periods with high production potential (  ms−1). Despite these enhanced inter-farm interactions, we find that the overall capacity factor over the basin increases by 1.6%pt after expansion due to the deployment of next-generation turbines and installation at low capacity densities in high-resource zones. However, negative impacts are highly region-dependent and many wind farms may face substantial losses.

Forest loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and logging, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies. Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat, Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a 1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation, logging, settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7000 reference samples to train a global neural network model that classifies the driver of tree cover loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Our results show that permanent agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing 35% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of tree cover loss vary by region, with the leading driver identified as logging in Europe, permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity targets."

Here, we conduct an initial test of the empirical evidence that such investments were made in the context of groundwater extraction in India. Irrigation with groundwater has played a crucial role in India’s rural development, but also made it the world’s largest consumer of groundwater with fast depleting aquifers. We test whether in locations that have extracted greater amounts of water between 1966–2009, there are indications of greater accumulation of household level physical (assets) and human (education and health) capital, presumably through the investment of income generated from irrigation. We document positive correlations between groundwater utilization and the accumulation of physical assets. The results are more mixed for correlations with health and learning outcomes, which are likely the most important for the diversification of income away from farming once irrigation is no longer viable."

A deployment of marine carbon dioxide removal (CDR) for mitigating global warming could therefore also be viewed as a measure for mitigating ocean deoxygenation if, and only if, the respective CDR measure itself does not lead to a larger oxygen loss than the reduction in atmospheric CO2 would prevent. We here review the current state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of various marine CDR (mCDR) options onto ocean oxygen, a key ocean state variable and an essential element for all higher forms of marine life. Using results from global model simulations, we show that biotic approaches, such as ocean fertilization, macroalgae cultivation and sinking, and placement of organic matter that is prone to remineralization, can lead to a loss in seawater dissolved oxygen that is 4–40 times larger than the oxygen gain that would result from the CDR-induced reduction in global warming only. Biotic approaches also tend to enhance the amplitude of the diel cycle in dissolved oxygen, with possible physiological impacts specifically in shallow-water environments of coastal vegetated ecosystem. In contrast, geochemical approaches, and biotic approaches that avoid remineralization of biomass within the ocean, may be applied in ways that have minimal impacts on dissolved oxygen. We suggest that impacts on marine oxygen should be accounted for in assessing the suitability of mCDR, and that oxygen should be measured prior to, during and after any research-scale or full-scale implementation activity."

Additionally, the geostrophic velocity in multicore eddies is generally higher, through inverse barotropic energy, than in single-core ones. Using LLC4320 simulations, we found that the baroclinic (BC) instability plays a key role in forming these subcenters, and the probability of eddies generating multiple centers decreases during the eddy lifecycle.

While significant advancements have been made in S2S meteorological forecasting, skill variability among prediction systems persists due to differences in physical process representation and technical characteristics of the predictive systems. Traditionally, sub-seasonal systems are considered more informative than seasonal systems within their time horizons, leading to seamless communication approaches that combine systems at fixed horizons, overlooking tailored solutions to optimize forecast skill. This study investigates S2S streamflow forecasting skill across Europe’s diverse hydrological regimes, identifying optimal combination horizons for skill-informed seamless communication. Using bias-adjusted forecasts from ECMWF’s sub-seasonal (ENS-ER) and seasonal (SEAS5) systems, we evaluate streamflow forecasts to uncover spatiotemporal complementarities between the two systems. The results reveal that most European basins benefit from sub-seasonal forecasts up to 3–6 weeks ahead, while steep, snow-dominated mountain ranges, high-precipitation basins, and elevated Mediterranean areas exhibit shorter horizons of 2–4 weeks. Gains in meteorological forecast skill at short lead times (1–3 weeks) are amplified when translated into hydrological processes, extending predictability up to 6 weeks. ENS-ER-based forecasts demonstrate greater spatial homogeneity in skill during shorter lead times, while SEAS5-based forecasts excel at extended horizons. These findings highlight the potential for tailored seamless products to enhance S2S forecast utility. By integrating complementary S2S prediction systems with this diagnostic, region-dependent strategy tailored to diverse hydrological regimes, hydro-climate services can seamlessly deliver accurate, actionable, and operationally relevant information to water- and climate-dependent sectors."

We find systematic differences of these two distinct water limitation regimes across drylands: the more significant the WP effect, the less significant the CSM effect, and vice versa. Climatic aridity, soil texture, root-water uptake depths or all together drive the divergence between two types of ecosystem water limitations at regional scale, and soil texture play a dominant role. Sand and clay soils drive ecosystem productivity fluctuations by increased water limitations, albeit through different pathways: clay soils correspond to a more significant water limitation as WP contribution rather than CSM, while sandy soils are the opposite.

We investigate vegetation dynamics and soil moisture fluctuations across three grassland types—meadows, typical grasslands, and desert grasslands—utilizing solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil moisture data from 2001 to 2020. By employing event coincidence analysis and the maximum coincidence rate, we quantified the grasslands’ responses to drought events. Our findings indicate a significant upward trend in SIF across all grassland types over the past two decades, while NDVI and soil moisture levels remained relatively stable. Under drought conditions, the probability of grassland degradation ranged from 40% to 60%. Notably, desert grasslands exhibited a considerably slower response rate compared to other grassland types, while meadow grasslands responded the fastest to drought; however, all grassland types displayed a response delay of 1–2 months. When soil moisture levels fell below −1.8 standard deviations (STDs), a reversal in grassland response patterns was observed, particularly in meadow grasslands, which showed a substantial increase in response probability. At soil moisture levels below −2.4 STD, this probability stabilized at approximately 90%, significantly higher than that of other grassland types.

The fitting parameters obtained within a narrow range of conditions can generally be extended to estimate the OHexp for wide ranges of conditions in the OFR, except for external OH reactivity, which requires new fitting. At least 20–30 data points from SO2 or CO decay with varying conditions are required to fit a set of empirical parameters that can accurately estimate OHexp. 
 The oxidation flow reactor (OFR) has been widely used to simulate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in laboratory and field studies. OH exposure (OHexp), representing the extent of hydroxyl (OH) radical oxidation and normally expressed as the product of OH concentration and residence time in the OFR, is important in assessing the oxidation chemistry in SOA formation. Several models have been developed to quantify the OHexp in OFRs, and empirical equations have been proposed to parameterize OHexp. Practically, the empirical equations and the associated parameters are derived under atmospheric relevant conditions (i.e., external OH reactivity) with limited variations in calibration conditions, such as residence time, water vapor mixing ratio, and ozone (O3) concentration. Whether the equations or parameters derived under limited sets of calibration conditions can accurately predict the OHexp under dynamically changing experimental conditions with large variations (i.e., extremely high external OH reactivity) in real applications remains uncertain. In this study, we conducted 62 sets of experiments (416 data points) under a wide range of experimental conditions to evaluate the scope of the application of the empirical equations to estimate OHexp. Sensitivity tests were also conducted to obtain a minimum number of data points, which is necessary for generating the fitting parameters. We showed that, for the OFR185 mode (185 nm lamps with internal O3 generation), except for external OH reactivity, the parameters obtained within a narrow range of calibration conditions can be extended to estimate the OHexp when the experiments are in wider ranges of conditions. For example, parameters derived within a narrow water vapor mixing ratio range (0.49 %–0.99 %, corresponding to 15.1 %–30.8 % of relative humidity at 101.325 kPa and 298 K) can be extended to estimate the OHexp under the entire range of water vapor mixing ratios (0.49 %–2.76 %, equivalent to 15.1 %–85.7 % of relative humidity under identical conditions). However, the parameters obtained when the external OH reactivity is below 23 s−1 could not be used to reproduce the OHexp under the entire range of external OH reactivity (4–204 s−1). For the OFR254 mode (254 nm lamps with external O3 generation), all parameters obtained within a narrow range of conditions can be used to estimate OHexp accurately when experimental conditions are extended. Additionally, when using the OFR254 mode, lamp voltages that are too low should be avoided, as they will generally result in large deviations in the estimations of OHexp from empirical equations. Regardless of whether the OFR185 or OFR254 mode is used, at least 20–30 data points from sulfur dioxide (SO2) or carbon monoxide (CO) decay with varying conditions are required to fit a set of empirical parameters that can accurately estimate OHexp. Caution should be exercised to use fitted parameters from low external OH reactivity to high ones, for instance, those from direct emissions such as vehicular exhaust and biomass burning."

 The complexities of urban climate and environmental challenges have garnered significant attention in the 21st century. Numerical simulations, offering high-spatiotemporal-resolution meteorological data, are essential tools in meteorological research and atmospheric science. Accurate representation of urban morphology parameters is crucial for enhancing the precision of these simulations in urban areas.

Our findings indicate that GloUCP not only surpasses existing datasets in accuracy but also provides superior spatial coverage. In key urban agglomerations such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, GloUCP offers detailed and reliable urban morphological information that closely aligns with reference datasets, outperforming other available sources. Similarly, in United States cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, GloUCP consistently achieves lower RMSE values and higher correlation coefficients, demonstrating its robustness in modeling diverse urban environments. Furthermore, GloUCP's capability to effectively capture the vertical distribution of buildings, particularly in high-rise areas, highlights its utility in urban climate modeling and related applications. As UCPs are pivotal in regulating atmospheric responses to urbanization, the availability of this globally consistent urban description is a crucial prerequisite for advancing model development and informing climate-sensitive urban planning policies.

Tolson,A reach-integrated hydraulic modelling approach  for large-scale and real-time inundation mapping,"We aim to improve mapping of floods and present a new method for hydraulic modelling that uses a combination of novel geospatial analysis and existing hydraulic modelling approaches. This method is wrapped into a modelling software called Blackbird. We compared Blackbird with two other existing options for flood mapping and found that the Blackbird model outperformed both. The Blackbird model has the potential to support real-time and large-scale flood mapping applications in the future. 
 Flooding is one of the world's most common and costly natural hazards, inflicting billions in damages each year. However, current hydraulic models to support flood mapping are not well suited for large-scale applications or frequent updates, either due to limited accuracy of simple methods or lack of scalability (i.e. large computational requirements) for more sophisticated hydrodynamic models. This results in flood maps being decades out of date or simply nonexistent in some areas. Recent advances in generating flood maps have been made seemingly in parallel between geospatial methods and hydrodynamic models, such as the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method, hybrid 1D–2D hydrodynamic models, and more efficient computing of 2D models. This study presents the Geospatially Augmented Standard Step (GASS) method, which combines a novel improvement to the HAND method, Dynamic Height Above Nearest Drainage (DHAND), with a 1D hydraulic model for rapid flood inundation mapping at large scales while maintaining the accuracy of hydrodynamic models. This method is implemented into a new modelling software package called Blackbird and is tested via verification of the code and a benchmark case study comparing multiple approaches in the ability to approximate 2D model results. The Blackbird model vastly outperforms the simpler HAND–Manning method and also outperforms a traditional HEC-RAS 1D model when evaluated for accuracy of approximating a 2D model benchmark. This new method is shown to reduce the incidence of falsely predicting flooded areas through improved resolution of landscape connections over HAND-based or 1D hydraulic models. Blackbird also streamlines the model development effort relative to existing 1D or 2D models while maintaining a computational speed that was 10 000 times faster (a few seconds compared to a few hours) than a comparable 2D model in one case study. The method also allows for future integration of hydraulic structures, ice jams, and other features that are unavailable in HAND-based models. Overall, the GASS method provides a viable option for large-scale and real-time fluvial flood mapping applications."

However, this study reveals a critical limitation: in atmospheric environments where reactant density is relatively low, the generation of OH radicals triggers the breakdown of the C–C network in carbon cocatalysts rather than degrading air pollutants. This self-destruction of carbon cocatalysts not only reduced long-term efficiency but also led to their mineralization into CO2, causing unintended secondary air pollution. We verified the self-destruction mechanism of carbon nanotubes, graphene oxides, and carbon nanofibers loaded onto TiO2 through microscopic and colorimetric analyses in air purification applications. Although these composites initially exhibited higher removal efficiencies for various gaseous pollutants, their performances over an extended period reverted to that of pristine TiO2, while contributing to additional CO2 emission. An economic analysis comparing carbon cocatalysts with noble metals, factoring in material costs, accumulated depreciation, and CO2 emission taxes, revealed that carbon cocatalysts are less economically favorable than noble metal cocatalysts, especially when they are used in practice over the long term. Contrary to perception, using carbon cocatalysts in photocatalytic air purification may offset their benefits, indicating the need for a paradigm shift from focusing on initial cost and removal efficiency to considering the ultimate environmental relevance."

HVAC filters were collected from three air handling units (AHUs) in university buildings between November 2022 and February 2024. Using vacuum-based dust collection, followed by RT-ddPCR analysis, varying levels of SARS-CoV-2 were detected on filters across AHUs. Positive detection rates ranged from 28 to 86% in prefilters and 17–50% in final filters. Viral concentrations in coarse dust varied significantly across AHUs and sampling batches, reaching up to 14,000 genome copies (gc)/g of dust in prefilters. Analysis of fine dust samples showed  viral concentrations higher than those of coarse dust when normalized by dust mass. Factors such as the prevalence of COVID-19  on campus, occupancy dynamics, lecture room air distribution systems, and HVAC operation conditions likely contributed to the observed SARS-CoV-2 positive rates and concentrations in dust samples.

This AMOC tipping event was found under constant pre‐industrial greenhouse gas forcing, while global warming likely limits this AMOC‐induced cooling response. Here, we quantify the European temperature responses under different AMOC regimes and climate change scenarios. A strongly reduced AMOC state and intermediate global warming (≤+2° ${\le} +2{}^{\circ}$C, Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) has a profound cooling effect on Northwestern Europe with more intense cold extremes. The largest temperature responses are found during the winter months and these responses are strongly influenced by the North Atlantic sea‐ice extent. Enhanced North Atlantic storm track activity under an AMOC collapse results in substantially larger day‐to‐day temperature fluctuations. We conclude that the (far) future European temperatures are dependent on both the AMOC strength and the emission scenario."

This issue has been widely discussed but without a clear attribution. Using the latest sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models, we investigate the relevant physical processes contributing to the greater simulated temperature variability in China based on the atmospheric energy budget. The results show that a strong overestimation exists in Northwest, Southwest, North, Central, and East China, which is dominated by the poor reproduction of snow cover and cloud. Exaggerated snow cover variability enhances the fluctuations of the clear‐sky shortwave radiation reflected back to the top‐of‐the‐atmosphere, inducing positive biases in the Tibetan Plateau, North, Central, and East China. This snow‐albedo feedback also explains why the overvalued temperature variability in winter and spring is larger than that in summer and autumn. The shortwave cloud radiative forcing is also responsible for the overvalued temperature fluctuations in North and Northwest China, as well as south of 30°N in Central and East China. The contributions of snow‐albedo feedback and shortwave cloud radiative forcing vary with seasons and regions. Additionally, the overvalued tropospheric temperature variability leads to the temperature variability overestimation in Northwest China."

This study investigates heatwave frequency (HWF) across 50 global regions, spanning historical (1979–2014) and future periods (2025–2060 and 2065–2100) under SSP 370 (regional rivalry) and SSP 585 (fossil‐fuel development) scenarios. Using bias‐corrected general circulation model simulations and reconstructed terrestrial water storage (TWS) data, we quantify the contributions of atmospheric processes to HWF modulation and assess the impacts of HWF and temperature changes on water storage deficits using TWS drought severity index (TWS‐DSI) and standardized temperature index (STI). We show that Western Central Asia exhibits moisture divergence driven by significant positive thermodynamic effects, which correlates with increased HWF. In West Africa, moisture flux divergence at 1,000 hPa accounts for 45% of HWF variability, while relative humidity at 300 hPa explains 58% of HWF changes in East Asia. HWF and STI strongly influence TWS‐DSI, with high STI intensifying TWS deficits. Concurrent high HWF and wet conditions in Western North America are linked to atmospheric blocking and hydrological persistence, highlighting complex illative mechanisms. We project population exposure to HWF to rise tenfold globally by 2100, with regions such as South Asia experiencing over 100% increases due to combined climate and population effects.

 Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore communication for people who have lost the ability to speak owing to a neurological disease or injury. BCIs have been used to translate the neural correlates of attempted speech into text1–3. However, text communication fails to capture the nuances of human speech, such as prosody and immediately hearing one’s own voice.

We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real time to change intonation and sing short melodies.

 Type I interferons are essential for antiviral immunity1 but must be tightly regulated2. The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon-β (Ifnb1) expression through an unknown mechanism3,4. Here we report that SP140 does not directly repress Ifnb1 transcription. Instead, SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator that we call RESIST (regulated stimulator of interferon via stabilization of transcript; previously annotated as annexin 2 receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within punctate structures called nuclear bodies that have important roles in silencing DNA-virus gene expression in the nucleus3. Consistent with this observation, we find that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 is independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1. Our results establish dual antiviral and interferon regulatory functions for SP140. We propose that SP140 and RESIST participate in antiviral effector-triggered immunity5,6.

Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth6–8, high-performance field-effect transistors9–20 and circuits based on 2D materials21–23, achieving complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics. A two-dimensional one instruction set computer has been fabricated based on complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology by leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors."

 Since the invention of the laser, nonlinear effects such as filamentation1, Rabi cycling2,3 and collective emission4 have been explored in the optical regime, leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications5–8. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have extended many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of ångström-scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity9. An example is XFEL-driven inner-shell Kα1 (2p3/2 → 1s1/2) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been used for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of new X-ray laser sources10–16. Here we show that strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity (>1019 W cm−2) XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal XFEL pump pulse substructure, the resulting X-ray pulses (about 106−108 photons) can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities and spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Three-dimensional Maxwell–Bloch calculations17 show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation and that the broad spectral features are driven by sub-femtosecond Rabi cycling. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that provide opportunities for quantum X-ray optics applications. Strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese."

Here, the authors develop an integrated analysis of advanced SGC to characterize the immune microenvironment and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. 
 Salivary gland cancers are rare, diverse malignancies characterized by poor response to immunotherapy. The tumor immune environment in these cancers remains poorly understood. To address this, we perform an integrative analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment in a large cohort of advanced salivary gland cancer samples. Most tumors exhibit low immune activity with limited immune cell infiltration. Inflammation is linked to higher tumor mutational burden in non-adenoid cystic carcinoma histologies. Subtype specific expression of immune checkpoints is identified with prominent expression of VTCN1 in luminal-like cells within adenoid cystic carcinoma. Macrophages with immunosuppressive properties dominate the immune microenvironment across subtypes. Responses to immunotherapy are limited and associated with a higher ratio of T-cells relative to macrophages in individual cases, warranting further investigation. Here, we show an immunosuppressive environment in salivary gland cancers and identify subtype-specific immune vulnerabilities that could inform tailored therapeutic strategies. Salivary gland cancers (SGC) respond poorly to immunotherapies and new treatment strategies are needed.

 Importing renewable energy to Europe may offer many potential benefits, including reduced energy costs, lower pressure on infrastructure development, and less land use within Europe. However, open questions remain: on the achievable cost reductions, how much should be imported, whether the energy vector should be electricity, hydrogen, or derivatives like ammonia or steel, and their impact on Europe’s infrastructure needs. This study integrates a global energy supply chain model with a European energy system model to explore net-zero emission scenarios with varying import volumes, costs, and vectors. We find system cost reductions of 1-10%, within import cost variations of  ± 20%, with diminishing returns for larger import volumes and a preference for methanol, steel and hydrogen imports. Keeping some domestic power-to-X production is beneficial for integrating variable renewables, leveraging local carbon sources and power-to-X waste heat.

This study examines the impact of human depopulation on biodiversity levels across Japan. 
 Global studies consistently highlight a direct relationship between habitat and species losses, and human population and economic growth. Nevertheless, countries are experiencing below-replacement human fertility and starting to depopulate; among these countries, Japan is a global forerunner. To better understand whether human depopulation automatically yields environmentally restorative outcomes, we examine the impacts of human depopulation on aspects of biodiversity in Japan. Alongside population, land use and surface temperature, we analyse biodiversity change among 464 taxonomic species of bird, butterfly, firefly and frog egg masses, and 2,922 native and non-native plant species in wooded, agricultural and peri-urban landscapes across Japan over periods of 5–17 years from 2004. Irrespective of human population increase or decrease, biodiversity losses continue among most species studied mainly because of change in agricultural land use, either due to urbanization, disuse and abandonment, or intensification. Only where human numbers are currently stable, biodiversity is also more stable, although we anticipate that this may also change as ageing deepens into depopulation in these areas. We conclude by urging countries facing depopulation to account for its outcomes in their biodiversity conservation and restoration strategies.

 Determining what was responsible for the last glacial millennial-scale glacier fluctuations can help to pinpoint the causes of abrupt climate events during that period. Yet, the question remains poorly constrained in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), where glaciers react to the global climate system via the northern mid-latitude westerlies and Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). Here, we examine this issue through 10Be exposure dating of moraines in the western Nyainqentanglha Mountains, southern TP. We find that glaciers reached their maximum extent during the last glaciation before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and that the LGM termination pre-dated a rapid CO2 rise at ~18 ka. Changes in summer air temperature, which is tied to the northern tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperature by the northern mid-latitude westerlies, likely accounted for the pattern of glacial fluctuations, along with the ASM weakening. The rising summer solar insolation from 23 ka also made a positive contribution towards terminating the LGM."

 The Western Antarctic Peninsula is undergoing rapid environmental change. Regional warming is causing increased glacial meltwater discharge, but the ecological impact of this meltwater over large spatiotemporal scales is not well understood. Here, we leverage 20 years of remote sensing data, reanalysis products, and field observations to assess the effects of sea surface glacial meltwater on phytoplankton biomass and highlight its importance as a key environmental driver for this region’s productive ecosystem. We find a strong correlation between meltwater and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a across multiple time scales and datasets. We attribute this relationship to nutrient fertilization by glacial meltwater, with potential additional contribution from surface ocean stabilization associated with sea-ice presence. While high phytoplankton biomass typically follows prolonged winter sea-ice seasons and depends on the interplay between light and nutrient limitation, our results indicate that the positive effects of increased glacial meltwater on phytoplankton communities likely mitigate the negative impact of sea-ice loss in this region in recent years. Our findings underscore the critical need to consider glacial meltwater as a key ecological driver in polar coastal ecosystems.

 Explosive volcanic eruptions, driven by magma fragmentation, pose significant geohazards due to their rapid energy release and widespread dispersal of pyroclasts. High magma viscosity promotes brittle fragmentation by limiting volatile escape and enhancing internal pressure buildup. Although recent studies have recognized that iron-titanium oxide nanocrystal formation increases melt viscosity, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly constrained. Here we quantify the influence of nanocrystallization on magma viscosity by developing viscosity models that incorporate iron-titanium variations, calibrated against nanocrystal-free andesitic melts. Using time-resolved imaging, we show that nanocrystals form within seconds within synthetic andesitic melts. This process generates nanoscale chemical heterogeneities, including silica enrichment in the surrounding melt and aluminum-rich shells embedding the nanocrystals. These heterogeneities result in viscosity increases of up to 30-fold at eruptive temperatures. Our findings indicate that nanocrystallization modulates magma rheology during early crystallization, with direct implications for the dynamics of andesitic eruptions.

 Climate change is projected to cause significant and irreversible losses in mountain regions, severely impacting both people and ecosystems. Assessing adaptation in mountain regions is crucial to address diverse sectoral challenges and to mitigate the risks of maladaptation. Despite increasing awareness of the need to integrate adaptation across all sectors affected by climate change, the understanding of multi-sectoral solutions remains limited. Here we analyzed 118 research articles on human adaptation published between 2012 and 2022 and found disparities and commonalities across different regions, adaptation types and sectors. Behavioural/cultural responses, primarily reactive and linked to agriculture and pastoralism sectors, are most prevalent in Africa and Asia, particularly within rural settings. In contrast, technological/infrastructural and institutional responses, often anticipatory and associated with disaster-risk management, tourism, transportation and water sectors are highly prominent in Europe, especially in urban areas.

 In recent years new sensors and products have been developed to advance our capabilities in assessing human activities based on the remote sensing of night lights. Correctly understanding patterns in human activity and land use based on night lights, is key to gauge our advancement in reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this paper I focus on five challenges in remote sensing of night lights. For each of these research challenges I provide a brief review of previous work, and then demonstrate how this challenge can be tackled, using a variety of ground-based sensors (TESS-4C, LANcube, SVC-HR1024 field spectrometer and webcams), UAV imagery, and spaceborne sensors (SDGSAT-1 and VIIRS/DNB). Challenge 1: Providing a cloud mask in future night light missions; Here I demonstrate that using a thermal night time image acquired simultaneously with the night time light image (as in the case for some of the SDGSAT-1 images), a cloud mask can be created, allowing to analyze night lights over cloud-free areas. Challenge 2: Monitoring hourly changes in night lights over a single night. Here I demonstrated that using mobile measurements conducted with a LANcube photometer at different hours, it was possible to detect locations where and when night lights have decreased during the night (e.g. a large sport stadium). In addition, using a citizen science webcam, I showed that hourly changes in night lights can be discerned even from a non-calibrated camera, and that within the city of Jerusalem, where there is a large population of orthodox Jews, certain land uses had less lights during holy days. Challenge 3: Fusing night time imagery from spaceborne sensors with different overpass times and spatial resolution to better understand hourly changes in night lights; merging SDGSAT-1 images (21:30 overpass) and VIIRS/DNB images (01:30 overpass) I was able to map the turning off of street lights across rural areas in France that accelerated since the 2022 energy crisis of Europe. Challenge 4: Estimating the emissions of blue light using night light sensors; here I demonstrated that the measured portion of blue light varies between ground based and spaceborne sensors, and that it is affected by atmospheric scattering; Challenge 5: Quantifying the anisotropy of night light emissions; here I demonstrated that using panoramic images acquired from a UAV at different heights, it is possible to examine how viewing angles affect the light sources that are observed. I conclude that while the number of designated night lights sensors is still limited, with the availability of new multispectral sensors, we can advance in our understanding of the dynamics of human activities at night-time, by fusing data from different sensors, to take advantage of the unique spatial, spectral, temporal and directional capabilities of each of them."

 The hotspot-sun angular offset (the spherical circular angle between hotspot and sun positions, termed ΔCA) in urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) plays a pivotal role in advancing remote sensing of urban climates. However, its diurnal and monthly variations across scenarios influenced by sun position, urban morphology, and thermal inertia remain largely unknown. Here we filled this knowledge gap based on 1049 UTA scenarios incorporating 12 urban surface models using both computer simulations and in-situ measurements. Our findings reveal ΔCA varies from 0° to 50° (predominantly 10° – 30°). Surface thermal inertia, urban morphology (i.e., building-street aspect ratio), and sun position collectively drive ΔCA variation, with their relative contributions exhibiting significant diurnal and monthly variabilities. In general, ΔCA is most pronounced around noon with relatively low thermal inertia (279–739 W·s1/2·m−1·K−1) and low aspect ratio values (< 1.5), leading to high ΔCA values exceeding 30°. Monthly ΔCA variations shows a bimodal pattern, with peaks (ΔCA is ∼25°) in April and August and a trough (ΔCA is ∼15°) from May to July around the summer solstice when the solar zenith angle (SZA) is relatively small. Hourly ΔCA variations exhibits sinusoidal variation during daytime, also characterized by a noon trough around the summer solstice. Troughs in diurnal/annual cycles are associated with small SZA (< 20°) and high sunlit roof/ground temperatures that ensure hotspot-sun adjacency. Our results indicate pronounced ΔCAs under scenarios with lower thermal inertia, lower aspect ratio, and midday periods in May to August. Our findings could facilitate designing kernel-driven models for simulating UTA."

It covers snow, ice and ocean surfaces with mean and max–min daily temperatures poleward of 50 degrees North and South, for the period 1982–2023. The C3S IST is provided as a Level 3 (L3) dataset in a polar 0.25 ° latitude and longitude grid. It consists of two parts: (1) the C3S IST climate data record (ISTCDR v1.1), covering the period 1. January 1982 to 30. June 2019, and (2) the C3S IST Interim CDR version 1.1 (ICDR v1.1) covering 1. July 2019 to 31. December 2023. The surface temperatures (STs) are calculated from satellite thermal infrared Brightness Temperature (TB) measurements from the Global Area Coverage – Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (GAC - AVHRR) data, creating a comprehensive data set based solely on a single sensor type. The underlying AASTI algorithm is a combination of algorithms specifically tuned for sea ice, marginal ice zone, land ice and high latitude open water. In addition, each of the algorithm coefficients are tuned specifically for each of the AVHRR instruments, using simulated Top of the atmosphere (TOA) TBs and ERA-Interim reanalysis surface and atmosphere data. Simulated TOA TB’s are computed using the community radiative transfer model, RTTOV v12.3. Spatially and temporally varying uncertainties are computed for each data-point. The C3S IST surface temperatures were validated against different in situ observation types, where comparison against radiometric temperatures from flight campaigns and ice sheet station data resulted in smaller mean differences of 0.20°C and -1.84°C in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than for validations against met station air temperatures, which were usually 1–3°C higher. Surface temperature climatology and trends have been computed for sea ice and ice sheets, showing large regional differences in surface temperature trends within the NH. For the entire dataset, the average trend is +1.11 °C/decade for the NH sea ice, +0.16 °C/decade for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, +0.38 °C/decade for the Greenland ice sheet and -0.13 °C/decade for the Antarctic ice sheet. The positive trends are typically small during summer and larger during winter, e.g. in the Barents Sea, where trends exceed +0.3 °C/year in winter. Negative temperature trends are observed in some regions such as the Bering Strait’s ice edge. For Antarctic sea ice, the trends are generally smaller and statistically less significant than those in the NH. The trends of the ice sheet surface show a similar pattern, where the Greenland Ice Sheet has positive trends, which both are largest and most significant in the coastal areas. The Antarctic Ice Sheet has diverse trends and large areas have statistically non-significant trends, except for the negative temperature trend in the central, high altitude part of east Antarctica exceeding -0.5 °C/year."

 Climate change is dramatically shifting the distribution and prevalence of pests and diseases, posing significant threats to global forest ecosystems. Poplar plantations, particularly multiclonal ones, are highly vulnerable to pathogen-driven diseases such as leaf rust caused by Melampsora spp. In this study, we developed three machine learning (ML) detection models (DMs) for identifying rust-affected poplar trees coupling Sentinel-2 time series and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. For each DM, three ML algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks) were trained using in situ leaf rust inspections as reference data, and the following inputs: (i) inverted plant traits retrieved from the PROSAIL model, (ii) key spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 time series, and (iii) a combination of both plant traits and indices from Sentinel-2 images. The best-performing DM, which combined plant traits and spectral indices, achieved an overall accuracy of 89.5 % (Kappa = 0.78) across three tested ML algorithms. Relative importance analysis highlighted chlorophylls (21 %), carotenoids (16 %), and leaf water content (11 %) as the most critical variables for rust detection. This study shows the potential of combining biophysical models with Sentinel-2 imagery for precise and scalable rust detection in multiclonal poplar plantations. Our approach also highlights how key plant traits, such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, and leaf water content, vary across poplar clones, offering valuable insights for forest management and conservation strategies in the context of climate change. The framework we propose is adaptable and transferable to different regions and conditions, enhancing disease monitoring and forest health management. Its robustness is further supported by external validation using the ANGERS spectral database, confirming the physiological relevance of the retrieved traits."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a crucial tool in remote sensing, yet existing deep learning methods are primarily limited in visual representation, neglecting the intrinsic characteristics of SAR and the need for strong generalization across multiple tasks. To address this, we propose SUMMIT (SAR foUndational Model with Multiple auxiliary tasks enhanced Intrinsic characterisTics), a foundational model tailored for SAR image understanding. SUMMIT is pre-trained on the Multi-sensor SAR Image Dataset (MuSID), which contains over 560,000 SAR images. To enhance its feature extraction capability, we introduce a masked image modeling (MIM) framework with self-supervised auxiliary tasks (SSATs): (1) MIM for learning robust structural representations, (2) self-supervised denoising to improve the model’s noise resistance, and (3) space scattering feature enhancement to preserve geometric consistency. Furthermore, we design an auxiliary task coordination module (ATCM) to balance these tasks and ensure effective feature fusion. The resulting self-supervised framework enables SUMMIT to integrate deep learning with SAR’s physical attributes effectively. Extensive experiments across seven datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that SUMMIT achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in SAR classification, detection, and segmentation.

 The accurate extraction of building roof structures from aerial imagery represents a fundamental task for urban digital twin systems, facilitating critical applications such as 3D city modeling and solar potential assessment. Despite recent advancements in geospatial artificial intelligence, existing methods frequently encounter challenges posed by real-world complexities. These include structural heterogeneity caused by diverse architectural styles, discontinuities in roof structures due to occlusions from vegetation and other obstacles, and the limited generalization ability of models stemming from the scarcity of specialized annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end network called RoofMapNet, specifically designed for extracting roof structures. First, we propose a strategy for roof junction extraction that integrates dynamic Gaussian heatmaps with quadratic coordinate calibration. This strategy enhances the model’s robustness in junction prediction under heterogeneous sample distribution scenarios. To address the loss or blurring of roof lines caused by occlusion and shadow, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware module. This module employs a bidirectional mapping between geometric and feature spaces to refine candidate lines accurately, thus improving the model’s generalization ability and robustness in roof line detection. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of roof structure detection models, we meticulously annotated a diverse, large-scale remote sensing imagery dataset for roof structure extraction, named RoofMapSet. Comprehensive evaluations on the VWB and RoofMapSet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with mean sAP improvements of 4.13% and 2.85% over competitors, respectively. Further analyses confirm the resilience to varying spatial resolutions and complex occlusion patterns. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CVEO/RoofMapNet."

 Port cities are often burdened by elevated air pollution levels due to ship emissions and harbour-related activities such as cargo handling and internal traffic. This study investigates the concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and selected metals/metalloids (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cr, Zn, Mn, Fe) bound to the inhalable particulate matter (PM10) in the port of Volos (central Greece), the fourth largest in the country. Data were collected over a five-year period (2018–2022), allowing for the assessment of interannual variability. A risk assessment was conducted using standard U.S. EPA methodologies to estimate both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks through inhalation exposure, separately for adults and children. The results revealed that the cumulative non-cancer risk from EU-regulated PM10-bound metal(loid)s (As, Ni, Cd, Pb) remained well below the threshold of 1 × 10−6, indicating acceptable exposure levels. However, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) contributed significantly to the non-cancer risk—30 % for children and 20 % for adults. The inhalation lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for the metal(loid)s exceeded the U.S. EPA's safety threshold (1 × 10−6), reaching 5.1 × 10−5 for children and 5.7 × 10−5 for adults, with lead (Pb) being the predominant contributor. In contrast, the ILCR of Σ12PAHs was nearly two orders of magnitude lower. These findings emphasize the necessity of long-term pollutant monitoring in port areas to inform evidence-based public health interventions and regulatory action."

 The impact of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme on the simulated track of TC InFa (2021) is explored in this study. The TC track and intensity are accurately captured in the experiment with the eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) PBL scheme. Conversely, the TC exhibits a noticeably slower translation speed and deviates significantly from the observed track in the experiment using the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme. The potential vorticity tendency (PVT) budget analysis reveals that the diabatic heating related to the asymmetric convection within the TC inner-core has a negative impact on the translation speed of TC. The in-cloud mixing effect in the YSU scheme is conducive to transporting the moisture from the boundary layer to the upper levels, promoting the development of asymmetric deep convection and the enhancing diabatic heating. This study presents a new perspective, suggesting that the representation of in-cloud mixing in the PBL scheme plays an important role on affecting the TC movement."

 Extreme precipitation events in the winter season (WEPEs) over Southeast China cause tremendous social and economic loss with spatiotemporal variability across scales, making it important to study the complicated triggering mechanisms and further to improve seamless forecasting skills for winter extreme precipitation events (WEPEs). Based on a daily precipitation dataset from 2474 stations across China from 1961 to 2023, an objective identification metric was employed to identify 347 WEPEs over Southeast China. Synthesis analysis was performed by using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to study the circulation features across large-scale, synoptic scale, and sub-synoptic scale. Results show that WEPEs occur more frequently in the central region rather than the northern and southern coastal areas. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function and objective pattern correlation statistics, 279 WEPEs were classified into five categories, i.e. Huai River Basin type (HR), Yangtze River Middle-Lower Reaches type (YR), Central Southeast China type (CSE), Southeast China type (SE), and South China type (SC). Similarities among the five types are concluded from two perspectives. On one hand, large-scale and synoptic scale characteristics all present anomalous troughs in the lower troposphere over South China extending to the Indochinese Peninsula, which deepened the southern branch trough (SBT), and anomalous positive geopotential height anomalies near northeast China and Japan in the form of the Northeast Asian anomalous anticyclone (NAAA). On the other hand, the unbalanced winds in the lower atmosphere coincide with precipitation areas and intensity of the five types of WEPEs. Differences are evident in locations and intensities of both scale systems resulting to different moisture transports. Moisture transport from the NAAA in HR and YR types is greater than from the SBT. Moisture in the CSE type mainly comes from the SBT, while it originates from the combined effects of the SBT and the NAAA in the SE and SC types. What's more, the unbalanced winds of sub-synoptic scales more accurately highlight similarities and differences in moisture transport channels over heavy precipitating areas compared to ageostrophic wind."

 This study investigates the processes driving interannual variability of rainfall over the western coast of the Philippines during the peak southwest monsoon (SWM) months (July–September) from 1961 to 2022. Specifically, it describes how tropical cyclones (TC), SWM, and TC-enhanced SWM influence SWM rainfall variability. Rainfall measurements from 11 stations along the western coast of the Philippines were classified into three types: direct TC rainfall (PD), indirect TC rainfall (PI), and SWM rainfall (PSM). The yearly contributions of PD, PI, and PSM to SWM rainfall were estimated to be 15.4 %, 33.1 %, and 51.5 %, respectively. Furthermore, four rainfall variability types were found depending on the characteristics of each year's rainfall anomalies: enhanced PD but suppressed PSM (D+S-), suppressed PD but enhanced PSM (D-S+), enhanced PI but suppressed PSM (I+S-), and suppressed PI but enhanced PSM (I-S+). Composite analysis using ERA5 data revealed the presence of anomalous winds and circulations unique to each type that causes variations in the TC tracks and the monsoon flow, which accounts for the rainfall variability. Notable ones are the anomalous anticyclone over Taiwan in the D+S- case, which pushes TCs closer to the Philippines, and the anomalous anticyclone east of the Philippines in the I+S- case, which enhances the trade winds."

 This study applies the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) algorithm to investigate the causal relationship between Arctic Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) and the Siberian High (SH) from a causal perspective. The main results are as follows: 1) Both autumn and winter pan-Arctic SIC have a causal influence on the winter SH, and the causal influence of autumn SIC on SH being significantly stronger than that of winter SIC. 2) The causal strength of autumn SIC on the SH differs by region, being most potent in the Barents-Kara Sea and least in the Greenland Sea. Nonetheless, the trends in interannual variations in causal strength are uniform, with a notable intensification in the impact of autumn SIC on SH across various regions after 1998. 3) A comparison of the circulation patterns before and after 1998 reveals that the reduction in the autumn Arctic SIC may affect the SH through stratospheric pathways. Specifically, after 1998, the accelerated reduction in the autumn Arctic SIC has weakened the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and the westerly jet, enhanced cold air activities, which in turn strengthened the SH. This study will enhance the comprehension of the impact of Arctic sea ice decline on the SH and its potential as an early warning signal. Additionally, it will improve the understanding of the causal relationships between Arctic sea ice and mid-latitude climate, which can help in forecasting extreme cold events."

It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response toPlasmodiumspp. infection. We found that asymptomaticP. falciparuminfection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibitedP. falciparumproliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole.

We demonstrate that flowing CO2gas into an acid bubbler—which carries trace amounts of acid vapor into a gas diffusion electrode for silver-catalyzed CO2RR to carbon monoxide (CO)—can prevent salt accumulation. In a 100-square-centimeter, scaled-up CO2RR membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with single serpentine flow channels, the acid humidification method achieved the 4500 hours of stability milestone at 100 mA cm−2without compromising the CO faradaic efficiency, whereas a conventional water-humidified CO2feed only operated stably for ~80 hours.

A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li2Co3(SeO3)4, which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids."

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients by lysing neighboring cells through contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) lysed neighboring cells and thus provided nutrients from lysing cells for growth. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the previously unexplored distribution of the T6SS across bacterial taxa in natural environments suggest that bacterial antagonism may contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities in many ecosystems."

By querying 1375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagicDiplotaxodonthrough admixture, whereas the others established early in the deep benthic clade. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes. These results indicate that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system."

The cellular events underlying lesion formation are unknown. Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we found that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions developed from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multisite sequencing in human patients confirmed the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions.

We conservatively estimate that, despite accounting for less than 10% of the global surface area, inland and coastal aquatic systems fix 40 (30 to 54) teragrams of nitrogen per year, equivalent to 15% of the nitrogen fixed on land and in the open ocean.

We found that Cat1 provides immunity by cleaving and depleting oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) molecules from the infected host, inducing a growth arrest that prevents viral propagation. Cat1 forms dimers that stack upon each other to generate long filaments that are maintained by bound cOA ligands, with stacked TIR domains forming the NAD+cleavage catalytic sites.

LFDAS revealed distinct strain responses from nine intrusive events, six resulting in fissure eruptions. Geodetic inversion of LFDAS strain reveals detailed magmatic intrusions, with inferred dike volume rate peaking systematically 15 to 22 min before the onset of each eruption.

Yet, the extent and pace of land abandonment depends on future demand for food, energy, and other anthropogenic drivers. Here we quantify the extent and spatial distribution of agricultural abandonment and conversion in the southeastern US under a range of future development scenarios, addressing (1) what is the extent of future agricultural abandonment and conversion, (2) how much forecast agricultural conversion could be offset by recultivation of abandoned land, and (3) within a given development scenario, how do different strategies for recultivation of abandoned lands influence (a) habitat fragmentation and (b) connectivity for the umbrella species Ursus americanus. Future abandonment ranged from 1.63 Mha (local economic scenario) to 7.95 Mha (local environmental scenario). Future conversion ranged from 1.24 Mha (global environmental scenario) to 5.65 Mha (global economic scenario). While environmental scenarios predicted surplus abandonment available to offset all conversion, economic scenarios predicted enough abandonment to offset a third of conversion at most. Within a given development scenario, strategic recultivation targeting carbon or biodiversity conservation can reduce fragmentation by up to 17% compared to land-use decisions that do not consider those characteristics. However, strategic recultivation did not significantly affect connectivity, which was instead driven by development scenarios: cost-weighted distance to least-cost path ratio was highest in the economic development scenarios and lowest in the environmental concern scenarios. Our results suggest that while socio-economic development scenarios are the primary drivers of land-use change patterns and the attendant ecological consequences, strategic recultivation decisions targeting carbon sequestration or biodiversity potential can reduce habitat fragmentation within development scenarios."

PM10 (particulate matter) collected above a scaled-down activated sludge tank treating domestic sewage in the UK was analysed for a range of short-, medium-, and long-chain PFAS.

 Environmental pollution with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly referred to as “forever chemicals”, received significant attention due to their environmental persistence and bioaccumulation tendencies. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been reported to contain significant levels of PFAS. Wastewater treatment processes such as aeration have the potential to transfer PFAS into the atmosphere. However, understanding their fate during sewage treatment remains challenging. This study aims to assess aerosolisation of PFAS during a WWTP process. Special emphasis is given to new-generation and legacy PFAS (e.g. perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) as they are still observed in sewage after years of restrictions. Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 µm (PM10) collected above a scaled-down activated sludge tank treating domestic sewage for a population of >10 000 people in the UK was analysed for a range of short-, medium-, and long-chain PFAS. Eight PFAS including perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), PFOS, and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were detected in the PM10. The presence of legacy PFOA and PFOS in the PM10 samples, despite being restricted for over a decade, raises concerns about their movement through domestic and industrial sewage cycles. The total PFAS concentrations in PM10 were 15.49 and 4.25 pg m−3 during autumn and spring campaigns, respectively. PFBA was the most abundant of the PFAS, suggesting a shift towards short-chain PFAS use. Our results suggest that wastewater treatment (WWT) processes such as activated sludge aeration could aerosolise PFAS into airborne PM."

Compared to GEOS-Chem's complex (dry) scheme, we show that the BAT-VBS model can predict substantial enhancements in organic aerosol mass concentration at moderate-to-high relative humidity. 
 Atmospheric organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations can be affected by water uptake through its impact on the gas–particle partitioning of semi-volatile compounds. Current chemical transport models (CTMs) neglect this process. We have implemented the Binary Activity Thermodynamics model coupled to a volatility basis set partitioning scheme in the GEOS-Chem CTM, providing an efficient reduced-complexity OA model that predicts relative-humidity-dependent mixing and partitioning thermodynamics, while limiting the impact on computational efficiency. We provide a quantitative assessment of this water-sensitive OA treatment, focusing on a subdomain over North America. The updated OA scheme predicts a spatiotemporal mean enhancement in surface-level OA mass concentration of 145 % for January 2019 and 76 % for July 2019 compared to GEOS-Chem's most advanced OA scheme. The temporal mean surface-level OA organic mass concentration can increase by up to ∼590 % for January 2019 and ∼280 % for July 2019, with the greatest enhancements occurring over the ocean. The updated OA scheme also quantifies the OA-associated water content. The simulations show how different OA precursors and related OA surrogates contribute and respond to water uptake, including that due to changes in temperature and relative humidity over the diurnal cycle in selected winter and summer months. These results are independent of future CTM improvements involving updates to chemical reaction schemes and emission inventories. Our water-sensitive OA scheme allows for a better representation of the seasonal and regional variations in OA mass concentration in CTMs."

Crowley,Short-lived organic nitrates in a suburban temperate forest: an indication of efficient assimilation of reactive nitrogen by the biosphere?,"Measurements and modelling of reactive nitrogen gases observed in a suburban temperate forest in Rambouillet, France, circa 50 km southwest of Paris in 2022 indicate that the biosphere rapidly scavenges organic nitrates of mixed biogenic and anthropogenic origin, resulting in short lifetimes for, for example, alkyl nitrates and peroxy nitrates. 
 Alkyl nitrates (ANs) and peroxycarboxylic nitric anhydrides (PANs) are important reservoirs of reactive nitrogen that contribute significantly to the rate of formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols and support the transport of reactive nitrogen from polluted areas to remote areas. It is therefore critical to understand their sources and sinks in different environments. In this study we use measurements of OH, O3, NO3 reactivity, volatile organic compounds, ∑ANs  and ∑PANs during the ACROSS (Atmospheric ChemistRy Of the Suburban foreSt) campaign to investigate different production and loss processes of ANs and PANs in a temperate forest. During the daytime OH-initiated processes were the dominant source of ANs (69 %–72 %), followed by NO3 (18 %–20 %) and O3 (8 %–12 %). During the nighttime the contribution from OH decreased to 43 %–53 %, and NO3 increased to 26 %–40 % with that of O3 largely unchanged. Of the measured ∑PANs, 48 %–78 % were modelled to be peroxyacetic nitric anhydride (PAN, commonly known as peroxyacetyl nitrate). Physical loss (e.g. deposition) was an important sink for both ANs and PANs and contributed significantly to the very short lifetimes of 1–4 h for ANs and 0.08–1.5 h for PANs observed during the campaign."

A shock wave near the lightning channel causes extensive shattering of cloud particles. At a distance, the audio wave will cause agglomeration of particles. So, thunder may influence the rain generation process and the radiative properties of clouds. As global warming may influence the occurrence rate of lightning, a climate feedback may be induced by these mechanisms. 
 Calculations are presented on the impact of thunder on cloud particles. The results show that the creation of a shock wave front near a lightning channel results in shattering of ice crystals, droplets, and dust aerosols, this being a yet unidentified mechanism for secondary ice production in clouds. At low altitudes shattering is more efficient. At the distance where the shock wave front decays to audio wave, another mechanism can cause agglomeration of particles. The cloud particles' characteristics appear to be not very suitable for extensive acoustic agglomeration if the sound pressure level (SPL) is below 120 dB. Nevertheless, even for SPL<120 dB, some agglomeration will occur. Agglomeration will occur readily if SPL > 135 dB at sound frequencies of 10 to 200 Hz. Agglomeration efficiency increases with height. More agglomeration will occur in pyroclouds, due to their large particle number densities. These results show that the electrical environment in clouds has, through thunder, effects on the size distribution and number density of ice particles and droplets, will hence influence thundercloud radiative properties, and may be a significant driver of secondary ice production. As global warming may influence the occurrence rate of lightning, a climate feedback may be induced by the mechanisms discussed here."

TWSAs are reconstructed (BNML_TWSA) with grid-specific leader models (among four machine learning models) from January 1960 to December 2022 to generate a continuous global gridded dataset. The uncertainty in the reconstructed BNML_TWSA product is also assessed in terms of standard error. 
 Understanding long-term terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations is vital for investigating hydrological extreme events, managing water resources and assessing climate change impacts. However, the limited data duration from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO) poses challenges for comprehensive long-term analysis. In this study, we reconstruct TWS anomalies (TWSAs) for the period from January 1960 to December 2022, thereby filling data gaps between the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions and generating a complete dataset for the pre-GRACE era. The workflow involves identifying optimal predictors from land surface model (LSM) outputs, meteorological variables and climatic indices using a novel Bayesian network (BN) technique for raster-based TWSA simulations. Climate indices, like the Oceanic Niño Index and Dipole Mode Index, are selected as optimal predictors for a large number of grid cells globally, along with TWSAs from LSM outputs. The most effective machine learning (ML) algorithms among convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector regression (SVR), extra trees regressor (ETR) and stacking ensemble regression (SER) models are evaluated at each grid cell to achieve optimal reproducibility. Globally, ETR performs best for most of the grid cells; this is also noticed at the river basin scale, particularly for the Ganga–Brahmaputra–Meghna, Godavari, Krishna, Limpopo and Nile river basins. The simulated TWSAs (BNML_TWSA) outperformed the TWSAs from LSM outputs when evaluated against GRACE datasets. Improvements are particularly noted in river basins such as the Godavari, Krishna, Danube and Amazon, with median correlation coefficient, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, and RMSE values for all grid cells in the Godavari Basin, India, being 0.927, 0.839 and 63.7 mm, respectively. A comparison with TWSAs reconstructed in recent studies indicates that the proposed BNML_TWSA outperforms them globally as well as for all of the 11 major river basins examined. Furthermore, the uncertainty of BNML_TWSA is assessed for each grid cell in terms of the standard error. Results show smaller standard error magnitudes in grid cells in arid regions compared to other regions.

 In winter, snow- and ice-covered artificial surfaces are important aspects of the urban climate and trigger road maintenance operations. Urban climate and road weather models have specialized in simulating these conditions in cities or in the countryside, respectively. In this study, we intend to bridge the gap between road weather models and urban climate models in terms of cold region urban modelling and artificial surface condition predictions in any environment. We have refined the modelling of road surface processes related to winter conditions in the Town Energy Balance (TEB), an urban climate model designed for complex environments. We have developed an ice content prediction to account for the freezing and melting of the water content on the surface. Additionally, we have enhanced the TEB representation of snow on road, moving from a single-layer snow model (1-L), to a more precise multi-layer snow model known as Explicit Snow (ES). We have isolated the winter surface processes from other physical interactions by limiting the evaluation of the experiments to open environments. The experiments are carried out at two locations: the Col de Porte in the Alps and a road weather station in southern Finland. Our findings show that the enhanced TEB model (named TEB-ES) outperforms TEB, as well as a benchmark model, ISBA-Route/CROCUS, but with mixed results against a multiple linear regression in-sample algorithm.

Integrating various models, the software provides reliable and rapid assessment, maps risk areas, and estimates tsunami amplitude. This advancement reduces false alarms and enhances global tsunami warning systems' accuracy and efficiency. 
 We introduce a tsunami warning technology towards a global real-time analysis. The technology is based on the analysis of acoustic signals generated together with the tsunami, due to the compression of the water layer. The acoustic signals propagate much faster than the tsunami and thus can be recorded at hydrophone stations, which in turn enables the analysis in real time. The presented technology comprises a collection of models that have been integrated into a software with the goal to make it operational and to complement efforts by warning centres and provide a more reliable assessment, globally. The main models that were integrated into the software are presented and briefly discussed. Test cases performed by the software are compared with DART buoy observations, showing satisfactory agreement, though discrepancies arise in particular at far distances and locations separated by land. The calculation time of a full global-scale analysis is in the order of tens of seconds on a standard multi-core machine, without reliance on pre-computations, making it an appropriate real-time forecast."

Properly calibrating model parameters is essential, and although automated tools can speed up this process, they may occasionally produce incorrect values due to inconsistencies in the model. We demonstrate that by carefully applying automated tools, we were able to identify and correct a flaw in a widely used model for lake environments. 
 Models are simplified descriptions of reality and are intrinsically limited by the assumptions that have been introduced in their formulation. With the development of automatic calibration toolboxes, finding optimal parameters that suit the environmental system has become more convenient. Here, we explore how optimization toolboxes can be applied innovatively to uncover flaws in the physical formulations of models. We illustrate this approach by evaluating the effect of simplifications embedded in the formulation of a widely used hydro-thermodynamic model. We calibrate a Delft3D model based on temperature profiles for a case study, Lake Morat (Switzerland), through the DYNO-PODS optimization tool. The results show that higher values of the light extinction coefficient can compensate for neglecting the fraction β of short-wave radiation absorbed at the surface of the water. This leads to unrealistic values of the light extinction coefficient, as the optimization pushes its value toward the limit of no transparency, consistent with the need to reproduce a significant absorption at the surface. Although it is well known that β is significantly larger than zero, its absence from the model was never noticed as critical. Automatic calibration tools provide valuable diagnostic insights into the physical robustness of models, enabling more precise evaluation of their structural integrity and performance."

The models and the way observations are used to improve the forecasts were changed, which led to a significant error reduction of 1 d forecasts. The new system performance in past conditions, where subsurface observations are scarce, was improved with more consistent ocean heat content estimates. The new system will be of better use for climate studies and will provide improved forecasts for end users. 
 The Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) is the Met Office's operational, coupled ocean–sea ice system, which produces analyses and short-range forecasts at global and regional scales each day for various stakeholders, including defence, marine navigation and science users. This paper describes and evaluates the impacts of recent model and data assimilation (DA) updates on global FOAM when compared to its current operational version. The model updates include the use of the TEOS10 formulation for the seawater equation of state, with improved ocean model settings in the Southern Ocean and the implementation of a new sea ice model. Updates to the DA include an increase in the number of DA minimisation iterations, an improved specification of observation errors for sea surface temperature and sea level anomaly (SLA), and optimisations of the DA computational efficiency. Large-scale DA corrections for temperature have also been removed to prevent an inconsistent projection of the SLA DA signal onto large-scale temperature at depth. For 1-year runs at 1/12° resolution, the new FOAM system shows a 40 % improvement in observation-minus-background (OmB) statistics for SLA and subsurface temperatures relative to the current system in eddy-rich regions, which result in a similar level of improvement for ocean currents. To evaluate potential impacts on the pre-Argo period, 1-year experiments at 1/4° resolution are run withholding profiles of temperature and salinity observations in both new and current FOAM systems. Limited to the assimilation of only surface data, OmB statistics for SLA, temperature and salinity in the new FOAM system can reach improvements up to 90 % in the Southern Hemisphere relative to the current system, resulting in more temporally consistent ocean transport and heat content results. Therefore, it is expected that the model and DA updates will lead to more potential for use of FOAM reanalyses in climate studies, particularly in the pre-Argo period, and will provide improved ocean–sea ice initial conditions to FOAM as well as to the Met Office short-range and seasonal coupled ocean–atmosphere–land–sea ice forecasting systems."

Yager,RiverBedDynamics v1.0: a Landlab component for computing two-dimensional sediment transport and river bed evolution,"Rivers shape landscapes by moving sediments and changing their beds, but existing computer models oversimplify these processes by only considering erosion. We developed new software that simulates how rivers transport sediments and change over time through both erosion and deposition. This helps scientists and engineers better predict river behavior for water management, flood prevention, and ecosystem protection. 
 Computational landscape evolution models (LEMs) typically comprise at least two interacting components: a flow hydraulic solver that routes water across a landscape and a fluvial geomorphological model that modifies terrain properties, primarily bed surface elevation. LEMs used in long-term simulations over large watersheds, including some available in the Landlab library, often assume that only erosive processes occur in rivers and that terrain elevation increases solely due to tectonic uplift. Consequently, these models cannot capture the dynamics of gravel-bedded rivers, lacking the capacity to include sediment mixtures, simulate sediment deposition, and track textural changes in substrate stratigraphy that result from varying flow characteristics. To address this limitation, we developed, implemented, and tested RiverBedDynamics, a new Landlab component that simulates the evolution of bed surface elevation and grain size distribution in 2D grids based on the Exner equation for sediment mass balance. By dynamically coupling RiverBedDynamics with Landlab's hydrodynamic flow solver, OverlandFlow, we created a new LEM capable of simulating the dynamics of local shear stresses, bed load transport rates, and grain size distributions. Comparisons of our LEM results with analytical and previously reported solutions demonstrate its ability to accurately predict time-varying local changes in bed surface elevation, including erosion and deposition, as well as grain size distribution. Furthermore, application of our LEM to a synthetic watershed illustrates how spatially variable rainfall intensity leads to varying discharge patterns, which in turn drive changes in bed elevation and grain size distribution across the domain. This approach provides a more comprehensive representation of the complex interactions between flow dynamics and sediment transport in gravel-bedded rivers at timescales ranging from individual flood events to yearly morphological changes, enhancing our ability to model landscape evolution across diverse geomorphic settings."

However, emerging evidence suggests that the oxidative dissolution of MSNPs can lead to the release of toxic metal ions. Here, we investigated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdSNPs) in zebrafish under environmentally relevant oxidative conditions induced by hypochlorite, a common disinfectant used in wastewater treatment. We observed that the dissolution of CdSNPs in hypochlorite solutions followed an inverted U-shaped pattern with respect to hypochlorite concentration and reaction time over 24 h. Compared with CdSNP exposure alone, hypochlorite-mediated oxidative dissolution markedly potentiated neurodevelopmental toxicity, evidenced by abnormal light–dark behavioral responses in transgenic hb9:EGFP zebrafish. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the toxicity was primarily driven by dissolved cadmium ions released both in vitro and in vivo, which disrupted serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. Metabolomic profiling and protein expression analyses revealed that cadmium disrupts the synthesis, metabolism, and receptor interactions of monoamine neurotransmitters. This study shows a previously underappreciated mechanism by which oxidative transformation under disinfection-relevant conditions enhances MSNP toxicity, offering critical insights into the ecological and health risks associated with metal sulfide nanoparticles in aquatic systems."

Notably, while no formation of new reaction products were observed, aqueous-phase mixtures exhibited greater complexity and higher toxicity compared to their gaseous counterparts.

During the study period, a total of 130,252 COPD deaths were included in the analyses. A monotonic, nonlinear increase in mortality from COPD, acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), and chronic bronchitis was observed with increasing eSAT. The effects were more prominent among females, older adults, widowed individuals, farmers, and individuals living in the city with lower ownership of air conditioners. Exposure to eSAT was responsible for 3.37%, 3.07%, and 4.59% of deaths from COPD, AECOPD, and chronic bronchitis, respectively. This study demonstrates the impact of extreme heat during sleep on COPD mortality and underscores the need for targeted interventions to protect respiratory health."

However, current techniques share common drawbacks such as low cost-effectiveness, harsh operating conditions, and overlooking of post-treatment environmental hazards. Herein, we propose a green mechanochemical strategy that utilizes the electrons and reactive oxygen species generated by ball milling to achieve ultrahighly efficient metal recovery and removal of residual organic pollutants. The recovery efficiencies from lithium manganese oxide (LMO) batteries reached ∼100% for lithium and 94.3% for manganese within 60 min, and the representative residual organic pollutants were effectively removed, ranging from 73.1 to 99.1%. Similar efficiencies were achieved for lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt batteries. The generation of abundant electrons and reactive oxygen species during the ball milling process is proposed as the main mechanism underlying the efficient metal recovery and pollutant degradation. The effective reduction in the valence state of manganese in the LMO powders was verified by X-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy. The excellent performance of our strategy in Li recovery and mitigating environmental hazards has far surpassed those of existing techniques and demonstrates the exceptional potential of mechanochemical ball milling as a green technique for LIB recycling."

Dispersed PET-NPs are widely present in the freshwater rivers and lakes of China with an average concentration of 2.23 μg/L, but they are rare in the saltwater. Much more PET-NPs are detected in the dialyzed and ultrasonicated samples, indicating the significant contribution of PET-NP aggregates in natural surface water. The total concentrations of PET-NPs in fresh lake water (average: 7.02 μg/L) are much higher than those in seawater (average: 1.71 μg/L). The lower critical coagulation concentration of PET-NPs indicates that they are more prone to aggregation than other nanoparticles. PET-NPs aggregate faster in seawater than in freshwater, and Na+ and Ca2+ significantly promote aggregation. Conversely, the higher dissolved organic matter in lake water inhibits the formation of large PET-NP aggregates. Therefore, more PET-NPs were present in fresh lake water and latent as small aggregates but fewer in seawater. Although the ecological risks of these latent PET-NPs are not yet clear, they are potential sources of dispersed nanoplastics."

We built random forest regression models to predict tritium concentrations from microbial family relative abundance (held-out testing coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.77 and mean absolute percentage error = 7%) and interpreted the models with Shapley additive explanation values. The most important families for predicting tritium concentrations were Nitrosopumilaceae and Methylomirabilaceae.

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a promising technique, but conventional solid SERS substrate-based detection faces difficulties such as ensuring NPs make contact with hotspots, dealing with uneven particle distribution, and poor detection repeatability. Herein, we propose a simple and sensitive SERS detection strategy by co-self-assembling silver (Ag) nanoparticles and NPs in a monolayer. 90% of NPs in solution spontaneously transfer to the monolayer within 30 s. More importantly, a single NP can be uniformly entrapped in Ag nanoparticle SERS “hotspots”, resulting in a significant enhancement of the intrinsic Raman signal. This enhancement enables quantitative detection in the range of 10–2–2 mg/L for 80, 300, and 800 nm polystyrene (PS) NPs, with a low detection limit of 10–2 mg/L. The method allows for the identification of various plastic types, including PS, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyformaldehyde (POM). This method was used to determine the efficacy of NP generation from bulk PS foam through physical (sand friction) and biological (mealworm ingestion) routes.

The underlying mechanisms of the proton-induced suppression remain elusive. This study demonstrates that NH4+ hydration significantly impacts reactive halogen species (RHS)-initiated oxidation. Our experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the unique solvation shell of NH4+ features strong hydrogen bonding, which creates a protective barrier that limits oxidant access particularly at acidic pH values. HClO/ClO– was less effective in interacting NH4+ due to the strong solvation shell surrounding NH4+. In contrast, HBrO/BrO– with a larger ion radius and lower charge density can disrupt the solvation layer, resulting in superior oxidation efficiency. The addition of methanol effectively alleviated NH4+ solvation and lowered the energy barrier associated with the rate-determining desolvation step, and thus markedly enhancing its reactivity. Electrochemical experiments involving in situ RHS generation validated superior NH4+-N removal performance in NaBr-based systems compared to NaCl. Moreover, the NaBr-involved electrochemical approach enabled simultaneous NH4+ oxidation and Cu recovery from [Cu(NH3)4]2+-containing synthetic wastewater.

To address this gap, a ship-based microcosm experiment was conducted, where OA and MP pollution were simulated under in situ conditions to explore their effects on the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS), bromoform (CHBr3), and dibromomethane (CH2Br2). The results indicated that both MP and OA inhibited phytoplankton growth and DMS concentration, with OA inducing further reductions in the production rate and yield of DMS. MP addition led to extra dissolved organic matter, and the acidified condition enhanced bromoperoxidase activity, both of which promoted the production of CHBr3 and CH2Br2. When OA and MP addition were combined, DMS concentrations decreased by 61%, whereas CHBr3 and CH2Br2 concentrations increased by 132% and 45%, respectively. Based on the results, MP pollution under OA conditions might directly reduce DMS accumulation or decrease the formation of DMS-derived sulfate aerosols by increasing CHBr3 and CH2Br2 levels, which finally weaken DMS’s climate-cooling capabilities.

PhaC concentrations in urine ranged from hundreds of μg/L up to tens of mg/L with some PhaC detected at concentrations above 20,000 μg/L. This concentration range is 3–4 orders of magnitude above what is found in wastewater. Intensive care unit patient urine, collected in urine drainage bags, is a promising point of intervention, as it can be easily separated from other waste streams and treated on-site. To screen for potential on-site treatment options, we tested the PhaC removal potential of a commercial activated carbon, a steam-activated biochar, and ion exchange resins in both batch and column experiments. These experiments showed that pore size distribution of activated carbon was a crucial factor for PhaC removal. Ion exchange resins were generally worse sorbents, including for charged PhaCs.

In this work, we found that N2O had a CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emission factor twice that of CO2 or PFCs. We also identified a significant linear relationship between the N2O emission factor and the product of the electrolysis cell number, the anode effect coefficient, and the duration. Based on the above results, we estimated that global N2O emissions from the AEI reached 65.1 ± 6.4 Mt of CO2eq/year in 2018. The newly discovered N2O emissions constituted 27.4–52.2% of total GGE in the AEI and 15.7–65.1% of existing industrial N2O emissions. These findings highlighted that the AEI was a long-neglected source of N2O emissions. The N element content control in carbon anodes may be an effective measure to reduce N2O emissions during the processing of the anode effect.

Two static vegetation scenarios deviate in opposite directions from DYNM in irrigation‐induced precipitation responses: DYNM indicates a slight decrease, LUSH shows a more pronounced decrease, while BARE presents a significant increase. These discrepancies stem from different magnitudes of irrigation‐induced evapotranspiration and cooling stabilization.

(b) At the national scale, the spatial distribution of AP shows a pattern of higher density in the north and lower density in the south, with more AP in the east than in the west. Notably, inland AP account for 15% of the national total.

Large‐scale and rapid invasion of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has imposed significant impacts on coastal wetland ecosystems and biodiversity globally. Tracking dynamic trajectories of S. alterniflora and the rhythmic changes of its vegetation functional traits is important to understand the invasion mechanism. This study proposed a novel time series adaptive threshold segmentation method (NSATS) to extract S. alterniflora. Specifically, for the San Francisco Bay (SFB) of the U.S., the extraction was carried out from 1995 to 2004, while for three representative bays along the coastal zone of China, the extraction was conducted from 2011 to 2020, respectively, and to explore their spatio‐temporal distribution patterns. We developed an innovative CCD‐HCM method to track the historical growth trajectories of S. alterniflora, and evaluated their growth dynamics. Finally, we explored the phenological rhythm of S. alterniflora functional traits, and clarified the response mechanisms of its vegetation functional traits to hydro‐meteorological factors. NSATS showed high accuracy (0.82–0.96) in identifying S. alterniflora. Its invasion was faster in China's bays, with rapid expansion in 2011–2020, especially in YRD. SFB remained stable, with minor changes. Functional traits showed earlier SOS and longer LOS with latitude decrease. Air and water temperatures influence S. alterniflora traits differently across bays. These findings aid in monitoring and controlling its invasion."

 Lipids are essential components of cancer cells due to their structural and signalling roles1. To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2–5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.

 Natural killer (NK) cells use inhibitory and activating immune receptors to differentiate between human cells and pathogens. Signalling by these receptors determines whether an NK cell becomes activated and destroys a target cell. In some cases, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, immune receptors are found in pairs, with inhibitory and activating receptors containing nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains coupled to different intracellular signalling domains1. Previous studies showed that repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, displayed on the surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, can bind to inhibitory immune receptors and dampen NK cell activation2,3, reducing parasite killing. However, no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for any human activating receptor. Here we identified a clade of RIFINs that bind to inhibitory immune receptor KIR2DL1 more strongly than KIR2DL1 binds to the human ligand (MHC class I). This interaction mediates inhibitory signalling and suppresses the activation of KIR2DL1-expressing NK cells. We show that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs are abundant in field-isolated strains from both Africa and Asia and reveal how the two RIFINs bind to KIR2DL1. The RIFIN binding surface of KIR2DL1 is conserved in the cognate activating immune receptor KIR2DS1. We find that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs can also bind to KIR2DS1, resulting in the activation of KIR2DS1-expressing NK cells. This study demonstrates that activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors can recruit NK cells to target a pathogen and reveals a potential role for activating immune receptors in controlling malaria infection.

 Mapping the spatial organization of DNA-level somatic copy number changes in tumors can provide insight to understanding higher-level molecular and cellular processes that drive pathogenesis. We describe an integrated framework of spatial transcriptomics, tumor/normal DNA sequencing, and bulk RNA sequencing to identify shared and distinct characteristics of an initial cohort of eleven gliomas of varied pathology and a replication cohort of six high-grade glioblastomas. We identify focally amplified extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in four of the eleven initial gliomas, with subclonal tumor heterogeneity in two EGFR-amplified grade IV glioblastomas. In a TP53-mutated glioblastoma, we detect a subclone with EGFR amplification on ecDNA coupled to chromosome 17 loss of heterozygosity. To validate subclonal somatic aneuploidy and copy number alterations associated with ecDNA double minutes, we examine the replication cohort, identifying MDM2/MDM4 ecDNA subclones in two glioblastomas. The spatial heterogeneity of EGFR and p53 inactivation underscores the role of ecDNA in enabling rapid oncogene amplification and enhancing tumor adaptability under selective pressure.

 Cultural systems play an important role in shaping the interactions between humans and the environment, and are in turn shaped by these interactions. However, at present, cultural systems are poorly integrated into the models used by climate scientists to study the interaction of natural and anthropogenic processes (i.e. Earth systems models) due to pragmatic and conceptual barriers. In this Perspective, we demonstrate how the archaeology of climate change, an interdisciplinary field that uses the archaeological record to explore human-environment interactions, is uniquely placed to overcome these barriers. We use concepts drawn from climate science and evolutionary anthropology to show how complex systems modeling that focuses on the spatial structure of the environment and its impact on demographic variables, social networks and cultural evolution, can bridge the gap between large-scale climate processes and local-scale social processes. The result is a blueprint for the design of integrative models that produce testable hypotheses about the impact of climate change on human systems.

 Climate advertising on social media can shape attitudes towards climate change.

Here, we present a two-part study—an observational analysis (n = 253,125) and a field experiment (M = 650)—to investigate algorithmic bias in Facebook’s climate ad dissemination. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the algorithm’s selection of ad audiences can be explained by factors such as ad content, audience location (US states), gender and age group. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of contrarian ads is linked with the conservative political alignment of a state, while the cost-effectiveness of advocacy ads correlates with liberal political alignment, higher population and per-capita gross domestic product; ad targeting strategies further modulate these effects. The skew in the distribution of climate ads across US states, age groups and genders reinforces existing climate attitudes.

 In March 2024, the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex (ASPV) collapsed dramatically. The following April, extreme precipitation in South China (SCP) caused severe floods and economic damage. Whether and how they are connected is crucial yet unclear. Through observations and model simulations, we demonstrate that the ASPV collapse in March amplified extreme SCP in April 2024. As stratospheric anomalies persistently propagated downward, March ASPV had a pronounced impact on the North Atlantic tropospheric circulation in April, exciting eastward-propagating Rossby waves. The resulting lower-tropospheric cyclonic anomaly over South China enhanced vertical motion and moisture transport, with vertical ascent dominating the extreme precipitation. The ASPV’s influence on SCP ranked just behind that of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and together they improved SCP predictability to 52%. A weakened March ASPV increased extreme April SCP occurrence by 45%.

 Pesticides assured food security for decades, but have left humanity with degraded soils, polluted water, and biodiversity losses1. Enhanced crop diversity contributes to the regulation of insect pests, weeds, and diseases2–4, and is therefore assumed to allow pesticide reduction. At the cropping system scale, pesticide use is affected more by crop species than by the number of crops5, because crops have contrasting sensitivities to pests and contrasting pesticide requirements. Here, we disentangled the effects of diversity from the effects of crop species, for 1285 cropping systems in French commercial arable farms, using 28 indicators of functional diversity. A composite diversity metric, combining indicators with the greatest explanatory power, accounted for 8% of the pesticide use variance, much less than the variance due to crop species. The results suggest that reducing agricultural reliance on pesticides through diversification is feasible when different components of diversity—namely, crop species and diversity features—are combined.

 :High spatial resolution Ice/snow Surface Temperature (IST) data provides prominent advantages for polar research, such as identification of sea ice lead, monitoring of surface melting on ice shelves and variations of polynyas. As the first satellite dedicated to sustainable development goals, SDGSAT-1 is equipped with 30 m thermal infrared bands, making it highly promising for monitoring fine scale process in polar regions. In this study, an optimal IST retrieval algorithm for SDGSAT-1 was selected from ten widely used Split-Window Algorithms (SWAs), with emphasis on two key criteria: low sensitivity to emissivity and high absolute retrieval accuracy. Sensitivity analysis identified four SWAs (PR1984, VI1991, UL1994, and Enter2019) exhibited low sensitivity to emissivity and sensor equivalent noise, and thereby for subsequent validation. Evaluation using simulated data showed that the overall uncertainty of four SWAs was less than 0.2 K, with PR1984 exhibiting a slight cold Bias of −0.16 K compared to the other three SWAs. Validation using in-situ IST data indicated that the overall uncertainty for four SWAs was less than 1.7 K, with a Bias of approximately −1 K, and PR1984 showed larger Bias and RMSE. Intercomparisons among the four SWAs and cross-validation with MODIS IST also demonstrated that PR1984 had a cold Bias compared to the other three algorithms, while VI1991, UL1994, and Enter2019 showed similar accuracy. Considering that Enter2019 has stability and low sensitivity to surface emissivity, high IST retrieval accuracy, and is widely applied and well recognized as the official land surface temperature retrieval algorithm for the VIIRS sensor, this study recommends Enter2019 as the optimal IST retrieval algorithm for SDGSAT-1.

 Hyperspectral remote sensing has great potential for monitoring chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in optically complex waters. However, various hyperspectral indices currently used for retrieving Chla in productive waters exhibit drawbacks due to interference from other water parameters, imperfect atmospheric correction, and the constraints imposed by discrete spectral bands. To address these issues, we proposed a novel spectral index called the Red-Edge reflectance Peak Width Index (REPWI) for productive waters, which is defined as the horizontal wavelength distance from the fixed wavelength of red reflectance valley (678 nm) to the intersection of the right side of the red-edge reflectance peak curve. Firstly, the bio-optical model was used to clarify the theoretical basis and relationship between REPWI and Chla. Then, in situ remote sensing reflectance and Chla data from 57 water bodies worldwide were used to calibrate and validate the REPWI-based Chla retrieval model. The REPWI-based model achieved high accuracy (coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.92, mean relative error of 26.5 %, and root mean square error of 13.7 mg/m3), significantly outperforming other spectral indices. Furthermore, REPWI maintained a strong correlation with Chla (R2 = 0.87–0.90) when applied to major on-orbit hyperspectral satellites equivalent spectra. Finally, the REPWI-based Chla retrieval model was applied to ZY1-02D hyperspectral imagery, which obtained high accuracy and demonstrated resistance to imperfect atmospheric correction. In summary, this novel hyperspectral index, REPWI, has demonstrated a solid theoretical foundation and significant advantages in monitoring Chla in productive waters."

To address this, we propose Diversity-Mix Remote Sensing (DMRS), a foundation model-based framework designed for long-tailed remote sensing scene recognition. DMRS introduces two key innovations: (1) multi-low-rank adaptation diversity experts, which achieves balanced classification by specializing different experts for different regions of the class distribution, and (2) a semantic-aware mixing strategy, which incorporates textual semantic information typically unused in traditional classification to enhance perception across diverse remote sensing scenes. Extensive experiments on NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRS, achieving 6.7% and 2.0% improvements in overall accuracy, respectively, while significantly enhancing the recognition of tail classes. These results highlight the potential of DMRS in tackling long-tail challenges in remote sensing scene classification.

 The significant advances of cloud-based remote sensing frameworks have allowed researchers to develop large-scale analytics for better understanding, monitoring of, and decision-making around sensitive and valuable coastal ecosystems like seagrass meadows. However, an information gap related with the spatially-explicit accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) products has been identified. The goal of this study is to estimate the per pixel uncertainty of a Random Forest classification of four benthic habitats and exploit it to retrain the model through training data selection by bootstrapping and producing an ensemble model. The calculation of the spatially-explicit uncertainty is based on the Shannon Entropy equation and the probability values of a successful prediction according to the ML model. The remote sensing data for this study are sourced from the European Union Copernicus Sentinel-2 twin satellite system and Planet’s cubesat satellite constellation respectively, and have been processed and analyzed through the Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform. The national extent of The Bahamas and the regional extent of the Wakatobi archipelago in Indonesia comprise our study sites. Our results indicate the potential of the presented uncertainty workflow for optimizing the classification and the usefulness of the produced uncertainty map to aid policy-makers through our provided spatially-explicit accuracy metrics. More precisely in the case of the Bahamas, the percentile differences for seagrass user and producer accuracies are improved in the ranges of 1.16–4.77 % and 4.36–8.54 %, respectively, in comparison with a standard supervised classification. In conclusion, spatially-explicit uncertainty information can and should be used as unique and vital geospatial information suitable for ML classification optimization and as a tool for better decision-making and field expedition planning, and understanding of benthic ecosystems."

 Land use/land cover (LULC) classification based on deep learning techniques is a significant research area for analyzing high-resolution remote sensing(HRRS) images. However, due to the limitation of available samples and model feature extraction capability, the current deep learning methods suffer from weak generalization ability for widespread and effective application across diverse HRRS scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an innovative network model named multi-level feature adaptation-segment anything Model (MLFA-SAM). The model employs a three-level fine-tuning strategy to adapt the SAM foundation model for remote sensing LULC classification. The proposed MLFA-SAM significantly enhances high-precision classification performance across diverse HRRS scenarios. Specifically, the domain distribution shift adaptation (DDSA) level is designed to adjust the input image modality for SAM and initially extract features and overcome the domain distribution shift between remote sensing images and the natural images used by the SAM. Then, we designed depthwise low-rank adaptation (DLRA) strategy to optimally fine-tune the frozen SAM parameters. Finally, we improved SAM’s mask decoder to generate high-quality multi-class masks required for LULC classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the MLFA-SAM model surpasses several existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods on the HRLC dataset and the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MLFA-SAM, with its concise yet efficient architecture, achieves 66.77% mIoU and 86.02% OA on the HRLC dataset. Notably, the integration of near-infrared (Nir) bands further enhances its performance to 68.43% mIoU and 87.91% OA. The generalization test on the LoveDA dataset, along with four test HRRS images exhibiting spatiotemporal and semantic scene differences, further demonstrate that MLFA-SAM possesses a stronger generalization ability compared to existing methods and shows greater potential for practical applications."

 Size-dependent airborne metal solubility in air and living organisms has been identified as a key parameter to understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, global biogeochemical cycles, indoor air quality, and aerosol toxicity. Emission sources play a dominant role in size-dependent airborne metal solubility, which could be enhanced by atmospheric aging. Studies show that toxic metals (e.g., heavy metals) concentrated in submicron particles tend to have a higher solubility compared to crustal metals and possess even higher solubility levels in biological fluids than those in water, which may trigger more adverse health effects. Factors related to metal solubility and particle size, such as liquid water concentrations and acidity levels, mixing states, and particle parameters of particles, were discussed. Analytical techniques on various scales play an essential role in accurately measuring size-dependent metal solubility, particularly for soluble fractions. Available detection techniques at bulk and single particle levels were examined, including offline, online, and mapping analysis. The purpose of this overview is to summarize the current understanding of size-dependent airborne metal solubility and related state-of-the-art analytical techniques.

 Changes in rainfall seasonality can have far-reaching impacts on the livelihood of population, agricultural production, and ecosystem sustainability. However, the changes in rainfall seasonality and associated climatic causes are largely unclear, especially in global land monsoon regions. Here, we analyzed the variations of rainfall seasonality during 1960–2022, and explored the possible effects of global climate teleconnections (CTs) on rainfall seasonality changes in global land monsoon regions using interpretable machine learning and multivariate wavelet coherency method. The results show that rainfall seasonality weakens significantly in northeastern South Asian, northeastern South American, and most parts of southern North African and South African monsoon regions, but enhances significantly in southern South Asian, northern North African, and southwestern South American monsoon regions. Rainfall seasonality also experiences an abrupt change in all hotspots during 1960–2022. We also find that many CTs are nonmonotonically related to rainfall seasonality in these hotspots, and the key CTs that explain the variations in rainfall seasonality differ across different hotspots using interpretable machine learning. The coupled influences of the key CTs on rainfall seasonality are also significant at certain scales during different periods in these hotspots. However, the key CTs have undergone changes, with stronger impacts on rainfall seasonality in almost all hotspots since 1990s.

We search for possible observational evidence for such a relationship by examining evolutions of the virtual geomagnetic axial dipole moment and the atmospheric oxygen level over the past 540 million years. We find that both exhibit strong linearly increasing trends, coupled with a large surge in magnitude between 330 and 220 million years ago. Our time series analysis and statistical tests show that both are highly correlated, with the maximum correlation reached when there is no time lag between the two. Our findings suggest unexpected strong connections between the geophysical processes in Earth’s deep interior, the surface redox budget, and biogeochemical cycling."

However, conventional tools are blind to the nanoscale dynamics of this metastable interface. Here, we leverage electrified cryo–electron microscopy (eCryo-EM), a technique that rapidly freezes and kinetically traps these dynamic, nonequilibrium states during battery operation for nanoscale characterization. Collective snapshots of the electrified interface at controlled time intervals quantifies early-stage growth kinetics of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivation film that governs electron and ion transport. Unexpectedly, the diffusivity of charged species of the two SEI films with differing chemistry and performance are estimated to be within 10% of the other, indicated by the slope of their diffusion-limited SEI growth regimes. Instead, the slope of the reaction-limited SEI growth regimes differs by a factor of 3, suggesting that lowered reactivity of the high-performance electrolyte is largely responsible for its high coulombic efficiency."

Existing MAOC is thought to preclude additional C storage on minerals, but this perspective is difficult to reconcile with observations that MAOC stacks in multilayers, suggesting that existing MAOC could promote greater C retention. Here, in a manipulative experiment using 118 soils from 15 agricultural sites across the United States, we show that MAOC formation is promoted by both existing MAOC and its counterpart—MAOC saturation deficit. The positive effect of existing MAOC on the formation of new MAOC persists after accounting for soil physicochemical properties that covary with MAOC. In contrast with current theory, we found that MAOC formation was not clearly influenced by microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE). Our findings demonstrate that existing MAOC and saturation deficit, not microbial CUE, are key to determining new MAOC formation in agricultural soils."

We reconstituted ABCB19 into lipid nanodiscs, where activity was drastically higher than in detergents, and determined its cryo–electron microscopy structures in substrate-free, substrate-bound, vanadate-trapped, and inhibitor-bound states. Inward-facing ABCB19 moved inward upon substrate binding and fully closed with vanadate trapping, unexpectedly temperature dependent.

However, the knowledge is limited because of the complexities of the multiphoton interactions with molecules in the nonperturbative regime. Here, we address these challenges using an orthogonal two-color (OTC) scheme, which combines different photon energies and polarizations of the laser fields to produce characteristic photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) that vary with the laser phase. By analyzing the phase-dependent PADs, the partial waves, including their individual amplitudes and phases, involved in the nondissociative and dissociative single ionization of H2are unambiguously resolved. In addition, the interaction phases accumulated during the absorption of multiple photons of different polarizations are revealed.

Although the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ROS production and scavenging genes have been studied, the regulation of these TFs to control ROS accumulation remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that during N nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–mediated immunity, Alfin-like 7 (AL7) is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 7 (UBR7). UBR7 interacts with AL7 and acts as a molecular brake to mediate the ubiquitination of AL7 at lysine-20, leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation. UBR7 functions upstream of AL7 to reduce AL7-induced ROS accumulation duringN-mediated defense. The phosphorylation of AL7 at serine-174 enhances its interaction with UBR7, thereby increasing AL7 ubiquitination and reducing AL7 stability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which ROS accumulation is regulated through the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of a TF during the immune response. This ensures precise switching of ROS signaling to prevent excessive defense responses."

Using reconfigurable nanoscale control over conductivity at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3interface, we create chiral electron potentials that explicitly lack mirror symmetry. Quantum transport measurements on these chiral nanowires reveal enhanced electron pairing persisting to high magnetic fields (up to 18 tesla) and oscillatory transmission resonances as functions of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region.

We previously found that human Tregcells minimally produce IL-10 and have a limited capacity to control innate immunity compared to type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells). To create “hybrid” CAR Tregcells with Tr1 cell-like properties, we examined whether thePDCD1locus could be exploited to endow Tregcells with CAR-regulated IL-10 expression. CRISPR-mediated PD1 deletion increased CAR Tregcell activation, and knock-in ofIL10under control of the PD1 promoter resulted in CAR-induced IL-10 secretion.IL10knock-in improved CAR Tregcell function, as determined by increased suppression of dendritic cells and alloantigen- and islet autoantigen–specific T cells. In vivo,IL10knock-in CAR Tregcells were stable, safe, and suppressed dendritic cells and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease.

Our approach is evaluated using both a rigorously controlled dataset and a realistic high-throughput dataset comprising extensive reaction screenings across diverse catalysts sets and experimental conditions.

Forces act on the channels by causing their curved blades to flatten and decompact, leading to an activated state, but it is unclear how this is regulated to enable the channels to adapt to different contexts. To identify potential mechanisms, we performed coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on human PIEZO1. We observed an interblade handshake interaction mediated by basic amino acid residues in two flexible helices coordinated with regulated anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The interaction determined the resting configuration of the channel, blade curvature, compactness, and ion pore structure. In experiments, disruption of the handshake by neutralization of helix amino acids or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion increased the channel’s sensitivity to membrane tension. Structural and amino acid sequence analysis for multiple PIEZOs predicted helix amino acid arrangements for varied handshaking intensity. We suggest a dynamic interaction in PIEZO channels that regulates force sensitivity."

The mechanism underlying this coordination is not well understood. Here, we show that a conserved molecular chaperone, chloroplast signal recognition particle 43-kDa protein (cpSRP43), provides a molecular thermostat that helps maintain this coordination. cpSRP43 undergoes a conformational rearrangement between a well-folded closed state and a partially disordered open state. Closed cpSRP43 is dedicated to the biogenesis of LHCPs, whereas open cpSRP43 protects multiple Chl biosynthesis enzymes from heat-induced destabilization. Rising temperature shifts cpSRP43 to the open state, enabling it to protect heat-destabilized Chl biosynthesis enzymes. Our results reveal the molecular basis of a posttranslational mechanism for the thermoadaptation of LHC biogenesis.

The study reveals that the autophagy-regulating gene PLAC8 (placenta-specific 8) is significantly involved in Cd-induced prostate carcinogenesis, and NF-κB acts as the upstream transcriptional activator of PLAC8, which then selectively up-regulates BCL-xL, providing a survival advantage to Cd-transformed cells. NF-κB activation stabilizes PLAC8 in the cytosol, disrupting autophagy by allowing PLAC8 to colocalize with LC3B instead of LAMP1. Silencing NF-κB down-regulates PLAC8 and its survival function while inhibiting NF-κB or PLAC8, which restores autophagy and decreases tumor growth in xenograft models. In addition, targeting BCL-xL confirmed this signaling pathway. The findings suggest that sustained NF-κB activation regulates PLAC8 and highlights the NF-κB–PLAC8–BCL-xL axis as a potential target for early detection and therapies in metal-induced prostate cancer."

It has been hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) in contrast to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can reduce tree species diversity in local communities, which remains to be tested at the global scale. To address this gap, we analyzed global forest inventory data and revealed that the relationship between tree species richness and EcM tree proportion varied along environmental gradients. Specifically, the relationship is more negative at low latitudes and in moist conditions but is unimodal at high latitudes and in arid conditions. The negative association of EcM tree proportion on species diversity at low latitudes and in humid conditions is likely due to more negative plant-soil microbial interactions in these regions.

While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a sixfold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice’s field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal’s topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a twofold anisotropic response indicative of the emergence of a symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the potential of pyrochlore frustrated magnet/topological semimetal heterostructures in search of emergent interfacial phenomena."

Spatially dispersed delocalized singlet excitons (DSEs) in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) provide an alternative channel to promote charge generation without interfacial CT state. Here, we manipulate intermolecular interactions, carrier dynamics, and photovoltaic properties through selective asymmetric fluorination. Two asymmetric molecules, Z12 and Z13, were synthesized by substituting the terminal group with different fluorine atoms compared with the symmetrical molecule, Z11. Z12 showed enhanced molecular interactions, promoting to more compact and ordered stacking, which in turn promotes the DSE formation, benefiting the synergistic enhancement ofVOCandJSC. The D18:Z12-based device achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, notably outperforming the other two devices.

Here, we developed an Ecopath model for the East China Sea (ECS) with 45 functional groups and constructed an Ecosim model with 15 scenarios, using fishing effort (FE) and sea surface temperature (SST) as driving variables. The resistance resilience stability (RRS) index was proposed to quantify the comprehensive changes in total biomass and stability of the ECS under dual pressures from 2000 to 2100. SST increase led to biomass declines eight to 12 times greater than FE increase, though 63.06% of economic species were negatively affected by rising FE. Notably, several key economic species may face the risk of extinction by the end of the century under a 10% FE increase and 4.0 °C SST rise. This will pose a significant disturbance to the ecosystem stability. However, our results suggest that reducing FE to 50% of current levels and limiting SST rise to within 1.5 °C could effectively prevent a further biomass reduction and keep the RRS index within reasonable limits.

Herein, carbon doped Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15 (PtCx/SBA-15) were prepared by ethane (C2H6) heat treatment on SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts (Pt/SBA-15). Characterization results disclose that carbon atoms are successfully introduced in Pt particles, forming unique PtCx active sites. The PtCx active sites exhibit strong C2H4 adsorption and activation ability, enhanced hydrophobicity, and high catalytic activity for CO oxidation. As a result, PtCx/SBA-15 catalysts exhibit much higher C2H4 conversion and CO2 yield than Pt/SBA-15 catalysts at 0 °C. Particularly, 3PtCx/SBA-15 maintains 100% conversion of 50 ppm of C2H4 for more than 7 h and even displays 93.2% C2H4 conversion and 88.8% CO2 yield after 20 h of time-on-stream (TOS), exhibiting unprecedentedly prominent catalytic performance. This study provides a universal and efficient strategy to accurately enhance the surface hydrophobicity of noble metal particles employed in the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of C2H4.

In this study, we collected matched samples of indoor dust, drinking water, and urine from 81 households in Indiana, United States, and analyzed these samples for 82 CUPs, including 48 insecticides, 25 herbicides, and 9 fungicides. Of these, 47 CUPs were identified across samples of indoor dust, drinking water, and urine with median total CUP (∑CUP) concentrations of 18 300 ng/g, 101 ng/L, and 2.93 ng/mL, respectively. Notably, concentrations of neonicotinoids (NEOs) in indoor dust were higher than those reported in other studies. Herbicides were the most abundant CUPs detected in drinking water, constituting 55% of the ∑CUP concentrations. Insecticides were the most abundant CUP group detected in urine (median total insecticide concentration: 2.30 ng/mL), followed by herbicides (median: 0.409 ng/mL) and fungicides (median: 0.0531 ng/mL).

However, during this transformation, the reduction capacity of the Fe(II)aq–Fe(III) oxyhydroxide system evolves substantially over time and its impacts on contaminant attenuation processes remain unclear. In this study, a single quantitative relationship between contaminant reduction rates (ksa) and shifts in the reduction capacity during the ferrihydrite transformation (log(ksa) = 0.91·(−EH/59 mV – pH) + 2.96) was established using nitrobenzene as a representative contaminant, despite variations in transformation pathways and product assemblages at different pH values and Fe(II)aq concentrations. The reduction capacity of such systems was dependent on the iron oxide composition when ferrihydrite was transformed to more thermodynamically stable Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. EH decreased from 1.5 and – 46.8 mV to −113.1 and −136.5 mV (all measurements vs. a standard hydrogen electrode) as ferrihydrite transformed to lepidocrocite and goethite, respectively. When structural Fe(II)-containing magnetite was formed, decreases in the pH and Fe(II)aq concentration increased EH from −159.7 to −79.9 mV.

Seven-day-old spheroids (400 μm diameter) exhibited increased levels of neutral lipids─cholesterol esters (CEs) and diacylglycerols (DGs)─alongside reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (fasn, acc, and scebf1) compared to cell monolayers. This suggests a metabolic shift from lipid synthesis to lipid storage. Additionally, spheroids showed a reorganization of membrane lipids, with an increased ratio of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) to phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and elevated levels of phospholipids containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6). Upon exposure to β-naphthoflavone (BNF), the spheroids showed a markedly higher expression of cyp1a (650-fold) compared to monolayers (57-fold increase), indicating increased metabolic competence.

The oxygenation of Fe(II) under oxic conditions produces hydroxyl radicals (•OH). However, the influence of PC on this process remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of PC on •OH generation during ferrihydrite transformation by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 at the redox interfaces. The results showed that PC increased •OH generation by 2.3–6.5-fold during the oxygenation of Fe(II) and this enhancement correlated with the redox properties of PC. Electrochemical analysis indicated that PC decreased the redox potential of Fe(II) and facilitated the interfacial electron transfer of Fe(II), thereby increasing Fe(II) oxidation by 33–86%. PC mediated electron transfer from Fe(II) to O2 to sequentially generate O2•–, H2O2, and •OH through oxygen-containing functional groups and graphitic structures. During the decomposition of H2O2 by Fe(II) to produce •OH, PC inhibited Fe(IV) formation by preventing O-atom transfer from H2O2 to Fe(II) and promoted •OH generation by facilitating electron transfer from Fe(II) to H2O2. Consequently, PC increased •OH generation efficiency by 2.9–3.3-fold, making a major contribution to the enhanced •OH generation than to the increased Fe(II) oxidation (9–13% at most). This study improves our understanding of the effect of PC on Fe cycling and provides mechanistic insights into PC-enhanced •OH generation from the oxygenation of Fe(II) during the microbial transformation of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides at redox interfaces."

This study aims to examine the association between energy burden and CKD prevalence across 500 U.S. cities by using nationally representative data sets. Utilizing propensity score matching and a random intercept analysis, we found that census tracts with high energy burden were significantly associated with a 0.195 higher chronic kidney prevalence [95% CI: 0.144–0.246] compared to those with low energy burden, after adjusting key observed characteristics such as living, housing, and sociodemographic conditions of census tracts. Other risk factors contributing to increased CKD prevalence included older building age, higher percentages of nonwhite populations and older adults, lower educational levels, and lower average household incomes. The findings highlight that energy burden is not merely a financial problem but rather a social determinant of CKD health and a significant risk factor for increased CKD prevalence in U.S. urban areas.

This Bedrock Vadose Zone (BVZ) has been shown to store and circulate water, host organic carbon respiration and serve as a critical source of rock‐derived nutrients. However, the extent to which deep roots influence chemical weathering rates remains poorly understood. Here, we report 4 years of depth‐resolved major ion chemistry over a 16‐m thick BVZ hosting a deep rhizosphere in a catchment subject to a Mediterranean climate. These data allow development and validation of a reactive transport model (RTM), revealing that the timescales of water storage and drainage in the BVZ are sufficient to facilitate substantial chemical weathering of the shale bedrock. However, observed solute concentrations are only reproduced by the RTM when we explicitly include measured rates of CO2(g) ${\text{CO}}_{2(g)}$ production meters below soil driven by the deeply rooted forest. By combining direct observations and a process‐based RTM we conclude that the carbon respiration promoted by deep roots significantly enhances chemical weathering rates in the BVZ, constituting 43% ± $\pm $ 3% of total solute flux from the base of the BVZ to the water table."

Achieving these objectives requires accurate reconstruction of wind speeds and wind directions that assimilate real‐time observations, but current methods used for such reconstructions remain computationally expensive and challenging to solve highly nonlinear equations. By selecting multiple regions in the Pacific Ocean as case studies, we explore the fusion of sparse scatterometer observations from different satellites with physics‐informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct large‐scale sea surface wind fields, effectively integrating observations and filling data gaps. The result demonstrates that PINNs can efficiently reconstruct full realistic wind fields from sparse data at a low computation cost. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that can preserve fine‐scale details while capturing the key features of the wind field. Evaluation against reference data sets, including buoy measurements, ERA5, and cross‐calibrated multiplatform (CCMP) wind speed and direction, highlights the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. Compared to the reanalysis data of ERA5 and CCMP, the wind field reconstructed by the PINN closely aligns with the observation.

 Compared with those provided by polar-orbiting satellites/sensors (e.g., Landsat/MODIS), new-generation geostationary satellites, such as Himawari-8 and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R), offer temporally continuous and much more frequent observations of the land surface over the course of the diurnal cycle. In this study, Himawari-8 land surface temperature (LST) data and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) were assimilated into a coupled two-source surface energy balance–vegetation dynamics model (TSEB-VDM) via the variational data assimilation (VDA) method to retrieve the regional sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary productivity (GPP) (hereafter referred to as the VDAHimawari-8 scheme). Regional H, LE, and GPP values were estimated across the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwestern China, with a spatial resolution of 0.02° × 0.02°. Moreover, LST data from the MODIS, which is an instrument onboard polar-orbiting satellites (i.e., Terra and Aqua), were assimilated into the TSEB-VDM model (hereafter referred to as the VDAMODIS scheme) for comparison with the VDAHimawari-8 scheme. Four unknown parameters of the TSEB-VDM model, i.e., the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (CHN), the evaporative fractions of the soil and canopy (EFS and EFC, respectively), and the specific leaf area, were optimized via the VDA approach. The estimated H and LE values were validated against ground measurements from the large-aperture scintillator, and the GPP estimates were validated against eddy covariance data at three sites (Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the HRB. The results indicated that the assimilation of geostationary satellite-based LST data significantly improved the performance of the VDA model. The three-site-average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the H, LE, and GPP estimates from the VDAMODIS scheme were 45.27 W m−2, 83.77 W m−2, and 3.30 g C m−2 d−1, respectively. Compared with the VDAMODIS scheme, the VDAHimawari-8 scheme notably enhanced the performance of the VDA framework and decreased the RMSE by 15.0 % for H, 22.5 % for LE, and 38.5 % for the GPP, with an especially notable enhancement in humid (or vegetated) areas. The primary factors contributing to the enhancement in the performance of the VDA framework were the availability of much more frequent LST observations and the diurnal sampling capability of the Himawari-8 satellite."

 The impacts of climate change pose significant challenges to global forest ecosystems, particularly in Mediterranean evergreen forests dominated by Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.). Since the CLMS 10-daily Gross Dry Matter Productivity (GDMP) product represents the potential productivity and, by definition, does not account for water stress, this study aims to evaluate and improve the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) estimation based on GDMP for these forests. To achieve this, we assessed the GDMP-derived GPP (RS-GPPst) against eddy covariance GPP data (EC-GPP) from six Aleppo pine forest stands across the Mediterranean basin, covering 30 site-years and spanning a climatic gradient from semi-arid to semi-humid conditions. Additionally, we analyzed the ecophysiological response of Aleppo pine to drought, focusing on environmental factors such as temperature and water stress (i.e., atmospheric based on vapor pressure deficit and edaphic based on soil water content) to refine the GPP model. Our results indicated that the RS-GPPst underestimates EC-GPP during cold periods. Using ERA5-Land data, we proposed a simplified approach to remove the temperature limitation factor and incorporated a soil water content factor, which significantly enhanced model accuracy, reduced uncertainty, and improved precision. The soil water-corrected GPP model achieved a Pearson correlation of r = 0.85, a negligible bias, and an RMSE of 1.1 gC m−2 d−1, providing a more accurate representation of GPP across varying climatic conditions. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and integrating key limiting environmental stressors, particularly water stress, into GPP models for water-limited ecosystems. The improved model, relying solely on remote sensing data without requiring in-situ measurements, offers a robust approach for large-scale carbon cycle monitoring."

 Snowmelt provides critical water resources that impact ecosystem health and hazard frequency; however, the timing of melt is difficult to infer across large spatial scales. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used to detect snowmelt onset, the accuracy of different methodological approaches requires evaluation. We use Sentinel-1 SAR observations to estimate snowmelt timing at automated snow water equivalent (SWE) stations (n = 52) across British Columbia between 2018 and 2021. The timing of backscatter minima are compared to snowmelt onset estimates derived from continuous SWE and surface air temperature records. First, we develop a manual selection method, which requires SWE and air temperature records, to determine the feasibility of SAR for estimating snowmelt onset. Using this approach, we demonstrate that images with identical viewing geometries (i.e., those from the same orbital track) should be utilized for snowmelt onset estimation with SAR, and that including the timing of local minima, a minimum value over an interval, as potential dates of snowmelt initiation increases accuracy compared to the use of absolute minima alone. Accuracy further increases when snowmelt analysis is constrained to specific timeframes informed by region and topography, with error reduced by greater than 50 % in some study years. After demonstrating the potential accuracy of SAR with manually selected estimates (RMSE = 5.3 d), we develop an automated method that can produce SAR estimates of melt onset that are independent of surface observations. While accuracy was reduced from automated approaches, the mean date of absolute backscatter minima in track-separated SAR time series (both cross and co-polarized images) provided the most accurate automated estimates of snowmelt (RMSE = 11 d). We observed no spatially coherent bias in SAR error which suggests that SAR observations can be used to detect snowmelt onset across large regions."

 This paper contributes to developing novel ensemble models for delineating flood-prone areas in a West African context. One critical West African city with a history of flooding in Ghana, the Cape Coast Metropolis (CCM), was chosen with flood inventories, comprising 70% training and 30% validation, prepared as the basis for accurate prediction modeling. Furthermore, 13 conditioning parameters were chosen via multicollinearity evaluation. Three bivariate statistical algorithms, namely evidential belief function (EBF), relative frequency ratio (RFR), and Shannon entropy (SE) were combined through basic arithmetic operations to produce nine ensemble scenarios. Model performances were adjudged using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC) ratings and the overall best-performing model with a predictive accuracy of 99.6% was selected. Based on the findings, CCM’s total area was categorized into very low (20.0%), low (22.1%), moderate (20.2%), high (18.8%), and very high (18.9%) susceptibility zones. Moreover, the resultant map revealed middle portions down to the coast are most sensitive to floods compared to the northern part due to flat slope surfaces, decreasing vegetative cover, and low elevated lands. These delineated flood zones have substantial implications for national and local flood management to proactively plan and manage floods within the region and contribute to the global agenda of sustainable cities and communities."

 Accurate and timely information on the spatiotemporal distribution of crops is essential for sustainable agricultural practices and ensuring food security. The significant challenges persist in accurately classifying crop types in highly fragmented cropland regions characterized by small field sizes, complex landscapes, and highly frequent cloud cover. This study presents a novel classification workflow designed to generate archaic/historic and reliable land cover (LC) maps from integrating time series data from multiple EO sources—Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and the Highly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM)—with the Random Forest (RF) classifier and cloud computing technology. To the evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, Northeast (NE) Thailand was selected as a case study region, focusing on the classification of 14 crop types between 2021 and 2023. Different combinations of EO datasets and a RF classifier were evaluated using a substantial dataset of 13,453 reference points. The crop type/LC transitions from 2021 to 2023 were then analysed and a temporal transfer model was employed to map historical crop fields. The combined all EO datasets in this work achieved high overall accuracy and F1 scores (>85 %) with the high spatial consistency of crop fields when compared to the use of combined both datasets. Results demonstrated the high potential and excellent efficiency of the RF, utilising an extensive reference dataset and the continuous temporal monthly information of gap-filled data. The most dominant crops were rice, followed by cassava, sugarcane and rubber trees throughout the three study years. The transfer learning RF model proved effective in mapping historical crop types and LC even when ground data was limited. Transitions of 7,287 km2 (∼5%) appeared from 2021 to 2022, with major crop decreases in rice and sugarcane. From 2022 to 2023, cropland changes totaled 8,466 km2 (∼6%), primarily as reductions in sugarcane and rubber trees. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiple EO datasets in this study for mapping crop types across large areas and confirm the benefit of using monthly temporal data to obtain historic LC maps, providing valuable insights for a large range of stakeholders."

 Understanding the chemical complexity of atmospheric aerosols and their associated health risks remains a significant challenge, particularly in rapidly urban regions. Although PM2.5-associated organic compounds have received growing attention, nitrogen-containing hazardous species such as nitrosamines remain under-explored. Here, comprehensive chemical characterization of urban PM2.5 was conducted using two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC × GC-MS) for non-targeted profiling, together with a nitrogen chemiluminescence detector (NCD) for the quantification of nitrosamines at a trace level of 1.1 ppb. Aerosol samples were collected in Tianjin (a mega city in China) in 2022, including the Beijing Winter Olympics period. The study revealed seasonal variations in hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with elevated levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines observed in winter, particularly during the Olympics. And interestingly, the estimated carcinogenic risk of nitrosamines is quite consistent with the local incidence rate in Tianjin.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the highly toxic pollutants that require strict control. High-resolution distribution of PAHs is crucial for accurately quantifying their population exposure levels. However, due to the high computational cost, few models applying the dynamical approach could simulate global PAHs to evaluate health effects with resolution down to 1–10 km. This study simulated the global distribution of PAHs by combining the IAP-AACM model with a nonlinear downscaling method based on relative anthropogenic emissions and observations. A global high-resolution (0.1° × 0.1°, ∼10 km in middle latitudes) dataset of Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, the most representative PAHs) in 2013 and 2018 is generated to support exposure studies. The 0.1° × 0.1° results are comparable to the nested simulation and have better consistency with observations than that of the 1° × 1° simulation. The 0.1° × 0.1° estimation shows significantly higher population-weighted total incremental lifetime cancer risks (PTILCR), with an increase larger than 50 %, compared to the 1° × 1° simulation. The PTILCR is greatly higher in winter than in other seasons and it is larger for children and young adults than for adolescents and seniors.

 East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), a system comprised of several atmospheric members, profoundly impacts local and global climate. However, whether the EAWM is always a firmly unified system is unclear. This study examines the connection between two key EAWM system members: the East Asian trough (EAT) and Siberian High (SH). Our findings reveal that the connection between the two circulations is most unstable in January out of the three winter months over the past six decades. Notably, the January EAT-SH connection has experienced a significant decadal weakening since the early 1990s. By diagnosing the related baroclinic and barotropic processes, we demonstrate that although baroclinic process is important in establishing the EAT-SH connection, its contribution is weaker than that of barotropic process. When the EAT and SH are associated with different barotropic processes, their connection is undermined. Over the whole period, the barotropic processes related to the EAT and SH are featured by a triple atmospheric pattern over the North Atlantic-Eastern Europe. This pattern maintains a stable and significant relationship with the SH, but its association with the EAT is substantially weakened since the early 1990s. Further analysis suggests that this decadal weakened relationship possibly attributed to the decadal weakened westerly jet stream over the Eurasian continent. Alongside this weakened jet stream, the Rossby wave train triggered by the triple atmospheric pattern more readily propagates upward into the stratosphere, but exhibits weak horizontal propagation over Siberia. Consequently, the impact of the triple atmospheric pattern on the EAT diminishes after the early 1990s, contributing to the weakened EAT-SH connection."

For these two specific cases under consideration, LES confirms that early‐morning relative humidity dominates afternoon rain patterns. The attributed impacts are distinct: moisture determines the rain onset timing while temperature affects the peak rain intensity. Single‐pulse day observes one round of strong precipitation and cold pools, which further suppresses convection. On double‐pulse day, the first precipitation peak results from an intermediate development of congestus clouds, whose detrainment leads to a gradual moistening of the lower‐to‐middle troposphere. This behavior of convection favors a second pulse of stronger precipitation with more convective organization, whose development decouples from surface fluxes and sustains until evening."

These interactions result in complex characteristics of rift‐related volcanic features, which may be difficult to interpret considering the different controlling processes. The Turkana Depression (East Africa) exemplifies these complexities, showing an anomalous location of volcanic fields (outside the area of ongoing extension), with variable vent orientation. We analyze vent distribution in the Turkana Depression and calculate the stresses resulting from Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE). Our results show that West to East variations in topography and (subordinately) crustal thickness give rise to extensional GPE‐related stresses East of Lake Turkana, where recent off‐rift volcanism is localized. Within each different volcanic field, local GPE‐related stresses control the arrangement of volcanic vents, which therefore do not respond to the regional (plate motion‐driven) stress field."

Bank erosion causes sinuosity changes and lateral migration that influence terrace formation, hillslope base level and drainage divide evolution. We conducted laboratory experiments and developed equations to predict lateral bedrock abrasion rates, which are poorly understood compared to vertical incision rates. We systematically varied channel curvature, lateral (cross‐stream) bed slope, and the supply rate of bedload. Surprisingly, bank abrasion decreases with increasing channel curvature due to secondary circulation. Bank erosion increases with lateral bed slope because it increases sidewall sediment concentration. However, at higher sediment supply rates lateral erosion is ≈constant due to particle interactions and dynamic cover effects. We propose equations which capture the sensitivity of bank erosion rate to the experimental variables. Our model will be useful for predicting future lateral erosion and for constraining bedload transport rates from bedrock channel morphology."

This is because stronger UHIs tend to be associated with lower background wind speeds, while the downwind enhancement of precipitation is stronger with higher background wind speeds. These results suggest a competition between thermodynamic and dynamic factors in regulating the downwind enhancement of precipitation, with the background wind speed playing a more important role than the UHI effect.

We find that the sensible heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere is substantially higher in CARRA while the latent heat flux is higher in ERA5. For sensible heat flux, the differences scale with the magnitude, leading to maximum disagreement over the ice‐free ocean where the heat flux is high. Accounting for the varying heat flux magnitude over different surface types, we find the largest relative disagreement over sea ice. During MCAOs, negative anomalies in temperature and specific humidity are present throughout most of the troposphere in both reanalyses. Over the studied period, sea ice decline has caused positive trends in the surface‐atmosphere potential temperature difference forming the basis of the MCAO index, leading to higher heat fluxes around much of Svalbard. In ice‐free Fram Strait however, both reanalyses show negative trends in the MCAO index and the heat fluxes in January, when the increase in potential temperature is larger at 850 hPa than at the surface.

About 100 events were extracted and analyzed, focusing on the seasonal and interannual variation of the IHC response in the Northern Hemisphere. The seasonal variation can be explained by differences in the background atmosphere. The upward shift and weakening of the gravity wave forcing during the IHC in September are opposite to the characteristics of July and August. However, the mean zonal wind and the momentum deposition of gravity waves in the northern middle atmosphere in September are also opposite to those in July and August. Together, these result in the same sign of the anomaly. Additionally, an interannual variation in the altitude of the warming in the northern polar region is also observed, with warmings split at 100 km. A warming that appears above 100 km is explained by an additional mechanism of gravity wave modulation, which drives the winter‐to‐summer circulation in the lower thermosphere, while a warming below 100 km corresponds to the weakening of the summer‐to‐winter circulation in the upper mesosphere. Correspondingly, no warming is observed near 100 km, where the circulation and its modulation are absent. This interannual variation of the IHC is influenced by the intraseasonal oscillation, which represents a similar meridional temperature structure in the global middle atmosphere."

 Gross primary production (GPP) is a key indicator of plant growth and ecosystem health, and accurately capturing its diurnal variation is crucial for understanding vegetation responses to extreme heat and drought. However, the applicability of satellite-based semi-empirical models to diurnal GPP estimation remains limited. This study refined diurnal GPP estimation in humid temperate climates by leveraging Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite data to incorporate direct/diffuse radiation and the nonlinear GPP response to diurnal variations in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The eddy covariance-light use efficiency (EC-LUE) model was employed by adopting three approaches: the direct/diffuse (DD) setting to consider the direct/diffuse components of APAR, DD with nonlinear relationship (DD-NL) setting to additionally consider the nonlinear GPP-APAR relationship, and the baseline setting. The model was calibrated and validated using the eddy-covariance tower observations from 18 sites across Japan and South Korea. The DD-NL setting improved accuracy by correcting the baseline's overestimation of GPP under high APAR and underestimation under low APAR. Particularly for forest sites, the DD-NL setting reduced midday overestimations by 12–30 % on clear-sky days and morning/afternoon underestimations by 25–40 % on cloudy days. In the baseline setting, low-APAR biases progressively accumulated across daily to annual timescales, whereas the DD-NL setting reduced them to −0.10 g C m−2 day−1 and -51 g C m−2 year−1 (−2.7 % of the site's average GPP). The DD setting had minimal impact in densely vegetated sites. Our findings show that the DD-NL setting in LUE models enhances geostationary satellite-based GPP estimates across diurnal to annual timescales, supporting ecosystem monitoring during extreme events and long-term carbon assessments."

 Daytime land surface temperature (D-LST) plays a pivotal role in regulating net ecosystem exchanges and is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Thermal infrared satellite remote sensing (TIRS) is widely used to acquire D-LST data owing to its global coverage and high-frequency observations. However, the presence of cloud cover impedes the TIRS technique by obstructing ground thermal emissions. A prevalent solution to this challenge involves correcting clear-sky surface temperatures using the cloud effect which is derived from surface energy balance (SEB) models representing distinct weather conditions. Yet, conventional methods might encounter substantial uncertainties primarily due to the oversimplified SEB modeling, which exacerbates the temperature estimation errors caused by the biases in their employed data products. This study introduces a novel SEB model termed ‘C-SWARM’, designed to reconstruct D-LST under cloudy conditions. The C-SWARM model characterizes D-LST as the result of a cloud-moderated surface warming process, with coefficients indicating the complementary mechanism for solar heating and atmospheric insulation driving surface warming throughout the day. The new model was implemented to fill missing data caused by cloud cover in the LST product of NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R), demonstrating a mean absolute error of 2.57 K and accuracy improvements of 0.38 to 1.89 K over benchmark methods at 49 flux tower sites across the contiguous United States.

 Hedgerows provide habitat and food for a wide range of species and play a crucial role for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. In addition, hedgerows render an important carbon stock, above and below ground, and protect agricultural soils from erosion. However, comprehensive, standardized and area wide information regarding the distribution of hedgerows is often lacking, which makes it hard to incorporate them in nature conservation plans and national carbon balance models. We evaluate the potential of high-resolution PlanetScope multitemporal satellite data and semantic segmentation approaches to map the distribution of hedgerows across the entire agricultural landscape in Germany. Based on a comprehensive set of independent reference data from the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, we evaluate the performance of different loss functions and different combinations of spectral and temporal input feature sets. We assess the transferability of the final model using independent test data from three additional German Federal states. Additionally, we compare our results against the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service High Resolution Layer Small Woody Features, and a recently published biomass map of trees outside forests. All loss functions tested offered similar performance, but the binary-cross entropy function allowed for overcoming sensor artifacts to some extent. Visible and near-infrared imagery from all four monthly mosaics (April, June, August and October) of PlanetScope data was found to yield better results (F1-score 0.65) than different combinations of months and only red-green-blue inputs. We estimate a total surface of 4081 (± 1425) km2 of hedgerows across Germany, which represent 2.3 % of the agricultural land in Germany. By combining our results with a digital landscape model, we reveal heterogenous estimates of hedgerow height across municipalities. Our findings highlight that semantic segmentation approaches are well-suited for area-wide hedgerow mapping, especially in combination with multitemporal high-resolution satellite data. Furthermore, we underscore the relevance of using application-specific models over post-processing existing products, and provide for the first time a spatially explicit and comprehensive overview of the distribution of hedgerows and their structure across agricultural landscapes in Germany. Our methodology and product can be incorporated into landscape biodiversity models, carbon balance estimations and soil protection policies at national, regional and local scale."

In addition, this study evaluates responsiveness of crop WUE to Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) and other meteorological and biophysical factors—including solar radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, gross primary productivity, and evapotranspiration. Our findings confirm VPD as dominant factor affecting WUE, with a 3.5 kPa threshold beyond which WUE no longer responds, signaling a physiological limit for water management. The projected VPD trend, based on ensemble analysis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, indicates an increase in number of months with high VPD in future, reinforcing the need for adaptive irrigation strategies in the region."

 Building height significantly influences urban development and evolution. Previous studies on building height estimation using digital surface models (DSMs) have predominantly addressed simple, single-environmental scenarios, often yielding unsatisfactory results across diverse environments. This study introduces a novel method for estimating building height by integrating scene classification with spatial geometric relationships. Initially, raw data are processed to derive the various data types required for this approach. Environmental scene classification, based on vegetation and shadows analysis, is then performed. Subsequently, the building height is estimated either directly from the DSM or through road height prediction. The proposed method is validated using a scene image from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The results demonstrate that the estimated building height maintains high accuracy in complex environments with significant vegetation and shadow coverage, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.84 m. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms existing DSM-based techniques. This approach is adaptable for high-precision building height estimation across various environments and holds substantial application potential, facilitating further research in urban-related scenarios."

Farooq Azam,Thermodynamics of extreme precipitation related to Atmospheric Rivers in two major Himalayan basins,"•Weak ARs (IVT ≤250kg.m−1.s−1, duration ≥18 h) are frequent in Western Himalaya. •Extreme AR-events can cause extreme precipitation with intensities corresponding to 20- and 100-year return periods. •Dynamic changes (convergence) dominate AR-precipitation and intensity. •Frontal lift and orography drives intense AR-precipitation, with localized convection, even under weak instability. •Moisture primarily comes from Arabian Sea, partly from land evaporation and Bay of Bengal. 
 In the extra-tropics, moisture is efficiently transported polewards in the lower troposphere through narrow bands of moisture transport, known as Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This study identifies ARs that penetrate the southern Himalaya using 6-hourly Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT), and investigates the moisture dynamics, thermodynamics, and moisture sources of the top 8 AR events with substantial precipitation impacts in the Indus Basin (IB) and Ganga Basin (GB), to understand the mechanisms driving extreme AR-related precipitation. Most of these ARs produce over 150 mm/day precipitation (exceeding the 99th percentile of non-zero daily-precipitation) along their central axis and mountain landfall locations, and up to 50 mm/day in the plains. Even the glacierized regions that feed the main basins’ streams receive over 65 mm/day. High-intensity precipitation typically found near southern Himalaya, strongly corresponds to positive moisture convergence and positive advection, with minimal changes in atmospheric moisture content indicating effective translation of AR-moisture to precipitation. Different regions within the ARs experience distinct precipitation mechanisms, with mountains/foothills dominated by orographic uplift even under weak convective conditions, while areas near/on AR-axis are influenced by convective or frontal lifting. The presence of high moisture (IVT), saturated layers, and favourable thermodynamics highlights the ARs' capacity to generate intense precipitation when vertical lift is present. Excess moisture within ARs primarily originates from the Arabian Sea (north, east, and west), followed by Bay of Bengal (north and east), land-based evaporation, and smaller contribution from the Middle Eastern Seas. These case-specific findings demonstrate that ARs are key moisture transport mechanisms to mainland India and the Himalaya, delivering extreme localized precipitation strongly influenced by topography and position of ARs axis. This study offers the first comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic sources of AR moisture, associated precipitation, and the role of the Himalaya in extracting large amounts of moisture from ARs. These findings have important implications for understanding ARs contribution to extreme precipitation in IB and GB, driving mechanisms behind AR-precipitation, and the sources of high moisture content during ARs. These results can help explore potential risks of extreme precipitation, improve AR modeling, and forecasting ARs over these regions."

Deposition of minerals in shallow waters results in enhanced dissolution rates via the ‘benthic weathering engine’, thus inducing an additional alkalinity release from the seabed on top of the natural alkalinity efflux. However, the application potential of mERW as a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology remains uncertain. Here, we quantified the CDR potential via mERW through a spatially explicit model, using the coastal zone of France as a case study. We simulated the one-time addition of dunite (olivine-rich source rock) distinguishing between three sediment types: bedload, permeable, and cohesive seafloor environments. The average CO2 sequestration rate was estimated at 0.32 kg CO2 m–2 seafloor kg–1 dunite over 100 yr. The sediment type was identified as the most important factor governing the CO2 sequestration rate, as it critically constrains the olivine dissolution kinetics. Coarse sediments exposed to bedload transport provide the highest CO2 sequestration rates. The application area was restricted to the territorial seas of mainland France (12 nautical miles offshore), and we estimated that 45% of this zone is suited for mERW. This area is further reduced to 23% when nature conservation areas are excluded from application. Assuming a dunite (olivine-rich mineral) loading of 20 kg m–2 seafloor, the CO2 sequestration capacity over 100 yr for the entire mERW area in France is estimated to be 210 Mt. As such, mERW will not be able to cover the entire CDR need for a country like France but could be one technology in a larger portfolio of CDR techniques. Our model analysis identifies a number of uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the assessment of the mERW potential."

AU is thus considered a marine carbon dioxide removal option among other potential uses.

This concept was introduced by Stommel et al (1956 Deep Sea Res.3 152–3) as the perpetual salt fountain.

In this region, tropical-extratropical (TE) cloud bands in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) produce most of the rainy season precipitation. In this study, we diagnose the impacts of warming on the frequency and intensification of SACZ TE cloud bands. The cloud bands are identified using a feature-detection algorithm applied to a suite of convection-permitting simulations produced by the UK Met Office. Intensely raining clusters embedded within these large-scale cloud bands are diagnosed in order to identify the most intense events. Although the total number of cloud-band days will see a 20%–30% decrease in their frequency under high-emission global warming, the present day 1-in-5 most intense cloud-band days will happen every 3-in-5 cloud-band days in the future. Therefore, despite fewer cloud-band days occurring in a given year, when they form they will frequently be more intense than is typical in the current climate. This increase is primarily due to warming-driven intensification of rain rates within the heavily raining clusters embedded in these weather systems. These results highlight the growing risk of intense SACZ rainfall over South America under warming, increasing the likelihood of flash floods, landslides, and unprecedented catchment-scale fluvial flooding."

 The turnover time (τ) of global soil organic carbon is central to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Yet our spatially explicit understanding of the depth-dependent variations and environmental controls of τ at a global scale remains incomplete. In this study, we combine multiple state-of-the-art observation-based datasets, including over 90 000 geo-referenced soil profiles, the latest root observations distributed globally, and large numbers of satellite-derived environmental variables, to generate global maps of apparent τ in topsoil (0–0.3 m) and subsoil (0.3–1 m) layers, with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec (∼1 km at the Equator). We show that subsoil τ (385203485 years (mean, with a variation range from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile)) is over 8 times longer than topsoil τ (1511137 years). The cross-validation shows that the fitted machine learning models effectively captured the variabilities in τ, with R2 values of 0.87 and 0.70 for topsoil and subsoil τ mapping, respectively. The prediction uncertainties of the τ maps were quantified for better user applications. The environmental controls on topsoil and subsoil τ were investigated at global, biome, and local scales. Our analyses illustrate the ways in which temperature, water availability, physio-chemical properties, and depth jointly exert impacts on τ. The data-driven approaches allow us to identify their interactions, thereby enriching our comprehension of mechanisms driving nonlinear τ–environment relationships at global to local scales. The distributions of dominating factors of τ at local scales were mapped for purposes of identifying context-dependent controls on τ across different regions. We further reveal that the current Earth system models may underestimate τ by comparing model-derived maps with our observation-derived τ maps.

An integrated observation of an asymmetric eddy dipole was conducted in the South China Sea in April 2023, which evidences the “gear-like” process. 
 Mesoscale dipoles consist of mesoscale eddies with opposite signs. They are globally discovered and play a significant role in eddy-eddy interactions. Due to the complexities of the marine environment, many dipoles are asymmetric, characterized by unequal strengths between the dipole eddies. The strong interaction has been observed between asymmetric dipole eddies, a phenomenon referred to as the “gear-like” process. Specifically, stronger dipole eddies generally drive weaker ones to move around, resulting in a reduction of discrepancies in their kinematic properties, such as rotational speed, amplitude, and eddy kinetic energy. An integrated observation of an asymmetric eddy dipole was conducted in the South China Sea in April 2023. The general characteristics of the dipole eddies were derived from satellite altimeter data, and the evolution of their vertical structures was studied based on the joint data from Argo floats, gliders, drifters, and a survey vessel. Employing rigorous criteria, a 10−day successive coupling process of an asymmetric dipole was identified between a weaker anticyclonic eddy (AE) and a stronger cyclonic eddy (CE) from 13 to 22 April 2023. AE was initially weaker than CE in early April and strengthened when it coupled with CE, which is similar to the “gear-like” process. In addition, the drifting speed of the drifters further confirmed the “gear-like” process between the target asymmetric dipole. The vertical temperature anomalies were surprisingly positive (~0.5 °C at 50−300 m) on the CE periphery and reveal a distinct conical AE structure at 60−350 m. AE induced a significant sinking of dissolved oxygen saturation during the coupling process. Furthermore, the coupling interaction increased CE’s positive temperature anomaly near the contact zone and deepened AE’s temperature and dissolved oxygen saturation structures. Both thermohaline and biological responses provide evidence that the interaction between the asymmetric dipole eddies impacted the vertical transport of water. These findings, on the one hand, support the observations that weaker dipole eddies strengthen after coupling with stronger ones. On the other hand, the results offer valuable vertical structure information of the asymmetric eddy dipole."

In this work, we used machine learning to improve estimates of oxygen levels across the global ocean. Our approach produces a new gridded product that captures detailed changes in oxygen over time and space. 
 Ocean deoxygenation, driven by climate change, poses significant challenges to marine ecosystems and can profoundly alter nutrient and carbon cycling. Quantifying the rate and regional patterns of deoxygenation relies on spatio-temporal interpolation tools to fill gaps in observational coverage of dissolved oxygen. However, this task is challenging due to the sparsity of observations, and classical interpolation methods often lead to high uncertainty and biases, typically underestimating long-term deoxygenation trends. In this work, we develop a novel gridded dissolved oxygen product by integrating direct oxygen observations with machine-learning-based emulated oxygen estimates derived from temperature and salinity profiles. The gridded product is then generated through optimal interpolation of both the observed and emulated data. The resulting product shows strong agreement with baseline climatology and captures well-known patterns of seasonal variability and long-term deoxygenation trends. It also outperforms current state-of-the-art products by more accurately capturing dissolved oxygen variability at synoptic and decadal scales, and by reducing uncertainty around long-term changes. This study highlights the potential of combining machine learning with classical interpolation methods to generate improved gridded biogeochemical products, enhancing our ability to study and understand ocean biogeochemical processes and their variability under a changing climate."

Here, we conducted a 30-day stepwise exposure experiment to investigate the impacts of the commonly used disinfectants polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and their combination on AMR and pathogenicity of Wild-Type Escherichia coli. Results reveal that the coexistence of dual disinfectants dramatically led to higher levels of AMR (2.0- to 14.8-fold) and pathogenicity (8.7-fold) in the evolved strains. Dual disinfectant-induced bacterial evolution is primarily driven by the alteration in the expression of key functional genes, such as those involved in biofilm formation and cell motility. In contrast, genetic mutations may not account for the increased AMR and pathogenicity in combination of dual disinfectant treatment, as similar gene mutations are responsible for both dual and single disinfectant stress. The evolved strains induced by disinfectant combination, characterized with transcriptional regulation, exhibited a synergistic or additive response on AMR and pathogenicity, which was further confirmed by a toxicology prediction model. This study demonstrated that dual disinfectants synergistically enhanced AMR and the associated pathogenicity, advancing our understanding of the risks posed by coexistence of multiple chemical pollutants in the environment."

Here, we quantify the OP of the PM originating from commonly used indoor sources via three different assays, i.e., dithiothreitol consumption (OPDTT), glutathione consumption (OPGSH), and hydroxyl radical generation (OPOH). The intrinsic (mass-normalized) OPm of several sources (candles, incense, cigarettes, humidifiers using tap water, toasters, and air fryers) were comparable (0.75–1.25×) or exceeded (1–6×) that of typical ambient PM2.5. Emissions from candles in the presence of a wind-draft had the highest OPDTTm and OPOHm while OPGSHm was highest for cigarette emissions. Elemental carbon determined the OP of PM emitted from sources undergoing incomplete combustion, whereas, for noncombustion sources (water evaporation and heating-based), metals were the important drivers. An exploratory exposure assessment in a hypothetical apartment (volume = 100 m3, air change rate = 0.45 h–1, and penetration coefficient = 0.6) revealed that certain sources (e.g., incense, cigarettes, toasters, and air-fryers) could result in occupants being exposed to higher OP in less than 1 h of indoor operation than that resulting from inhaling typical U.S. ambient PM2.5 (8 μg/m3) over an entire day.

Reversing these trends will require data-centric approaches that identify salt sources, environmental drivers, and ecosystem responses. In this study, we applied principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to identify ion covariance patterns, or “ion clusters,” in Broad Run, an urban stream in the Mid-Atlantic United States. These clusters correspond to distinct hydrologic regimes and reveal specific salinization risks: (1) phosphorus pollution mobilized during summer storms (Cluster 1); (2) elevated concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate during baseflow (Cluster 2), likely reflecting groundwater discharge; and (3) elevated specific conductance and sodium, chloride, and potassium ion concentrations during snowmelt and rain-on-snow events (Cluster 3), driven by deicer and anti-icer wash-off. These ion fingerprints offer a transferable framework for diagnosing salt sources, assessing ecological risk, and identifying management targets.

Electroactive biofilm (EAB)-enabled, microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based biosensors facilitate self-powered online pollutant detection. However, as EABs are highly dynamic, naturally formed EABs as sensing and transducing elements limit the performance of MFC-based biosensors. Here, we report a fast-response and sensitive MFC-based biosensor enabled by enhancing Shewanella oneidensis biofilms on the electrode using an optogenetic approach. We incorporated a near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive synthetic bis(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) module into S. oneidensis to promote biofilm formation on the anode under NIR light. The biosensors with enhanced EABs exhibited a rapid and sensitive response to Cr(VI), reducing the sensing time from approximately 30 min to just 3 min. This improved sensing performance was maintained over three sensing cycles, even with fluctuating Cr(VI) concentrations. Based on the analyses of the electrode biofilms and extracellular polymeric substance matrices, different Cr(VI) response mechanisms for the normal and enhanced EABs were proposed; enhanced EAB’s massive dispersal by Cr(VI) was the cause of the improved response of the biosensors. Such improved response still held in the natural water matrix.

These high U levels are primarily geogenic. The δ238U and U activity ratios (234U/238U) were determined on the same set of samples to understand the redox processes governing groundwater U cycling. The δ238U isoscape displays a variation of 1.3‰ from −0.95‰ to 0.3‰, providing evidence of a generally oxidizing groundwater environment, with localized U-reducing conditions in the southern part of the study area. The (234U/238U) of groundwater varies from 1.2 to 5.4, indicating a dynamic interplay of α-recoil effects, preferential leaching of 234U, and the dissolution of high U zone(s) in granitic rocks. Statistical analysis of geochemical and field parameters reveals three distinct redox environments: oxidized, intermediate, and U(VI) reducing, across the study area. Integrating U isotope compositions and additional redox indicators with statistical analysis in this manner provides a robust approach to understand the subsurface environment controlling U cycling in large, data-limited regions."

There is increasing evidence that eco-corona plays a critical role in determining the fate, transport, and impact of nanoplastics. In this study, we show that even a low mass of eco-corona formed on nanoplastics significantly affects the cotransport of nanoplastics and organic contaminants in porous media. Specifically, eco-corona formation promotes the transport of 4-nonylphenol with polystyrene nanoplastics, especially when the eco-corona forms after contaminant adsorption to nanoplastics. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that 4-nonylphenol molecules are sequestered between the nanoplastics and the eco-corona due to the simultaneous binding to surface O-functional groups of the nanoplastics and to the polar macromolecules preferentially acquired by the nanoplastics. Transport modeling and supplementary adsorption/desorption experiments confirm that this binding configuration effectively inhibits or retards the release of 4-nonylphenol from the nanoplastics-eco-corona complex. Conversely, for 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether, an eco-corona inhibits its cotransport with nanoplastics by blocking the porous domains of the nanoparticles, which are the preferred binding sites for nonpolar, nonionic, hydrophobic compounds. The dynamic interplays between nanoplastics, macromolecules, and contaminants have important implications for predicting the spread, release, and bioaccumulation of plastic additives in aquatic environments."

However, its potential is hindered by the lack of dual-functional cathode materials for simultaneously achieving efficient in situ H2O2 generation and activation. Particularly, developing cathode-based electron transfer channels for the green activation of H2O2 without Fe(II) regeneration presents significant challenges. Here, we designed a nonheme iron catalyst, which employs polypyrrole as an auxiliary ligand to direct the reduction of oxygen into H2O2 and superoxide radicals (O2•–). A pathway was innovatively constructed in which the O2/O2•– redox couple was employed to transfer electrons from the cathode for activating in situ generated H2O2. Although the reaction between O2•– and H2O2 is typically considered unfeasible traditionally due to the slow rate, the energy barrier was lowered to 48% and kinetically accelerated through biomimetic electrocatalysis, which led to a 370% enhancement in water purification efficiency. We confirmed that only the presence of coordination between the auxiliary ligand and the nonheme iron catalyst can obtain the formation of O2•–. This work initiates a novel and sustainable pathway for highly efficiently activating H2O2 via oxygen reduction intermediates for water purification at near-neutral conditions."

Previous studies have mostly focused on evaluating climate models for temperature and precipitation biases without identifying the origins of these biases, which remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a process‐based evaluation to examine the atmospheric processes and physical mechanisms influencing regional climate simulations. We used downscaled data from the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) driven by European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) over Australia at 10 km spatial resolution. Using ERA5 driven downscaling is useful for model evaluation, as it avoids the inherent biases from initial and boundary conditions present in free running CMIP6 coupled global climate models. We found that CCAM well represented the atmospheric circulation at various vertical levels, performing comparably to or better than previous studies. CCAM also successfully captured key large‐scale circulation features, such as the monsoonal westerly, subtropical jet, and Australian precipitation teleconnections with climate modes of variability (e.g., El Niño‐Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole). CCAM underestimated mean sea level pressure in northern Australia, resulting in stronger wind circulation (monsoonal westerly) over ocean north of Australia. This led to dry biases in humidity over northern Australia and contributed to dry biases over the north and northeast coasts. CCAM simulated stronger north‐south wind and moisture flux in central Australia, which may be associated with wet biases over western Queensland. This study highlights CCAM's ability to simulate atmospheric circulation and sheds light on the source of biases."

This study proposes a new framework for retrieving MIR land surface emissivity (LSE) from nighttime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The framework integrates an extended water vapor scaling (WVS) method to enhance the accuracy of atmospheric parameters for both MIR and thermal‐infrared (TIR) bands, along with an improved temperature and emissivity separation (TES) method for LST retrieval, upon which the MIR LSE is estimated based on the radiative transfer theory. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the retrieved MIR LSE achieves root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.03 and bias within ±0.005. Additionally, the extended WVS method further improves the accuracy of TES‐based LST and TIR LSE retrievals compared to the original WVS method. Using nighttime MODIS data from January and July 2024 over Qinghai Province, China, monthly MIR LSE maps were generated. Compared to the MODIS MIR LSE product, the retrieved MIR LSE showed an overall RMSE of 0.032 and bias of 0.016 but captured surface details at 1 km resolution. Validation against laboratory‐measured emissivity spectra showed average deviations of −0.008 for snow‐covered pixels and −0.002 for water‐body pixels.

We observed significant geographic variations in disease heterogeneity, with higher SHDI values in high‐income Western countries such as the United States of America and Sweden and lower in South Asia and Oceania (p < 0.05). In 2021, SHDI values in elderly populations (age ≥60 years) for Europe and North America countries were an average of 1.12 times higher than in Oceania. While SHDI increases toward higher ages (for instance, in 2021, SHDI for adults above 95 years is 1.06 times higher than for ages between 60 and 64 years), the global SHDI tends to decrease nonlinearly over time. From 1990 to 2021, global age‐standardized SHDI (age ≥60 years) averagely decreased by 1.2% for both men and women.

The octamer is stabilized by numerous tertiary and quaternary interactions, including triple-strand A-minors that we propose to name “A-minor staples”. The structure of an isolated ROOL monomer at ~3.2-Å resolution indicates that nanocage assembly involves a strand-swapping mechanism resulting in quaternary kissing loops.

 Spatial multi-slice multi-omics (SMSMO) integration has transformed our understanding of cellular niches, particularly in tumors. However, challenges like data scale and diversity, disease heterogeneity, and limited sample population size, impede the derivation of clinical insights. Here, we propose stClinic, a dynamic graph model that integrates SMSMO and phenotype data to uncover clinically relevant niches. stClinic aggregates information from evolving neighboring nodes with similar-profiles across slices, aided by a Mixture-of-Gaussians prior on latent features. Furthermore, stClinic directly links niches to clinical manifestations by characterizing each slice with attention-based geometric statistical measures, relative to the population. In cancer studies, stClinic uses survival time to assess niche malignancy, identifying aggressive niches enriched with tumor-associated macrophages, alongside favorable prognostic niches abundant in B and plasma cells. Additionally, stClinic identifies a niche abundant in SPP1+ MTRNR2L12+ myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts driving colorectal cancer cell adaptation and invasion in healthy liver tissue. These findings are supported by independent functional and clinical data. Notably, stClinic excels in label annotation through zero-shot learning and facilitates multi-omics integration by relying on other tools for latent feature initialization.

 A major challenge hampering therapeutic advancements for high-risk sarcoma patients is the broad spectrum of molecularly distinct sarcoma types and the corresponding lack of suitable model systems. Here we describe the development of a genetically-controlled, yet versatile mouse modeling platform allowing delivery of different genetic lesions by muscle electroporation (EPO) in wildtype mice. This EPO-GEMM (EPO-based genetically engineered mouse model) platform allows the generation of ten genetically distinct sarcomas on an isogenic background, including the first model of ETV6::NTRK3-driven sarcoma. Comprehensive histological and molecular profiling reveals that this mouse sarcoma cohort recapitulates a spectrum of molecularly diverse sarcomas with gene fusions acting as major determinants of sarcoma biology. Integrative cross-species analyses show faithful recapitulation of human sarcoma subtypes, including expression of relevant immunotherapy targets. Comparison of syngeneic allografting methods enables reliable preservation and scalability of sarcoma-EPO-GEMMs for preclinical treatment trials, such as NTRK inhibitor therapy in an immunocompetent background.

 Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is a critical developmental milestone characterized by the rapid and simultaneous activation of genome-widely silenced chromatin. Various active histone modifications accumulate upon ZGA and have long been implicated in ZGA. However, their biological relevance still remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively examined the functional significance of active histone modifications and their writers during ZGA in teleost embryos. Our data propose that developmental genes and housekeeping genes are distinctively regulated during ZGA; CBP/P300 activity is required for developmental gene activation, whereas housekeeping genes depend on non-CBP/P300 histone acetylations H3K9ac/H4K16ac/H3K14ac. Moreover, accumulation of H3K4me2/3 is not prerequisite for activation of all types of genes during ZGA, in contrast to previous reports with cell lines. Finally, temporal accumulation of H3.3S31ph greatly enhances CBP/P300 activity specifically at ZGA, ensuring the activation of developmental genes. Our data demonstrate that multiple histone modifications cooperatively shape ZGA-specific gene activation programs in non-mammalian vertebrates.

 Current national emissions targets fall short of the Paris Agreement goals, prompting the need for equitable ways to close this gap. Fair emissions allowances rely on effort-sharing formulas based on fairness principles, yielding diverse outcomes. These variations, shaped by normative decisions, complicate policymaking and legal assessments of climate targets. Here we provide up-to-date numbers, comprehensively accounting for three dimensions—physical and social uncertainties, global strategies and equity—and the relative impact of them on each country’s emissions allowance. In the short run, normative considerations substantially impact fair emissions allowances—directing current discussions to this debate—while global discussions on temperature targets and non-CO2 emissions take over in the long run. We identify many countries with insufficient nationally determined contributions in light of fairness and discuss implications for increased domestic mitigation and financing emissions reductions abroad—yielding a total international finance flux of $US0.5–7.4 trillion in 2030.

 In numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, horizontal and vertical turbulent mixing is parameterized separately within the dynamic solver of a model and by a one-dimensional standalone module outside the dynamic core. This method becomes problematic as model resolution increases to the gray zone of turbulence parameterization where three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic turbulence tends to generate inter-connected horizontal and vertical mixing that cannot be artificially separated. To remediate the problem, a 3D scale-aware (SA) turbulence scheme based on a generalized turbulence closure applicable across scales has been developed and implemented in the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS). Simulations of 11 Atlantic basin storms of 2024 show that the new scheme substantially improves HAFS’s forecasting skill for storms with hurricane strength, suggesting that an appropriate account for 3D anisotropic turbulent transport is important for track and intensity forecast of tropical cyclones and provides a venue for realistically representing sub-grid-scale turbulence in NWP."

 We investigate the drivers of projected summer precipitation changes and their uncertainties across Africa in the second half of the 21st century under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios using CMIP6 models. Our results reveal distinct regional precipitation changes, particularly under SSP5-8.5, with robust increases of 75%, 24%, and 17% over the Sahara, South Eastern Africa, and South Central Africa, respectively, and a decline of up to 5% over West Southern Africa (WSAF). In most regions, precipitation increases are driven by enhanced vertical thermodynamic processes associated with temperature-induced moisture increases and enhanced moisture convergence. In contrast, the WSAF decrease is associated with vertical dynamic processes driven by a weakening of the Hadley circulation’s ascending branch. Model uncertainty accounts for over 85% of total projection uncertainty across all regions and is largely due to subgrid-scale parameterizations.

Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to downscaling challenges and supports practical applicability for generating high-resolution precipitation data for arbitrary ERA5 time periods and regions on demand.

 The impact of climate change on tropical cyclones (TCs) remains a critical concern, but understanding is limited by short instrumental records and low-resolution prehistoric data. Here, we present the first daily-resolution proxy data for investigating prehistoric TC activity, using a 12-year growth rate record of a fossil Tridacna shell (circa 3 ka BP) from the northern South China Sea (NSCS). By analyzing temporal patterns in the proxy data, we derived monthly TC frequency estimates. While modern TC frequency in the NSCS peaks in autumn (September–October), our results showed that TCs at 3 ka BP occurred more frequently in summer (June–July–August), with approximately 15% higher frequency than present. Combined with paleoclimate records, we suggested that this seasonal shift and increased frequency were likely linked to the relatively northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which provided favourable conditions for TC formation and development. Our findings imply that future warming would contribute to earlier TC seasons and increased TC frequency in the NSCS."

 Water availability limits evapotranspiration on land, shaping the energy balance, land carbon uptake, and climate extremes. Despite its importance, Earth system models struggle to capture where and how often water-limited conditions occur. Here we investigate the representation of water limitation and its link to land water storage capacity in simulations from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) driven by consistent observational atmospheric forcing. Using observations of remotely sensed solar-induced vegetation fluorescence and terrestrial water storage, together with ecosystem flux data, we find that CMIP6 models overestimate the frequency of water limitation by 14% over land and 26% in the tropics. Model overestimation occurs over 57% of the land area, and 78% in the tropics. These too frequent water-limited conditions are not conclusively linked to a potential underestimation of land water storage capacity in the models, hinting at gaps in how ESMs represent rooting depths, plant water uptake, and plant water-use strategies. Our study highlights the need for model development in these areas, with implications for projections of future climate on land.

 Glacial lakes in high-altitude regions influence both water systems and greenhouse gas emissions, yet the effects of different hydrological recharge mechanisms on methane release and microbial ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated methane fluxes and microbial community patterns in glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during peak ablation stage. Our findings revealed that total methane flux from non-glacier-fed lakes were approximately three times higher than from glacier-fed lakes, with ebullition being the predominant emission pathway. Network analysis showed that the microbial community structure in glacier-fed lakes was more stable. The neutral community model confirmed deterministic processes mainly shape microbial assembly in glacial lakes with different recharge types. Microbial communities in glacier-fed lakes were more stable and tightly connected, while those in non-glacier-fed lakes were more fragmented. As glacier melting accelerates with climate change, more lakes may lose glacier input, potentially increasing methane emissions and disrupting microbial ecosystems.

 Minerals are pivotal environmental factors influencing the adaptation and evolution of microbial communities. Conventional wisdom has long regarded the impact of minerals as a byproduct of their role in providing nutrients and energy to organisms, largely overlooking the significance of non-nutritive and energy-neutral mineral species. In this study, we explore the influence of minerals on microbial development in nutrient- and energy-rich media through a serial passage evolution experiment. Our results show both the inert mineral kaolinite and the energy/nutrient-rich olivine exert evident effects on the microorganisms. Both minerals induced substantial shifts in community structure. Notably, kaolinite and olivine selectively enriched specific taxa, including Acinetobacter and Clostridium. Metatranscriptomic analyses revealed substantial changes in gene expression, with both minerals enriching unique metabolic pathways. Interestingly, kaolinite specifically enriched pathways related to streptomycin biosynthesis. Both minerals stimulated the expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), particularly those associated with multidrug and macrolide resistance. Furthermore, both minerals induced the upregulation of genes involved in the degradation of complex organic matter, highlighting their potential role in soil carbon cycling. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between minerals and microbes, challenging the conventional notion that minerals function solely as material sources for organism growth.

 Deep-sea mud is rich in rare-earth elements, primarily found in fluorapatite, a mineral deposit that forms over hundreds of thousands to millions of years through the accumulation of fish remains. After fish die, biogenic apatite captures rare earth elements from seawater on the seafloor and from pore waters during the diagenesis process. The conventional model for rare earth element enrichment suggests that they are incorporated into the bioapatite crystal structure through solid-state diffusion. However, our data reveal that cerium atoms are instead precipitated within an amorphous layer surrounding bioapatite nanocrystals, as shown by high-energy-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Computational simulations further support this finding, predicting that cerium atoms cluster on the surface of fluorapatite. These results suggest that the fluorapatite-water interface plays a crucial role in the enrichment of cerium, as well as other rare earth elements, in marine sediments.

A significant interdecadal shift in the relationship between the NIO-SCS SSTAs and eastern China's precipitation around 1995/96. Before 1995, warm NIO-SCS SSTAs consistently enhanced precipitation in the Huaihe-Yangtze River Basin (HYRB) throughout July and August, primarily altered by the Pacific-Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern. However, after 1996, a distinct pattern emerged: warm NIO-SCS SSTAs increased precipitation over the HYRB and simultaneously reduced precipitation in North/Northeast China in July. In contrast, this pattern is reversed in August. Based on observations and numerical experiments, the interdecadal shift is linked to a weakening of Indian Ocean SSTAs after 1996 compared to before. During the post-1996, cooler Indian Ocean SSTAs in July weaken the Kelvin wave, shifting the PJ pattern westward and broadly influencing precipitation across eastern China. In August, the cooler Indian Ocean SSTAs induce westward-shifted Walker circulation anomalies, with a descending branch near the Philippine Sea extending to 30°N, leading to decreased precipitation in the HYRB and increased precipitation over North/Northeast China. Furthermore, the reduction in NIO-SCS SSTAs' amplitude after 1996 may be attributed to a weakened spring ENSO amplitude, potentially linked to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."

Solar-powered mini-grids are being used to increase rural electrification. However, their deployment is hindered by high costs, low electricity demand, and limited incomes in rural households. Agriculture constitutes 70% of rural incomes in SSA and faces threats due to a reliance on rainfall coupled with low irrigation levels in the context of climate change. Irrigation loads have been suggested as a strategy to enhance the economic viability of solar mini-grids by boosting electricity demand: reducing the levelised cost of used electricity (LCUE) whilst improving farmer yields and incomes. This study investigates a case study in Tanzania, selected based on the amount of population without access to electricity, the potential for irrigation, and the prevalence of photovoltaic solutions in the least-cost pathways for rural electrification. The seasonality and timing of irrigation demand, as well as crop mixes, are varied to optimise for the lowest LCUE using the open-source modelling framework continuous lifetime optimisation of variable electricity resources. Evapo-transpiration and energy-system modelling are used to estimate energy demand. We find that adding irrigation loads has the potential to increase the LCUE and lower asset utilisation (load factor) when compared to residential loads but that, by selecting crops with longer growth periods, optimising irrigation timing, and implementing multiple planting seasons, the LCUE can be up to 7% less than residential-only systems with an increase seen in asset utilisation. LCUE values of 0.54–1.30 $/kWh were found: higher costs were associated with shorter crop-growth periods, single planting seasons, and poorly timed irrigation loads whilst lower costs were observed with bimodal cropping and solar-coordinated irrigation times. The research highlights that, when incorporating irrigation loads into rural-electrification strategies, specific factors should be considered to enhance their viability within mini-grids in SSA. We recommend to both policymakers and mini-grid developers to promote multiple planting seasons (bimodal cropping) and encourage optimal crop mixes where relevant alongside irrigation schemes and rural electrification projects as well as adopting the use of flexible tariffs for irrigation loads."

In systems with alternative stable states maintained by feedback mechanisms, such shifts are difficult to reverse due to hysteresis. These systems may show early warning signals (EWSs) (e.g. critical slowing down (CSD)), indicating ecological resilience loss prior to an RS. CSD manifests as a reduced rate of recovery from disturbances and can be detected through increasing temporal autocorrelation at-lag-1 (AC1) in vegetation indicator time series. While studies increasingly use remote sensing data (e.g. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to evaluate CSD in natural ecosystems, most lack in-field validation and are conducted at broad spatial scales, limiting real-world applicability. Here, we assess whether EWSs precede RSs in Zambian wet Miombo woodlands by combining field-based vegetation data with remote sensing time series. We investigate (i) whether RSs in the Miombo woodlands can be detected using field data on vegetation structure and remote sensing data, (ii) the relationship between fire frequency and RSs, and (iii) if increasing AC1 precedes an RS. Our findings demonstrate the occurrence of RSs in Miombo woodlands and provide empirical evidence supporting the use of CSD as a predictive tool. Spatial models showed that both a high fire frequency and an increasing AC1 preceding the shift are significantly (p < 0.05) linked to RS occurrence. This study highlights the importance of integrating field and remote sensing data to monitor ecosystem transitions. By identifying resilience loss and RS occurrence, our approach offers valuable insights for conservation and restoration planning, emphasizing the need for adaptive fire management strategies to mitigate degradation and promote ecosystem recovery."

To investigate their properties and changes on a global scale, observational records are often complemented by climate models such as those from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). However, typical CMIP6 models have a grid spacing of about 100 km and, therefore, do not allow the representation of extremes at local scales important for impacts. Here, we provide a global view on the information lost at such resolutions, focusing on temperature and precipitation extremes. We draw on two next-generation, km-scale global climate models, run with a grid spacing of about 10 km, and regrid them to a range of coarser resolutions. From the regridded data, we then investigate the spatial sub-grid variability hidden at the CMIP6-like 100 km grid spacing to quantify the effect resolution has on the representation of extremes globally. We find clear patterns of such a resolution effect on a diverse set of temperature extremes, particularly in mountainous areas, at coastlines, and along large rivers. For the example of annual maximum temperature, the difference between the 10 km and 100 km grid spacings can exceed 10 ∘C. For precipitation, globally aggregated low and high extremes are shown to be underestimated at coarse resolution, with the strongest spatial signals emerging in regions with complex topography and in the tropics. Our results quantify existing knowledge and demonstrate the importance of spatial resolution for the representation of climate extremes, in particular for hotspot regions such as coastlines, which often coincide with densely populated areas. The advent of ever higher resolved global models, hence, allows improved estimates of local climate impacts and related risk assessments with global coverage."

However, current energy system models often address sustainability too narrowly with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions during the operational phase, and neglecting other environmental impacts can lead to suboptimal and unsustainable energy systems. This study integrates environmental impacts and planetary boundaries as constraints into a multi-sectoral energy system model to explore sustainable configurations for the European energy system in 2050. Our results indicate that it will not be possible to stay within all allocated carrying capacities without a combined application of energy demand reduction, large-scale deployment of renewable energies, electrification of heating, and technological improvements. Specifically, with the most permissive allocation principle, European electricity and heat demand must be limited to 3550 and 4655 to remain within the planetary boundaries, which represents a 22% and 24% reduction compared to 2050 projected final energy demand for the sectors of electricity and heat, excluding transport and fuels demands. Results show that scenario normally considered ‘Net Zero’ would transgress the allocated budget for climate change by 70%, despite a high deployment of renewable energies, when life cycle impacts are considered. All generated scenarios highly rely on renewable energies and the electrification of heating. The analysis of the different scenarios highlights substantial burden shifts across carrying capacities when only considering climate change and praises a global environmental approach in decision-making.

It provides valuable insights into how reservoir storage grew by 130 % between 2008 and 2017, driven by dams in key river basins. Our data also reveal how droughts, like the 2019–2020 event, significantly impacted water reservoirs. This resource can aid water management, drought planning, and research globally. 
 The recent surge in reservoir construction has increased global surface water storage, with Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) being a significant hotspot. Such infrastructural evolution demands updates in water management strategies and hydrological models. However, information on actual reservoir storage is hard to acquire, especially for transboundary river basins. To date, no high-resolution spatiotemporal dataset on absolute storage time series is available for reservoirs in MSEA. To address this gap, we present (1) a comprehensive open-access database of absolute storage time series (sub-monthly) for 186 reservoirs (larger than 0.1 km3) in MSEA spanning the period 1985–2023 and (2) an analysis of the reservoir storage dynamics. This dataset is derived from remote sensing observations, integrating satellite-based water surface area extraction from high-resolution (30 m) images and area–elevation–storage (A–E–S) relationships to estimate reservoir level and storage dynamics. The MSEA database includes static (area–elevation–storage curves, water frequency, and reservoir extent) and dynamic (area, water level, and absolute storage time series) components for each reservoir. The 186 reservoirs collectively store around 175 km3 of water, with a minimum of 140 km3 and a maximum of 210 km3. They cover an average area of 8700 km2, ranging from a minimum of 6500 km2 to a maximum of 10 000 km2. We show that the combined average reservoir storage increased from 70 to 160 km3 (+130 %) from 2008 to 2017, primarily contributed by reservoirs in the Irrawaddy, Red, Upper Mekong, and Lower Mekong basins. Our in situ validation provides a good match between estimated storage and in situ observations, with 50 % of the validation sites (10 out of 20) showing an R2>0.7 and an average nRMSE < 14 %. The indirect validation (based on altimetry-converted storage) shows even better results, with an R2>0.7 and an average nRMSE < 12 % for 70 % (14 out of 20) of the reservoirs. Furthermore, the analysis of the 2019–2020 drought event in the MSEA region reveals that nearly 30 %–40 % of the region experienced more than 5 months of drought, with the most significant impact on reservoirs in Cambodia and Thailand. As a result, storage departures ranged by up to −40 % in some reservoirs, highlighting significant impacts on water availability. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the potential of the inferred storage time series for assessing real-life water-related problems in Mainland Southeast Asia, with the possibility of applying the method to estimate reservoir storage time series in other parts of the world. The reservoir storage database in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA-Res database) and the associated Python code are publicly available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14844580 (Mahto et al., 2025)."

Anderson,FLAME 1.0: a novel approach for modelling burned area in the Brazilian biomes using the maximum entropy concept,"As fire seasons in Brazil become increasingly severe, confidently understanding the factors driving fires is more critical than ever. To address this challenge, we developed FLAME (Fire Landscape Analysis using Maximum Entropy), a new model designed to predict fires and to analyse the spatial influence of both environmental and human factors while accounting for uncertainties. By adapting the model to different regions, we can enhance fire management strategies, making FLAME a powerful tool for protecting landscapes in Brazil and beyond. 
 As fire seasons in Brazil lengthen and intensify, the need to enhance fire simulations and to comprehend fire drivers becomes crucial. Yet determining what drives burning in different Brazilian biomes is a major challenge, with a highly uncertain relationship between drivers and fire. Finding ways to acknowledge and quantify that uncertainty is critical in ascertaining the causes of Brazil's changing fire regimes. We propose FLAME (Fire Landscape Analysis using Maximum Entropy), a new fire model that integrates Bayesian inference with the maximum entropy concept, enabling probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty quantification. FLAME utilises bioclimatic, land cover, and human driving variables to model fires. We apply FLAME to Brazilian biomes, evaluating its performance against observed data for three categories of fires: all fires (ALL), fires reaching natural vegetation (NAT), and fires in non-natural vegetation (NON). We assessed burned-area responses to different explanatory variable groups. The model showed adequate performance for all biomes and fire categories. Together, maximum temperature and precipitation are important factors influencing burned area in all biomes. The number of roads and forest boundaries (edge densities), forests and pastures, and carbon in dead vegetation showed higher uncertainties among the responses. Overall, the uncertainties were larger for the NON category, particularly for the Pampas and Pantanal regions. Customising explanatory variable selection and fire categories based on biome characteristics could contribute to a more biome-focused and contextually relevant analysis. Moreover, prioritising regional-scale analysis is essential for decision-makers and fire management strategies. FLAME is easily adaptable and can be used in various locations and periods, serving as a valuable tool for more informed and effective fire prevention measures."

Herein, the initial retention performance of E. coli onto six types of plastics, both without and with N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs, a common signal molecule) at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/L to 100 μg/L in suspension, was determined to reveal the influence of signal molecules on the formation of the plastisphere. We found that AHLs coexisting in suspensions significantly enhanced bacterial adhesion performance onto plastics, regardless of plastic types and AHL types, with a more pronounced enhancement observed at higher AHL concentrations. This enhanced bacterial adhesion induced by AHLs also held true in solutions containing humic acid, in river water, and in sewage. AHLs stimulated the synthesis of EPS, enhanced EPS hydrophobicity by altering the protein/polysaccharide ratio and its secondary structures, and upregulated pathways related to flagellar assembly, quorum sensing, protein production, and biofilm formation, thereby enhancing bacterial adhesion capability onto plastics. Moreover, AHLs adsorbed onto plastic surfaces could induce chemoattraction effects, further promoting bacterial adhesion performance.

This study aimed to examine the effects of low (∼0.1 mg/L) and high (∼2.2 mg/L) NH4+-N concentrations on OMP removal, ARG occurrence, and microbial communities. NH4+-N addition had no significant effect on the removal of 108 out of 128 OMPs, suggesting that other factors primarily govern the removal process. Notably, NH4+-N addition enhanced the removal of 20 OMPs by 3–70%, including three quinolones (e.g., flumequine), indicating its promotion of specific OMP removals. This effect may primarily result from NH4+-N enhancing OMP biotransformation through the stimulation of AOMs (particularly AOA and comammox) and heterotrophs (e.g., Bradyrhizobium). Furthermore, NH4+-N addition significantly reduced the abundance of eight ARGs, including quinolone ARGs, likely due to its inhibition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Additionally, we hypothesize that NH4+-N alleviates OMP selective pressure on microorganisms by promoting OMP conversion through AOMs. This study enhances the understanding of microbe-mediated OMP removal in the presence of NH4+-N and its impact on ARG occurrence during RBF."

Three oxidation routes were involved in the oxidative transformation of catechol, including two direct oxidation routes and a surface-catalyzed route. Specifically, MnO2 promoted OM polymerization under circumneutral conditions, whereas DO promoted ring cleavage and hydroxylation under alkaline conditions.

Denitrification core and accessory gene expressions showed temperature-specific patterns associated with intermediate formation. High expression of upstream core genes (e.g., narG) and limited expression of accessory genes in Thermus spp. promote incomplete denitrification at high temperatures, while low-temperature communities upregulated complementary pathways (e.g., nosRD with nosZ in Thauera spp.) for complete denitrification. Division of metabolic labor appears to be more important in denitrifying communities at high temperatures, where dominant denitrifiers perform incomplete denitrification and downstream intermediates are reduced by minor species (e.g., N2O reduction). These findings improve understanding of denitrification in thermally dynamic environments and reveal mechanisms underlying its temperature-dependent regulation."

We analyzed census-tract-level demographic and socioeconomic data using the American Community Survey (2018–2022) alongside 2019 data on chrome plating facilities from the California State Water Board. Two cohorts were included: adolescents from the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes (SOLAR; n = 238; recruited between 2001 and 2012) and young adults from the Metabolic and Asthma Incidence Research study (Meta-AIR; n = 118; 2014–2018). Plasma PFAS were measured via liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression assessed associations between neighborhood characteristics, numbers of chrome plating facilities, and PFAS concentrations in participants’ plasma. Compared to areas without chrome plating facilities, neighborhoods with one (or more than one) facility had 11% (22%) more Hispanic residents, 6% (9%) more residents without a high school education, and 3% (3%) more individuals below the poverty line. In Meta-AIR, residents within 3 km of these facilities were correlated with elevated plasma PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA concentrations, and in SOLAR, with PFDA and PFHpS. Chrome plating facilities are concentrated in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods in California. Proximity to these facilities is linked to elevated blood PFAS levels."

This study aims to explore how MPs change the feeding of planktivorous silver carp. After exposure to MPs, the utilization efficiency of zooplankton by carp increased from 28.45% to 38.63–40.20%, while that of phytoplankton decreased from 50.64% to 40.47–43.32%. MPs did not cause changes in the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities that carp consumed but altered its gut microbiota, leading to increased abundance of genes encoding proteases but decreased carbohydrase genes. Gut metabolomics further showed corresponding metabolic changes especially with increased levels of l-tyrosine, citrulline, succinic acid, and propionic acid, which are significantly correlated with the isotopic signatures of carp utilizing zooplankton. Germ-free zebrafish transplanted with feces of MPs-exposed carp showed metabolic changes like those of carp, verifying that the gut microbiota mediated the effects induced by MPs, while silver carp transplanted with feces of MPs-exposed carp exhibited increased protease activity and enhanced zooplankton utilization efficiency, confirming that MPs could alter its food utilization via gut microbiota. Our findings fill a knowledge gap regarding the ecological risk of MPs to the feeding of planktivorous fish, with potential cascading effects on aquatic ecosystems."

While human urine is a nitrogen-rich resource, its complexity presents challenges, including chlorine-mediated ammonia oxidation and disinfection byproduct formation in the electrochemical process. In this study, we investigate these important issues in a stacked electrochemical system. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and stopped-flow techniques were used to examine chlorine evolution and dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation. Results showed minor ammonia loss due to chlorination because the Cl2-to-nitrogen ratio was significantly lower than the breakpoint ratio under anodic conditions (pH < 1.5). However, the generated active chlorine induced hydrogen abstraction and chlorine addition to unsaturated bonds, forming chlorinated DOM in the ammonia-receiving solution. This necessitated activated carbon post-treatment to ensure product quality. The electrochemical system demonstrated stable performance over 390 h with an ammonia removal rate of 24.4 g-N m–2 h–1 and consistent removal/recovery efficiencies of 80%. Further attention should be given to control of cathode scaling, anion exchange membrane fouling, and gas permeable membrane wetting. Overall, this study is anticipated to enhance the applicability of electrochemical ammonia recovery technologies."

Prevailing research indicates that intracellular or extracellular biomineralization enhances photosynthesis and carbon fixation, with limited attention to the potential and mechanisms of intracellular–extracellular synergy. Here, we report that electroactive cyanobacteria (Synechococcus, Syne) construct an intracellular–extracellular synergistic biohybrid system by biomineralizing Zn(II) into intracellular Zn(II)-OM and extracellular ZnO-OM. The photoexcited electrons from ZnO-OM transfer to the photosynthetic electron transport chain and promote photosynthesis in this biohybrid system. Meanwhile, Zn(II)-OM plays essential roles in photosynthesis and cellular metabolism, upregulating key genes involved in light-dependent reactions (e.g., PsbA, PsbD, PsaA, and PsaB) and light-independent reactions (e.g., rbcL and rbcS) to increase CO2 capture and fixation. Compared to untreated Syne cells, this biohybrid system, formed by treating Syne cells with Zn(II), exhibits a combined 120.9% increase in protein and lipid production efficiency. This work reveals the complexity of biomineralization both intracellularly and extracellularly, proposes the concept of an intracellular–extracellular synergistic biohybrid system that boosts photosynthetic carbon fixation, and provides comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of self-assembled hybrid systems."

Large influences from anthropogenic sources on health risks were observed with acellular and cellular assays. Anthropogenic biomass burning (BB) and natural dust events increased human pulmonary exposure to the oxidative potential (OPdose,T) of WS-PM10 by 209 and 47%, respectively, compared to regular periods. OPvDTT and ROSv results were positively correlated in anthropogenic-dominant samples, while showed no significant correlation in the remaining samples. As a result, the BB and dust event had higher and lower levels of cellular ROSv compared with the nonevent period, respectively. Source apportionment results suggest that specific organic contents (e.g., PAHs) had relatively low contents in samples less influenced by anthropogenic sources, possibly explaining the divergence in acellular and cellular results. Heavy metals were dominant contributors of OPvDTT throughout the campaign, and a Chelex method is recommended over a EDTA method for quantification of their summed OPvDTT."

The authors identify a localized defect in 2D glasses-a square of four particles vibrating in a two-in, two-out pattern-as the origin of quasi-localized modes and a microscopic Eshelby inclusion driving mechanical anisotropy. 
 In crystals, defects are well-defined and crucial to their mechanical properties. In contrast, the structural disorder in glasses makes it challenging to directly identify defects at the particle level. However, low-frequency quasi-localised modes (QLMs) in glasses provide valuable insights, acting as mechanical defects associated with shear transformation zones and soft spots. Using molecular dynamics simulations of two-dimensional glasses, we identify a particle-level defect responsible for generating QLMs. The primary QLM originates from a “key-core” square of four particles vibrating in a two-in, two-out pattern, interpretable as a microscopic Eshelby inclusion. The motion of these particles induces nearby volumetric and far-field shear deformations, forming a characteristic four-leaf pattern. Despite the structural isotropy of the glass, these QLMs introduce notable mechanical anisotropy, particularly in nano-sized glasses. Crucially, pinning the key-core particles dramatically reduces shear modulus anisotropy, confirming their role as “localised particle-level defects.” This discovery deepens our understanding of glass defects and offers valuable insights for nanoscale glass applications. Unlike crystals with well-defined defects, glasses exhibit structural disorder that makes identifying particle-level defects difficult.

Here, the authors show that cytosolic p62-positive bodies in aneuploid cells are enriched for mitochondrial precursor proteins, which in turn impairs mitochondrial function. 
 Aneuploidy, or aberrant chromosomal content, disrupts cellular proteostasis through altered expression of numerous proteins. Aneuploid cells accumulate SQSTM1/p62-positive cytosolic bodies, exhibit impaired protein folding, and show altered proteasomal and lysosomal activity. Here, we employ p62 proximity- and affinity-based proteomics to elucidate p62 interactors in aneuploid cells and observe an enrichment of mitochondrial proteins. Increased protein aggregation and colocalization of p62 with both novel interactors and mitochondrial proteins is further confirmed by microscopy. Compared to parental diploids, aneuploid cells suffer from mitochondrial defects, including perinuclearly-clustered mitochondrial networks, elevated reactive oxygen species levels, reduced mitochondrial DNA abundance, and impaired protein import, leading to cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Overexpression of heat shock proteins in aneuploid cells mitigates protein aggregation and decreases the colocalization of p62 with the mitochondrial protein TOMM20. Thus, proteotoxic stress caused by chromosome gains results in the sequestration of mitochondrial precursor proteins into cytosolic p62-bodies, thereby compromising mitochondrial function. Aneuploidy disrupts proteostasis, leading to protein aggregation and accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 in the cytosol. Here, the authors show that cytosolic p62-positive bodies in aneuploid cells are enriched for mitochondrial precursor proteins, which in turn impairs mitochondrial function."

 Histologic variant (HV) subtypes of bladder cancer are clinically aggressive tumors that are more resistant to standard therapy compared to conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC). Little is known about the transcriptional programs that account for their biological differences. Here we show using single cell analysis that HVs harbor a tumor cell state characterized by expression of MUC16 (CA125), MUC4, and KRT24. This cell state is enriched in metastases, predicted to be highly resistant to chemotherapy, and linked with poor survival. We also find enriched expression of TM4SF1, a transmembrane protein, in HV tumor cells.

 We experimentally investigate a superconducting circuit composed of two flux qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a common LC resonator. Owing to the large anharmonicity of the flux qubits, the system can be described well by a generalized Dicke Hamiltonian containing spin–spin interaction terms. In the experimentally measured spectrum, we observed two key phenomena. First, an avoided level crossing provides evidence of the exotic interaction that allows the simultaneous excitation of two artificial atoms by absorbing one photon from the resonator. Second, we identified a pronounced spectral asymmetry that is a clear signature of light-matter decoupling. This multi-atom ultrastrongly coupled system opens the door to studying novel processes for quantum optics and quantum-information tasks on a chip.

 Due to low availability of CO2 in aquatic environment, microalgae have evolved a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM). It has long been thought that operation of CCM would suppress photorespiration by increasing the CO2 concentration at the Rubisco active site, but experimental evidence is scarce. To better explore the function of photorespiration in algae, we first characterized a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant defected in low-CO2 inducible 20 (LCI20) and show that LCI20 is a chloroplast-envelope glutamate/malate transporter playing a role in photorespiration. By monitoring growth and glycolate excretion in mutants deficient in either CCM or photorespiration, we conclude that: (i.) CCM induction does not depend on photorespiration, (ii.) glycolate excretion together with glycolate dehydrogenase down-regulation prevents the toxic accumulation of non-metabolized photorespiratory metabolites, and (iii.) photorespiration is active at low CO2 when the CCM is operational. This work provides a foundation for a better understanding of the carbon cycle in the ocean where significant glycolate concentrations have been found.

 Microtubules and nuclear transmembrane SUN1/2 proteins promote the mobility of DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and the misrepair of one-ended DSBs induced in BRCA1-deficient cells by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, whether microtubules promote aberrant DSBs repair by altering the nuclear structure and whether the nuclear structure itself plays a role in these processes is still unclear. Here we show that microtubule-dependent DSBs mobility in BRCA1-deficient cells after PARPi treatment is associated with nuclear envelope (NE) invaginations. Furthermore, increasing NE invaginations by Lmna deletion or inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis increases DSBs mobility, chromosomal aberrations, and PARPi cytotoxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells. These findings reveal a functional connection between the NE and DSB repair and suggest that drugs increasing NE deformability will enhance PARPi therapy efficacy in BRCA1-deficient cancers.

 The sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic prompts active convection over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), which consequently drives the Hadley Cell (HC) in the South Asian monsoon region to shift northward. This interaction mechanism stresses the “hub” effect of the QTP in the atmospheric energy and water cycle of the low- to mid–high latitude systems during the convergence of westerly and monsoon winds. The Rossby source, also famous as the “oscillation source,” formed in the upper troposphere by the SST variations in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic, is an essential “thermal driving source” for the interannual shifts in convection over the QTP. The meridional teleconnection wave train structure triggered by the warming (1991–2020)/cooling (1961–1990) of the SST in the high-impact area of the mid–high latitudes of the North Atlantic displays a reversed phase. The Rossby wave train, which spreads from the North Atlantic to the QTP during the high-impact sea surface warming phase in the North Atlantic, indicates a remarkable anticyclonic structure (strong divergence) in the high altitude (200 hPa) of the QTP, which favors the generation of active convective activity in the latter 30 years. By contrast, convective activity is blocked. During the two stages of 1961–1990 and 1991–2020, despite a significant interdecadal positive and negative phase reversal in the North Atlantic Multiyear Oscillation (AMO), the variance in the definition range between the AMO and the high-impact area of the North Atlantic led to substantial differences in the meridional teleconnection wave train structures and the corresponding effects. In addition, the latent heat emitted by the enhanced convective activity on the QTP during the sea surface warming phase in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic can strengthen the “heat pump” effect of the QTP, cause the northward shift of HC in the South Asian monsoon region, and spark the mutual feedback mechanism between the plateau convection and the HC in the South Asian monsoon region. According to these interdecadal response characteristics, this paper offers a comprehensive physical image that exhibits the mutual feedback between the convection over the QTP and the HC in the South Asian monsoon region, where the active convection is initiated by the SST warming in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic."

 Numerous studies have explored global warming impact on tropical cyclones (TCs), but post-global warming TC activity remains poorly understood. This study analyzed 400-year evolution of TC characteristics in CO2 emission-driven ensemble experiments performed with the CESM2 model under net-zero (ZeroE) and negative CO2 emission (NegE) scenarios. Findings reveal a hemispheric asymmetry in TC track changes, with the Northern Hemisphere seeing a decrease and the Southern Hemisphere an increase. Under the ZeroE scenario, asymmetry persists for 300 years, while the NegE scenario mitigates it within 200 years. This asymmetry is influenced by changes in mid-level humidity, vertical wind shear, and sea surface temperature gradients. Unlike the TC frequency, maximum wind speeds and rainfall associated with landfalling TCs are enhanced globally in the ZeroE scenario, while alleviated in the NegE scenario. These results indicate that a carbon-neutral strategy is not sufficient and that more ambitious negative emission efforts are needed to mitigate TC impacts."

 This study investigates how the atmospheric mean state influences the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections with the North Atlantic-European (NAE) region, using ERA5 and CMIP5/CMIP6 models. By isolating the contributions of heating anomalies in the Niño 3.4 and Tropical Western-Eastern Indian Ocean (TWEIO) regions, we find that in November, the Niño 3.4 teleconnection dominates, projecting onto the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In December, the TWEIO teleconnection prevails, reinforcing the positive NAO via a zonal wavenumber-3 Rossby wave train originating from SouthEast Asia (SEA). Models that fail to simulate the December ENSO teleconnection with the NAE exhibit a weak Rossby wave source in SEA and overly strong subtropical Pacific and Atlantic jet streams, which trap Rossby waves at lower latitudes, affecting the remote atmospheric response over the NAE. This waveguide bias is likely driven by a cold bias in the northern Pacific and Atlantic, a common mean-state error in climate models."

 The Warm Arctic–Cold Eurasian pattern (WACE) is a pair of opposing surface air temperature anomalies over the polar region and the midlatitude Eurasian continent, which is usually associated with Arctic Sea ice melt and midlatitude extreme weather. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere. Here we show evidence of an inter-hemispheric connection between SAM and WACE during boreal winter. A positive SAM leads to a negative WACE (and vice versa) 30–40 days later. This lagged remote influence of SAM is transmitted via a Rossby wave that crosses the equator in the eastern Pacific and tropical Atlantic. The ensuing WACE temperature pattern is then amplified by the greenhouse effect associated with the local humidity response. SAM also leads to a convection anomaly in the equatorial Atlantic which generates a Northern Hemisphere Rossby wave that reinforces WACE. The link between SAM and WACE revealed here indicates a dynamical origin for WACE. This long-distance teleconnection, and the lagged association between SAM and WACE may be relevant for subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions."

 Over recent decades the Amazon region has been exposed to large-scale land-use changes and global warming. How these changes affect Amazonia’s hydrological cycle remains unclear as meteorological data are scarce. We use tree ring oxygen isotope records to confirm that the Amazon hydrological cycle has intensified since 1980. Diverging isotopic trends from terra firme and floodplain trees from distinct sites (approximately 1000 km apart) in Western Amazon indicate rainfall amounts increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season at large-scale. Using the Rayleigh distillation model, we estimate that wet season rainfall increased by 15–22%, and dry season rainfall decreased by 8–13%. These diverging trends provide evidence, independent from existing climate records, that the seasonality of the hydrological cycle in the Amazon is increasing. Continuation of the observed trends will have a pervasive impact on Amazon forests and floodplain ecosystems, and strongly affect the livelihoods of the regional riverine communities.

 Repetitive optical observations from satellites are crucial for monitoring earth surface dynamics over time. However, optical satellite image time series is severely affected by frequent data gaps due to clouds and shadows. While synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides cloud-penetrating capabilities to complement missing optical data, recent advancements in time series reconstruction have shifted focus from incorporating single SAR image to exploiting SAR time series. However, current methods still struggle for challenging scenarios like highly dynamic surface, persistent data gaps, and exhibit poor resilience to inaccurate cloud masks. In this research, we approach the time series reconstruction problem from the perspective of conditional generation. We propose a multimodal diffusion framework termed RESTORE-DiT, which firstly promotes the sequence-level optical-SAR fusion through a diffusion framework. Specifically, date-matched SAR time series provide under-cloud surface dynamics to guide the denoising process of cloudy areas, and date information is embedded to account for irregular observation intervals and periodic patterns. Extensive experiments on three regions have shown the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. RESTORE-DiT outperforms comparison methods by 2.87 dB in PSNR and a 27.2 % reduction in RMSE on France site. SAR and date information together increase PSNR by 2.41 dB. The reconstructed optical image time series is verified to accurately reflect the crop growth condition and support for long-term vegetation observations. In addition, RESTORE-DiT can be easily extended to other conditional reconstruction or prediction tasks for arbitrary time series image data, thus facilitating spatiotemporal analysis research.

They have been widely applied in geospatial analysis and environmental science fields.

The experimental results show that, compared with ISEA-projection-based HDGGS grids, the Fuller-projection-based HDGGS grids’ cell neighbor distance standard deviation, grid neighboring distance standard deviation, and global deformation index are 72.09 % to 76.12 %, 74.25 % to 81.92 %, and 72.25 % to 76.29 % of the former’s values, respectively. In comparison, the Gnomonic-projection-based HDGGS’s global deformation index is 55.28 % and 40.35 % of the previous two’s values, respectively. Therefore, Gnomonic-projection-based HDGGS demonstrates the least cell shape deformation and optimal equidistant characteristics. This study pioneers quantifying local distance consistency as standardized neighbor distance standard deviation, transcending conventional evaluation paradigms that solely rely on cell perimeter mean squared error or compactness. Experimental results confirm the method’s effectiveness in quantitatively evaluating HDGGS shape deformation, providing a decision-support tool for HDGGS projection type selection."

 Long-term, large-scale crop distribution mapping is crucial for agricultural policy and resource management. While high-resolution multispectral remote sensing has been widely used for crop type mapping, three major challenges remain: 1) spatiotemporal heterogeneity in cloud-free and shadow-free observations, 2) the lack of sufficient ground truth samples, and 3) limited generalization of identification models over extended periods. To address these challenges, this paper constructs a time-continuous sequence model that captures the unique feature pattern between the target-crop and non-target crops (referred to as the knowledge model). Specifically, a morphing approach was first employed to interpolate intermediate models between two pre-trained non-adjacent knowledge models. Then, a date-continuous sequence model that estimate the probabilistic of growth patterns of target crop was generated. This date-continuous sequence model mitigates spatiotemporal heterogeneity issues at the pixel level across large regions. Additionally, crop-specific knowledge model addresses sample scarcity and enhances generalization during long-term applications. The method was test using a long-term cotton mapping task (2000, 2005–2023) in Xinjiang, China. The results demonstrate that: 1) The sequence of knowledge model can effectively capture feature differences between cotton and non-cotton throughout the growing period, resulting in knowledge feature has a higher separability compared to original spectral and vegetation index features; 2) Segmenting knowledge features with Unet enables effective mapping cotton and non-cotton without ground samples. The estimated planting area from our mapping results shows excellent consistency with official statistics (R2 = 0.97). The correlation between our 2018–2021 results and previously published data reached 0.8, 0.88, 0.88, and 0.89. 3). The stable and excellent mapping accuracy proves that resonation of connectivity and reachability in parameter space between two networks with identical architecture, and model morphing is a feasible way to overcome the spatial–temporal heterogeneity in valid observations in large regions."

In the study, 1382 samples of precipitation from 27 stations in the Qilian Mountains were analyzed. We quantified the wet deposition of atmospheric S on the Qilian Mountains, and the following conclusions were drawn. The annual average S wet deposition flux in the Qilian Mountains is 37.59 kg/hm2. Due to the influence of precipitation patterns, the distribution of S wet deposition flux is uneven throughout the year, with 78.75 % of the total deposition occurring between May and October. Also, the S wet deposition flux shows an obvious spatial variability, with an increasing variation characteristic trend from west to east. Additionally, altitude, meteorological factors, and ecosystem types influenced the S wet deposition. The main sources and mechanisms of individual air pollutants in the Qilian Mountains are highly complex. The concentrations of SO2 are strongly influenced by the regional transport of emissions, mainly from severe pollution source regions in South Asia, Western China, and Central Asia.

 In early January 2021, an unprecedented cold wave impacted Eastern China and triggered record-breaking low temperatures across vast regions. Utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, this study investigates stratosphere-troposphere coupling mechanisms through dynamic and thermodynamic analyses with a focus on tropopause folds dynamics that drove this extreme event. The results demonstrate that the 26 December 2020 Arctic sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event triggered a zonal wind reversal in early January and downward-propagating geopotential height and temperature anomalies that displaced the polar vortex toward Eastern China, inducing southward high-potential vorticity (PV) air mass intrusion via tropopause folds. Diagnostic analysis using the 3D labeling methods revealed a significant rise in tropopause folds frequency preceding the cold wave, culminating in deep folding events as high-PV air masses penetrated the midlatitude troposphere down to 700 hPa while the sloping 315 K isentropic surface facilitated southward cold stratospheric air transport and enhanced convective development through fold intensification. Thermodynamic analysis revealed marked instability within and beneath the dry intrusion zone characterized by negative Brunt-Väisälä frequency squared (N2) and Richardson numbers <0.25, where stratified instability and turbulence generation correlated positively with fold intensity, and the coupling of tropopause folds intrusions with mid-high latitude cyclonic ascent and low-latitude anticyclonic descent amplified vertical convection-driven cold surge intensification. This study establishes tropopause folds as a critical mediator bridging stratospheric anomalies with surface extreme events, highlighting its regulatory function in cold outbreak dynamics through coordinated stratosphere-troposphere mass exchange and vertically destabilizing processes."

 Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) estimation faces constraint due to complicate parameterization. The non-parametric (NP) method offers an efficient alternative, but its effectiveness across diverse environments, particularly under extreme conditions, is uncertain. This study leverages data from 131 global flux stations across various climate and landcover types to assess the NP method's accuracy, focusing on extreme scenarios spanning from dry to wet and from hot to cold. Our results indicate substantial variability, with absolute errors ranging from −41.7 to 26.8 W/m2 and relative errors between 0.4 % and 98.1 %. The NP method tends to overestimate ET in hot, dry conditions, and underestimate in cold, wet conditions, with performance declining under extremes. Cold climates exhibit the largest biases, with particularly severe underestimation in extreme wet (−54.5 W/m2) and cold (−69.2 W/m2) conditions. Closed shrublands demonstrate the largest overestimation (73.2 W/m2) in extreme hot conditions. Across stations, three error patterns are observed: (i) overestimation in dry-hot regions caused by a high difference between equilibrium and actual ET, (ii) underestimation in humid regions resulting from a low difference, and (iii) underestimation in cold regions arising from large surface-air temperature gradients, causing an excessive integral term resulting in overcorrection. These errors could be amplified under extreme conditions, reducing model performance and highlighting the NP method's sensitivity to hydroclimatic extremes while offering insights for improving its accuracy and robustness."

Bingemer,A view on recent ice-nucleating particle intercomparison studies: why the uncertainty of the activation temperature matters,"Ice-nucleating particle (INP) observations often differ by 1 order of magnitude, when multiple instruments measure in parallel. As INP measurements are sensitive to the activation conditions, inaccuracies in the temperature measurement may induce significant deviations in the INP concentration. It was found that typical temperature uncertainties reported in intercomparison studies may explain divergences of a factor of 2 (± 0.5 °C) or 5 to 10 (± 1 °C) between two INP counters with opposite bias. 
 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) play a crucial role in cloud formation, influencing cloud phase, lifetime, and the onset of precipitation. Consequently, microphysical processes involving INPs strongly affect the radiative properties of clouds. However, when multiple INP counters are operated simultaneously, notoriously high deviations between instruments in the range of 1 order of magnitude are commonly observed. These differences occur in ambient atmospheric measurements as well as in laboratory studies. A potential reason for these discrepancies that deserves more consideration may be related to uncertainties and errors in the temperature measurement. As the activation of INPs is a strong function of the nucleation conditions, relatively small inaccuracies in the temperature measurement may lead to significant over- or underestimations of the INP concentration. In this study, we have explored this effect as a potential reason for the differences observed among INP counters by analyzing 10 INP intercomparison studies that were published within the last 10 years with a novel quantitative estimate of the temperature uncertainty effect on heterogeneous ice nucleation. The stated temperature uncertainty of instruments used in these experiments ranged from ±0.1 to ±1.5 °C, and was most commonly specified as ±0.5 °C. Potential deviations resulting from typical temperature errors were compared with the reported level of agreement for intercompared methods. As a measure of the potential INP error due to nucleation temperature error, we defined the temperature error factor (TEF) as the quotient of the ice nucleation activity at the actual nucleation temperature divided by the ice nucleation activity at a potentially erroneously measured temperature. Respective TEFs were calculated for five distinct activation spectra based on four INP parameterizations and one compilation of atmospheric INP data. TEFs were between 1.1 and 3.2 for temperature errors of ±0.5 °C, and between less than 2 and larger than 10 for temperature errors of ±1.5 °C. TEFs calculated from parameterizations of aerosols that are highly ice nucleation active were significantly larger than those derived from atmospheric data; although the effect was found to be still as large as a factor of 10 for certain temperature ranges in atmospheric activation spectra at a temperature error of ±2 °C. When comparing two INP instruments, measurement biases may be of opposite direction, thus resulting in expected differences of up to the product of both TEFs. We found that opposite biases of +0.5 and −0.5 °C can therefore typically explain differences of a factor of 2, while opposite biases of +1 and −1 °C can theoretically explain differences of factors up to 5 or even 10, which is of the order of discrepancies typically reported in the literature on INP intercomparisons. These results highlight the need to carefully assess and report on uncertainties of the ice nucleation activation temperature."

We use advanced artificial intelligence techniques and a massive amount of data, including observations at over 2500 gauges and a wealth of climate and environmental information. The maps are a critical step in understanding and predicting how carbon moves through our environment, hence making them a useful tool for tackling climate challenges. 
 Riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a vital role in regional and global carbon cycles. However, the processes of DOC conversion from soil organic carbon (SOC) and leaching into rivers are insufficiently understood, inconsistently represented, and poorly parameterized, particularly in land surface and Earth system models. As a first attempt to fill this gap, we propose a generic formula that directly connects SOC concentration with DOC concentration in headwater streams, where a single parameter, the transformation rate from SOC in the soil to DOC leaching flux (Pr), accounts for the overall processes governing SOC conversion to DOC and leaching from soils (along with runoff) into headwater streams. We then derive high-resolution Pr maps over the contiguous US (CONUS) using SOC data from two different sources: the Harmonized World Soil Database v1.2 (HWSD) and SoilGrids 2.0. Both maps are developed following the same five major steps: (1) selecting independent catchments where observed riverine DOC data are available with reasonable quality; (2) estimating catchment-average SOC for the independent catchments; (3) estimating the Pr values for these catchments based on the generic formula and catchment-average SOC; (4) developing a predictive model of Pr with machine learning (ML) techniques and catchment-scale climate, hydrology, geology, and other attributes; and (5) deriving a national map of Pr based on the ML model. For evaluation, we compare the DOC concentration derived using the Pr map and the observed DOC concentration values at evaluation catchments. The resulting mean absolute scaled error and coefficient of determination are 0.73 and 0.47 for the HWSD-based model and 0.58 and 0.72 for the SoilGrids-based model, respectively, suggesting the effectiveness of the overall methodology. Efforts to constrain uncertainty and evaluate sensitivity of Pr to different factors are discussed. To illustrate the use of such maps, we derive a riverine DOC concentration reanalysis dataset over CONUS. The two Pr maps, robustly derived and empirically validated, lay a critical cornerstone for better simulating the terrestrial carbon cycle in land surface and Earth system models. Our findings not only set a foundation for improving our predictive understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle at the regional and global scales, but also hold promises for informing policy decisions related to decarbonization and climate change mitigation.

We developed a continual-learning-based multilayer perceptron, integrating prior knowledge from numerical models and BGC-Argo validation to reconstruct a pan-European 3D nitrate field from 2010 to 2023 (0–2000 m depth, monthly, 0.25° horizontal resolution) using sea surface environmental features. This dataset helps bridge observational gaps and enhances understanding of the ocean's interior environment. 
 Nitrate plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, as it influences primary productivity. Despite its ecological significance, accurately mapping its three-dimensional (3D) concentration on a large scale remains a considerable challenge due to the inherent limitations of existing methodologies. To address this issue, this study proposes a continual-learning-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to reconstruct the 3D ocean nitrate concentrations above 2000 m depth over the pan-European coast. The continual-learning strategy enhances the model generalization by integrating knowledge from Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS) nitrate data, effectively overcoming the spatial limitations of Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) observations in comprehensive nitrate characterization. The proposed approach integrates the advantages of extensive spatial remote sensing observations, the precision of BGC-Argo measurements, and the broad knowledge from simulated nitrate datasets, exploiting the capacity of neural networks to model their nonlinear relationships between multisource sea surface environmental variables and subsurface nitrates. The model achieves excellent performance in profile cross-validation (R2=0.98, RMSE = 0.592 µmol kg−1) and maintains robustness across diverse 3D validation scenarios, suggesting its effectiveness in filling observational gaps and reconstructing the 3D nitrate field. Then, the spatiotemporal distribution of the reconstructed 3D nitrate field from 2010 to 2023 reveals a spatial distribution pattern, an interannual upward trend, and the degree of consistency in vertical variation. The contributions of all 22 input features to the model's estimation were quantified using Shapley additive explanation values. This study reveals the potential of the proposed approach to overcome observational limitations and provide further insights into the 3D ocean condition.

To date, laboratory experiments were mostly focused on microbial (28 % of samples from laboratory experiments) and pyrogenic (15 %) methanogenesis or anaerobic (16 %), and aerobic (8 %) CH4 oxidation, and only a single contribution to studies of photochemical oxidation via OH and Cl (5 %). The distinct ranges of Δ13CH3D and Δ12CH2D2 values measured in these studies suggests their potential to improve our understanding of atmospheric CH4. This work provides an overview of the major gaps in measurements and identifies where further studies should be focussed to enable the highest immediate impact on understanding global CH4."

Wind and temperature reconstructions show reasonable skill, while humidity and sunshine duration perform less well. Application to historical wild fire events demonstrates the data set’s potential for impact studies. This is the first Swiss data set providing several variables at a high-resolution of 1x1 km and going back to 1763. 
 High-resolution gridded daily data is needed to study historical climate and weather impacts. Current daily gridded data sets in Switzerland extend to 1961 or 1971 for variables such as minimum and maximum temperature and sunshine duration. However, studying historical weather and climate events, such as the year-without-a-summer requires much longer time periods. For Switzerland, high-resolution gridded reconstructions of daily mean temperature and daily precipitation sums have recently been developed based on a large amount of early instrumental data for a period from 1763 to 1960. Here, we present an extension of these daily reconstructions to six more variables, namely, relative sunshine duration, relative humidity, minimum and maximum temperature at 2 m, and u- and v-wind at 10 m with a 1x1 km resolution. These additional reconstructions are based on the same method as the previous reconstructions by combining the analogue resampling method and data assimilation. Cross-validation results using a network representative of early 19th-century observations show a mean squared error skill score ranging from 0.70 to 0.80 for wind speed, depending on the season. For maximum and minimum temperature, values average between 0.48 to 0.82, depending on the seasons. These results indicate reasonable skill of the reconstructions and show that the wind and temperature fields outperform climatology despite the data scarcity in the historical period. However, for relative humidity and relative sunshine duration, the values of the mean squared skill score are significantly lower, ranging between -0.31 to 0.48. Furthermore, we explored the potential of the extended reconstructions by evaluating historical and contemporary wildfire events in Switzerland using the widely used Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI). The two historical fires were associated with a notably high fire danger in the reconstruction. For the contemporary winter fire, the reconstruction agrees well with the index calculated from the COSMO-1 weather forecast model, though neither indicates exceptionally high fire danger."

PaleoRiada, the first open palaeoflood database for Spain, addresses these issues by compiling data from 299 palaeoflood records, accessible via ArcGIS Online. This database aims to support the revision of Potential Significant Flood Risk Areas, providing insights for regions not included in current national flood maps. 
 Palaeoflood records are natural evidence of past flood events (typically found in landforms, sediments, or vegetation). Over the last 25 years, several palaeoflood record databases have been implemented. However, many of these databases are outdated, lack accessible or comprehensive palaeohydrological information, and present challenges in terms of data accessibility and reuse, particularly for non-research communities (e.g., planning administrations or flood risk managers). This work introduces PaleoRiada, the first open database that compiles published palaeoflood records from Spain. PaleoRiada stores typological, hydrological, temporal, and spatial data collected from approximately 126 publications (including journal articles, scientific reports, and book chapters). This database has been implemented using a simple Relational Database Management System (RDMS), integrated into a web platform, and is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15627801 (Sandoval-Rincón et al., 2025). The PaleoRiada database contains 299 palaeoflood records (both geological and biological) dated between 2014 CE and 97,000 BP and distributed across both Atlantic (164) and Mediterranean (135) catchments. PaleoRiada includes 157 records with specific discharge values ranging from 0.02 to 320 m3/km2·s. These records are associated with a variety of river systems, including wide alluvial plains (25), Mediterranean ephemeral streams (17), mountain torrents (36), and confined valley rivers (79). Additionally, they encompass flood events (102), flash floods (48), dam failures (1), and hyperconcentrated flow events (6). The relationship between PaleoRiada and the Spanish Flood-prone Mapping Project (SNCZI) indicates that approximately 80 % of the PaleoRiada records are not included in the flood-prone areas defined by SNCZI. Therefore, several records can be consulted to prioritise or propose new areas for preliminary flood risk assessment. Accessibility and simplified data query and entry in PaleoRiada can facilitate the application of palaeoflood data in land planning and flood risk management."

To help improve emergency response, we created a global dataset called BRIGHT using both optical and radar images to detect building damage in any weather. We tested many artificial intelligence models and showed how well they work in real disaster scenes. This work can guide better tools for future disaster recovery and help save lives faster. 
 Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment, an essential capability crucial in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to accurately map unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. These solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal EO data, particularly combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the lack of suitable benchmark datasets has constrained the development of robust multimodal AI models. In this paper, we present a Building damage assessment dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse multimodal dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of human-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, focusing on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The dataset's optical and SAR images with spatial resolutions between 0.3 and 1 meters provide detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise damage assessment. We train seven advanced AI models on BRIGHT to validate transferability and robustness. Beyond that, it also serves as a challenging benchmark for a variety of tasks in real-world disaster scenarios, including unsupervised domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised multimodal change detection, and unsupervised multimodal image matching. The experimental results serve as baselines to inspire future research and model development. The dataset (Chen et al., 2025), along with the code and pretrained models, is available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT and will be updated as and when a new disaster data is available. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track II. We hope that this effort will promote the development of AI-driven methods in support of people in disaster-affected areas."

We developed the Flexible Snow Model version 2 to quantify these uncertainties. In a first model demonstration, how unloading of intercepted snow from the forest canopy is represented is responsible for the largest uncertainty. Global mapping of forest distribution is also likely to be a large source of uncertainty in existing models. 
 Multiple options for representing physical processes in forest canopies are added to FSM, which is a model with multiple options for representing physical processes in snow on the ground. The canopy processes represented are shortwave and longwave radiative transfer; turbulent transfers of heat and moisture; and interception, sublimation, unloading, and melt of snow in the canopy. There are options for Beer's law or two-stream approximation canopy radiative transfer, linear or non-linear canopy snow interception efficiency, and time- and melt-dependent or temperature- and wind-dependent canopy snow unloading. Canopy mass and energy balance equations can be solved with one or two model layers. Model behaviour on stand scales is compared with observations of above- and below-canopy shortwave and longwave radiation, below-canopy wind speed, snow mass on the ground, and subjective estimates of canopy snow load. Large-scale simulations of snow cover extent, snow mass, and albedo for the Northern Hemisphere are compared with observations and land-only simulations by state-of-the-art Earth system models. Without accounting for uncertainty in forest structure metrics and parameter values, the ranges of multi-physics ensemble simulations are not as wide as seen in intercomparisons of existing models. FSM2 provides a platform for rapid investigation of sensitivity to model structure and parameter values or ensemble-based data assimilation for snow in open and forested environments."

Ryzhkov;Guosheng Liu;GyuWon Lee,Diagnosis of winter precipitation types using the spectral bin model (version 1DSBM-19M): comparison of five methods using ICE-POP 2018 field experiment data,"Microphysics model-based diagnosis, such as the spectral bin model (SBM), has recently been attempted to diagnose winter precipitation types. In this study, the accuracy of SBM-based precipitation type diagnosis is compared with other traditional methods. SBM has a relatively higher accuracy for dry-snow and wet-snow events, whereas it has lower accuracy for rain events. When the microphysics scheme in the SBM was optimized for the corresponding region, the accuracy for rain events improved. 
 Winter precipitation types (WPTs) are controlled by many factors, including thermodynamic and microphysical processes. Therefore, realistically simulating interactions between precipitation particles and the atmosphere is important when diagnosing the WPT. In the present study, we analyze the performance of a modified version of the one-dimensional spectral bin model (SBM; version 1DSBM-19M) of Carlin and Ryzhkov (2019), which simulates the change in the physical characteristics of precipitation particles of various sizes as they fall from the cloud top to the ground and diagnoses surface WPTs. We compare the performance of the SBM and four other diagnostic methods that use the following variables: (1) atmospheric thickness, (2) wet-bulb temperature, (3) temperature and relative humidity, and (4) wet-bulb temperature and low-level lapse rate. Three reference WPTs (snow (SN), rain (RA), and RASN) are obtained from particle size velocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometer data using a newly proposed decision tree algorithm. The results show that the SBM has the highest overall hit rate for all cases among five diagnostic methods. In contrast, the hit rate of the SBM for each WPT shows lower performance for RA than for the other methods. These results indicate that the SBM simulations tend to underestimate melting compared to observations. We thus explore the effects of the SBM's microphysics scheme on the extent of melting in cases of misdiagnosed RA. An optimized SBM that uses the climatological snow density–diameter relationship for the Pyeongchang region produces an increased amount of melting and achieves improved skill scores compared to the current SBM, which uses a snow density–diameter relationship for the Colorado region."

The poisoning mechanism of SO2 on the active sites of catalysts has been well acknowledged, yet the role of support in sulfur-tolerant catalysis remains elusive. Herein, TiO2, Al2O3, and CeO2 carriers were selected to unveil the sulfur resistance mechanism of Pd-based catalysts in catalytic CO oxidation. We showed that Pd/TiO2 effectively terminated continuous sulfidation, achieving 100% CO conversion at 175 °C for 200 h under SO2 and H2O exposure. This exceptional sulfur tolerance was attributed to the formation of a distinct tridentate sulfate structure on the PdO nanoparticles, facilitated by the moderate reducibility and strong acidity of Pd/TiO2. In contrast, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/CeO2 remained only ∼70 and 5% efficiency, accompanied by the abundant formation of Pd-related bidentate and Ce-related tridentate sulfate species, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses revealed the distinct in situ-formed tridentate Pd–SOx coordination over Pd/TiO2 regulated the local electronic distribution, effectively mitigating the affinity of the catalyst to SO2 while preserving the redox capability and reactivity of oxygen species. Our findings are crucial for advancing sulfur-tolerant catalysis, offering valuable strategies for rationally designing robust catalysts to overcome both economic and environmental challenges in industrial applications."

Cerium (Ce) is a rare earth element that exhibits multiple oxidation states. The oxidation of dissolved Ce(III) by manganese oxides (MnO2) and the resulting Ce anomaly is used as an indicator for tracing biogeochemical processes controlling REE transport and mobility, as well as a paleo-redox proxy for understanding Earth’s oxygenation events. However, a detailed kinetic rate law for this process is still lacking. This study determines the reaction orders and rate constant for Ce(III) oxidation by δ-MnO2 using the initial rate method. The overall reaction follows a first order for Ce(III) and δ-MnO2 and a 0.5th order for OH–, resulting in an overall 2.5th order. The calculated overall rate constant (k) was 1.4 × 106 L3/2 mol–1/2 g–1 h–1. Kinetic modeling was employed to distinguish Ce adsorption and oxidation by using redox-inert Ce-analogues La and Nd. Our experimental and kinetic modeling results suggest that Ce(III) oxidation by δ-MnO2 occurs in multiple steps: the adsorption of Ce(III) on the δ-MnO2 surface, the oxidation of Ce(III), and surface precipitation of CeIVO2. Our findings provide important insights into the quantitative applications of Ce anomaly as a proxy to investigate various biogeochemical processes."

We selected well-defined short-chain organic acids (OAc), i.e., formic acid (FA), oxalic acid (Ox), and citric acid (CA), which commonly occur as components of organic compounds, to examine how carboxylic density influences Fh transformation. Results showed that Fh transformation was mediated by specific organic-mineral/ion interactions. Monocarboxylic FA exhibited minimal binding affinity and thus had negligible influence on Fh transformation. In contrast, dicarboxylic Ox interacted with Fh and dissolved Fe3+, accelerating Fh dissolution by destabilizing Fe–O bonds of Fh and lowering aqueous Fe3+ activity. During subsequent nucleation, Ox preferentially adsorbed onto nascent hematite (Hm) nuclei via bidentate-mononuclear complexation. This interaction reduced Hm surface energy from 330 to 180 mJ·m–2, increasing nucleation rate ∼70-fold compared to goethite (Gt). Moreover, Ox likely guided Hm growth via oriented attachment, probably driven by van der Waals forces and/or patch-charge attraction. Conversely, tricarboxylic CA strongly bound to Fh, stabilizing Fh against transformation.

This study aimed to develop and validate the first physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for iHg, incorporating species-specific physiological and chemical parameters to better characterize iHg kinetics in mice, rats, and humans. We included a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to address the complex nature of iHg toxicokinetics. It facilitated parameter estimation while characterizing uncertainty and variability using an extensive species-specific iHg toxicokinetic database. Our results show narrower posterior distributions for most parameters across species, suggesting reduced uncertainty compared to prior distributions. Additionally, posterior estimates for absorption and excretion somewhat differ between humans and rodents, pointing to species-specific differences. The geometric standard deviations of the estimated residual errors typically remained below 3, indicating that the model fits the experimental data adequately.

We find that the rate of watershed mercury inputs from dry deposition, wet deposition, and litterfall significantly decreased over the monitoring record (2003–2021), but the watershed continued to accumulate mercury by 25.2 ± 2.8 μg m–2 yr–1 (mean ± interannual SD). Annual fluxes of total mercury from the major tributary inflow to Arbutus Lake declined early in the record (−3.3% yr–1, 2005–2010) but have increased more recently (1.8% yr–1, 2015–2019), possibly in response to changing climate and soil chemistry. No significant trends were observed in the net total or methylmercury loading to Arbutus Lake, nor in fish mercury concentrations in nearby lakes.

We exposed juvenile coho salmon to roadway runoff or 6PPD-quinone to investigate whether disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–gill barrier cause behavioral symptoms of urban runoff mortality syndrome in this sensitive species. BBB disruption was present in one-third of presymptomatic fish and in all symptomatic individuals, supporting its role in toxicity. Co-occurring brain and gill barrier disruptions at the onset of sustained surface swimming suggest a systemic vascular response rather than localized brain injury. Histological analysis of coho brains revealed red blood cell congestion within intact endothelia, consistent with circulatory collapse and plasma leakage, likely impairing oxygen delivery and disrupting neuronal signaling. Behavioral symptoms also coincided with altered expression of BBB junctional proteins genes (ocln, cld5α, and vecad). In Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), exposure to a high but environmentally relevant concentration of 6PPD-quinone reduced expression of the scaffolding protein zo-1, suggesting potential sublethal effects.

Notable matrix effects are anticipated to arise from poor retention and coelution with abundant salts in PM samples. Here, we systematically evaluated RPLC versus hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with ESI-Orbitrap MS in quantifying PM-bound C2–3OSs. We synthesized three C2–3OSs, including glycolic acid sulfate, hydroxyacetone sulfate, and lactic acid sulfate. The availability of authentic standards enabled the first quantitative assessment of measurement bias for C2–3OSs using the RPLC-ESI-Orbitrap MS method, revealing an underestimation of these compounds by 1–2 orders of magnitude. The measurement bias primarily stemmed from the matrix effects arising from the coexisting bisulfate in ambient PM. In contrast, HILIC notably outperformed RPLC in retentive capacities and peak resolving abilities, effectively avoiding matrix suppression effects.

This study investigated the transformation of Fh nanoparticle film across a continuum of sizes of pore-scale spaces created by pressing a glass bead onto the film and immersing in 2 mM and 10 mM FeSO4 at pH = 7.0. While lepidocrocite (Lp) dominated over goethite (Gt) on the static Fh film, both minerals were observed to preferentially precipitate in micropore regions adjacent to the Fh film–glass bead contact area. The natural logarithm of product formation rates decreased linearly as increasing pore height (h) from 5 to 600 μm, revealing pronounced kinetic inhibition in macropore regions. Product mineral particles in smaller pore regions exhibited reduced primary particle size (146.1 ± 57.6 nm at h = 0.11 μm) compared with those in larger pores (222.5 ± 61.8 nm at h = 561.84 μm). COMSOL-based reaction-diffusion modeling shows that rapid Fe(III)labile intermediate supply from Fe(II)-catalyzed Fh dissolution drives its localized accumulation and elevated supersaturation within confined micropores, which ultimately dictates the pore-size-dependent distribution, formation kinetics, and primary particle size of the resulting product minerals. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the dominant role of intermediate precursor supply in dictating confinement-regulated phase transformation and highlight the notable effects of micropore size on Fh transformation and element cycling in natural porous media."

Historical manufacturing and disposal of PFAS have led to their introduction to the environment, although only a fraction of existing PFAS are routinely monitored using targeted analysis methods. Here, nontargeted analysis was used to investigate the identity and fate of PFAS present in eight groundwater and nine surface water samples collected near St. Paul, MN, surrounding two sites that historically received wastes from a PFAS manufacturer in the 1940–1970s. A total of 210 PFAS, split across 33 different homologous series, were identified in surface and groundwater samples both at and downstream of the two waste sites. Identified compounds included perfluorinated, polyfluorinated, and unsaturated sulfonic and carboxylic acid species as well as a variety of sulfonamide and sulfonamido chemistries. PFAS measured downgradient included legacy perfluorinated sulfonic and carboxylic acids, as well as their polyfluorinated, unsaturated, keto, and ether-containing analogs. Two-thirds of the identified PFAS were unique to the groundwater at one site. The lack of these PFAS at downstream sites likely reflects dilution below the limit of detection during downgradient transport. The identified species reveal previously unknown and substantial ongoing contamination of the watershed due to historic PFAS manufacturing and waste disposal."

This study presents the first record of Hg concentrations (HgC) and accumulation rates (HgAR) using sediment cores from four lakes around Mount Lyell. HgC and HgAR increased from the 1890s (onset of smelting), peaked from the 1920s (introduction of the flotation processing method), and declined after 1969 (smelter closure). Mercury isotopic signatures confirmed its anthropogenic source. Modeling of Hg deposition vs distance over the period 1922–1969 showed that it followed a power-law function. The Mount Lyell emissions may have affected an area up to ∼270,000 km2, beyond which deposition was indistinguishable from the natural background. Estimated total Hg loadings ranged from 23 to 43 t, compared to an estimated ∼150 t Hg contained in the ore floated. Isotopic data showed Δ199Hg trending toward zero near the smelter, indicating that the smelter was the main source of Hg. Our findings highlight that pyrometallurgical smelting methods contributed more significantly to Hg emissions than production volume. Studying legacy mines in the Southern Hemisphere, responsible for 29.1% of global Cu production during the preregulatory era (1880–1950), is critical to understanding historical Hg dispersion in this understudied region."

We examined UFP concentrations and size distribution across 32 particle diameters at a monitoring site in close proximity to Boston Logan International Airport across a two-year period, incorporating covariates for flight activity and meteorology. Total particle number concentration (PNC) was ∼2-fold higher when the site was downwind of the airport. During these wind conditions, particles between 8 and 12 nm in diameter comprised the largest proportion of overall PNC observed, consistent with aircraft contributions. Particle size distribution differed substantially between hours of predominant aircraft arrivals (peak modal diameter 9–11 nm) versus departures (peak modal diameter 39–52 nm). Peak concentrations of particles between 9 and 11 nm were found in the winter and during afternoon hours. We conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to confirm particle size distributions from aviation activity. PCA results showed that nucleation-mode particles (<30 nm in diameter), specifically those between 9 and 11 nm, were associated with landing aircraft on a nearby runway, especially when the monitor was downwind of the airport. Our findings confirm that aviation-specific UFP emissions are dominated by nucleation mode particles, with long-term size distribution information able to distinguish between aircraft operations in near-airport communities."

To address this gap, we established a real-world indoor renovation VOC inhalation mouse model and used an innovative ex vivo biosensor assay with endothelial cells to respond to serum derived from VOC exposed mice, exploring the adverse health outcomes of total VOCs on the aorta and its potential mechanisms. The ex vivo biosensor assay confirmed that VOCs triggered phenotypic transformation of aortic smooth muscle cells via epigenetic changes in aortic endothelial cells. Mechanistically, VOCs elevated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation by upregulating DNMT1, leading to mtDNA leakage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway. By integrating real-world indoor VOC exposure with mechanistic cellular analysis, this ex vivo biosensor assay offers a physiologically relevant model to elucidate the systemic vascular toxicity of complex environmental mixtures. Overall, this study revealed the molecular mechanism of indoor VOC-induced aortic fibrosis based on increased mtDNA methylation in aortic endothelial cells, which mediated the phenotypic transformation of aortic smooth muscle cells. mtDNA methylation may serve as a potential target for preventing aortic fibrosis or alleviating symptoms in affected patients.

We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations.

However, the sensitivity of L‐VOD to different vegetation components, such as foliage and stems, remains poorly understood despite their distinct interannual variations. Here we investigate the differential sensitivity of L‐VOD to foliage biomass and aboveground biomass (AGB) at various spatiotemporal scales over contiguous US. Our analysis reveals that at interannual scale, L‐VOD's sensitivity to foliage biomass is 4.5–16.8 times greater than to AGB across various forest types. Given that foliage biomass typically exhibits larger interannual fluctuations than woody components, this suggests that L‐VOD may overestimate the interannual variability of total AGB by disproportionately responding to foliage dynamics. Although foliage constitutes only a small fraction of total aboveground biomass (∼2%), it accounts for 21.2% of the interannual variations in L‐VOD. However, when large‐scale disturbances reduce foliage and woody biomass proportionally, VOD effectively captures the AGB declines. These findings highlight the need to account for component‐specific sensitivities in VOD‐based models."

Peak sand transport occurs during southern spring and summer to the west and southwest, driven by daytime anabatic slope winds originating from Hellas. Migration rates decline with waning temperatures, when eastward drainage winds into Hellas dominate nights annually and during the colder seasons.

On the interannual scale, surface and subsurface events demonstrate an opposite correlation with ENSO, primarily due to distinct drivers at different depths. During the developing phase of El Niño, the Luzon Strait transport, indicative of the SCS throughflow (SCSTF), increases and necessitates stronger upwelling for mass balance. This upwelling, acting on large subsurface vertical temperature gradients, induces significant subsurface cooling and the occurrence of MCSs. As El Niño matures, excessive atmospheric heat flux warms the surface layer, triggering surface MHWs. This heat is then transported downward mainly by vertical turbulent mixing, diminishing subsurface cooling, and terminating subsurface MCSs. The scenario reverses during La Niña events. The SCSTF serves as a vital oceanic pathway, transmitting ENSO signals into the SCS and profoundly modulating subsurface MHWs and MCSs."

A pre‐existing east–west arc just south of the site began beading from the west, evolving into curls and then spirals while extending eastward, initiating a substorm expansion within ∼2 min. The vortices were seen in all four wavelengths at 427.8, 557.7, 630.0, and 1100.0 nm, indicating a ∼200 km‐tall cylinder spanning 100–300 km altitude. Vortex dimensions were ∼30 × 40 km (east–west × north–south). Estimated average energy and energy flux were 4–6 keV and 30–40 mW/m2. The auroral morphology suggests that a remote shear force triggered the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, generating local vortices that rolled up the magnetic flux like coiling a carpet.

Therefore, assessing their fidelity in reproducing the extreme rainfall characteristics in historical simulation is critical. We evaluated CMIP6 models' performance in reproducing the climatology of daily extremes, focusing on the global land monsoon (GLM) domain that feeds two‐thirds of the world's population. Compared with ERA5, models demonstrate a significant wet bias in GLM domain for the annual maximum daily precipitation (14.14%) and the extreme tail of daily precipitation distributions (32.53%), more than twice the global average. Decomposition of biases reveals that dynamic processes, particularly vertical velocity, primarily drive these biases. Using the quasi‐geostrophic ω $\omega $ equation, we determined that the component associated with large‐scale adiabatic disturbances (ωD ${\omega }_{D}$) mainly drives vertical velocity biases, with diabatic heating term amplifying them. Furthermore, a significant correlation between ωD ${\omega }_{D}$ biases and baroclinicity biases in midlatitude suggests that baroclinicity biases are a key contributor to the vertical velocity biases."

Here, we constrain the apparent silicon isotope (δ30Si) fractionation associated with early diagenesis by measuring δ30Si signatures of pore fluids and authigenic phases in a South Atlantic sediment core. The δ30Si offsets between authigenic phases and pore fluids vary between −2.9 and −0.4‰, supporting a substantial negative δ30Si fractionation during early diagenesis. The variable apparent δ30Si fractionation covaries with the amount of sedimentary lithogenic materials and may be attributable to the associated kinetic effects.

We analyze China's long‐term precipitation changes using four observational data sets and CMIP6 simulations, with percentage precipitation anomaly as a key metric. Through optimal fingerprinting detection, we identify anthropogenic signals in China's mean precipitation changes. Results reveal an increasing trend in annual precipitation across most regions since the 1960s, which CMIP6 models generally capture, though large inter‐model discrepancies persist in simulating trends in southern China. Human influence on China's mean precipitation changes is detectable and separable from natural forcings.

The Okavango Rift Zone (ORZ) is in the early stages of rifting and magmatic activity and thus is an ideal locale to study this relationship. We examine the relationship using two primary crustal structure parameters: crustal thickness and average Vp/Vs ratio obtained from receiver functions. Our large Vp/Vs estimates indicate the existence of melts within the crust of the ORZ. Comparing our results with those of other continental rifts, we identify a quantitative relationship between rifting and crustal melt fraction. Additionally, the comparative analysis suggests that melts within a rift crust are introduced only when the stretching magnitude reaches that of the ORZ. We also propose a model suggesting that with the progression of rifting, melts would be introduced into the crust and increased gradually, potentially triggering rift‐related volcanism."

To reduce this bias, the response of QBO bias to the convection scheme in an AGCM is investigated using different convection schemes (Emanuel and spectral schemes) and a gravity wave (GW) scheme in which the GW properties are estimated from convective heating and mean wind. Unlike the known QBO bias in previous model intercomparison studies, the easterly wind and QBO amplitude in the lower stratosphere are excessively magnified when the Emanuel scheme is used. The spectral scheme reproduces similar known QBO biases, such as the mean westerly wind bias and the weak QBO amplitude in the lower stratosphere. To distinguish the cause of these biases, several sensitivity experiments using the spectral scheme with tunings are conducted. Application of several tunings mitigates the common QBO biases near the 50 hPa level. The zonal wind bias in the troposphere controls the GW and consequently the QBO properties. Further investigation reveals that improved convective momentum transport with phase speed tuning reduces the zonal wind bias and improved the QBO through modified GW momentum fluxes. The findings of this study may be applicable to other AGCMs if the tunings related to the convection scheme are adopted, potentially reducing zonal wind biases."

In this study, we calculate the SWV radiative feedback in the CMIP6 model ensemble in a quadrupling CO2 experiment. Specifically, we compare the results of two quantifications: one accounting for the radiatively driven temperature adjustment in the stratosphere only and the other in the entire atmospheric column including both the stratosphere and the troposphere. The stratosphere‐adjusted feedback is found to be 0.25±0.06Wm−2K−1 $0.25\mathit{\pm }0.06\ \mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}{\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$, but it reduces to 0.020±0.007Wm−2K−1 $0.020\mathit{\pm }0.007\ \mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}{\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$ with the full atmosphere adjustment, indicating the radiation process alone may lead to a muted overall SWV radiative effect, due to the stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming simultaneously driven by the SWV radiative perturbation. This suggests that the radiative forcing of SWV is subject to an intrinsic and robust limiting effect. In addition, we analyze the intermodel spreads in the temperature adjustment and its radiative effect, and find the spreads primarily arise from the differences in SWV responses projected by GCMs, rather than the differences in their climatological states."

The analysis focuses on the meteorological drought measured by the 24‐month standardized precipitation index (SPI24). The results show that anthropogenic aerosols and GHGs have distinct effects on Asian drought trends. Aerosols dominate the drying trend in East Asia, whereas GHGs drive the wetting trend in Central Asia. In South Asia, their impacts tend to offset each other with aerosols playing a larger role. Moisture budget analysis indicates that the changes in the vertical motion are the primary drivers of drought changes in Asia. Aerosols‐induced stronger cooling of midlatitude continents reduces the land‐sea thermal contrast, which in turn weakens the summer monsoon circulation and suppresses precipitation over South and East Asia. Conversely, GHG‐induced strengthening of the westerly jet stream contributes to the alleviation of drought in Central Asia. Both the cooling effect of aerosols and warming effect of GHGs are stronger in the Norther Hemisphere, leading to an asymmetric change between the two hemispheres and causing a meridional shift of intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which influences drought changes in South Asia."

 The ability of materials to respond to stimuli with significant optical nonlinearity is crucial for technological advancement and innovation1–3. Although photon-avalanche upconversion nanomaterials with nonlinearities exceeding 60 have been developed, further enhancement remains challenging4–6. Here we present a method to increase photon-avalanche nonlinearity beyond 500 by reconstructing the sublattice and extending the avalanche network. We demonstrate that lutetium substitution in the host material induces significant local crystal field distortions. These distortions strengthen cross-relaxation, the key process governing population accumulation. As a result, the optical nonlinearity is significantly amplified, enabling sub-diffraction imaging through single-beam scanning microscopy, achieving lateral and axial resolutions of 33 nm (about 1/32 of λExc) and 80 nm (around 1/13 of λExc), respectively (where λExc is the excitation wavelength). Moreover, our research shows regional differentiation within photon-avalanche nanocrystals, in which photon-avalanche performance varies across different regions at the single-nanoparticle level. This effect, coupled with extreme optical nonlinearity, enables visualization of nanoemitters at resolutions beyond their physical size using simple instrumentation. These advancements open new possibilities for super-resolution imaging, ultra-sensitive sensing, on-chip optical switching and infrared quantum counting.

 Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes1. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents2,3. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.

 Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1.

However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood.

We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5. In a mouse model, maternal obesity during pregnancy can lead to fatty liver disease in the offspring, driven by aberrant developmental programming of Kuppfer cells."

 Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is a primary sensor for short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota. Consequently, FFA2 is a promising drug target for immunometabolic disorders1–4. Here we report cryogenic electronic microscopy structures of FFA2 in complex with two G proteins and three distinct classes of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), and describe noncanonical activation mechanisms that involve conserved structural features of class A GPCRs. Two PAMs disrupt the E/DRY activation microswitch5 and stabilize the conformation of intracellular loop 2 by binding to lipid-facing pockets near the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. By contrast, the third PAM promotes the separation of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 by interacting with transmembrane helix 6 at the receptor–lipid interface. Molecular dynamic simulations and mutagenesis experiments confirm these noncanonical activation mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular basis for the Gi versus Gq bias, which is due to distinct conformations of intracellular loop 2 stabilized by different PAMs. These findings provide a framework for the design of tailored GPCR modulators, with implications that extend beyond FFA2 to the broader field of GPCR drug discovery. Structural, pharmacological and computational studies reveal how different classes of positive allosteric modulators bind to distinct allosteric sites and use noncanonical mechanisms to activate the free-fatty acid receptor FFA2."

 The pursuit of strong yet ductile alloys has been ongoing for centuries. However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature. The few that do are mostly ultra-strong steels1–3; however, their stress–strain curves exhibit plateaus and serrations because their tensile flow suffers from plastic instability (such as Lüders strains)1–4, and the elongation is pseudo-uniform at best. Here we report that a group of carefully engineered multi-principal-element alloys, with a composition of Fe35Ni29Co21Al12Ta3 designed by means of domain knowledge-informed machine learning, can be processed to reach an unprecedented range of simultaneously high strength and ductility. An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L12 nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation. A new group of multi-principal-element alloys, designed through machine learning and extreme microstructural heterogeneities, achieve high strength (1.8-GPa yield strength) and ductility (25% uniform elongation) at room temperature."

 Climate change threatens global food systems1, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial2. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7–9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.

 The microbiota has been recognized as a critical contributor to various diseases1, with multiple reports of changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in contexts such as inflammatory bowel disease2,3 and neurodegenerative diseases4. These microbial shifts can exert systemic effects by altering the release of specific metabolites into the bloodstream5,6, and the gastrointestinal microbiota has also been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory activity through the activation of innate and adaptive immunity7,8. However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (Tcomm cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated Tcomm cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of Tcomm cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.

 Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease1,2. Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor targeting PurF, the first enzyme in the mycobacterial de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The lead candidate, JNJ-6640, exhibited nanomolar bactericidal activity in vitro. Comprehensive genetic and biochemical approaches confirmed that JNJ-6640 was highly selective for mycobacterial PurF. Single-cell-level microscopy demonstrated a downstream effect on DNA replication. We determined the physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleobases in human and mouse lung tissue, showing that these levels were insufficient to salvage PurF inhibition. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using a long-acting injectable formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the compound. Finally, we show that inclusion of JNJ-6640 could have a crucial role in improving current treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Together, we demonstrate that JNJ-6640 is a promising chemical lead and that targeting de novo purine biosynthesis represents a novel strategy for tuberculosis drug development.

 Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems1–3. Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development4. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization.

Enhanced particle adhesion increases the filtration of airborne particulates while maintaining air permeability, providing longer filter lifetime and increased energy savings. Moreover, strong adhesion of the captured particles enables effective filtration under high-speed airflow as well as suppression of particle redispersion.

 Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited—a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer1,2. At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator3–5, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth’s known magnetic sense4), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth’s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth’s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.

 All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka)1–9. By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10–15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.

 Distant-acting enhancers are central to human development1. However, our limited understanding of their functional sequence features prevents the interpretation of enhancer mutations in disease2. Here we determined the functional sensitivity to mutagenesis of human developmental enhancers in vivo. Focusing on seven enhancers that are active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1,700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-base-pair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modelling, we annotated critical nucleotides at the base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes in in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks. Taken together, our results reveal that human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function and provide a rich resource for further exploration of human enhancer logic.

 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure. Recent studies have begun to detail the molecular biology of PTSD. However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identified so far1, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profile the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specific manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinflammation. We further validated these findings using cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics, confirming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specific context. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting effects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex.

 Modern colour image sensors face challenges in further improving sensitivity and image quality because of inherent limitations in light utilization efficiency1. A major factor contributing to these limitations is the use of passive optical filters, which absorb and dissipate a substantial amount of light, thereby reducing the efficiency of light capture2. On the contrary, active optical filtering in Foveon-type vertically stacked architectures still struggles to deliver optimal performance owing to their lack of colour selectivity, making them inefficient for precise colour imaging3. Here we introduce an innovative architecture for colour sensor arrays that uses multilayer monolithically stacked lead halide perovskite thin-film photodetectors. Perovskite bandgap tunability4 is utilized to selectively absorb the visible light spectrum’s red, green and blue regions, eliminating the need for colour filters. External quantum efficiencies of 50%, 47% and 53% are demonstrated for the red, green and blue channels, respectively, as well as a colour accuracy of 3.8% in ΔELab outperforming the state-of-the-art colour-filter array and Foveon-type photosensors. The image sensor design improves light utilization in colour sensors and paves the way for the next generation of highly sensitive, artefact-free images with enhanced colour fidelity.

R9AP silencing or knockout, R9AP-derived peptide and R9AP monoclonal antibody each significantly inhibit, whereas R9AP overexpression promotes, EBV uptake into both cell types. R9AP binds directly to the EBV glycoprotein gH/gL complex to initiate gH/gL–gB-mediated membrane fusion. Notably, the interaction of R9AP with gH/gL is inhibited by the highly competitive gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1, which blocks EBV epithelial and B cell entry. Moreover, R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with EBV gp42–human leukocyte antigen class II or gH/gL–EPHA2 complexes in B cells or epithelial cells, respectively. We propose R9AP as the crucial common receptor of B cells and epithelial cells and a potential prophylactic and vaccine target for EBV. R9AP is a key receptor for entry of Epstein–Barr virus into human epithelial and B cells, and interacts directly with the viral glycoprotein gH/gL complex to mediate virus–host membrane fusion."

 Equitable coverage and reliable operation of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are crucial for a just transition to a carbon-free future. Yet, a comprehensive national analysis of public EVCSs across different communities is lacking in the United States. Here, we utilize real-world reviews (n = 470,142) from a user-generated content platform to analyze public EVCSs at the census tract level. We find that disadvantaged communities (DACs) have 64% fewer public EVCSs per capita than non-DACs. This disparity rises to 73% when considering renters in multi-dwelling units. Additionally, EVCS users in DACs and urban areas experience significantly more reliability issues compared to those in non-DACs and rural areas, primarily related to hardware and technical failures. Given the limited access to home charging in DACs and their underserved public infrastructure, these findings highlight critical equity concerns and call for targeted investment in EVCS infrastructure and reliability improvements, particularly in DACs.

 Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels and invaluable tools for optogenetic applications. Recent developments in multicolor optogenetics, in which different neurons are controlled by multiple colors of light simultaneously, have increased the demand for ChR mutants with more distant absorption wavelengths.

The structure elucidates the 6-s-cis configuration of the retinal chromophore, indicating its contribution to a distinctive blue shift in action spectra. The unique architecture of the C-terminal region reveals its role in the allosteric modulation of channel kinetics, enhancing our understanding of its functional dynamics. Employing a rational approach, we developed mutants with blue-shifted action spectra. Finally, we confirm that UV or deep-blue light can activate KnChR-transfected precultured neurons, expanding its utility in optogenetic applications.

 Montane birds represent a large proportion of global avian biodiversity and are highly sensitive to seasonal climatic shifts. Many montane species undertake elevational migration in response to seasonal climate change, but how they cope with disparate environmental pressures along the elevational gradient is poorly understood. Here, we investigate phenotypic plasticity in two closely related elevational migrants that differ in their seasonal movements (small-scale vs. large-scale elevational migrants). Through common-garden experiments with adult male birds of these species, we compared gene and protein expression plasticity in response to changes in temperature and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). The small-scale elevational migrant exhibited greater plasticity in response to changes in temperature, and the large-scale elevational migrant exhibited greater plasticity in response to changes in PO2. These findings correspond to annual variation in environmental conditions experienced by each species, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may co-vary with the seasonal elevational distributions of these elevational migrants.

This study describes how the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 protects genome stability by preventing premature TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination. 
 The eukaryotic replisome, which consists of the CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase, replicative polymerases, and several accessory factors, sometimes encounters proteinaceous obstacles that threaten genome integrity. These obstacles are targeted for removal or proteolysis by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP, which associates with the replisome. However, TRAIP must be carefully regulated to avoid inappropriate ubiquitylation and disassembly of the replisome. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. Furthermore, TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37’s response to topological stress. We propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.

Here, the authors show that blocking ribosomal RNA production by rapid depletion of RNase MRP induces a long-lasting quiescence-like state in human cells. 
 Cellular quiescence is a state of reversible proliferative arrest that plays essential roles in development, resistance to stress, aging, and longevity of organisms. Here we report that rapid depletion of RNase MRP, a deeply conserved RNA-based enzyme required for rRNA biosynthesis, induces a long-term yet reversible proliferative arrest in human cells. Severely compromised biogenesis of rRNAs along with acute transcriptional reprogramming precede a gradual decline of the critical cellular functions. Unexpectedly, many arresting cells show increased levels of histone mRNAs, which accumulate locally in the cytoplasm, and S-phase DNA amount. The ensuing proliferative arrest is entered from multiple stages of the cell cycle and can last for several weeks with uncompromised cell viability. Strikingly, restoring expression of RNase MRP leads to a complete reversal of the arrested state with resumed cell proliferation at the speed of control cells. We suggest that targeting rRNA biogenesis may provide a general strategy for rapid induction of a reversible proliferative arrest, with implications for understanding and manipulating cellular quiescence.

 Steroidal alkaloids play a crucial role in plant defense and exhibit distinct stereochemistry at C25, forming either the tomato-type (25S) or eggplant-type (25R) isomers. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanisms shaping this stereochemical diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM 8 (GAME8) cytochrome P450 hydroxylases across the Solanaceae family revealed two distinct clades producing either 25S or 25R isomers. Ancestral GAME8 likely favored 25R, with gene duplications giving rise to 25S-producing enzymes in more recent Solanum species. In S. nigrum and S. dulcamara, multiple GAME8 copies generate mixed isomeric profiles. Notably, in wild S. cheesmaniae from the Galápagos, mutations in GAME8 have driven a shift from 25S back to the ancestral 25R, suggesting reverse evolution. Our findings highlight how GAME8 evolution has shaped alkaloid diversity in the genus Solanum, demonstrating a complex interplay between enzyme function, genetic variation, and evolutionary adaptation.

 Aircraft emissions of (ultra)fine particles during landing and take-off operations pose increasing human health hazards for airport employees and near-airport communities. Measurements of in-operation aircraft are therefore crucial for characterizing real-world aircraft emissions, and their variability. In this work, we develop an approach that enables the gathering of large quantities of data on real-world aircraft-specific emissions. We use three types of portable PM sensors located ca. 200 m downwind of an operational runway at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, over different seasons, to characterize the plumes from ca. 500 specific operations covering most aircraft types of the global flying fleet. High concentration peaks (in the order of 106 particles/cm3) of sub-25 nm particles are observed in the near field. While departure plumes exhibit higher particle number concentrations than arrival plumes, the values do not necessarily scale with aircraft size or engine thrust rating. We find large variability among aircraft types and engine models, highlighting the importance of incorporating real-world observations when assessing the impacts of aviation on the atmospheric composition and human health."

 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects sea surface temperatures (SSTs) around the world with varying degrees of influence. Dynamical understanding of global SST responses to ENSO has progressed substantially, but is far from complete. We propose a novel modelling approach, and use it to investigate why SSTs along Australia’s southeast coast are modulated by ENSO much less strongly than along Australia’s west coast. Combining tropical Pacific pacemaker ensemble simulations and ocean model perturbation experiments, this modelling approach identifies and compares the contributions of different mechanisms for the two regions. Off Australia’s west coast, the strong ENSO signature in SST variability is dominated by remote tropical Pacific ENSO-driven wind stress forcing via oceanic teleconnections, with smaller contributions from non-ENSO climate variability. However, off the southeast coast, the contribution from remote tropical Pacific ENSO-driven wind stress forcing is largely offset by the thermodynamic ENSO-driven buoyancy forcing locally within the Coral and Tasman Sea. This resultant weak ENSO signature in SST is further weakened by non-ENSO climate variability."

 Anthropogenic land use and land cover changes (LULCC) have profound impacts on land water availability, defined as precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET), through biophysical pathways. However, such impacts have long been debated mostly due to either the inadequate consideration of the atmospheric feedbacks arising from the changes in circulations and background climate in observation-based studies or unrealistic representation of historical LULCC in idealized-simulation-based studies. To overcome these limitations, we use the latest simulations from multiple Earth system models to investigate the impacts of historical (1850–2014) and future (2015–2100) LULCC on P–ET. Here we show that historical LULCC caused an insignificant reduction in global P–ET, mainly in wet regions. Locally, P–ET tends to decrease (increase) in deforestation (reforestation) regions mainly due to the dominant role of precipitation. Approximately 3.8% of the global land area (5.1 Mkm2) even has experienced opposite regime shifts, in which negative (positive) P–ET becomes positive (negative). Under a medium-to-high warming scenario, however, reforestation is projected to decrease P–ET even over reforested areas. This study not only elucidates the hydrological effects of realistic LULCC with atmospheric feedbacks being fully considered, but also highlights that the relative importance of the local effects and atmospheric feedbacks varies with background climate changes. We stress that background climate changes and feedbacks due to LULCC should be considered when planning reforestation and other land-use policies."

 The Tibetan Plateau, known as Asian water tower, plays a crucial role in regional water cycles and climate. However, limited in-situ cloud observations have hindered a comprehensive understanding of cloud microphysical processes over this region. To address this, a ground-based in-situ experiment was conducted in the southern Tibetan Plateau (STP) to investigate aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions. Utilizing extensive microphysical measurements of aerosols and clouds, this study derived in-cloud water vapor supersaturation (SS) and examined its role in aerosol activation and cloud development. Results revealed that orographic clouds over the STP exhibit notably high SS levels, with an average SS of 0.36% and cloud case mean SS ranging from 0.1% to 1.27%. Such high SS compensates for the low hygroscopicity of Aitken-mode aerosols, facilitating their activation into cloud droplets. The resulting microphysical changes include increased droplet number concentrations, broader droplet spectra, and enhanced cloud liquid water content, which could promote collision-coalescence processes and precipitation formation. Moreover, these SS-induced microphysical changes may enhance cloud albedo and influence regional radiative forcing, potentially impacting atmospheric circulation and monsoon dynamics over the Tibetan Plateau. These findings highlight the critical role of high SS in cloud formation under conditions of weak aerosol activation potential, offering new insights into orographic cloud processes in high-altitude environments."

 Fundamental ecological questions about the distribution of ocean life remain unanswered, hindering both the effective management of the ocean, and our comprehension of life on this planet. The benthic and pelagic realms are subject to different methods of study, and to understand where to best focus effort, a thorough understanding of existing information is required, allowing identification of critical knowledge gaps. Open-access data repositories provide a valuable means to identify such gaps; however, these repositories are subject to challenges in separating benthic from pelagic data. Here we demonstrate an automated data pipeline for extracting and separating benthic from pelagic data in open-access repositories. By stratifying data against essential ocean variables in a critical gap analysis, we show that large spatial and taxonomic biases exist in both the benthic and pelagic global datasets, favouring depths shallower than ~100 m, the northern hemisphere, and vertebrate species. The newly compiled, cleaned, and classified dataset is used to identify areas of chronic under sampling and high-priority regions for exploration. We argue that coordinated strategic prioritisation of sampling is needed to support modelling and prediction, enabling us to better manage our oceans and comprehend life on Earth.

 The ratio of soil heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration (Rh/Rs) is critical for soil carbon pool stability and atmosphere-biosphere exchanges, yet its spatiotemporal dynamics and responses to environmental drivers remain poorly constrained. Here, we estimate global soil and heterotrophic respiration by integrating ground observations with machine learning models. From 1980 to 2022, annual increases reached 0.76 and 0.54 g C m⁻² yr⁻² for soil and heterotrophic respiration, respectively. Globally, Rh/Rs averaged 61.30 ± 0.54% with a decadal rise of 0.13%. Rising soil temperature enhances Rh/Rs, while soil moisture suppresses it, exhibiting stronger global-scale influence. Temperature dominates Rh/Rs regulation in forests and shrublands, whereas moisture controls this ratio in grasslands and croplands. These findings elucidate ecosystem-specific mechanisms governing Rh/Rs dynamics, advancing predictions of soil carbon-climate feedbacks essential for carbon neutrality strategies.

 Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important.

 Sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide in the Southern Ocean is strongly seasonal, with ocean uptake in summer, which is partly offset by carbon dioxide outgassing in winter. This seasonal balance can shift due to sea ice conditions, inducing interannual variability in the Southern Ocean carbon sink. A decade (2010–2020) of unique, year-round marine carbonate chemistry observations from the Rothera Time Series (West Antarctic Peninsula) reveals that interannual variability in seawater fugacity of carbon dioxide depends on wintertime processes. Sea ice duration controls ocean stratification, which acts as a gateway to the carbon-rich ocean interior. Consequently, years with persistent sea ice cover and high mean winter stratification absorb, on average, 20% more carbon dioxide than years with less sea ice and weaker stratification in winter. Wintertime marine observations are therefore essential to resolve critical processes and reliably quantify interannual variability of the sea-air carbon dioxide flux in seasonally sea ice-covered regions.

 Extreme states of the North Atlantic Oscillation in summer can lead to severe weather events such as heatwaves and floods in Europe. But how these extremes evolve in response to climate change remains unexplored. Here we show that the statistical distribution of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index grows wider with increasing global warming in large ensembles of climate change simulations as well as reanalysis data. Such an amplified variability of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation caused by global warming leads to a higher probability of summer North Atlantic Oscillation extremes — for both positive and negative phases — accompanied by an amplification of their impacts on surface temperature over northwestern Europe.

 Grounded ice cliffs in Antarctica contribute directly to global sea level rise through calving, yet they are less studied compared to floating ice shelves. Traditional satellite remote sensing methods face limitations in temporal and spatial resolution for monitoring these small-scale calving events. This research aims to develop a method for fine-scale monitoring of grounded ice cliff calving using multi-temporal UAV photogrammetry without ground control points, with assistance from in-situ snow pit measurements. The methodology involves co-aligning UAV images to create consistent 3D models, followed by detecting calving events based on significant local volume changes between successive models. Noise filtering strategies were implemented to exclude outliers, and calving volume and mass were calculated using measurements of snow depth and density. Our method was conducted near the China’s Qinling Station on Inexpressible Island in Victoria Land, East Antarctica, and achieved a co-alignment accuracy of 2.69 cm. Over a 26-day observation period with 10 repeated flights, 44 calving events were identified along the coastline of 0.89 km, resulting in a total calving volume of 4506.69 m3 and a mass of 3078.45 tons.

The results indicate that: (1) The synoptic pattern during this precipitation process followed a typical cold-season elevated thunderstorm structure, extending from upper layers to the surface. Strong echo height exceeding the −20 °C layer was the main reason for the formation of ice-phase particles and lightning. (2) Precipitation particles displayed different size-distribution models and disparate phases during the diverse precipitation stages. During the initial stage, the particle size distribution displayed a single-peak pattern, primarily composed of drizzle and ice pellets. In the development stage, the size distribution showed both single-peak and multi-peak patterns, with particles including freezing rain, graupel, and small ice crystals. During the subsequent stable snowfall stage, the precipitation was mainly consisted of various morphological ice crystals, graupel, and wet snow particles dominated by small solid particles with a diameter less than 1 mm, the peak number concentration was 0.69 mm in diameter, and their terminal velocities were stable at 1 m s−1.

Each source influences individuals based on their credibility, the veracity of the article, and the individual’s characteristics.

We found that fenpropathrin-resistant female mites (YN-FeR, with target resistance: F1538Ikdrmutation) exhibited significantly enhanced adaptability to various stress conditions, including exposure to different acaricides and high-temperature (34°C) and low-humidity environments (40% relative humidity). This evolution was attributed to cuticle thickening in resistant female mites. Cuticle proteinCPR25was identified as a critical gene mediating cuticle thickening.CPR25regulated its own overexpression by producing a circular RNA, namedcircCPR25, which acted as a decoy to selectively sequester and bind to the miR-34~317 cluster. This study revealed a distinctive mechanism underlying the evolution of stress resistance in spider mites. Specifically, a cuticle protein in spider mites regulates its own overexpression by producing a decoy circRNA, thereby promoting cuticle thickening and facilitating rapid adaptation to adverse conditions."

However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of ASNS in breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) are not well understood. Our study revealed that the family with sequence similarity 50 member A (FAM50A) gene substantially modulates the brain metastatic potential of breast cancer by up-regulating ASNS and promoting asparagine biosynthesis. We demonstrated that FAM50A forms a complex with chromosome 9 open reading frame 78 (C9ORF78), specifically at the S121 residue, to enhance ASNS transcription. This interaction accelerates the rate of ASNS-mediated asparagine synthesis, which is essential in facilitating metastatic cascades to the brain. From a therapeutic perspective, both the genetic suppression of FAM50A and pharmacological inhibition of asparagine synthesis effectively counteract BCBM. Our results highlight the importance of the FAM50A-ASNS signaling pathway in BCBM therapy."

In this study, we demonstrate an effective orbital gating of prototypical alkanethiol–based molecules with deeper orbital levels in vertical large-area mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) configuration that offers enhanced electrical bias stability and gating efficiency. By using ion gel gating in Au-molecule-graphene junction, the channel conductance could be modulated notably according to a clear transition from direct tunneling to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regime. The mixed SAM molecular transistors also showed a superior gating efficiency due to the suppressed field screening effect by the net molecular dipole.

We found that effector CfEC92 fromC. fructicolaspecifically binds ATP through an unidentified ATP-binding domain, leading to changes in the protein secondary structure. The residues Cys26, Asn38, and Cys39were critical for ATP binding with CfEC92, and mutations at these sites impaired the ability to suppress host immunity. CfEC92 interacted with MdNDPK2, a negative immune regulator in apple. The CfEC92-ATP complex altered the conformation of MdNDPK2, enhancing its affinity for ATP, and further increasing its autophosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated MdNDPK2 phosphorylated MdMPK3 to suppress host immunity. Homology and functional tests showed that the Cx11NC motif was highly conserved amongColletotrichumspecies, suggesting that CNC effectors represent a class of broad-spectrum virulence factors.

Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified the Zinc Finger CCCH-Type Containing 4 protein (ZC3H4), a suppressor of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) production, as a pivotal player in this system. Experimentally, ZC3H4 deficiency led to increased DNA damage, abnormal mitosis, and cellular senescence. Biochemical analysis and super-resolution microscopy revealed that the loss of ZC3H4 increased replication stress (RS)—a major driver of genome instability—by inducing a hypertranscription state that promoted R loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), both of which drive RS. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that ZC3H4 preferentially binds to genomic regions prone to TRCs and R loops, where it suppresses ncRNA bursts, functioning as part of the Restrictor complex. Our findings identify ZC3H4 as a crucial factor in maintaining genome integrity, strategically positioned at the critical intersection of DNA and RNA synthesis."

The interaction between the disordered amino-terminal domain of PXN and the carboxyl-terminal targeting domain of FAK (FAT) is necessary and sufficient for localizing FAK to focal adhesions. Furthermore, PXN serves as a platform for recruiting other proteins that together control the dynamic changes needed for cell migration and survival. Here, we show that the PXN N-domain undergoes significant compaction upon FAT binding, forming a 48-kilodalton multimodal complex with four major interconverting states. Although the complex is flexible, each state has unique sets of contacts involving disordered regions that are both highly represented in ensembles and conserved. PXN being a hub protein, the results provide a structural basis for understanding how shifts in the multistate equilibrium (e.g., through ligand binding and phosphorylation) may rewire cellular networks leading to phenotypic changes."

Thus, characteristic emergent rules of collective migration can arise from cell-cell contacts locally tweaking architecture, orchestrating self-regulation during development, wound healing, and cancer progression. TheDrosophilatestis-nascent-myotube system allows dissection of contact-dependent migration in vivo at high resolution. Here, we describe a role for the axon guidance factor Plexin A in collective cell migration: maintaining cell-cell interfaces at a precise point on the mesenchymal-to-epithelial continuum. This is crucial for testis myotubes to migrate as a continuous sheet, allowing normal sculpting-morphogenesis. Cells must maintain filopodial N-cadherin–based junctions and remain ECM-tethered near cell-cell contacts to spread while collectively moving. Our data further suggest Semaphorin 1b is a Plexin A antagonist, fine-tuning activation. This reveals a contact-dependent mechanism to maintain sheet integrity during migration, driving organ morphogenesis. This is relevant for mesenchymal organ sculpting in other migratory contexts such as angiogenesis."

In the ear, the receptor potential of presynaptic inner hair cells (IHCs) covers the entire intensity range, while postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) tile the range with their firing rate codes. IHCs vary the voltage dependence of Ca2+channel activation among their active zones (AZs), potentially diversifying SGN firing. Here, we tested this hypothesis in mice modeling the human CaV1.3A749Gmutation that causes low-voltage Ca2+channel activation. We demonstrate activation of Ca2+influx and glutamate release of IHC AZs at lower voltages, increased spontaneous firing in SGNs, and lower sound threshold of CaV1.3A749G/A749Gmice. Loss of synaptic ribbons in IHCs at ambient sound levels of mouse husbandry indicates that low-voltage Ca2+channel activation poses a risk for noise-induced synaptic damage.

We demonstrate that the RNA demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) drives glutamine reprogramming to support ccRCC growth and survival. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FTO in ccRCC cells impaired glutamine-derived reductive carboxylation, depleted pyrimidines, and increased reactive oxygen species. This led to increased DNA damage and reduced survival, which could be rescued by pyrimidine nucleobases or the antioxidantN-acetylcysteine. Mechanistically, FTO demethylates the glutamine transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) messenger RNA to promote its expression. Restoration of SLC1A5 expression in FTO-knockdown cells rescued metabolic and survival defects. FTO inhibition reduced ccRCC tumor xenograft and PDX growth under the renal capsule.

The tissue has an extraordinarily high toughness of ~100 kilojoules per square meter. Here, we investigate the origin of the toughness through mechanical tests and microscopic observations. In the tissue, crimped, long, strong collagen fibers are embedded in a soft matrix. As a crack grows in the matrix, the fibers decrimp, reorient, slip, and bridge the crack. These microscopic processes enable the fibers to transmit high tension over a long distance. Using two types of experiments, we measure the bridging traction as a function of crack separation, σ(δ). The peak traction is σ0~ 60 megapascals. The maximum separation is δ0~ 6 millimeters, two to four orders of magnitude higher than that of hard tissues. Both the high traction and large separation of the bovine pericardium contribute to its high toughness."

However, random data access usually requires additional noncoding primer DNA as indexes, which substantially reduce the physical data density. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to overcome this barrier by loading different data-encoding DNA files into porous microspheres, each distinguished by unique photonic bandgaps and diameters, allowing for 105types of indexing. With the two features as the addressing indexes, the physical separation of subsets from a diverse pool of DNA files is achieved, thereby facilitating the selective retrieval of stored data. The interconnected nanopore arrays and uniformly distributed positive charges within the microspheres enhance DNA enrichment, achieving a storage density of up to 22.6 exabytes per gram, far exceeding that of previous random access storage methods.

An optimized chemical synthesis enabled preparation of diverse IAPP glycoforms with complex glycan structures, allowing systematic evaluation of their effects on aggregation, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Sialylated glycans at Thr30completely inhibited IAPP aggregation, eliminated cytotoxicity toward pancreatic β cells, and enhanced solubility by up to 280-fold.

Until now, measurements have been obtained either destructively or directly in the field. Here, we present a novel, affordable, and easy-to-use approach to measure the stable isotope signatures of soil water. Our gas bag approach demonstrates a high accuracy and extends usability by allowing water vapor samples to be collected and stored in the field without the need for an instrument or a permanent power supply. 
 Water-stable isotopes are commonly used in hydrological and ecological research. Until now, most measurements of soil or plant water isotopes have been made by taking a sample from the field and extracting its water in the laboratory. More recently, samples have been collected with gas-permeable membranes (GPMs) and measured in the field. These new methods, however, present challenges in achieving high-resolution measurements across multiple sites since they require significant effort and resources. Gas bag sampling offers the advantage of non-destructive, cost-efficient, easy-to-perform measurements without the need to bring a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer into the field. We used gas-permeable membranes to extract samples of water vapor from the soil, which were then stored in multi-layer foil bags until analysis. The bags were modified with homemade connections to reduce leakage and simplify gas transfers. The bags were tested using laboratory standards to determine their maximum storage time, potential memory effects, and reusability. The storage experiment with new bags demonstrated the ability to store water vapor samples for up to 7 d while maintaining mostly acceptable trueness for δ2H and acceptable to questionable trueness for δ18O. Trueness was defined as the mean difference between the measured and known water vapor placed into the bags and precision by the standard deviation of replicate measurements. The memory experiment using new bags revealed that the influence of previous samples increased with duration of storage. In both experiments, the light standards seemed to result in less accuracy. The reuse experiment confirmed that the bags can be filled repeatedly, provided they are used for similar sample lines and flushed 10 times with dry air. To demonstrate bag applicability in the field, we compared measurements of stored samples to measurements made directly in the field. Storing beyond 24 h needs further investigation but appears promising. With new gas bags up to 24 h of storage, we found accuracies of 0.2 ‰ ± 0.9 for δ18O and 0.7 ‰ ± 2.3 for δ2H. When the bags were reused and stored up to 24 h, they yielded accuracies of 0.1 ‰ ± 0.8 for δ18O and 1.4 ‰ ± 3.3 for δ2H. The proposed system is simple, cost-efficient, and versatile for both lab and field applications; however, case-specific testing is necessary given the remaining uncertainties."

By sampling both open-ocean and island areas, these data can show how plankton size, diversity and abundance change with different environments. We also highlight the usefulness of high-speed plankton sampling when it is not possible to slow the boat during sailing as well as the value of this technique with respect to extending the sampling coverage and frequency. 
 This paper presents the quantitative imaging datasets collected during the Tara Pacific expedition (2016–2018) carried out on the schooner Tara. The datasets cover a wide range of plankton sizes, from microphytoplankton (> 20 µm in size) to mesozooplankton (a few centimetres in size), and non-living particles such as plastic and detrital particles. It consists of surface samples collected across the North Atlantic and the North and South Pacific Ocean from open-ocean stations (a total of 357 samples) and from stations located in coastal waters, lagoons or reefs of 32 Pacific islands (a total of 228 samples). As this expedition involved long distances and long sailing times, we designed two sampling systems to collect plankton while sailing at speeds of up to 9 knots. To sample microplankton, surface water was pumped aboard using a customised pumping system and filtered through a 20 µm mesh size plankton net (hereafter referred to as the deck net – DN). A high-speed net (HSN; 330 µm mesh size) was developed to sample the mesoplankton. In addition, a manta net (330 µm) was also used, when possible, to collect mesoplankton and plastics simultaneously. We could not deploy these nets at the reef and lagoon stations of islands. Instead, two bongo nets (20 µm) attached to an underwater scooter were used to sample microplankton. In addition to describing and presenting the datasets, the complementary aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify the potential sampling biases associated with these two high-speed sampling systems and the different net types, in order to improve further ecological interpretations. Regarding the imaging techniques, microplankton (20–200 µm) from the DN and bongo net were imaged directly aboard Tara using a FlowCam instrument (Fluid Imaging Technologies), whereas mesoplankton (>200 µm) from the HSN and manta net were analysed in the laboratory with a ZooScan system (back on land). Organisms and other particles were taxonomically and morphologically classified using the automatic sorting tools of the EcoTaxa web application; following this, validation or correction was carried out by taxonomic experts. For microplankton smaller than 45 µm, a subsample of 30 % of the annotations was 100 % visually validated by experts. More than 300 different taxonomic and morphological groups were identified. The datasets include the metadata and the raw data from which morphological traits such as size (equivalent spherical diameter) and biovolume were calculated for each particle as well as a number of quantitative descriptors of the surface plankton communities. These descriptors include abundance, biovolumes, the Shannon diversity index and normalised biovolume size spectrum, allowing the study of their structures (e.g. taxonomic, functional, size and trophic structures) according to a wide range of environmental parameters at the basin scale (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6445609, Lombard et al., 2023)."

The Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan reduced regional transport pollution, but the eastern region showed the smallest decrease. Beijing should prioritize local emission reduction while considering the east region's contributions in future strategies. 
 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is closely linked to human health, with its sources generally divided into local emissions and regional transport. This study combined concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis with the HYSPLIT trajectory ensemble to obtain hourly resolution pollutant source results. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was then employed to simulate local emissions and ambient PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2020. The results revealed that clean air masses influencing the Beijing area mainly originated from the north and east regions, exhibiting a strong winter and weak summer pattern. Following the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan) by the Chinese government in 2017, pollution in Beijing decreased significantly, with the most substantial reduction in regional transport pollution events occurring in the west region during summer. Regional transport pollution events were most frequent in spring, up to 1.8 times higher than in winter. Pollutants mainly originated from the west and south regions, while polluted air masses from the east showed the least reduction, and the proportion of pollution sources from this region was gradually increasing. The COVID-19 restrictions might have reduced PM2.5 concentrations in 2020. From 2013 to 2020, local emissions were the main contributors to pollution events in Beijing. The Action Plan has more effectively reduced pollution caused by regional transport, particularly during autumn and winter. This finding underscores the importance of Beijing prioritizing local emission reduction while also considering potential contributions from the east region to effectively mitigate pollution events."

Generalized linear models were fit to test the association between exposures and small-for-gestational-age (SGA), low birthweight (LBW), and Fenton growth z-score outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Living in a high climate vulnerability index neighborhood was tested as an effect modifier. During preconception, increases in heat stress and WF measures were associated with higher odds of SGA. Living in the most climate-vulnerable neighborhoods during preconception significantly modified and nearly doubled the odds of SGA with exposure to heat stress. Similarly, heat stress and WF exposure in trimester-specific time periods were associated with adverse birth outcomes. Conversely, third-trimester exposures were associated with lower odds of LBW. Throughout pregnancy, two measures of infant size (SGA and Fenton z-scores) were lower among those with greater exposure to multiple WF exposures. This study highlights how living in more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods significantly modifies the effect of heat stress on SGA, suggesting that the increasing adaptation capacity of communities may strengthen climate change resilience."

We estimate how a 2010 SO2 NAAQS change that altered policy targeting from peak hourly emissions to annually aggregated hourly emissions affected SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. Using data on electricity generating unit (EGU) characteristics, SO2 emissions, fuel prices, and PM2.5 NAAQS classifications from 2001 to 2019 from public data sources, we estimate that, after a county was classified under the 2010 SO2 standard, EGUs reduced SO2 emissions during daily maximum hours by 31.6% (95% CI [−0.381, −0.247]) at the 99th percentile and 34.4% (95% CI [−0.424, −0.253]) at the 50th percentile. After a nearby ambient SO2 monitor was added to assess NAAQS compliance, hourly emissions fell by 12.4% (95% CI [−0.188, −0.054]) at the 99th percentile and 14.4% (95% CI [−0.228, −0.050]) at the 50th percentile. Our results also suggest the new standard had the same effect on peak hourly SO2 emissions as median and that plants in counties prioritized for early designation were less responsive to the policy change. These results suggest that the 2010 SO2 NAAQS change may have reduced SO2 emissions but may not have had an outsized impact on peak emissions despite policy guidance encouraging their control."

The impact of such debris, particularly when combined with co-occurring pollutants like antibiotics, on marine life remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that coexposure to aged polylactic acid (PLA) biomicroplastics and the antibiotic sulfamethazine (SMZ) induces overweight (an increase of 20.9–26.2%) and fatty liver-like disease in juvenile marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma). We investigated the underlying mechanism involving the orchestration of physiological processes between the host and its gut microbiota. We found that SMZ acted as a precondition or driver, while PLA acted as an environmental selective pressure, directionally shaping the gut microbiota communities. This altered microbiota demonstrated an increased ability to break down PLA into lactic acid, activating intestinal gluconeogenesis and consequently generating glucose. Excessive glucose shifted the hepatic glucose-fat balance toward fat accumulation, resulting in triglyceride and lipid droplet accumulation and overweight in the fish. Given the prevalent co-occurrence and interaction of PLA and antibiotics in the real-world environment, the combined ecological risk posed by these pollutants requires further investigation."

Herein, an all-solid-state piezoelectric-mediated strategy is proposed for the piezocatalytic destruction of dioxins induced by ball milling (BM) under ambient and solvent-free conditions. Dioxin-like compounds of harmful solid substances including fly ash (FA), sediment, and soil can be effectively eliminated, filling the gap between dioxin-contaminated matrices purification and piezocatalytic technology. Using the dibenzofuran as a dioxin model pollutant, an optimized removal efficiency up to 100% (below the detection limit) in the FA of municipal waste incineration was obtained after stainless-steel BM with the rotary speed of 600 rpm. This process was affected by piezocatalyst species, moisture content, ball-sample mass ratio, and ball size. Under the initiation of ball collisions, a surface piezopotential of 200 mV on commercially tetragonal barium titanate with a piezoelectric coefficient of 195.3 pm/V appeared, enabling favorable charge transfer between the interface. A unique mechanism of combining mechanochemical activation, hydrogen-atom abstraction, and mechano-radicals attack is ascribed to the elimination of dibenzofuran in the all-solid-state system. Multiple reactions such as cleavage, hydrogenation, rearrangement, and mineralization/coupling were subsequently involved. This approach demonstrates a promising way of destructing dioxins in hazardous solid waste without the need of additional solvent, heating, or pressurization."

Comprehensive identification of these TPs is imperative for environmental risk assessment and optimization of oxidation methodologies. Traditional experimental approaches for TP elucidation are often hindered by substantial financial and technical constraints, limiting their applicability in high-throughput scenarios. Here, we introduce TP-Transformer, an advanced deep learning framework designed to predict both the structures of TPs and their corresponding formation pathways. Trained on Chem_Oxi_2K, a meticulously curated data set comprising 2780 pollutant degradation reactions, TP-Transformer achieved a notable accuracy of 86.28% in TP prediction. The model adeptly reconstructs complete degradation pathways, addressing the intricate challenge of pathway elucidation. Attention analyses indicate that the TP-Transformer discerns reactive moieties within substrates and correlates them with specific reaction conditions, emulating expert-level chemical reasoning. Experimental validations corroborate the model’s robustness, with accurate TP predictions ranging from 80.20 to 92.86% for five pollutants absent from the training data set.

Nonetheless, no respective empirical data has been reported so far. In this study, particle samples from a road simulator and a highway tunnel were investigated with a validated imaging method. Different density and size fractions of both samples were measured separately, acquiring sizes and settling velocities of more than 30,000 individual particles. In addition, tire marker polymers were analyzed for each fraction via thermal extraction desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Finally, the acquired particle data was combined according to the fractions’ estimated tire contents in order to deduce detailed probability distributions of particle size and settling velocity for the actual TRWP from both samples. Weighted by TRWP-incorporated tire mass, median diameters of 54 and 44 μm as well as median settling velocities of 0.65 and 0.22 mm/s were found for TRWP from the road simulator and highway tunnel, respectively.

In this work, sorption of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) on NOM was first investigated. Correlation analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that nonpolar structures in NOM predominantly governed DBP sorption (309.4–387.8 mg/g). Subsequently, the DBP-NOM aggregates were prepared via solvent dialysis and freeze-drying, and DBP desorption was examined under various pH conditions. DBP desorption hysteresis increased with increasing pH, ranging from 26.02% (pH 9) to 63.91% (pH 4). At low pH, DBP desorption hysteresis was more pronounced for fulvic acids (FAs) than for humic acids (HAs). The 3D structure of aggregates was described using experimental characterizations and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The core–shell structure of NOM aggregates inhibited DBP desorption at high pH. The hydrophobic part of FAs was more likely to interact with DBP than HAs due to the higher degree of oxidation  and polarity.

This study investigates the differences in the macro‐ and micro‐structures between EPEs with and without lightning over eastern and southern China, as well as their underlying environmental conditions. EPEs are defined as convective features with maximum hourly rain rate reaching the gauge‐based climatological extreme precipitation threshold (99.9%). Results show that EPEs with lightning (EPE_LIG) account for 51%, and the other 49% EPEs have no lightning (EPE_NoLIG), whose fractional maxima are located along the coast. Most EPE_NoLIGs are embedded in large organized precipitation systems, although their convective cores are smaller than EPE_LIGs. The parent systems of both EPE types are multicellular in nature, but those of EPE_NoLIGs are more likely to produce multiple extreme precipitation centers. EPE_LIGs have the most intense convection, which is stronger than regular thunderstorms (NonEPEs with lightning), while the convective intensity of EPE_NoLIGs is just close to NonEPEs. Microphysical processes of the two types of EPEs differ significantly. The downward increasing radar reflectivity profiles and drop size distribution analyses suggest that warm‐rain processes highly dominate (94.1%) in the formation of extreme precipitation in EPE_NoLIGs. Even for EPEs with very active ice‐based processes (EPE_LIGs), warm‐rain processes still contribute significantly (83.31%). The large‐scale environments of EPE_NoLIGs are featured by a relatively convectively stable but deep moist troposphere and enhanced low‐level southwesterly winds, highlighting the importance of excessive moisture transport and convergence in these events."

The Weather Research and Forecasting Solar (WRF‐Solar) model, especially its sub‐grid cloud scheme (CLD), plays a key role in GHI prediction. This study mainly uses various CLD schemes (icloud option in different WRF‐Solar version, CLD1 v4.4 and CLD3 v3.8, v4.2, and v4.4) to explore the key factors in cloud radiation processes and causes of deviations that affect GHI in China. Results illustrate that WRF‐Solar generally overestimates GHI, with poorer simulations in Henan and southwestern China. The impact on GHI is minimized when the cloud fraction (CF) is the only influencing factor (default CLD) at 3 km horizontal resolution. There will be a compensating effect of CF and cloud condensate content for GHI feedback, but under extremely low CF, its impact exceeds the compensation from increased cloud condensate content. Employing the default climatological effective particle radius of clouds in the RRTMG radiation scheme would improve GHI prediction, especially for Henan Province. All CLD3 versions have enhanced simulations on GHI compared to CLD1 due to the incremental adjustments in cloud condensate content, with CLD3 v3.8 (CLD3_38) showing the best performance, which would reduce MB by 54.8% and RMSE by 11.1% at 13:00 across China. Furthermore, comparing CLD3_38 with Fengyun4A shows WRF‐Solar overestimates high clouds, causing discrepancies in cloud phase representation, especially in northwest China, while poor GHI simulation in southwestern China is linked to inadequate low and medium cloud representation."

Besides, the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) to tropical precipitation extremes remains loosely quantified on various scales, in particular on kilometer scales. Here, we construct a framework to analyze the cooccurrence of extreme precipitation at km‐scale and 1° × 1 day scale to compare their properties in terms of precipitation morphology and regional predominance. Using a storm‐tracking algorithm, we contrast the occurrence and precipitation statistics for two types of convective systems across 10 global storm‐resolving models and one geostationary satellite product. We do not find a large statistical dependence between rain extremes on these two scales, and they occur in distinct regions. Heavy km‐scale events occur mostly over continents and 40% of them are produced by MCSs in observations. Their intensity is independent from the area of rain features. Conversely, heavy 1° × 1 day rain intensities are dependent on the area of rain features, and occur more frequently over oceans, and a third of these events are produced by MCSs. Overall, the transition from deep to MCSs connect extremes across both scales. Compared to observations, models consistently underestimate the precipitating surface and show large discrepancies in the contribution of convective systems to precipitation extremes at each scale. This diagnostic is a key criterion for evaluating the ability of global storm‐resolving models to represent how individual convective systems produce realistic heavy rain distributions."

The Mixed type, most frequent and longest‐lived, features the most extensive and coldest anomalies across Eurasia uniformly distributed over East Asia. The North type shows the coldest anomalies in northeast Asia with weaker effects in southern East Asia. The weakening trend in CAO intensity observed in East Asia is primarily due to long‐term changes in the Mixed types.

It has long been controversial and poorly understood how vegetation physiological effects influence meteorological drought characteristics with increasing CO2. To investigate that, we employ multiple CO2 sensitivity experiments of the state‐of‐the‐art Earth System Models (ESMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We quantify drought characteristics in response to rising CO2 using two drought indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), with SPEI calculated using both the Penman‐Monteith method (SPEI_PM) and energy‐only method (SPEI_Rn). Our findings reveal that plant physiological effects can robustly induce more intense, frequent, and prolonged droughts under elevated CO2 levels. Spatially, drought intensity as measured by SPI, SPEI_PM, and SPEI_Rn, resulting from CO2 physiological forcing, is projected to increase over 61%, 69%, and 78% of global terrestrial areas, respectively. Notably, we found that the contribution of plant physiological effects (βPHY ${\beta }_{\text{PHY}}$) to drought characteristics, including intensity, frequency, and duration, exhibits a significant and spatially extensive declining trend with rising CO2 across most land areas. This declining trend is robustly depicted in both the multi‐model mean and individual models. Vegetation coverage plays an important role in the spatial pattern of βPHY ${\beta }_{\text{PHY}}$. CO2 physiological forcing therefore exerts greater impacts in the tropics, particularly over tropical forests. Our results demonstrate that drought characteristics are expected to become less dependent on plant physiological effects with increasing CO2, a consideration essential for accurate drought projections."

Global atmospheric chemical transport models tend to underestimate the magnitude of N deposition in China and fail to reproduce such a shift. How do underestimation and trend shift in N deposition influence China's terrestrial carbon (C) uptake remains unclear. Here we used a new N deposition data set and three independent methods to investigate the effect of N deposition on terrestrial C uptake in China. We found that the magnitude and trend of China's terrestrial C sink induced by N deposition (∆CNdep) would be underestimated during 1990–2015 when using commonly used global atmospheric N deposition data sets. Despite the decrease in N deposition trend, the increasing rate of ∆CNdep changed from 4.42 Tg C yr−2 in 1990–2005 to 5.64 Tg C yr−2 in 2006–2015, which was dominated by subtropical and tropical monsoon region. The interactive effect of N deposition with other environmental factors has a greater impact on the trend of ∆CNdep than direct effect. Our results highlight the rising terrestrial C uptake as N deposition stabilizes and the crucial role of interaction mechanisms among global change factors in assessing the impact of declining reactive N inputs on China's future land C sinks under C neutrality targets."

Reanalysis products are among the most widely used for driving impact models, evaluating climate models, or bias‐correcting and downscaling model outputs to generate climate change projections. However, they are often outperformed in accuracy by other GGPPs, particularly in tropical regions, including areas of the Global South. Therefore, we assessed the utility and suitability of GGPPs for climate and health research by examining how differences and uncertainties in these products affect area‐level precipitation estimates, often used in health studies when epidemiological data are linked to administrative units. We compared reanalysis (ERA5/‐Land) with satellite‐based (CHIRPS, PERSIANN‐CDR) and interpolated gauge‐based products (CRUTS, GPCC), each a viable candidate to serve as reference climatology in climate change impact assessments. We focused on seasonal patterns, disease‐related bioclimatic variables, and climate change‐relevant indices, such as the number of wet or dry periods. Our findings revealed substantial variation in the accuracy of local precipitation estimates across GGPPs, with differences in maximum pixel precipitation values exceeding 75% between ERA5‐Land and CHIRPS. These differences in GGPPs translated into area‐level precipitation and, consequently, in vector carrying capacity estimates, demonstrating their impact on health assessments.

We conducted an extensive review using nine search engines, which yielded 21 publications that focused on the health outcomes and barriers on the topic of climate change among vulnerable populations. Our findings indicated that poverty is the largest challenge preventing people from adequate health access and achieving positive outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations globally. In addition, institutional and systemic barriers also differ based on regional differences, which suggests that health inequities are context dependent. Our scoping review has implications for (a) enhancing the effectiveness of climate change mitigation strategies and (b) addressing the healthcare barriers of vulnerable populations based on country‐specific challenges."

 The ephemeral, supraglacial meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf’s undulating ice serve as analogues for refugia where eukaryotic organisms could have thrived during the Cryogenian period. The seafloor sediment and debris lined ponds support the growth of a diverse array of cyanobacterial mat communities and provide habitats for a variety of protists and meiofauna. Here, we show that these eukaryotic assemblages, assessed by steroid biomarker and 18S rRNA gene analyses, inform long-standing questions regarding the diversity of, and controls on, community composition in these environments. Sixteen photosynthetically active microbial mats from meltwater ponds, a 700-year-old relict microbial mat, and a microbial mat from the Bratina Lagoon were analysed for their sterol compositions. These sterols were subjected to simulated diagenesis via catalytic hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis affording their sterane hydrocarbon counterparts, facilitating comparisons with ancient settings. Pond salinity appeared to be a factor influencing the sterol distributions observed. Analyses of 18S rRNA gene sequences conducted on the modern mats independently confirm that the ponds host diverse eukaryotes, including many types of microalgae, protists, and an array of unclassifiable organisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that supraglacial meltwater ponds like those of the McMurdo ice are strong candidates for refugia that sheltered complex life during Snowball Earth episodes.

 Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) remodels the host chromatin structure and induces a host-to-virus transcriptional switch during lytic infection. We combine super-resolution imaging and chromosome-capture technologies to identify the mechanism of remodeling. We show that the host chromatin undergoes massive condensation caused by the hijacking of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and topoisomerase I (TOP1). In addition, HSV-1 infection results in the rearrangement of topologically associating domains and loops, although the A/B compartments are maintained in the host. The position of viral genomes and their association with RNAP II and cohesin is determined nanometrically. We reveal specific host–HSV-1 genome interactions and enrichment of upregulated human genes in the most contacting regions. Finally, TOP1 inhibition fully blocks HSV-1 infection, suggesting possible antiviral strategies. This viral mechanism of host chromatin rewiring sheds light on the role of transcription in chromatin architecture.

 Intense short-duration summer rainfall in mountainous areas can trigger a variety of natural hazards, including flash floods, debris flows, and urban floods. Warming is expected to intensify extreme sub-hourly rainfall events in response to an increased atmospheric water vapor content and invigorated storm dynamics. Here, we employ a new physically-based statistical model to estimate the projected intensification of sub-hourly and hourly extreme rainfall across 299 high-mountain Alpine stations in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria. Analyzing the projected intensification for 10-min rainfall at 1 to 3 °C of warming confirms a general intensification at a rate of 9% °C−1 over the Alpine region, with a stronger intensification at higher elevations. With a 2 °C increase in average regional temperature relative to the 1991–2020 period, extreme rainfall statistics over the Alps are likely to undergo significant changes, resulting in a two-fold increase in the probability of occurrence of the extreme rainfall levels used for infrastructure design and risk management."

 Understanding the changing flood magnitude and frequency is crucial for managing flood risks. Current flood projections are hindered by uncertain rainfall changes and inadequate representation of spatial-temporal rainfall characteristics from global climate models. Here we develop a framework for flood projection integrating large ensemble climate model outputs and dynamic downscaling simulations. By unveiling the shifting importance of changes in atmospheric circulation and water vapor to rainfall extremes of varying magnitudes, a scaling ratio is derived to constrain rainfall projections from thermodynamics-perturbed experiments. Applying this framework to the North China Plain, we reveal substantial rainfall increases partially attributed to more favorable synoptic conditions. This leads to a nearly fivefold rise in population exposure to moderate and high flood depths (i.e., 0.5 ~ 2 m). The region with heightened flood risk is spatially offset from that with rainfall increases. These findings highlight an urgency for improved flood risk management in the densely populated region.

 Addressing current environmental crises requires a fundamental shift in our relationship with nature. Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities can guide diverse pathways towards sustainable and just futures, rooted in ancestral knowledge and relational values that challenge the status quo. Indigenous knowledge and practices, however, are still largely underappreciated, not being recognized as agents of transformative change. Inspired by the Seeds of Good Anthropocenes approach, this research identifies types of initiatives driven by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Through hierarchical cluster analysis of 127 initiatives from Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia, six groups of initiatives are revealed. Three out of these six groups, i.e., Empowering, Reconnecting people and nature, and Intercultural and ancestral education (named here as I-Seeds), apply knowledge co-design processes led by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities and have higher transformative potential. Such initiatives also implement amplification strategies of scaling deep that catalyze profound shifts in values and mindsets beyond the I-Seed. This study draws attention to the importance of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities and their (retro)innovations to foster sustainability transformations.

 Carbon mineralization in humidified carbon dioxide offers a promising route to mitigate anthropogenic emissions in a world stressed by water security. Despite its technological importance, our understanding of carbonation in water-poor environments lags, as traditional dissolution-precipitation pathways struggle to explain the adsorbed water nanofilm-mediated reactivity. Here, we utilize in operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and advanced molecular simulations to investigate nanoconfined reactions driving forsterite carbonation, the magnesium-rich olivine. By examining magnesium ion dissolution and transport in atomistic simulations of the forsterite-water-carbon dioxide interface and comparing these with the in operando XRD activation energies, we identify both processes as rate-limiting at saturation. Our simulations reveal a mechanistic view of interfacial carbonation, where dissolution and precipitation are mediated by anomalous quasi two-dimensional diffusion. The transport process involves intermittent diffusive hopping in the desorbed state, separated by crawling events that are spatially short but temporally long. This understanding transcends carbon mineralization, with implications for understanding the transport of contaminants in geosystems, the design of multifunctional materials, water desalination, and molecular recognition systems.

 Northern peatlands are an important carbon store in mid to high latitudes, but become increasingly discontinuous in the higher latitudes, associated with temperature and precipitation limits on plant growth. During the last four decades, mean annual temperatures in the Arctic have increased on average by ~3 °C. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons likely drive increases in plant productivity throughout northern latitudes, but it is not clear whether warming has resulted in lateral spread of Arctic peatlands. Using long time-series Landsat satellite data, coupled with information gathered from fieldwork in situ, we show that Arctic peatlands have likely undergone lateral expansion over the last 40 years. On 21 transects from the edges of 16 extant peatlands in the European and Canadian Arctic (both high and low Arctic locations from 62 to 79°N), over two thirds of the peatland edges we studied showed statistically significant peak-summer greening (as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) in the last 15 to 20 years, compared to the period 1985–1995. Peak summer moisture (as normalised Difference Moisture Index) levels remained stable or increased at most study sites.

 Burning the reserves of the 200 largest fossil fuel companies could generate 673 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, far exceeding the remaining 400-gigatonne budget needed to limit warming to 1.5 °C by 2050. Rapid action is needed to reduce, or where necessary, offset emissions from burning fossil fuels but it remains unclear who will bear the cost. Our study aims to show the limits of offsetting using reserve data from the 200 largest fossil fuel companies sourced from Fossil Free Funds and carbon capture rates from peer-reviewed ecological studies. We show that if the cost of offsetting fossil fuel emissions exceeds $150 per tonne of carbon dioxide, fossil fuel companies could have negative market valuations. Using the social cost of carbon, we find the climate-related externalities associated with these reserves exceed their market valuation. Afforestation is often proposed as a carbon sequestration solution, but offsetting emissions from fossil fuel reserves would require covering an area the size of North and Central America solely with trees, displacing communities, farmland and existing habitats. Afforestation, while more economical could disrupt existing ecosystems that provide vital ecosystem services.

 Water shortages are intensifying globally due to climate change and human activities. Northeast Asia, with diverse ecosystems and transboundary water systems, is particularly sensitive to these pressures. Yet, the region’s water resource changes and drivers remain largely unknown. Here, we integrate Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its Follow-On observations, climate and anthropogenic data, finding a net surface water area loss of 16 × 103 km2 in Far East Russia over 2000−2023, primarily driven by rising temperature and evaporative demand, and a net surface water area gain of 3 × 103 km2 in Northeast China, primarily driven by increasing precipitation and irrigation infrastructure.

 Wave and offshore-wind energies offer promising alternatives to fossil fuels, yet their combined potential under climate change remains poorly understood. Here we assess how climate change may affect this potential over the coming century, using outputs from fifteen global climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and an empirical method to refine model projections. We identify two oceanic bands between 40°S and 60°S with high combined energy potential. Notably, the region between 20°E and 180°E is projected to remain favorable for both energy sources.

 Remote sensing has revolutionized crop mapping and monitoring, providing valuable insights for sustainable agricultural practices. However, successfully implementing remote sensing-based crop type identification in tropical regions remains challenging. Unlike temperate regions, tropical areas benefit from favorable weather conditions that support diverse land management practices, resulting in complex crop dynamics that are difficult to model. Additionally, frequent cloud cover in tropical regions limits the use of optical data during extended periods of the year, making SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) a more attractive alternative. Traditional models like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been useful in classifying crop types using spatial and temporal contexts. However, these models often use fixed inputs, optimizing them towards a specific task, and fail to consider the CRFs’ feedback for end-to-end learning features and the spatiotemporal dependencies. This work addresses this gap by introducing an end-to-end hybrid model that combines deep learning with CRFs to incorporate prior knowledge-based modeling of crop dynamics. The proposed framework integrates a backbone encoder–decoder to capture spatial and temporal contexts, with a CRF block that models temporal dynamics by accounting for label dependencies between adjacent epochs. This block facilitates the integration of both data-driven and expert-domain temporal constraints, allowing the framework to adapt to local agricultural practices and enhance crop dynamics modeling. We evaluate the framework using multi-temporal SAR image sequences from two municipalities in Brazil, comparing the effectiveness of learned versus prior-knowledge temporal constraints. The results show improvements of up to 30% in per-class F1 score and 12% in average F1 score compared to a baseline model that excludes temporal dependencies. These findings highlight the value of incorporating prior knowledge-driven temporal constraints into crop mapping models."

 Deep learning approaches have gained prominence for automatic glacier boundary extraction due to their localized nature of convolutional operations, potentially leading to incomplete or fragmented glacier pixel representations. Moreover, the accuracy of extracting glacier boundaries from a single remote sensing image (RSIs) is often influenced by seasonal snow, clouds, shadows, and frozen lakes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model for extracting the non-debris-covered areas of glaciers (NDCAG) from RSIs, termed GlacierSTR-UNet. This model enhances information flow and overall performance by embedding the Swin Transformer (ST) as an encoder into a U-shaped architecture and reduces training time and improves gradient handling by incorporating the ResNet block in the decoder. We deploy the GlacierSTR-UNet model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently generate multiple NDCAG results from RSIs taken at different periods. A pixel-by-pixel synthesis algorithm is then applied to aggregate the multiple NDCAG extraction results, producing the final NDCAG. Accuracy assessments indicate that GlacierSTR-UNet achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8817, and the relative deviation between automatically extracted and manually interpreted NDCAG remains within 2 %. Finally, we obtain the NDCAG datasets for the periods of 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 in High-Mountain Asia, revealing a reduction of 4,185.12 ± 7,870.96 km2 in NDCAG from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently and accurately extracting NDCAG, highlighting its potential for monitoring glacier changes and supporting glacier inventory efforts."

 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have demonstrated exceptional potential across various generative modeling tasks. Despite evident promise in semantic segmentation, their adoption for remote sensing remains limited primarily due to computationally demanding inference. While initial approaches using DDPMs in remote sensing achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models, the multi-step nature of their image generation process poses a major bottleneck. To address this limitation, this paper investigates three key strategies for accelerating inference: (1) optimizing training and inference steps, (2) applying DDPM acceleration techniques adapted to segmentation task (including Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models, Improved Denoising Diffusion Models, and Progressive Distillation), and (3) thoroughly analyzing the trade-off between accuracy improvement and additional inference time when using test-time augmentation. These strategies are extensively tested with two established remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets focused on buildings and roads. Finally, we compare the optimized diffusion-based model with state-of-the-art convolutional-based models in terms of accuracy and inference times, showing the narrowing gap between both approaches and the increasing viability of diffusion-based segmentation for practical applications."

 Recent advancements in drone-based fire early warning technologies have significantly improved fire detection, particularly in remote and forested areas where drones are widely utilized. However, the constrained battery life and limited computational resources of drones present challenges for real-time fire detection. Existing methods primarily focus on fire target identification without considering the distinct color and thermal characteristics of flames, leading to suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Flame-Specific Attention (FSA) mechanism, which integrates heat conduction principles and flame shape features to enhance receptive field expansion while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, the Neck of the model is optimized with a Focal Modulation module to improve feature fusion, and a variable multi-attention detection head is introduced to refine detection precision. Experimental results on our Comprehensive Fire Scene Dataset (containing 3,905 images) demonstrate that our model achieves a mean Average Precision ([email protected]) of 87.7%, surpassing both Vision Transformers (ViTs) and traditional CNN approaches. Compared to the YOLOv10 baseline, our approach improves precision by 5.7% while maintaining an inference speed of 182 FPS, enabling real-time deployment in edge-computing scenarios such as drone-based fire detection. Additionally, the model effectively detects small- and medium-sized flames, reducing false positives in challenging lighting conditions (e.g., sunset and urban illumination).

 A significant increase in summer precipitation was observed in Northwest China (NWC) from 1961 to 2014, posing opportunities and challenges for the local ecosystem and human society. Using multi-model pre-industrial control simulations, and historical and single-forcing simulations from the state-of-the-art MIROC6 model, we attributed this wetting trend and explored the relative roles of individual external forcings. Our finding indicated that external forcing is the primary driver of this observed wetting, with anthropogenic forcing—dominated by greenhouse gases (GHG) and secondarily by anthropogenic aerosols (AA)—playing a significant role than natural forcing. Moisture budget analysis indicated that intensified moisture flux convergence, driven by circulation changes, is a key mechanism behind the NWC wetting in both GHG and AA simulations. Specifically, GHG forcing alters the Asian subtropical westerly jet (ASWJ), inducing a southward shift of the western branch and a weakening of the eastern branch. These changes correspond to an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) in the west (east) of NWC, promoting moisture convergence over NWC of anomalous southwesterly and southeasterly winds. AA forcing weakens the ASWJ, producing a meridional dipole pattern of an anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) in the north (south), along with lower-level anomalous anticyclone over Mongolia and Northeast China. This circulation pattern facilitates moisture transport from the western North Pacific into inland NWC via anomalous easterlies and intensified moisture flux convergence."

Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]–rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis.

Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity.

We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade.

These clouds organize into striking mesoscale patterns that are exactly what climate models lack. This study explores the origin of such patterns and investigates how variations in microscale properties control them. The importance of microscale effects is compared to that of large-scale forcing on the mesoscale organization of trade-cumulus fields. 
 The mesoscale self-organization of trade-cumulus cloud fields is a major cloud–climate uncertainty. Cold pools, i.e., pockets of cold, dense air resulting from rain evaporation, are a key mechanism in shaping these dynamics and are controlled by the large-scale forcing. We study the microphysical sensitivity of cloud-field self-organization through cold pools by varying the cloud droplet number concentration (Nc) from 20 to 1000 cm−3 in large-eddy simulations on large 154 km×154 km domains. We find that cold pools exhibit two distinct regimes of mesoscale self-organization. Under very low Nc conditions, cold pools transition from a stage in which they are small and randomly distributed to forming large, long-lived structures that perpetuate due to the collisions of cold pools at their fronts. Under high-Nc conditions, cold pools display strongly intermittent behavior and interact with clouds through small, short-lived structures. Thus, although Nc influences the number of cold pools and, in turn, mesoscale organization, cloud depth, and cloud albedo, we find its effect on cloud cover to be minimal. Comparing the microphysical sensitivity of cold-pool-mediated mesoscale dynamics to the external, large-scale forcing shows that Nc is as important as horizontal wind and large-scale subsidence for trade-cumulus albedo. Our results highlight that cold pools mediate the adjustments of trade-cumulus cloud fields to changes in Nc. Such mesoscale adjustments need to be considered if we are to better constrain the effective aerosol forcing and cloud feedback in the trade-wind regime."

 This study delves into the small-scale temperature structure inside the turbulent convection Π Chamber under three temperature differences (10, 15, and 20 K) at Rayleigh number Ra∼109 and Prandtl number Pr≈0.7. We performed high-frequency measurements (2 kHz) with the UltraFast Thermometer (UFT) at selected points along the vertical axis. The miniaturized design of the sensor with a resistive platinum-coated tungsten wire, 2.5 µm thick and 3 mm long, mounted on a miniature wire probe, allowed for vertically undisturbed temperature profiling through the chamber's depth spanning from 8 cm above the bottom to 5 cm below the top. The collected data, consisting of 19 and 3 min time series, were used to investigate the variability of the temperature field within the chamber, aiming to better address scientific questions related to its primary objective: understanding small-scale aerosol–cloud interactions. The analyses reveal substantial variability in both variance and skewness of temperature distributions near the top and bottom plates and in the bulk (central) region, which were linked to local thermal plume dynamics. We also identified three spectral regimes termed “inertial range” (slopes of  ∼-7/5), “transition range” (slopes of ∼-3), and “dissipative range”, characterized by slopes of ∼-7. Furthermore, the analysis showed a power law relationship between the periodicity of large-scale circulation (LSC) and the temperature difference.

 Storm surges (SSs) cause massive loss of life and property in coastal areas each year. High-spatial-coverage and long-term SS records are the basis for deepening our understanding of these disasters. Due to the sparse and uneven distribution of tide gauge stations, such global or quasi-global information can only be provided by global numerical models, while their simulation products mainly span the most recent decades. In this paper, for the first time, an all-site modeling framework for a data-driven model was implemented on a quasi-global scale within areas severely affected by SSs caused by tropical cyclones. Using tide gauge records and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data, we generated a high-spatial-resolution (10 km along the coastline) hourly SS dataset, ASM-SS (all-site modeling storm surge), within the span 45° S–45° N, whose record length is over 80 years from 1940 to 2020. Assessments indicate that, for 95th extreme SSs, the precision of the ASM-SS model (the medians of the correlation coefficients, root mean square errors, and mean biases are 0.63, 0.093, and −0.050 m, respectively) is better than that of the state-of-the-art global hydrodynamic model (the medians are 0.55, 0.106, and −0.045 m). For annual maximum SSs, it is more stable than the numerical model, with the overall root mean square error and coefficient of determination optimizing by 22.3 % and 14.8 %, respectively. This dataset could provide possible alternative support for coastal communities through relevant SS analysis applications requiring high spatial resolution and sufficiently long records.

W. van de Wal,The Utrecht Finite Volume Ice-Sheet Model (UFEMISM) version 2.0 – Part 1: Description and idealised experiments,"Ice-sheet models are computer programs that can simulate how the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will evolve in the future. The accuracy of these models depends on their resolution: how small the details are that the model can resolve. We have created a model with a variable resolution that can resolve a lot of detail in areas where lots of changes happen in the ice and less detail in areas where the ice does not move so much. This makes the model both accurate and fast. 
 Projecting the anthropogenic mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets requires models that can accurately describe the physics of flowing ice and its interactions with the atmosphere, the ocean, and the solid Earth. As the uncertainty in many of these processes can only be explored by running large numbers of simulations to sample the phase space of possible physical parameters, the computational efficiency and user-friendliness of such a model are just as relevant to its applicability as is its physical accuracy. Here, we present and verify version 2.0 of the Utrecht Finite Volume Ice-Sheet Model (UFEMISM). UFEMISM is a state-of-the-art finite-volume model that applies an adaptive grid in both space and time. Since the first version published 2 years ago, v2.0 has added more accurate approximations to the Stokes flow, more sliding laws, different schemes for calculating the ice thickness rates of change, a more numerically stable time-stepping scheme, more flexible and powerful mesh generation code, and a more generally applicable discretisation scheme. The parallelisation scheme has changed from a shared-memory architecture to distributed memory, enabling the user to utilise more computational resources. The version control system (git) includes automated unit tests and benchmark experiments to aid with model development, as well as automated installation of the required libraries, improving both user comfort and reproducibility of results. The input/output (I/O) now follows the NetCDF-4 standard, including automated remapping between regular grids and irregular meshes, reducing user workload for pre- and post-processing. These additions and improvements make UFEMISM v2.0 a powerful, flexible ice-sheet model that can be used for long palaeoglaciological applications, as well as large ensemble simulations for future projections of ice-sheet retreat, and that is ready to be used for coupling within Earth system models."

This is usually done by running many simulations of the model with different settings, which can be time-consuming and relies heavily on expert knowledge. To make this process faster and more objective, we developed a machine learning emulator to create a large ensemble and apply a method called history matching to find the best settings. 
 In climate model development, “tuning” refers to the important process of adjusting uncertain free parameters of subgrid-scale parameterizations to best match a set of Earth observations, such as the global radiation balance or global cloud cover. This is traditionally a computationally expensive step as it requires a large number of climate model simulations. This step also becomes more challenging with increasing spatial resolution and complexity of climate models. In addition, the manual tuning relies strongly on expert knowledge and is thus not independently reproducible. To reduce subjectivity and computational demands, tuning methods based on machine learning (ML) have become an active research subject. Here, we build on these developments and apply ML-based tuning to the atmospheric component of the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON) at 80 km resolution. Our approach follows a workflow similar to other proposed ML-based tuning methods: (1) creating a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of limited size with randomly selected parameters, (2) fitting an ML-based emulator to the PPE to generate a large emulated ensemble with the emulator, and (3) shrinking the parameter space to regions compatible with observations using a method inspired by history matching. However, in contrast to previous works, we apply a sequential approach: the selected set of tuning parameters is updated in successive phases depending on the results of a sensitivity analysis with Sobol indices. We tune for global radiative properties, cloud properties, zonal wind velocities, and wind stresses on the ocean surface. With one iteration of this method, we achieve a model configuration yielding a global top-of-atmosphere net radiation budget in the range of [0, 1] W m−2, and global radiation metrics and water vapour path consistent with the reference observations. Furthermore, the resulting ML-based emulator allows us to identify the parameters that most impact the outputs that we target with tuning. The parameters that we identified to be mostly influential for the physics output metrics are the critical relative humidity in the upper troposphere and the conversion coefficient from cloud water to rain, influencing the radiation metrics and global cloud cover, together with the coefficient of sedimentation velocity of cloud ice, having a strong non-linear influence on all the physics metrics. The existence of non-linear effects further motivates the use of ML-based approaches for parameter tuning in climate models."

Users can set energy/time criteria or limit resource usage. Tested on various European Community Earth System Model (EC-Earth) configurations and high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, it achieved up to 34 % faster simulations with fewer resources. 
 Earth system models (ESMs) are intricate models employed for simulating the Earth's climate, typically constructed from distinct independent components dedicated to simulate specific natural phenomena (such as atmosphere and ocean dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, land and ocean biosphere). In order to capture the interactions between these processes, ESMs utilize coupling libraries, which oversee the synchronization and field exchanges among independent developed codes typically operating in parallel as a multi-program, multiple data (MPMD) application.The performance achieved depends on the coupling approach, as well as on the number of parallel resources and scalability properties of each component. Determining the appropriate number of resources to use for each component in coupled ESMs is crucial for efficient utilization of the high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures used in climate modeling. However, this task traditionally involves manual testing of multiple process allocations by trial and error, requiring significant time investment from researchers and making the process more error-prone, often resulting in a loss of application performance due to the complexity of the task. This paper introduces the automatic load-balance tool (auto-lb), a methodology and tool for determining the resource allocation to each component within coupled ESMs, aimed at improving the application's performance. Notably, this methodology is automatic and does not require expertise in HPC to improve the performance achieved by coupled ESMs. This is accomplished by minimizing the load imbalance: reducing each constituent's execution cost (core hours), as well as minimizing the core hours wasted resulting from the synchronizations between them, without penalizing the execution speed of the entire model. This optimization is achieved regardless of the scalability properties of each constituent and the complexity of their dependencies during the coupling.To achieve this, we designed a new performance metric called “fittingness” to assess the performance of coupled execution, evaluating the trade-off between parallel efficiency and application throughput. This metric is intended for scenarios where optimality can depend on various criteria and constraints. Aiming for maximum speed might not be desirable if it leads to a decrease in parallel efficiency and thus increases the computational costs of simulation.The methodology was tested across multiple experiments using the widely recognized European ESM, EC-Earth3. The results were compared with real operational configurations, such as those used for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and European Climate Prediction project (EUCP), and validated on different HPC platforms. All of them suggest that the current approaches lead to performance loss, and that auto-lb can achieve better results in both execution speed and reduction of the core hours needed. When comparing to the EC-Earth standard-resolution CPMIP6 runs, we achieved a configuration 4.7 % faster while also reducing the core hours required by 1.3 %. Likewise, when compared to the EC-Earth high-resolution EUCP runs, the method presented showed an improvement of 34 % in the speed, with a 6.7 % reduction in the core hours consumed."

For ROS induction, although all studied chemicals collectively explained a small fraction (<1%) of the effects elicited by seawater extracts in both cell lines, okadaic acid and gymnodimine accounted for ∼80% of the mixture effects of all chemicals, with additional contributions from PFASs. Extending the approach to other coastal habitats where concentration data are available revealed algal toxins as dominant contributors among the known contaminant mixtures eliciting dermal toxic potential. This study provides novel insights to guide the identification of toxicity contributors across dermal health end points, with a balanced perspective on natural toxins and anthropogenic contaminants in addressing their mixture effects on sentinel species health."

This study quantifies the contrail mitigation potential and fuel supply chain costs of a uniform SAF distribution scenario, assuming all departing flights use a 10% SAF blend by mass. Building on this, we propose three SAF allocation strategies that optimize the same SAF supply to maximize contrail mitigation, while considering real-world supply chain constraints and additional costs. A seasonal strategy – providing SAF to all flights from October to February at higher blend ratios (28%) – achieves the highest benefit-to-cost ratio (1.7–7.2) and lowest abatement cost (€14–61/tCO2e). It raises annual reductions in contrail energy forcing (EFcontrail) from 7–8% (uniform vs no-SAF scenario) to 12–13%, with supply chain costs rising by 0.5% relative to the uniform scenario. Two diurnal strategies – one targeting flights after 16:00 local time and another adding a constraint of selecting flights with >250 km of persistent contrails – have lower benefit-to-cost ratios (0.2–2.4) and higher abatement costs (€42–675/tCO2e). Their 1–2% rise in supply chain costs relative to the uniform scenario outweighs the additional contrail climate benefits, as annual EFcontrail reductions only rise from 7–8% (uniform scenario) to 9–17%."

However, few studies have explicitly examined their interactions in response to eutrophication. Here, we characterized organic matter (OM) and phosphorus (P) pools in these subsystems of Lake Taihu and analyzed their variations with a gradient from mesotrophic to hypertrophic states. We employed a “3-subsystem” conceptual model with statistical algorithms to estimate the interactions. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate OM and P increased with eutrophication, while only the surface OM and P pools in sediments exhibited variability with the trophic state. Protein- and humic-like substances in the dissolved and particulate OM pools became more prominent at higher trophic states. High mobile P and low inert P were observed in the suspended particles and surface sediments of eutrophic regions. As the trophic state increased, interactions between dissolved and particulate subsystems and between particulate and sedimentary subsystems strengthened, whereas few changes occurred in the interaction between dissolved and sedimentary subsystems. This suggests that particle release and sediment resuspension are more significant pathways for internal nutrient loading in eutrophic regions. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how eutrophication affects lake subsystems and their interactions, offering potential ecological restoration references for eutrophic shallow lakes."

Source-separated urine contains pharmaceutical compounds that could pose a risk to the environment and public health. While treatment technologies that address pharmaceutical contamination in UDF have been proposed, little is known about the exposure and risk to public health that UDF-fertilized crops pose. We assessed pharmaceutical uptake by lettuce exposed to UDF spiked with pharmaceuticals at two levels: the highest reported concentrations from the literature and at a level 10 times this amount to represent a worst-case scenario for UDF application. Between 0.00004% and 0.0002% of the applied pharmaceutical mass was taken up by lettuce. Exposure to pharmaceuticals through the consumption of UDF-fertilized crops is not significantly different from exposure through crops irrigated with reclaimed water (RW). Compared to therapeutic doses, the cumulative pharmaceutical ingestion associated with consuming UDF-fertilized vegetables every day over 70 years is up to 2.5% of the therapeutic dose of pharmaceuticals considered in this study. Our comparative exposure assessment reveals minimal exposures associated with the consumption of crops that are either fertilized by UDF or irrigated with RW, providing key insights for various stakeholders."

In this study, we examined polymer-type specific, small-sized MPs (20–500 μm) in both topsoil (5 cm) and subsoil (50 and 100 cm) in the megacity of Beijing, China, using Laser Direct Infrared (LDIR) Chemical Imaging Spectroscopy, focusing on variation in abundance, size, polymer type, and oxidation characteristics across 6 land use types. A total of 6085 MP particles with 11 polymer types were identified. MP abundance in subsoils was significantly lower, and they were surprisingly larger in size and less oxidized. MP distribution in subsoils was enhanced in fine-textured and iron (Fe)-depleted soils. Based on these findings, we conducted additional column migration experiments using different textured vadose zones, either with or without hematite, as a typical Fe oxide. Two scenarios were set, including continuous water infiltration and wet–dry cycling conditions. Field data strongly reflected our lab experiments under wet–dry cycling, suggesting that preferential penetration rather than filtration served as the likely primary mechanism of MP occurrence in subsoil."

This study presents a novel hybrid modeling framework that integrates a process-based hydrodynamic-environmental model with a data-driven approach to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of AMR in coastal waters. Macrolide-related antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs_Macro) were selected as representative markers. The model results were validated using data from a monthly sampling campaign conducted across Singapore’s coastal waters, yielding a mean coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.693, a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.589, and a root-mean-square deviation (RMSE) of 0.0257 GC/16S rRNA across 12 sampling points. Lincomycin, pH, dissolved oxygen, zinc and temperature were identified as significant influencers of ARGs_Macro. Although Lincomycin is not classified as a macrolide, it ranks as the most important driver of ARGs_Macro due to its shared resistance mechanisms with macrolides, potentially facilitating cross-resistance. The spatiotemporal model results revealed that coastal areas, particularly in the northern part of Singapore, are vulnerable to significant ARG accumulation, with monsoon seasons amplifying the spread of AMR due to hydrodynamic conditions. This study highlights the development of a robust modeling framework that provides valuable insights into the environmental drivers of AMR in coastal waters, offering a foundation for regulatory strategies and future research aimed at mitigating the risks of antimicrobial resistance in aquatic environments."

However, the presence of coexisting ions significantly impedes recovery efficiency. Here, we investigate the interference mechanisms of coexisting ions on ammonia recovery using a gas-membrane-coupled FCDI system. Results reveal that a single FCDI cell with 10 wt % carbon mass loading achieves optimal performance (SECw = 1.10 kWh m–3, SECN = 34 kWh kg–1 N, and FE = 91.67%), yet these metrics decline markedly after 2 h due to ammonium back diffusion. This back diffusion is strongly correlated with coexisting ion concentrations and carbon loading in flow electrodes. Double current step tests demonstrate that ammonia transmembrane transport is governed by concentration polarization at the membrane/electrolyte interface induced by coexisting ions. To address this, a parallel FCDI cell is employed to discharge high-salinity brine while recovering energy from the salt gradient. Long-term operation (100 h) validates the system’s robustness, achieving a concentrated ammonia extract of 954 ppm. This study elucidates critical ion interference mechanisms in FCDI-based ammonia recovery and presents a sustainable strategy for enhancing wastewater resource utilization."

Conventional oxidative degradation methods predominantly yield bioaccumulative short-chain fluorinated derivatives, failing to achieve molecular annihilation. We highlight reductive defluorination as a transformative strategy to directly cleave C–F bonds and mitigate toxicity through two distinct electron-transfer modalities: indirect routes mediated by reactive species (e.g., hydrated electrons/active hydrogen) contrasted with direct mechanisms employing biocatalytic or electrochemical systems for targeted electron injection. Mechanistic taxonomy and quantitative structure–reactivity analyses reveal that defluorination efficiency is governed by the molecular architecture (e.g., chain length and fluorination patterns) and operational parameters (e.g., pH, redox potentials, and solution matrices). While standalone reductive technologies face scalability constraints from energy intensity and secondary contamination risks, synergistic integration of bioremediation-electrochemical-photocatalytic systems demonstrates enhanced defluorination efficiency. By coupling molecular-level degradation mechanisms with modular engineering, we propose future directions for developing reductive defluorination, offering a sustainable pathway to eliminate environmental recalcitrance and comply with evolving global water quality mandates."

In this study, we developed a simple and effective modification method for the preparation of an anticombined scaling–biofouling thin-film composite (TFC) nanofiltration membrane via a synergetic strategy based on defensive (i.e., sequestering carboxyl groups) and offensive (i.e., immobilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)) functions. According to the Extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (XDLVO) analysis, the sequestration of carboxyl groups by AMPs diminishes the acid–base polarity interaction between the biofoulants and membranes, playing a critical role in dismantling the bridge of carboxyl–Ca2+–carboxyl and subsequently rendering both scaling ions and carboxyl groups unavailable to fouling. Meanwhile, the immobilization of AMPs on the membranes prevents microbial metabolism and growth by contact-killing mechanisms, endowing the membrane resistance to severe biofouling in the presence of scaling ions. Furthermore, the synergetic effects overcome the permeability–rejection–antifouling trade-off by enhanced water permeance without sacrificing salt rejection. This research provides a novel dimension for developing high-performance TFC membranes for the mitigation of combined scaling–biofouling in the practical application of wastewater treatment and desalination."

 Climate change may amplify the frequency and severity of supply-demand mismatches in future power systems with high shares of wind and solar energy1,2. Here, we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with such climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods—defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (i.e., the most-costly 10% of hours)—are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly due to the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the SSP126 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. Promisingly, the risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply-demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility.

 The interdependence of climate change and agricultural land use remains a critical, yet unquantified, area of concern for future food production. Here we determine climate-driven cropland change based on an empirical model of cropland response to changes in agricultural productivity. By estimating counterfactual total factor productivity in a scenario without climate change, we find that 88 million hectares (90% confidence interval (CI) 5–179 Mha), or 6.3% (90% CI 3.6–12.8%) of the cropland currently used in 110 countries, can be attributed to climate change via reduced agricultural productivity growth over 1992–2020. This area exceeds the observed 3.9% net cropland expansion in the studied countries, indicating that total cropland area would have decreased in the absence of climate effects. The release of about 21.8 GtCO2 (lower/upper bound: 4.4–41.4 GtCO2) could have been prevented without climate-driven cropland change, accounting for about 18.9% (3.8–35.9%) of land-use change emissions in these countries. Climate-driven cropland change also triggered noticeably warmer and drier local climate feedback in some regions, with potential repercussions for food security. The substantial emissions will probably impose further long-term negative impacts on agricultural efficiency.

Here, the authors demonstrate enhanced cross sections due to beyond single-photon excitations in He atoms, facilitating applications in precision spectroscopy. 
 Weak transitions between quantum states are of fundamental importance for a broad range of phenomena from analytical biochemistry to precision physics, but generally challenge experimental detection. Due to their small cross sections scaling with the absolute square of their transition matrix elements, spectroscopic measurements often fail in particular in the presence of competing background processes. Here we introduce a general concept to break this scaling law and enhance the transition probability by exploiting a stronger laser-coupled pathway to the same excited state. We demonstrate the concept experimentally by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in helium atoms. The quasi-forbidden transitions from the ground state 1s2 to the weakly coupled doubly excited 2p3d and sp2,4− states are boosted by an order of magnitude. Enhancing single-photon-suppressed transitions can find widespread applicability, from spectral diagnostics of complex molecules in life and chemical sciences to precision spectroscopy of weak transitions in metastable atomic nuclei in the search for new physics.

 Since the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) in U.S. dairy cattle in early 2024, the virus has spread rapidly, posing a major public health concern as the number of human cases continues to rise.

With no vaccines currently available, antiviral drugs remain the only treatment option. Here, we investigate the efficacy of the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (BXM) against this virus in mice.

Here the authors investigate changes in CD8+ T cell metabolism in iron limiting conditions and find that aspartate is increased yet downstream nucleotide synthesis is suppressed and addition of exogenous aspartate partially rescues T cell function. 
 Iron is an irreplaceable co-factor for metabolism. Iron deficiency affects >1 billion people and decreased iron availability impairs immunity. Nevertheless, how iron deprivation impacts immune cell function remains poorly characterised. We interrogate how physiologically low iron availability affects CD8+ T cell metabolism and function, using multi-omic and metabolic labelling approaches. Iron limitation does not substantially alter initial post-activation increases in cell size and CD25 upregulation. However, low iron profoundly stalls proliferation (without influencing cell viability), alters histone methylation status, gene expression, and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. Glucose and glutamine metabolism in the TCA cycle is limited and partially reverses to a reductive trajectory. Previous studies identified mitochondria-derived aspartate as crucial for proliferation of transformed cells. Despite aberrant TCA cycling, aspartate is increased in stalled iron deficient CD8+ T cells but is not utilised for nucleotide synthesis, likely due to trapping within depolarised mitochondria. Exogenous aspartate markedly rescues expansion and some functions of severely iron-deficient CD8+ T cells. Overall, iron scarcity creates a mitochondrial-located metabolic bottleneck, which is bypassed by supplying inhibited biochemical processes with aspartate. These findings reveal molecular consequences of iron deficiency for CD8+ T cell function, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for immune impairment during iron deficiency. Iron has been shown to be necessary for the activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells.

 Cancer treatment frequently fails due to the evolution of drug-resistant cell phenotypes driven by genetic or non-genetic changes. The origin, timing, and rate of spread of these adaptations are critical for understanding drug resistance mechanisms but remain challenging to observe directly. We present a mathematical framework to infer drug resistance dynamics from genetic lineage tracing and population size data without direct measurement of resistance phenotypes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the framework accurately recovers ground-truth evolutionary dynamics. Experimental evolution to 5-Fu chemotherapy in colorectal cancer cell lines SW620 and HCT116 validates the framework. In SW620 cells, a stable pre-existing resistant subpopulation was inferred, whereas in HCT116 cells, resistance emerged through phenotypic switching into a slow-growing resistant state with stochastic progression to full resistance. Functional assays, including scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq, validate these distinct evolutionary routes. This framework facilitates rapid characterisation of resistance mechanisms across diverse experimental settings.

 The Colorado River system is among the world’s most overallocated basins, struggling to supply water to the southwestern United States and Mexico. Consequently, 90% of the basin’s native fish species are endangered, threatened or extinct. Driven by a 24-year megadrought, the United States allocated over US$4 billion for drought mitigation, including water market transactions that pay farms, cities and industries to divert less water across the US Southwest. We developed a model of how strategic water markets can restore imperilled fish habitat, integrating hydrology, ecology, economics and water rights within the river’s headwater state of Colorado. While least-cost water-use reductions improve over one-third of restorable river habitat, strategically spending 8% more nearly triples habitat improvement. Ten transactions attain 26% of that improvement for 1% of the cost. Water markets that do not legally protect conserved water are 29% less cost-effective than markets that do. Overall, strategic investing and legal reforms yield outsized ecological benefits.

 Changes in storm track intensity and position are key indicators of atmospheric responses to global warming. In this study, we identified a robust northward shift and intensification of midlatitude storm track activity during boreal winters in the North Pacific since the early 1980s. This trend is linked to subtropical tropospheric warming, which has enhanced the midlatitude meridional temperature gradient. This gradient–storm track relationship is evident in both long-term trends and interannual variations. By contrast, Arctic warming weakens near-surface temperature gradients and negatively correlates with storm track activity. Additionally, tropical upper-tropospheric warming appears to strengthen the meridional gradient but induces equatorward shifts in the jet stream and storm track, countering the observed poleward trends. Numerical simulations suggest that the sea surface warming observed in the subtropical North Pacific and Indian Ocean contributes to storm track and circulation changes, providing insights into midlatitude atmospheric dynamics in the context of global warming."

 Several pulses of ocean oxygenation events were recognized in the Ediacaran period. However, the intrinsic triggers behind them remain ambiguous. Here we report phosphorus speciation data from the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation, South China, to elucidate the role of recycled phosphorus in driving ocean oxygenation. High ratios of organic carbon to organic phosphorus in all samples relative to the Redfield ratio generally imply preferential release of phosphorus during the remineralization of organic matter. Notably, ratios of organic carbon to reactive phosphorus exceed the Redfield ratio during purported oxygenation intervals, but fall mostly below or close to the Redfield ratio in the rest of the section. Quantitative calculations suggest that enhanced benthic and water-column recycling created a phosphorus influx into the ocean that was comparable to or outpaced that of weathering input.

 Seismic and geodynamic studies indicate that the boundary between the Earth’s liquid outer core and solid mantle is not spherical, but is likely characterized by topography in the form of inverted mountains and valleys that have typical amplitudes of several kilometers. One of the dynamical consequences of these deformations is that turbulent flow in the core can exert pressure torques on the mantle, thereby resulting in a transfer of angular momentum between the outer core and the mantle. Understanding this transfer of angular momentum is important for explaining variations in the Earth’s rotation rate, or length of day. Whether kilometer-sized topography can explain observed variations in length of day is a longstanding question in geophysics. Here we use a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of hydrodynamic convection in a rotating spherical shell with boundary topography to show that topographic torques exhibit a linear dependence on topographic amplitude and approach a quadratic dependence on flow speeds. This observation is explained with the asymptotic theory of rapidly rotating convection. These results imply that topographic torques are of sufficient magnitude to explain length of day variations.

 Irrigation is a fundamental practice for mitigating crop yield losses from drought and heat extremes. However, the extent to which irrigation moderates crop sensitivity to these stresses and the future quantity of irrigation required to maintain crop yields remain unclear. Here, we use a meta-analysis of maize field experiments across the Ogallala Aquifer to quantify how varying irrigation amounts influence yield sensitivity to heat and drought based on a panel regression model. We find that each 100 mm increase in irrigation reduces heat sensitivity of maize by 7.6%. By the 2050s, offsetting a projected 26% yield decline under a high-emission scenario, primarily driven by intensifying heat stress, would require a 67% increase in irrigation amounts.

 Stratospheric aerosol injection is a proposed method for offsetting greenhouse gas-induced warming by introducing scattering aerosols into the lower stratosphere to reflect sunlight. Here we explore a potentially more efficient alternative: weakening the Earth’s greenhouse effect by deploying absorptive aerosols in the upper stratosphere (~10 hPa). These aerosols warm the carbon dioxide emission level—where outgoing longwave radiation is most sensitive to temperature—thereby enhancing top-of-atmosphere infrared emission without altering atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Idealized climate model simulations indicate that this approach can reduce global temperatures an order of magnitude more efficiently per unit aerosol mass than conventional scattering-based interventions. Although based on simplified model experiments lacking interactive aerosol processes and operational constraints, our results identify a distinct physical mechanism for climate intervention, arguing for further research into the impacts—especially potential unintended side effects—of injecting absorptive aerosols into the upper stratosphere as an alternative solar radiation management strategy.

 Drought affects the health of natural and socio-ecological systems by altering green water evapotranspiration and blue water runoff. However, the global patterns of green and blue water responses to drought remain unclear. Here we quantified drought using root-zone soil moisture reductions and examined the resulting water deficits across different climatic and vegetation conditions. We show that drought generally reduces both evapotranspiration and runoff globally, though with pronounced spatiotemporal variability. In high-latitude humid regions, drought can initially enhance evapotranspiration, whereas runoff responds more rapidly and declines consistently throughout drought periods. Furthermore, drought reduces runoff more than evapotranspiration in humid regions, but the reverse pattern occurs in arid regions. Compared to other vegetation types, forests exhibit smaller drought-induced reductions in evapotranspiration but greater reductions in runoff. These results underscore the importance of considering background climate and vegetation when assessing drought’s hydrological impacts, with important implications for ecohydrological understanding and water resource management.

 International interest is focusing on how to better manage soil organic carbon (SOC) to increase resilience to climate change and reinforce food security. Remote sensing imagery and visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy combined with advanced modeling algorithms can monitor SOC in an efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly manner. However, the limited bands (multi-spectral imagery) as well as the confounding effects such as soil moisture and surface roughness from the satellite may jeopardize the spectral prediction of SOC. We proposed a framework to integrate laboratory spectra with Landsat-8 multispectral data collected in natural real-environments to implement the satellite hyperspectral simulation for SOC prediction and mapping. A soil spectral library (SSL) with 873 samples containing SOC and VNIR-SWIR reflectance was developed in Northeast China. Two pixelwise temporal mosaicking approaches (i.e., averaged bare soil conditions [Median] and dry soil conditions to exclude anomalous values [R90]) were compared for creating bare soil composite images. Fractional-order derivative was explored for spectral preprocessing. Results indicated Median approach outperformed R90 regarding both spectral correlation and the validation performance for SOC. Raw reflectance after hyperspectral image simulation with 201 bands developed by random forest algorithm improved the validation R2 from 0.38 and 0.29 to 0.49 and 0.32 for Median and R90 approaches, respectively, as compared to raw reflectance with six bands. Laboratory spectra yielded higher predicted accuracy for SOC than Median-simulated, followed by R90-simulated hyperspectral images. The convolutional neural network models developed with 0.75-order, 0.75-order, and 1.25-order one-dimensional spectra had the optimal validated performances for laboratory, Median-simulated, and R90-simulated hyperspectral data, respectively, with the corresponding validation R2 values of 0.79, 0.68, and 0.54.

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as an active remote sensing technology with all-weather and all-time capabilities, plays an essential role in environmental monitoring and disaster management. However, SAR employed the coherent imaging mechanism to synthesize images, inevitably introducing speckles in the obtained images. These speckles reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of an image due to the random variation of image pixel value, which brings challenges for subsequent applications. The breakthrough of image registration provides the data requirements for acquiring multi-source remote sensing data. Based on the above study, this paper presents a Gradient Consistency constraints semi-supervised network for Optical image-Assisted SAR despeckling (GCOANet). The presented method generates cross-domain reference images by utilizing optical pixel correlation to conduct the paired SAR reconstruction, thereby mitigating feature misalignment caused by the modal differences between SAR and optical imagery. The conditional diffusion model is then employed to learn the mapping between the SAR and reference images, eliminating the necessity for paired SAR/optical data. The reference image is first generated using a pre-trained conditional diffusion model during the training and test phase. Subsequently, a multi-scale blind spot despeckling network is designed to suppress speckles by fusing SAR and reference features, while also preventing the loss of blind pixel information. Finally, an all-directional gradient loss is proposed to rapidly differentiate homogeneous and heterogeneous regions and achieve separate speckle suppression. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated data verify the effectiveness of the presented method, which retains complete texture details and smooth homogeneous areas. Furthermore, the related applications further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in real-world scenarios."

 Flash floods in the Western Mediterranean pose a growing hazard due to the effects of climate change, rapid urbanization, and land-use changes. This study focuses on flash floods in the Montsià region of southern Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), with particular emphasis on the municipality of Alcanar, because it illustrates the recent intensification of flash flood dynamics in the Western Mediterranean. The research is motivated by three recent severe flood events in Alcanar (2018, 2021, and 2023), each characterized by extraordinary rainfall totals and significant economic losses, unprecedented in the municipality's 30-year observational record. Methodologically, we integrate multiple data sources—including meteorological station observations, weather radar products, lightning detection networks, high-resolution mesoscale model outputs, and a flood database spanning 1980–2023, complemented by economic compensation records from 1996 to 2020. Through this approach we (i) assess the regional frequency of heavy rainfall and flood episodes, (ii) quantify the economic impacts in Alcanar, (iii) characterize the meteorological and thermodynamic conditions on the three most intense recent events (including moisture source tracking via a Lagrangian methodology), and (iv) analyze spatio-temporal trends in extreme rainfall indicators (percentiles, threshold exceedances, kurtosis, and skewness). Our findings suggest that, from a meteorological perspective, current flash flood behavior in the Western Mediterranean likely emerges from the interplay of localized orographic triggers, elevated sea surface temperatures, strong instability associated with low-level moisture, particular positioning of jet streaks, synoptic-scale cut-off lows, and remote moisture sources. The results also point to an increase in rainfall intensity, explained by the presence of high precipitable water content and shallow convection, which enhances precipitation efficiency. These insights highlight the critical need for robust flood early warning systems, strategic watershed management, and improved risk communication to mitigate escalating flash flood risks in the Montsià county and similar areas throughout the Western Mediterranean region."

 The 2022 mega flash drought over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), which occurred without sufficient early warning, substantially affected water supply and hydropower generation. This raises a concern about exploring the precursors of flash droughts to facilitate prediction at subseasonal time scale. Previous studies have indicated that flash droughts are directly affected by insufficient precipitation and corresponding circulation anomalies. However, how intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) provide possible precursors and affect the drought onset remains unclear. Based on the analysis of flash droughts over the YRB during 1961–2022, we find that 38.9 % and 16.7 % of them are influenced by 10–20-day and 20–60-day mid-latitude ISOs, respectively. Although 10–20-day ISOs trigger more flash droughts, 20–60-day ISOs are more favorable for accelerating the onset speed of flash droughts. Specifically, the 10–20-day ISOs trigger eastward Rossby waves, promoting the eastward shift of the South Asian High and enhancing subsidence over the YRB, thereby contributing to flash drought onset. The 20–60-day ISOs are associated with the stagnation of a Circumglobal Teleconnection, and facilitating the superposition of the South Asian High and the Western Pacific Subtropical High, accelerating flash droughts onset. Although the impact of different timescales of ISOs on flash droughts varies, their combined effects are a critical factor in triggering mega flash droughts over the YRB. Our study suggests transitions from wet phases to dry phases of ISOs are critical precursors for flash drought early warning."

 This study proposed a performance-enhancement-oriented evaluation system to inspect the performance of three integrated multi-satellite retrievals of global precipitation measurement (IMERG) products (early run (IMERG ER), late run (IMERG LR), and final run (IMERG FR)) during Typhoon In-Fa, the strongest typhoon on record to make landfall in mainland China in 2021. The new system for comparing hourly IMERG V07 and V06 products at one gauge and ranking all gauge stations in the gauge group is called the increment-ranking scoring index (ISI). The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Compared to IMERG V06, IMERG V07 demonstrates better typhoon precipitation detection capability and higher stability. Although the V07 has improved the problem of underestimating hourly rainfall events, the increasing number of precipitation overestimations across all gauges still raises concerns. (2) The gauge groups with high ISI values demonstrate satisfactory performance in satellite-derived precipitation estimates, while those characterized by high ΔKGE (delta Kling-Gupta Efficiency) values perform less satisfactorily. Higher ISI values (more significant enhancements by V07) are more commonly observed in the coastal region than in the inland region. By introducing the ISI for comprehensive performance evaluation of IMERG V07 and V06 during Typhoon In-Fa, a performance-enhancement-oriented evaluation system proposed in this study is intuitive and concise in revealing the advances of IMERG V07 when monitoring and reconstructing typhoon processes."

In contrast, a small subset of genes is up-regulated incsr-1mutants, includingmorc-1, which encodes a conserved GHKL-type ATPase. We show thatmorc-1is overexpressed incsr-1mutants and accumulates over CSR-1 licensed targets, coinciding with aberrant gain of H3K9me3, reduced H3K36me3, and transcriptional repression. Notably, loss ofmorc-1fully rescues these chromatin defects and partially restores gene expression and fertility incsr-1mutants. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MORC-1 in the wild-type germ line is sufficient to repress CSR-1 licensed targets and severely compromise fertility. These findings support a model in which CSR-1 prevents MORC-1 overexpression and consequent misregulation of CSR-1 licensed genes."

We show that at the peak of acute inflammatory pain, superficial medullary dorsal horn projection neurons (PNs) that relay nociceptive information to the parabrachial nucleus reduce their intrinsic excitability and, consequently, action potential firing. When pain resolves, the excitability of these neurons returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current (IA) underlies the decrease in the excitability of medullary dorsal horn PNs in acute pain conditions. In chronic pain conditions, no changes ofIAwere observed, and medullary dorsal horn PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal a differential modulation of the excitability of medullary dorsal horn projection neurons in acute and chronic pain conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that, in acute pain conditions, tunes the output of the dorsal horn and, if lacking, could facilitate pain chronification."

However, large size poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding nutrient transport: These constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations. Here, we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism—spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically generated density gradients—can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by ciliary actuation in extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a “biophysical scaffold” to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities before genetically encoded innovations."

Unlike light, which can phase delay or advance the central pacemaker, stressors consistently induce delays, effects attenuated by inhibiting aPVT neurons. Stressors robustly activate AVP-expressing neurons within the SCN and are associated with inhibition of VIP-expressing neurons, whereas light strongly activates VIP-expressing neurons with minimal effects on AVP-expressing neurons. Pairing stressors with light reveals distinct time-dependent interactions, enhancing phase delays at early night but abolishing phase advances at late night.

When combined, collagen networks rigidify via synergistic mechanical interactions and stiffen only with higher mechanical loads. However, how cells respond to the nonlinear elasticity of collagen in hybrid networks remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that when collagen rigidifies by the interpenetration of a second polymer, the amount of force that initially stiffens the network (onset of stiffening, σc) increases and is sufficient to stimulate an increase in intracellular tension. We investigated this effect by precisely controlling the nonlinear elasticity of collagen with the synthetic semiflexible polymer, polyisocyanopeptides. We find that small increases in σcinduce a biphasic response in cell-matrix interactions, influencing how cells migrate, proliferate, and generate contractile force. Our results suggest that cells adaptively respond to changes in the nonlinear mechanics of collagen, which may be a mechanistic behavior used during tissue homeostasis or when collagen rigidifies during pathological conditions."

We used artificial selection to experimentally test the impact of adult predation on the evolution of life history and morphology in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We found that, compared to control fish, predation-selected fish produced larger offspring and larger broods early in life. However, other life history parameters, such as interbrood interval and total number of offspring, showed no response. We also found that predation selected for smaller and lighter females and for shorter tails and gonopodia in males, with no effect on body coloration. Our results show that while several traits evolve fast under selection on adult predation, several “classic” predation-dependent traits seem unaffected by predation selection. By comparing our experimental results to those from natural populations, we can disentangle the contribution of direct and indirect effects on trait evolution under predation pressure."

Nematic phases have been discovered in a variety of systems, including liquid crystals, correlated materials, and superconductors. Here, we report on a magnetic nematic phase, where the basis components are composed of magnetic helices. We directly probed the order parameters associated with the magnetic helices using resonant soft x-ray scattering and find two distinct nematic phases with complex spatiotemporal signatures. Using x-ray correlation spectroscopy, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on multiple disparate timescales. Our micromagnetic simulations and density functional theory calculations show that the fluctuations occur concomitantly with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of additional degrees of freedom. Our results provide a framework for characterizing exotic phases that can be extended to a broad class of physical systems."

Here, we identify IL-17 as a novel driver of LKB1-dependent polyp growth. GI tumors from mice bearing heterozygous mutations inStk11(which encodes LKB1) display signatures of pathogenic IL-17–producing CD4+T helper 17 (TH17) cells. LKB1 constrains T cell inflammatory potential, asStk11/LKB1 haploinsufficiency promotes T cell differentiation toward pathogenic IL-17–producing T cell lineages (CD4+TH17 and CD8+Tc17) in vitro and following intestinal infection. Mechanistically, aberrant CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)–dependent signaling drives pathogenic TH17 cell programs downstream of LKB1 haploinsufficiency. Targeting this circuit via CRTC2 deletion or IL-17 blockade antagonizes GI polyp growth in mouse models of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to current therapies or experience intolerable side effects. Transcriptomic characterization of murine and human PNF at bulk and single-cell resolution identified transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling as a key upstream regulator, driving aberrant basement membrane (BM) protein production by neoplastic Schwann cells and Fbs. Conditional TGFβ1 overexpression inNf1-deficient Schwann cells driven byHoxb7-Cre promoted PNF growth and malignant transformation in vivo. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of the type I TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI) reduced PNF tumor burden inNf1mutant mice.

The optical drive of coherent magnetic collective excitations, namely magnons, represents a promising route. The ability to arbitrarily and nonthermally increase the magnon frequencies with laser pulses could enable this progress. However, this effect has not been reported to date. To achieve it, here, we explore the optical resonant excitation of high-momentum magnons, which experimentally are observed to couple to low-momentum magnons, modifying the frequencies and amplitudes thereof. This evidence, not caused by laser heating, is explained with a resonant light-scattering mechanism coupling high- and low-momentum eigenmodes across momentum space.

The boundary between amorphous plagioclase and crystalline high-pressure phases in our phase diagram indicate diaplectic glass can form at 1300 to 1500 kelvin, and the melting line suggests that maskelynite can be generated above 3000 kelvin at high pressures.

Here, we investigated the CCF process, iron-bound organic carbon (Fe-OC), and chemoautotrophs through FeS-amended and in situ field samples in estuarine and coastal sediments. The CCF rates and Fe-OC concentrations were substantially enhanced by FeS addition and were significantly higher under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Sulfide rather than Fe2+ facilitated CCF rates, while more Fe-OC formation was caused by Fe2+. More humic substances, aromatic protein, and high diffraction intensity in the presence of FeS indicated that iron oxides protect organic carbon against microbial degradation. The enhanced abundance of functional genes in relation to nitrification, sulfide, and iron oxidation, as well as cbbL and cbbM genes synchronously, favored the CCF process and Fe-OC formation. The CCF rates and Fe-OC concentrations were also higher in Fe2+─and sulfide-enriched field sediments, and a positive feedback relationship was observed between Fe-OC formation and the CCF process.

However, the impact of complex exogenous DOM on soil microbial activity and C–Fe coupling in paddy soils remains underexplored. With a 100-day microcosm experiment, we found that biochar-DOM significantly promoted Fe reduction and accelerated CH4 and CO2 emissions, and manure-DOM increased soil CO2 emissions. These effects may be caused by the following mechanisms: DOM molecules with high aromaticity and high double bond equivalence (DBE), including lignins-polyphenols, lignins-polycyclic aromatics, and condensed aromatics-polycyclic aromatics, promoted soil Fe reduction and CH4 emissions with enrichment of soil Fe-reducing bacteria, r-strategists, and reduction of methanotrophs at the early stage of incubation. Conversely, DOM with low aromaticity, low DBE, and high H/C enhanced CO2 emissions with the enhancement of recalcitrant C degradation and CH4 oxidation at the late stage of incubation. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the molecular composition of organic amendment-derived DOM in regulating soil Fe reduction and greenhouse gas emissions.

 Phytochromes are biliprotein photoreceptors widespread amongst microorganisms and ubiquitous in plants where they control developmental processes as diverse as germination, stem elongation and floral induction through the photoconversion of inactive Pr to the Pfr signalling state. Here we report crystal structures of the chromophore-binding module of soybean phytochrome A, including ~2.2 Å XFEL structures of Pr and Pfr at ambient temperature and high resolution cryogenic structures of Pr. In the Pfr structure, the chromophore is exposed to the medium, the D-ring remaining α-facial following the likely clockwise photoflip. The chromophore shifts within its pocket, while its propionate side chains, their partners as well as three neighbouring tyrosines shift radically. Helices near the chromophore show substantial shifts that might represent components of the light signal. These changes reflect those in bacteriophytochromes despite their quite different signalling mechanisms, implying that fundamental aspects of phytochrome photoactivation have been repurposed for photoregulation in the eukaryotic plant.

 Future changes in rainfall over India are critically important, given their impact on millions of people and the country’s agriculture. However, most studies focus only on changes up to the year 2100, leaving long-term projections largely unexplored. In this study, we leverage a 10-member ensemble with an Earth system model under relatively strong emissions to examine rainfall changes over India to 2500. Our results show a pronounced weakening of large-scale monsoon circulation after 2100, mainly due to increased atmospheric stability caused by rapid warming in the upper troposphere over land. At the same time, the Indian monsoon system expands significantly to the north and west. The northward expansion is driven by accelerated warming over the Tibetan Plateau, which pushes the low-level monsoonal winds and pressure systems further north. This, along with the development of a strong anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, leads to more consistent upward motion over northern India and a northward expansion of the monsoon. Meanwhile, the westward expansion is linked to uneven warming in the Indian Ocean as the warm pool shifts westwards. These circulation changes, combined with the asymmetric warming pattern, enhance northward moisture transport and contribute to the intensification of rainfall across northwestern and northern India post-2100. These local expressions of large-scale perturbations provide a mechanistic framework for informing long-term mitigation and adaptation efforts for India."

 The coupling between the lithosphere and mantle dynamics is important for Earth’s tectonic movement and deformation. Plate driving forces changing from subduction to viscous flow drag can potentially explain the continuous plate convergence where subducting slabs are detached. However, tectonic expressions in different slab detachment scenarios are inconsistent and the role of mantle flow in plate convergence remains enigmatic. Through numerical modeling, we demonstrate that plate convergence can be caused by mantle flow induced by slab detachment and regulated by lithospheric mantle-ridge interaction. Spreading ridge-trench collision has minimal effects on the deformation of overriding plates, whereas continent-trench collision can lead to substantial tectonic uplift at suture zones. Mid-ocean ridges bounding incoming plates accelerate plate motion in ridge-trench collision scenarios and induce considerable tectonic uplift in continent-trench collision scenarios, as evidenced by the acceleration of the Farallon-Pacific ridge spreading and the rapid uplift of the Himalayas after slab detachment episodes.

 Earth’s crustal materials are recycled into the mantle through subduction, but the depth and nature of recycled components remain debated. Here we report copper (Cu) isotope evidence for the involvement of recycled crustal materials in a deep-mantle plume source. Permian mantle plume-derived picrites and basalts from the Emeishan large igneous province (Southwest China), excluding three hydrothermally altered outliers, exhibit δ65Cu values up to 0.65‰, obviously higher than typical mantle values (0.07 ± 0.10‰). The δ65Cu values show no correlation with loss-on-ignition (LOI), Mg#, ƐNd(t), Cu/Th, Cu/Pd, or redox state, ruling out magma differentiation or post-magmatic alteration. Instead, the elevated δ65Cu values most plausibly reflect recycled crustal sulfides with elevated δ65Cu value in the mantle source. These findings provide robust evidence for the recycling of Cu-rich sulfides into the deep mantle (potentially the lower mantle), elucidating the ultra-deep geochemical cycling of copper and sulfur within Earth’s interior.

 Oligo-Miocene strata in the northern North Sea comprise hundreds of enigmatic km-scale sand-cored mounds. We investigated these using a basin-scale 3D seismic dataset coupled with petrophysical logs and cuttings mineralogy for hundreds of wells. Here we document the discovery of ‘sinkites’, large-scale sand bodies that have sunk into and underpin low-density bio-silicious ooze rafts, violating the law of superposition. The stratigraphic inversion is attributed to buoyancy instabilities between km-scale rigid low density ooze rafts and liquefied, younger, denser, unconsolidated sand. The sand slurry dislodged the ooze as rafts, delimited by early-stage polygonal faults formed due to volumetric contraction of underlying ooze packages. Akin to load casts, but orders of magnitude bigger, ‘sinkites’ introduce a new large-scale gravitational process into geology. Their discovery and association to fractured low density ooze is important to stratigraphy and assessments of reservoir, seal and fluid flow in petroleum and CO2 storage projects and may have other implications.

 In September 2023, a spatially compounding event affected Europe, with an intense heatwave over northern France and nearly simultaneous extreme floods over the Iberian Peninsula and Greece. These extremes were accompanied by a low-high-low pressure system known as Omega pattern. However, the capability of climate models to reproduce such complex extremes and related atmospheric circulations is still unclear. By introducing a novel index, here we show that the 2023 event was not unique yet most extreme in recent decades. Using ensemble boosting, the fully-coupled Community Earth System Model 2 can reproduce such co-occurring extremes with remarkably similar configurations of the large-scale flow and even higher heatwave/rainfall than observed. This suggests that similar compounding events with even stronger intensity could, in principle, occur. However, such spatially compounding events are too rare in the model relative to reanalysis, suggesting that the model may underestimate their future occurrence in a warming climate.

 Foliar exchange of methane and nitrous oxide is a significant yet poorly understood component of global greenhouse gas budgets. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated foliar methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in Salix bebbiana, under varying light conditions (0–2000 μmol·m−2·s−1), soil aeration, and nitrogen availability, manipulated via biochar incorporation and nitrogen additions. Using rapid spectroscopic gas analysers, we observed consistent net foliar methane oxidation and nitrous oxide emission across all light conditions, demonstrating saturating light response patterns. Maximum flux rates were significantly more sensitive to soil conditions than carbon dioxide or water vapour exchange. Analysis revealed foliar methane and nitrous oxide fluxes overwhelmingly regulated by internal leaf processes like xylem transport, with modulation by external light intensity. These predictable light-response patterns provide a basis for scaling leaf-level methane and nitrous oxide fluxes, enhancing accuracy in predicting biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes within ecosystem and biosphere models.

 Rapid and accurate monitoring of surface water is critical for water resource management, environmental protection, sustainable urban development, among other issues. Landsat and Sentinel data are publicly available optical data with high spatial and temporal resolution, providing the possibility for large-scale surface water mapping. However, traditional threshold-based or supervised classification-based surface water mapping methods often require adjusting thresholds or training samples for different areas or different sensors, which may hinder the generalization performance of the method in large-scale water body mapping. To address these difficulties, we propose an unsupervised cross-sensor deep learning water bodies mapping framework (UUCP) for unlabeled large-scale optical remote sensing images. The UUCP framework adopts an unsupervised multi-segment thresholding strategy to achieve the transition from label-free learning to noisy label learning. It learns robust multi-scale features of water bodies by the developed channel attention multi-scale surface water extraction network and training strategies under noisy labels. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images from Guangzhou and Wuhan in China, and nine regions in France. The results show that our proposed method performs well in the overall performance of water extraction and is applicable to different sensors, with Kappa values reaching an average of 0.8859 and 0.8084 on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively. More importantly, in cross-sensor experiments (the model trained on Landsat-8 data directly predicts Sentinel-2 dataset), the UUCP algorithm has excellent performance and is superior to other traditional water extraction algorithms. Overall, UUCP has excellent generalization ability and provides a new perspective for large-scale surface water mapping."

 PAZ mission is an X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite launched by Spain in February 2018, capable of routinely acquiring images with high spatio-temporal resolution. In this paper, we explore the potential of spotlight-mode (HS) PAZ images for monitoring small-scale ground deformation with millimeter-level accuracy, utilizing 21 HS PAZ images acquired over the Alcoy basin (SE Spain) between September 2019 and February 2021. Phase unwrapping and long-wavelength atmospheric delays significantly impede high-accuracy estimation of small-scale ground deformation in the study area. To address these issues, we first propose an approach for correcting phase unwrapping errors in interferograms by incorporating constraints from both spatial and temporal domains. Subsequently, we propose a block-based correction algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) to mitigate long-wavelength errors in the interferograms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively eliminate long-wavelength errors in interferograms after both traditional phase-based method and GACOS corrections, reducing the standard deviation of the interferograms by up to a maximum of 68.4 %, and a value of 37.7 % on average. External validations from GPS and topographic measurements confirm that the deformation time series derived from the proposed method show an accuracy higher than 3 mm. This means millimeter-level precision is achieved in small-scale ground deformation measurements using PAZ SAR images. The analysis of the ground deformation derived from PAZ images reveals 41 active deformation areas in the Alcoy basin between September 2019 and February 2021, each that exhibits a deformation rate exceeding 5 mm/year. Through independent component analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering, we identify three distinct temporal evolution patterns corresponding to landslide activities, land subsidence, and land settlements. This study serves as a methodological blueprint for high-accuracy ground deformation estimation using high-resolution PAZ imagery, offering valuable complementary data to conventional medium-resolution SAR systems (e.g., Sentinel-1) in ground deformation monitoring applications."

 Surface water monitoring is fundamental for managing water resources and sustaining life in arid regions worldwide. Egypt is an arid country in Northern Africa, and the surface water is critical for ecosystem health, agricultural production, and human livelihoods. During dry seasons, Egyptian water bodies exhibit unique challenges for remote sensing detection due to their significant spectral differences, complex morphological patterns, and numerous small streams. However, existing water detection methods face challenges in accurately identifying water bodies with high spatial and spectral variability, especially in arid regions during dry seasons. This paper proposes an improved U-Net model with multi-scale information and attention mechanism for precise surface water mapping by multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The extraction accuracy can be improved by combining convolutional layers for local feature extraction with Vision Transformer using Manhattan self-attention for global context information. Our model attains optimal performance with IoU, F1-score, recall, and precision reaching 94.26%, 97.05%, 98.18%, and 95.94%, respectively, compared to traditional machine learning methods, particularly in challenging areas with small water bodies, complex backgrounds, and eutrophic water boundaries.

 The choice of transportation mode by residents significantly affects road traffic carbon emissions. Recent studies have explored the carbon reduction effects of green travel behaviors, such as bicycle-sharing and metro travel. However, there remains a gap in research estimating the carbon reduction potential associated with the transition from motorized transport to low-carbon alternatives. In this study, we propose a carbon emission reduction scenario simulation framework based on vehicle trajectory big data. This framework is designed to evaluate the impact of shifts in residential travel modes on carbon emissions at a fine spatial and temporal scale. Our analyses indicate that only 7.2 % of car trips are suitable for a shift to active transportation options, while over 64 % of trips qualify as multimodal, particularly involving e-bikes in combination with metro, which can result in annual carbon reductions of up to 3,138 tons. This highlights the importance of multimodal transport in reducing transportation-related carbon emissions. Regarding the spatial pattern, peripheral areas present substantial carbon reduction potential, accounting for nearly 50 % of the total. Moreover, significant carbon reduction potential exists in road sections connecting central and peripheral areas. In terms of timing, we observe two peaks in emission reductions on weekdays, occurring between 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM, with an additional peak on weekends around 9 PM. Ultimately, our research highlights that multimodal transportation, especially the combination of walking or conventional cycling with metro, may offer greater carbon reduction efficiency than relying solely on active transportation options.

The superiority of DCA is demonstrated in three geographic mapping tasks, including urban function mapping, region popularity mapping, and housing price mapping.

 Urban functional zones shape both the configuration of the physical environment and the ways individuals perceive and interact with urban spaces.

This study proposes an analytical framework to investigate such associations in Beijing, China, by integrating street view images (SVIs), panoptic segmentation, and machine learning models. Specifically, we extracted nine objective features and six subjective perceptions from SVIs and modeled their nonlinear associations across different functional zones using 36 XGBoost models combined with SHAP analyses. Model performance was robust, with XGBoost achieving the highest average R2 (0.221) and one of the lowest average RMSE values (0.031) compared to four baseline machine learning models, underscoring its generalizability across perception dimensions and functional zone types. The results reveal three key findings. First, road users and safety barriers consistently ranked among the top contributors to subjective perceptions across all functional zones, while elements like traffic signs exhibited zone-specific effects. Second, the nonlinear associations exhibited varying threshold effects across functional zones, highlighting the context-dependent influence of environmental factors; for example, greenery visibility reduced safety perception in residential zones but enhanced it in commercial zones. Third, typical nonlinear patterns, including V-shaped and threshold effects, were observed, reflecting phenomena such as sensory saturation and diminishing marginal utility.

 Soil moisture change and surface erosion provide unique insight into the evolution of desert ecohydrology and geomorphology in hyper-arid areas under increasing hydroclimatic extremes. However, the spatial and temporal distributions of the transitional changes in soil moisture and surface erosion associated with sparse rainstorm events are not yet well-characterized due to the low spatial resolution (a few kilometers) of the current microwave radiometer and scarce temporal acquisition and SAR orbital observations, respectively. To address this deficiency, we apply three processing techniques to monitor these changes at a spatial resolution of 45–105 m and with a limited dataset covering four precipitation events of different magnitudes over the hyper-arid Qatar peninsula from 2017 to 2019. Two of the techniques are based on radar interferometric coherence using Sentinel-1C-band satellite data, as the investigated rainstorm events generate measurable isolated changes in the time-series coherence associated with variations in transient soil moisture and surface erosion. The third technique employs soil moisture indices derived from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery. Our observations indicate that the timing of satellite acquisitions relative to a rainstorm is the primary factor in selecting the appropriate technique for identifying soil moisture change, surface erosion, or both. As a result, we integrate these three techniques into a decision-tree to guide users in their methodological choices. Moreover, this decision-tree approach can further improve the assessment of erosion hotspots, flood risks and ecohydrological and geomorphological changes of deserts caused by the current fluctuations in rainstorm events over hyper-arid areas due to hydroclimate volatility."

Catheterizations are effective approaches for treating vascular diseases; however, they face challenges in accessibility, efficiency, and invasiveness in narrow, tortuous vascular systems. This study presents a submillimeter magnetically actuated soft rotatable-tipped microcatheter (MSRM) designed to access small blood vessels and provide efficient, minimally invasive therapeutic interventions for blood clot treatment. The MSRM’s rotatable tip design enhances accessibility and navigation speed through a rotation-assisted active steering strategy. Improved blood clot treatment efficiency is achieved through the MSRM’s multifunctionality: It can accelerate drug-blood clot interactions, mechanically break down blood clots, and retrieve clot debris. The low invasiveness is attributed to the soft material design and conservative actuation strategy. The performance of the MSRM is validated in both in vitro phantom studies and in vivo rabbit models, and the invasiveness is evaluated using a human placenta model."

Using supercomputing and artificial intelligence algorithms, we analyzed a high-resolution global dataset of fusuline foraminifera—the most diverse marine fossil group from the Carboniferous to the Permian (~340 to 252 million years ago)—at an unprecedented temporal resolution of <45 thousand years. Our unbinned diversity reconstruction reveals unexpectedly simple diversity dynamics in this exceptionally well-preserved clade. We identify two (and likely a third) truncated exponential diversifications and four major diversity declines.

Here, fifty-one multilingual volunteers were recruited to speak same-semantic dialogues in three languages selected from eight different languages studied to investigate the emission characteristics of exhaled aerosol across languages. The findings revealed that the size of exhaled aerosol particles generated by speaking was predominantly concentrated below 1 μm. The emission loads of exhaled aerosols during speaking and the associated potential risk of aerosol transmission across languages showed notable discrepancies. Additionally, the individual physiological factors such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI) also jointly influenced the exhaled aerosols during speaking. The machine learning model of random forest regression further revealed that language differences had a considerably greater impact on size-resolved exhaled aerosol emission concentrations than gender, but not than BMI. Thus, different language usages can influence the emission concentrations of exhaled aerosol during speaking, thereby impacting the potential for aerosol transmission across languages. This linguistic-induced diversity of transmission potentials could have played a non-negligible role in the disparate global dissemination patterns observed in aerosol-transmitted pandemics including COVID-19."

 The increasing frequency of climate extremes and natural disasters demands rapid and scalable Earth surface scans for effective action. Emerging as a novel remote sensing technique, spaceborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) plays an increasingly vital role in monitoring Earth’s surface parameters. Recent studies leverage the growing volume of GNSS-R measurements with data-driven approaches to enhance retrieval products over both ocean and land. Yet, these models are typically trained using supervised learning, which requires extensive feature engineering and application-specific annotations. To address these limitations, we propose the first GNSS-R self-supervised learning framework as a generalist Earth surface monitor (GEM). Our model is pretrained on multimodal observables, i.e., delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) and auxiliary parametric data, to learn cross-modal representations from GNSS-R data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we fine-tune the pretrained model on various downstream retrieval tasks, including ocean wind speed retrieval, surface soil moisture estimation, and vegetation water content prediction.

 Ensuring fairness in machine learning applications is critical, yet it remains underexplored in crop type mapping. While the consequences of imbalanced classes for supervised classification tasks are known to the field of Earth Observation, assessing classification results for sub-groups of societally sensitive attributes, such as parcel size in crop mapping, have received little attention. To address this gap, we evaluate established class imbalance correction methods: Random Oversampling (RO), Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE), and Focal Loss (FL); and two novel approaches that target both class imbalance and the performance disparity between small and large parcels: Random Oversampling with Resampling (RO-R), and Double Objective Weighted Cross Entropy (DOWCE). RO-R increases the representation of smaller parcels by redistributing random samples, whereas DOWCE applies higher penalties to the misclassification of smaller parcels. Hybrid methods (RO-DOWCE and RO-FL) were also evaluated. To assess their generalizability under varying conditions, the methods were tested on ten diverse datasets subsampled from the BreizhCrops dataset, covering Brittany, France. Results showed that RO-DOWCE was the most effective method at addressing class imbalance across the datasets, though not significantly different from RO-R, RO, and RO-FL. Additionally, cost-sensitive methods were generally less efficient at addressing class imbalance than sample balancing and hybrid approaches. These findings illustrate how broader discussions on Responsible AI and fairness are relevant for Earth Observation applications such as crop type mapping. Furthermore, the strategies to increase fairness presented here can be applied to classification tasks outside the domain of crop mapping."

 A series of experiments was conducted to characterize a medium-sized 27-m3 smog chamber, KIST atmospheric processes simulation chamber (K-CAPS) in terms of the gas and particle wall losses, spectrum of light sources, and background reactivity and evaluate its suitability for simulating atmospheric reactions. Photo-oxidation experiments using a toluene and NOx mixture were then carried out to investigate the effects of the UV lamp type, UV intensity, and ammonium sulfate seeds on the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and O3, and on the physicochemical properties of SOA including hygroscopicity. When UVA and UVB lamps were used together, formation of SOA and O3 was faster than that for UVA lamps alone. And higher UV intensity also resulted in faster formation of SOA and O3, but the increase in O3 with accumulated OH exposure and the increase in SOA with reacted toluene concentrations are consistent regardless of photolysis rate of NO2 implying that increment in UV intensity can be acceptable to shorten the experiment time for relatively long aging processes such as multiday reactions. More SOA and less O3 were formed when ammonium sulfate seeds were initially injected and average RH was relatively higher, compared to the dry experiment without seeds.

A pronounced dipole pattern is identified in TC IR trends over the past four decades, characterized by decreases (increases) in the northwest (southeast) NA. While thermodynamic factors have generally become more favorable for intensification across the entire NA, dynamical factors, primarily vertical wind shear, exhibit a dipole trend closely aligned with observed IR changes. Quantitative analyses indicate that the decreasing TC IR in the northwest NA is primarily driven by deteriorating environmental dynamical conditions linked closely with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Conversely, the IR increase in the southeast NA is mainly attributable to enhanced thermodynamic conditions associated with global warming.

The method specifically targets signatures of horizontal and vertical gradients in ice and water that appear in the polarization of the lidar signals. The method was tested against direct measurements of the cloud properties collected by a second aircraft. 
 A technique was developed to provide cloud phase information using data collected by the NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar systems with a particular emphasis on mixed-phase cloud conditions, where boundaries and gradients in the distribution of ice and liquid water are critically important for microphysical and radiative processes. The method is based on the established use of depolarization to identify ice particles but incorporates a new method to separate the ice depolarization from the depolarization produced by multiple scattering in dense liquid clouds. Clouds known to be liquid-only based on ambient temperature were used to train an empirical model of the multiple-scattering depolarization that results at different ranges from the lidar. The method classifies lidar observations as liquid-dominant, mixed-phase, and ice-dominant and has an additional categorization for oriented ice. For evaluation of the retrieval, a two-aircraft approach was used with the lidar observing the same clouds that were concurrently being sampled with in situ microphysical probes. Aircraft matchups were able to track the individual cloud elements and capture marked changes in the distribution of liquid and ice across flight segments of typically 20–100 km. Qualitative features relating to localized changes in the cloud-top temperature, cloud morphology, and convective circulations were generally replicated between the lidar phase classification and the in situ microphysical data. Quantitative evaluation of the phase classification was carried out using a subset of 15 cloud scenes that satisfied strict aircraft collocation and microphysical requirements. Using the in situ microphysical data, it was found that ice extinction fractions of 14 % and 76 % most closely matched the upper and lower bounds of the lidar mixed-phase classification."

The Base Flow Index underscores groundwater’s crucial role in stabilizing and regulating surface water, particularly in forested basins.

Together with scientists from the Technical University of Denmark, they proposed an interesting interpretation of recorded gravity data, which enables direct comparison of gravity measurements to quasi-geoid models. The proposed interpretation provides useful information for geodesy, geophysics, and navigation. 
 Regional coverage of marine areas by data from marine gravity measurements is important in geodesy and geophysics. However, interpretation of recorded gravity data is still a challenge. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting gravity data using two related, but slightly different methods. The first method involves gravity anomalies, while the second employs gravity disturbances. The main objective of this paper, apart from publishing in some detail the theory behind the two methods, is to demonstrate and briefly discuss the differences in the results. The cause of these different results are mainly interpretation errors in extracting, from marine gravimeter readings, the corrected readings caused by the gravity signal. We show that when both methods are applied to the same data set, which is available at https://doi.org/10.34808/30k6-fj34 (Pyrchla Krzysztof et al., 2025), a model of the marine geoid along the survey lines can be obtained. This can be used either as a direct estimate of the geoid or as an additional constraint by which we can detect and correct the interpretation errors."

Yet, they mainly oversee critical local processes. This paper presents and demonstrates the inclusion of wastewater treatment and reuse into a global hydrological model. As a result, model performance improves, and models consider treated wastewater as an alternative water source. 
 Wastewater treatment and reuse are becoming increasingly critical for enhancing water use efficiency and ensuring reliable water availability. Wastewater also significantly influences hydrological dynamics within urban watersheds. Although hydrological modeling has advanced to incorporate human–water interactions, large-scale and multi-resolution models often lack the comprehensive integration of wastewater treatment and reuse processes. This paper presents the new wastewater treatment and reuse module as part of the hydrological Community Water Model (CWatM) and demonstrates its capabilities and advantages in an urban watershed with intermittent flows. Incorporating wastewater into the model improves model performance by better representing low and peak flows during the respective dry and wet seasons. It allows for the representation of sectoral wastewater reuse, the exploration of different measures to increase wastewater reuse, and the examination of the effects of wastewater reuse on the water stress level. Modeling wastewater treatment and reuse is particularly relevant in regions with semi-arid or arid climates, rapid urbanization, or active policies promoting water reuse. The wastewater treatment and reuse module could be upscaled by minimizing the data requirements via simplified workflows. Combined with the availability of recent datasets on wastewater treatment plants and processes, a global application of the module is feasible. As current developments focus on water quantity, the water quality dimension of wastewater treatment remains a limitation. This opens prospects for incorporating water quality into the model and developing global input data for wastewater treatment and reuse."

Bieri;Francina Dominguez;Gonzalo Miguez-Macho;Ying Fan,Implementing deep soil and dynamic root uptake in Noah-MP (v4.5): impact on Amazon dry-season transpiration,"Access to deep moisture below the Earth's surface is important for vegetation in areas of the Amazon where there is little precipitation for part of the year. Most existing numerical models of the Earth system do not adequately capture where and when deep root water uptake occurs. We address this by adding deep soil layers and a root water uptake feature to an existing model. Out modifications lead to increased dry-month transpiration and improved simulation of the annual transpiration cycle. 
 Plant roots act as critical pathways of moisture from the subsurface to the atmosphere. Deep moisture uptake by plant roots can provide a seasonal buffer mechanism in regions with a well-defined dry season, such as the southern Amazon. Here, mature forests maintain transpiration (a critical source of atmospheric moisture in this part of the world) during drier months. Most existing state-of-the-art Earth system models do not have the necessary features to simulate subsurface-to-atmosphere moisture variations during dry-downs. These features include groundwater dynamics, a sufficiently deep soil column, dynamic root water uptake (RWU), and a fine model spatial resolution (<5 km).To address this, we present DynaRoot, a dynamic root water uptake scheme implemented in the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model, a widely used model for studying kilometer-scale regional land surface processes. Our modifications include the implementation of DynaRoot, eight additional resolved soil layers reaching a depth of 20 mm, and soil properties that vary with depth. DynaRoot is computationally efficient and ideal for regional- or continental-scale climate simulations. We perform four 20-year uncoupled Noah-MP experiments for a region in the southern Amazon basin. Each experiment incrementally adds physical complexity. The experiments include the default Noah-MP with free drainage (FD), a case with an activated groundwater scheme that resolves water table variations (GW), a case with eight added soil layers and soil properties that vary with depth (SOIL), and a case with DynaRoot activated (ROOT).Our results show that DynaRoot allows mature forests in upland regions to avoid water stress during dry periods by taking up moisture from the deep vadose zone (where antecedent precipitation still drains downward). Conversely, RWU in valleys can access moisture from groundwater (while remaining constrained by the water table). Temporally, we capture a seasonal shift in RWU from shallower layers in wetter months to deeper soil layers in drier months, particularly over regions with dominant evergreen broadleaf (forest) vegetation. Compared to the control case, there is a domain-averaged increase in transpiration of about 29 % during dry months in the ROOT experiment. Critically, the ROOT experiment performs best in simulating the temporal evolution of dry-season transpiration using an observation-based ET (evapotranspiration) product as the reference. Future work will explore the effect of the DynaRoot uptake scheme on atmospheric variables in a coupled modeling framework."

The present study revealed that low DO (∼0.2 mg/L) enhanced the N2O emission factor (EF) from nitrification by 4.5 times in canonical ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)-dominated sludge, while it reduced N2O EF by 73% in comammox Nitrospira-dominated sludge. During nitrification, the accumulation of intermediate NH2OH in AOB-dominant sludge was much higher and increased more significantly by low DO (from 0.018 to 0.067 mg-N/L) compared to comammox Nitrospira-dominant sludge (from 0.004 to 0.009 mg-N/L). In AOB-dominant sludge, the increased NH2OH and upregulated AOB-NOR gene at low DO promoted NO reduction, thus increasing N2O EF while simultaneously decreasing NO emission. In the comammox Nitrospira-dominant sludge, N2O was primarily produced via abiotic pathways. Further investigation found that N2O production decreased significantly under low DO in inactivated sludge and pure water with the sole addition of NH2OH, suggesting that low DO inhibited N2O formation via abiotic NH2OH oxidation. Therefore, in comammox Nitrospira-dominant sludge, low DO decreased N2O production primarily due to the inhibition of low DO to N2O formation via abiotic NH2OH oxidation and the low NH2OH accumulation. These results imply that enriching comammox Nitrospira in the wastewater treatment process can ensure stably low N2O emissions regardless of the variations in DO."

Nanoplastics (NPs) are ubiquitous in marine environments and often co-occur with Phaeocystis blooms. However, the effect of NPs on the colony formation and bloom dynamics of Phaeocystis remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted both indoor and outdoor mesocosm experiments to demonstrate that NPs significantly increased the total cell density, colonial diameter, and colonial density of P. globosa. These enhancements in colonial density and diameter were primarily driven by elevated levels of extracellular polysaccharides as well as key substrates involved in polysaccharide synthesis, including glucose 1-phosphate, adenosine diphosphate glucose, and uridine diphosphate glucose. Concurrently, the accumulation of extracellular polysaccharides was accompanied by the significant upregulation of ten genes associated with N-glycan synthesis. Furthermore, assuming no other environmental changes, our projections indicated that if 0.1% of microplastics (MPs) degrade into NPs, colonial cell densities of Phaeocystis could increase by more than 5% at 242 global locations, with potential maxima approaching 80%. These findings indicate that the ongoing rise in MPs pollution could exacerbate Phaeocystis blooms by enhancing colony formation, posing substantial risks to marine ecosystems."

By integrating a novel surface energy balance model into a global climate model, we simulate the consequences of installing solar farms over 20% of desert areas across five continents. Our findings reveal significant global and regional climatic feedbacks, including a 6.95% reduction in near-surface wind speeds, which leads to a 5.5% decline in global wind power generation potential (312.47 TW h annually). Furthermore, solar farms induce local atmospheric changes, such as increased surface temperatures and cloud cover, resulting in a 22.44 TW h reduction in solar power output. Crucially, these climatic impacts on surface radiation extend beyond immediate locations, influencing renewable energy resources in distant regions through teleconnections. This self-limiting dynamic underscores the inherent trade-offs between solar and wind energy, highlighting the need for integrated global energy planning that accounts for cross-border climatic and energy interdependencies.

Through simultaneously perturbing 12 selected parameters from deep convection and cloud physics schemes, we conducted perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) experiments with 128 members. Our analysis uncovered that the parameters showing the most influential effects on tropical Pacific precipitation simulations can be separated into two distinct categories: those primarily governed by the convection scheme, which reflects the competition between convective and large‐scale precipitation, and those predominantly influenced by cloud ice processes. Furthermore, we revealed the importance of nonlinear effects of these perturbed parameters on the simulation of mean precipitation and interpreted the underlying mechanisms. Some biases in simulating precipitation revealed by our PPE experiments align with those in AMIP simulations, offering valuable insights for the AGCM's advancement."

 AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are integral to fast excitatory synaptic transmission and play vital roles in synaptic plasticity, motor coordination, learning, and memory1. While extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2-5, the molecular architecture of native calcium permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. To elucidate the subunit composition, physiological architecture, and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, here we present the first visualization of these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, while auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, are located at the B′/D′ positions and CNIHs or TARPs at the A′/C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the Noelin 1-GluA1/A4 complex, wherein Noelin 1 (Noe 1) specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, Noe 1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer without affecting receptor gating properties. Noe 1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric-AMPAR assemblies that likely engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors within synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs."

 Bridgmanite, a magnesium-rich silicate perovskite, is the most prevalent mineral in Earth’s lower mantle and contains substantial quantities of ferric (oxidized) iron, even in equilibrium with iron metal. Mixing of oxygen-rich material from the lower mantle could have raised the oxidation state of the upper mantle to its present level after the more reducing conditions during core formation. However, it remains unclear how the lower-mantle oxygen content was established to achieve this level. Here we use high-pressure and temperature multi-anvil experiments at known oxygen fugacities to show that the bridgmanite ferric iron content is independent of pressure but decreases with temperature. Using these data, we build a thermodynamic model to calculate the ferric iron content of the lower mantle as bridgmanite crystallized from a reduced magma ocean in the early Earth. We determine that this ferric iron content would have been sufficient to explain the current upper mantle’s ferric iron content after whole mantle mixing.

This finding suggests targets for diagnostics and treatment. 
 Brain waste is cleared via a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway, the glymphatic system, whose dysfunction may underlie many brain conditions. Previous studies show coherent vascular oscillation, measured by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, couples with CSF inflow to drive fluid flux. Yet, how this coupling is regulated, whether it mediates waste clearance, and why it is impaired remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that cholinergic neurons modulate BOLD-CSF coupling and glymphatic function. We find BOLD-CSF coupling correlates cortical cholinergic activity in aged humans. Lesioning basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in female mice impairs glymphatic efflux and associated changes in BOLD-CSF coupling, arterial pulsation and glymphatic influx. An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor alters these dynamics, primarily through peripheral mechanisms. Our results suggest cholinergic loss impairs glymphatic function by a neurovascular mechanism, potentially contributing to pathological waste accumulation. This may provide a basis for developing diagnostics and treatments for glymphatic dysfunction. The authors find cholinergic neurons regulate glymphatic waste clearance via neurovascular mechanisms, with their loss impairing this process.

This allows for graded separations of different-sized molecules. 
 Artificial stimulus-responsive membranes, particularly those responsive to different solvents, have important applications in complex and graded separation systems. Inspired by natural lipid membrane that alters mass transport behavior in response to interactions with various solvents, we report that incorporating porous graphene (PG) into graphene oxide (GO) membrane enables smart and switchable molecular sieving reversibly responsive to solvent types. The membrane shows high permeance for water and methanol, 45.52 and 13.56 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, respectively, and its molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) at ~319 g mol−1 in water, similar to pristine GO membrane, reversibly switches to 960 g mol−1 in methanol which is not observed in either pristine GO or graphene membrane. We accounted this switching to the change of transport pathways. In water, the GO-GO nanochannel is dominant, providing similar molecular sieving to pristine GO. In methanol, the GO-PG nanochannel becomes favorable because a strong solvent adsorption on the nanochannel surface, coupled with a weak solvent network under nanoconfinement, promotes a significant interlayer expansion, reducing the transport resistance and enabling larger, switched MWCO. This switchable sieving behavior is further demonstrated for efficient graded separation of ternary solution of solutes with various molecular weights. Porous graphene integrated into graphene oxide membranes yields smart molecular sieves that switch separation based on the solvent. This allows for graded separations of different-sized molecules."

 Tissue crowding represents a critical challenge to epithelial tissues, which often respond via the irreversible process of live cell extrusion. We report that apical size reduction via macropinocytosis serves as a malleable and less destructive form of tissue remodeling that can alleviate the need for cell loss. We find that macropinocytosis is triggered by tissue crowding via mechanosensory signaling, leading to substantial internalization of apical membrane. This drives a reduction in apical surface which alleviates crowding. We report that this mechanism regulates the long-term organization of the developing epithelium and controls the timing of proliferation-induced cell extrusion. Additionally, we observe a wave of macropinocytosis in response to acute external compression. In both scenarios, inhibiting macropinocytosis induces a dramatic increase in cell extrusion suggesting cooperation between cell extrusion and macropinocytosis in response to both developmental and external compression. Our findings implicate macropinocytosis as an important regulator of dynamic epithelial remodeling. This study reveals that epithelial cells can reduce their apical surface area via macropinocytosis to relieve tissue crowding, offering a reversible alternative to cell extrusion and highlighting a new mechanism of tissue remodeling under stress."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific (WNP), which occur mainly from June through November, are greatly influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), particularly during the peak and late seasons (August–November). However, during the early season (June–August; JJA), ENSO is in its onset or developing phase and thus is relatively weak. Consequently, the drivers of interannual variability in early-season WNP TC activity remain less understood. This study shows that Atlantic Niño/Niña, the leading mode of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature variability in JJA, significantly influences early-season WNP TC activity. Specifically, Atlantic Niño produces anomalous upper-level convergence in the tropical WNP, resulting in a decrease in low-level relative vorticity and mid-level relative humidity in the southern WNP (0°–10°N), and an increase in low-level relative vorticity in the northern WNP (20°N–30°N). These environmental conditions lead to an increase in TC activity over the northern WNP and a decrease over the southern WNP. Due to the resulting northward shifts in TC genesis and track density, the risk of landfalling TCs in far eastern Asia, particularly Korea and Japan, is greatly increased. These results suggest that Atlantic Niño/Niña may serve as a key predictor for seasonal WNP TC activity, especially during ENSO-neutral years."

 Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) numerical weather prediction (NWP) have transformed atmospheric modeling. AI NWP models outperform state-of-the-art conventional NWP models like the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting’s (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) on several global metrics while requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources. However, existing AI NWP models still face limitations due to training datasets and dynamic timestep choices, often leading to artifacts that affect performance. To begin to address these challenges, we introduce the Community Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin (CREDIT) framework, developed at the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). CREDIT is a flexible, scalable, foundational research platform for training and deploying AI NWP models, providing an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The CREDIT framework supports both existing architectures and the development of new models. We showcase this flexibility with WXFormer, a novel multiscale vision transformer designed to predict atmospheric states while mitigating common AI NWP pitfalls through techniques like spectral normalization, intelligent padding, and multi-step training. Additionally, we train the FuXi architecture within the CREDIT framework for comparison. Our results demonstrate that both FuXi and WXFormer, trained on hybrid sigma-pressure level ERA5 sampled at 6-h intervals, generally achieve better performance than the IFS High-Resolution (IFS HRES) on 10-day forecasts, offering potential improvements in efficiency and accuracy. The modular nature of CREDIT fosters collaboration, enabling researchers to experiment with models, datasets, and training options."

 The characteristics and concentrations of microbial communities in the air have been studied extensively; however, existing monitoring methods are often complex and expensive. In this study, we monitored the atmospheric environment in the Huairou District of Beijing for one year, using microbial metabolic activity (MA) as an indicator of microbial presence. We analyzed the lag effect of environmental factors on MA and assessed how these factors influence MA in PM2.5. Significant seasonal variations in MA within PM were observed, with higher levels recorded in winter and under fair weather conditions compared to other seasons and weather conditions. PM2.5, O3, and CO concentrations, as well as temperature and humidity, had a substantial impact on MA. Notably, the MA in PM2.5 was more sensitive to environmental factors than the MA in PM10. Seasonal variations in MA within PM2.5 were primarily driven by air pollution and meteorological factors, with ozone exerting the greatest influence on MA in summer. Additionally, environmental factors improved the accuracy of MA predictions in summer. These findings provide strong evidence that environmental factors can be used to predict bioaerosol contamination, providing a cost-effective and rapid alternative to traditional monitoring methods."

Gámiz-Fortis;María Jesús Esteban-Parra,HighResClimNevada: a high-resolution climatological dataset for a high-altitude region in southern Spain (Sierra Nevada),"This work aims to present a series of climate datasets for Sierra Nevada, a region especially vulnerable to climate change in southern Spain. The database consists of primary climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric humidity and also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices, which are both useful pieces of information for assessing the impact of climate change in this region. These datasets are only available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14883471. 
 Climate datasets with very high spatiotemporal resolution are essential to assess the impacts of climate change in mountain areas, which are complex systems in which climate is very changeable. However, these regions are characterized by a lack of climatic information, and if there is any, it is usually short, sparse, or incomplete. This work presents a new series of very high resolution (1 km) gridded climate datasets for Sierra Nevada (SN), a mountain range classified as a double climate change hotspot as it is a semi-arid mountain range in the Mediterranean area that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. The database, called HighResClimNevada, consists of a set of climate data derived from a climate simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the period from 1991–2022 and forced with the European ReAnalysis (ERA5).  HighResClimNevada provides not only hourly and daily primary climate variables (i.e., near-surface temperature, precipitation, near-surface relative humidity, surface pressure, surface net radiation, and wind speed), but also bioclimatic variables, extremes indices from the Expert Team of Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and precipitation-hour indicators, which were postprocessed using aggregated temperature and precipitation values from primary climate variables. To evaluate the database performance, HighResClimNevada temperature and precipitation values were compared with reference datasets from different sources. In general, HighResClimNevada captures reasonably well not only the spatiotemporal variability of raw temperature, but also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices in SN. It displays comparable behavior to other climatic products but with a greater level of detail due to its higher spatial resolution. For precipitation, which is variable, more uncertain, and difficult to characterize, HighResClimNevada exhibits a higher amount of precipitation when compared to station-based, coarse satellite-based, and reanalysis-based products. However, the latter two present problems in characterizing precipitation in high mountain regions probably due to the scarcity of data in areas with high spatiotemporal variability, such as SN. The precipitation from HighResClimNevada is comparable to other climatic products like CHIRPS or CERRA-Land, which captures better the spatiotemporal variability in this region. These findings, therefore, suggest HighResClimNevada as a valuable long-term climate tool for a variety of applications, including land management, hydrometeorological research, flora and fauna phenology, and risk assessment.

Therefore, it is necessary to integrate multi-temporal and multisource L-VOD products. Our study begins with the reconstruction of missing data and then develops a spatiotemporal fusion model to generate global daily seamless 9 km L-VOD products from 2010 to 2021, which are crucial for understanding the global carbon cycle. 
 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) products provide information on vegetation water content and correlate with vegetation growth status; these are closely related to the global water and carbon cycles. The L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher-frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. Currently, there are only two operational L-band sensors aboard satellites, i.e., the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite launched in 2010 and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite launched in 2015. The former has the limitation of a low spatial resolution of only 25 km, while the latter has improved this resolution to 9 km but has a shorter usable time range. Due to the influence of sensor and atmospheric conditions as well as the observation methods of polar-orbiting satellites (such as scan gaps and observation revisit times), the daily data provided by both satellites suffer from varying degrees of missing data. In summary, the existing L-band VOD (L-VOD) products suffer from the defects of missing data and coarse resolution of historical data. There is little research on filling gaps and reconstructing 9 km long-term data for L-VOD products. To solve this problem, our study depends on a penalized least-square regression based on a three-dimensional discrete cosine transform to firstly generate the seamless global daily L-VOD products. Subsequently, the nonlocal filtering idea is applied to spatiotemporal fusion between high-resolution and low-resolution data, resulting in a global daily seamless 9 km L-VOD product from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2021. In order to validate the quality of the products, time series validation and simulated missing-region validation are used for the reconstructed data. The fusion products are validated both temporally and spatially and are also compared numerically with the original 9 km data during the overlapping period. Results show that the seamless SMOS (SMAP) dataset is evaluated with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.855 (0.947) and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.094 (0.073) for the simulated real missing masks. The temporal consistency of the reconstructed daily L-VOD products is ensured with the original time series distribution of valid values. The spatial information of the fusion product and the original 9 km data in the overlapping period is basically consistent (R2: 0.926–0.958, RMSE: 0.072–0.093, and mean absolute error MAE: 0.047–0.064). The temporal variations between the fusion product and the original product are largely synchronized. Our dataset can provide timely vegetation information during natural disasters (e.g., floods, droughts, and forest fires), supporting early disaster warning and real-time responses.

This work presents the first publicly available daily global front dataset spanning 1982 to 2023, with comprehensive validations using in situ global observations. Our validations enhance confidence in the application of satellite-based front detection and provide independent support for global front occurrence patterns. The dataset is expected to be widely used in front-related studies. 
 Ocean fronts have garnered significant attention from researchers across various scientific disciplines due to their profound ecological and climatic impacts. The development of front detection algorithms has enabled the automatic extraction of frontal information from satellite observations, providing valuable tools for understanding the biophysical interactions within marine ecosystems. However, the lack of comprehensive validation and comparison of cross-satellite products against in situ observations, along with limited accessibility to frontal datasets, must be addressed to enable the broader application of front detection algorithms. This study promoted the improved histogram-based front detection algorithm to global oceans with additional enhancements, generating the first publicly available, high-resolution, daily global mesoscale front dataset spanning from 1982 to 2023 (Xing et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14373832). Global validation using in situ underway observations shows that most in situ and satellite-detected fronts can be matched with each other, with high temporal and spatial consistency, demonstrating the dataset's acceptable performance in detecting fronts. Cross-dataset comparisons reveal that multi-satellite blended products offer the best front detection performance, followed by observation-assimilated ocean model products, while single-satellite and purely simulated products show the lowest performance. In addition, in situ observations show a strong spatial resemblance to global frontal frequency, providing independent validation of the satellite-based global frontal occurrence map. These results enhance confidence in the application of satellite-based front detection, and our global front dataset and detection algorithm may be valuable for both regional and global studies in marine ecology, fisheries, ocean dynamics, and climate change."

A total of 2,984 sandy beaches were identified with high accuracy by integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery, terrain, and nighttime light data. Since 1990, the area at risk from human infrastructure squeeze has significantly increased. This study provides an updated dataset to support sustainable coastal management. 
 Sandy beaches provide essential ecological and economic services, but their functions are increasingly threatened by human activities. Analyzing the spatial distribution of China's sandy beaches and the impacts of human activities offers valuable insights for coastal resource management and ecological protection. However, remote sensing technologies face challenges such as limited data sources and tidal influences, which affect recognition accuracy. Therefore, integrating multi-source remote sensing data and reducing the impact of tidal fluctuations to improve recognition accuracy remains a key challenge. This study proposes an innovative approach utilizing multi-source data and an ensemble learning model to identify sandy beaches in China (2016–2023). By integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite data, terrain data, and nighttime light data, along with spectral, terrain, texture, and polarization features, sandy beaches were identified across multiple years, and the results were consolidated into a single-year dataset to analyze spatial patterns and risks from human infrastructure squeeze. (1) High-precision classification identified 2984 sandy beaches in China, covering a total area of 260.70 km2. Guangdong had the largest number, area, and perimeter, while Shanghai had the widest sandy beaches. (2) In Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan, the identified sandy beaches covered 149.68 km2, with perimeters of 5155.91 km and widths of 49.50 m, 32.83 m, and 50.70 m, respectively. These results were significantly better than those from reference datasets. (3) From 1990 to 2023, the area at risk from human infrastructure squeeze increased from 109.95 km2 to 245.58 km2, a rise of 135.63 km2, with the most significant increase occurring between 1990 and 2000. Guangdong and Fujian showed growth rates of 1.05 km2/year and 0.73 km2/year, respectively. This study provides an up-to-date dataset on China's sandy beaches.

To accommodate frequent snow and ice conditions, I walked the same bike carrying the same sensors more than 30 times back and forth along a quiet stretch of paved (mostly) snow-covered surface. Because loop and to/from Bozeman routes ran along an identical 3 km stretch of rural highway, that stretch represents one of the most-measured extents of impervious surface. Routes covered impervious paved surfaces punctuated by intervals of gravel or tree-shade or both. Sensors, adopted from consumer applications, produced reliable repeatable data.

A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 complete time series at sites of tide gauge, which allows for direct statistical assessment. The average of our reconstructed global mean sea level shows strong agreements with other reconstructions. 
 Tide gauges record sea level changes along coast. They are widely used to determine the twentieth century global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. However, a major issue in tide gauge data is the presence of various, substantial, and sometime persistent data gaps, which hinder our understanding of sea level rise, especially at regional and local scales. Whilst the GMSL reconstructions have been provided by several influential studies, reconstructions at the exact sites of tide gauges are rarely available. Here, we present sea level reconstructions at global 945 tide gauges, covering the period over 1900 to 2022. Our approach relies on a data assimilation technique that integrates various physical sea level observations and predictions, including sea level simulations from 35 climate models. A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 reconstructions at each site of tide gauge, offering complete and refined sea level time series. This ensemble reconstruction allows for direct statistical assessment, e.g., average, median, spread, and percentile. The average of reconstructed sea level across 945 tide gauges reveals a GMSL rise of 1.75±0.05 mm/yr over 1900–2020, and shows strong agreements with other GMSL reconstructions for both the curves of time series and overall trends. At local scale, our reconstructions are comparable to an independent reconstruction, despite apparent rate differences at locations, it is suggested that our reconstructed sea level trends closely follow the raw records when they are available, emphasizing the importance of the observed sea level rise at tide gauges. Our sea level reconstructions offer a valuable resource for improving global and regional sea level projections, validating climate model performance, and informing coastal adaptation strategies.

These maps reveal important patterns in soil health, such as a significant global loss of soil carbon in the past 25 years. Our results help track land degradation and support better land restoration efforts. This work provides a new global tool for understanding and protecting soil, a key resource for food, water, and climate. 
 There is increasing interest in global dynamic soil information with changes in soil properties mapped over time and at high spatial resolution. Thanks to long-term, multi-temporal, and fine- and medium-resolution satellite missions such as Landsat, MODIS, Copernicus Sentinel and similar, it is possible to produce globally consistent predictions of key soil variables that match other 10–30 m spatial resolution global data sets. This paper describes data preparation, modeling, and production of OpenLandMap-soildb: global dynamic predictions of soil organic carbon content, soil organic carbon density, bulk density, soil pH in H2O, soil texture fractions (clay, sand and slit) and USDA subgroup soil types (USDA soil taxonomy subgroups) at 30 m spatial resolution based on spatiotemporal Machine Learning (Quantile Regression Random Forest with output predictions showing the mean plus the lower and upper prediction intervals of 68 % probability). To train the models, a large compilation of soil samples imported from legacy soil projects was used: 216,000 soil samples with soil carbon density (kg m-3), 408,000 soil samples with soil carbon content (g kg-1), 272,000 samples with soil pH in H2O, 363,000 samples with clay, silt, and sand (%), and 134,000 samples with bulk density oven dry (t m-3). Soil carbon and soil pH were mapped with 5 year time-intervals; soil texture fractions, bulk density, and soil types were mapped for recent years only. The cross-validation results indicate RMSE of 17.7 (kg m-3; 0.486 in log-scale) and CCC of 0.88 for SOC density, RMSE of 51.3 (g kg-1; 0.574 in log-scale) and CCC of 0.87 for SOC content, RMSE of 0.15 (t m-3) and CCC of 0.92 for bulk density of fine-earth, RMSE of 0.51 and CCC of 0.91 for soil pH, RMSE of 8.4 % and CCC of 0.87 for soil clay content, and RMSE of 12.6 % and CCC of 0.84 for soil sand content respectively. The most important variables for predicting soil organic carbon density (kg m-3) were: soil depth, Landsat-based uncalibrated Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and CHELSA bioclimatic indices. The global distribution of soil pH can be primarily explained by the CHELSA Aridity Index (long-term), annual precipitation, and salinity grade. The global stocks for 2020–2022+ period for 0–30 cm depth interval are estimated at 461 Pg (Peta grams); the results further indicate that, in the last 25 years, the world has lost at least 11 Pg of SOC in the top soil.

Molecular structure including carbon number and functional groups influences SOA formation. However, limited research was conducted on the vastly different SOA yields among aliphatic carbonyls, and the impact of the molecular structure remains unclear and controversial. In this study, 11 aliphatic carbonyls were photooxidized to study the SOA formation and gas-phase products in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). The maximum SOA yields of C15 and C13 straight-chain carbonyls are 0.41–0.52 and 0.18–0.23, lower but within a comparable range with long-chain alkanes, whereas those for C8–C10 carbonyls are less than 0.04. Aliphatic carbonyls with more carbon have significantly higher SOA yields, accompanied by additional multigenerational products. The SOA yield of n-aldehyde is moderately higher than that of n-alkan-2-one with the same carbon number, due to the enhanced formation of long-chain acids with lower volatility than dicarbonyls. The saturated cyclic structure increases the SOA yield by forming more multifunctional products with additional aldehyde groups upon ring-opening, whereas the branched structure easily fragmented and decreased the SOA yield. This study highlights that the aliphatic carbonyls with more carbon numbers and a cyclic structure with less branching may have higher SOA yields."

This study simulated a realistic exposure scenario to evaluate the effects of drinking nitrate-contaminated water on the growth, physiology, and antipredator behavior of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) chicks. Hatchlings were exposed to two nitrate concentrations commonly used in fertigation (100 and 500 mg/L) through ad libitum drinking water over a 28-day period. Nitrate exposure at both concentrations increased chick weight and elevated hematocrit levels, possibly as a compensatory response to nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia. Additionally, it reduced cell-mediated immune responsiveness, indicating a compromised immune function. We simulated aerial and terrestrial predator attacks (raptor and fox) and evaluated behavioral responses of exposed and control chicks. We report nitrate effects on antipredator responses, specifically reduced fleeing distances, altered freezing, and active escape behaviors, which would increase predation risk in the wild. These findings highlight new threats associated with nitrate contamination in agricultural landscapes, particularly for exposed birds that rely on irrigation water during the summer months. This study emphasizes the need to assess the sublethal effects of nitrates in high-exposure scenarios to improve environmental risk assessments and mitigate risks contributing to the population declines in farmland species."

Physicochemical properties of PFAA are known to influence their toxicokinetics in mammals, but mechanistic models capable of identifying the key drivers of absorption, distribution, and elimination are limited. Here, we develop and evaluate a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model parameterized to an in vivo mouse model using data from in vitro studies. We simulated tissue concentrations of 9 PFAA with perfluorinated carbon chains (ηpfc) ranging from 4 to 10 in wild-type mice, and for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in knockout mice, following intravenous and oral exposures. The PBTK model quantifies blood flow, binding to tissue proteins and phospholipids, membrane permeability, hepatic and renal transporters, and fecal and urinary excretion. Model evaluation comparing experimental and simulated mice blood and tissue concentrations showed R2 values of ≥ 0.65 and relative root-mean-square errors of ≤ 122% for most PFAA. Model sensitivity analyses showed that permeability and phospholipid binding strongly influenced the elimination and distribution of long-chain PFAA (ηpfc ≥ 7), while elimination for short-chain PFAA (ηpfc ≤ 6) was more sensitive to renal transporters and albumin binding. This study illustrates how integrating in vitro-derived parameters into PBTK models enables mechanistic evaluation of PFAS toxicokinetics across diverse compounds and physiological conditions."

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) turnover plays an important role in controlling the stability of soil aggregates, affecting aggregate formation and microbial activity. Microplastics (MPs) are known to impact soil DOM composition and structure, but their effects on DOM transformation in different soil aggregates remain unclear. Herein, we conducted 450 day incubation assays to study the effects of nondegradable and biodegradable MPs with varying aging levels on DOM transformations in agricultural soil aggregates. MPs were found to increase DOM transformation in soil aggregates, leading to changes in soil aggregate stability, including a reduction in geometric mean diameter and mass-weighted diameter. The addition of MPs resulted in a decrease in the stability of DOM in large-sized aggregates but an increase in the aromaticity and unsaturation of DOM in small-sized aggregates, which were more pronounced in the PLAMPs-treated group. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the transformation of unsaturated aliphatic compounds and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds, which play a major role in the intra- and intergroup transformation of DOM. In this process, microbial communities play a significant role. They tend to consume DOM in larger aggregates and produce DOM in smaller aggregates, leading to an accumulation of DOM in smaller aggregates, thereby promoting the formation of smaller aggregates and reducing the aggregate stability. This study uncovers the mechanisms of DOM transformation in response to MPs in soil aggregates, providing a scientific basis for soil management and sustainable agricultural development."

Using a hierarchy of climate model ensembles, we find that the decline in AMOC, and its SST fingerprint within the North Atlantic warming hole region, are sensitive to external forcing level and wind driven ocean forcing. Once external forcing reaches a level at which sea ice melt increases the Labrador Sea vertical salinity gradient, localized cooling and resulting expansion of the sea ice edge decrease vertical mechanical stirring. Under greenhouse gas only forcing, this mechanism plays a large role and under SSP3.70 forcing, it plays a relatively minor role due to larger buoyancy forcing. This implies that an AMOC fingerprint developed from one simulation or external forcing level cannot be applied to other scenarios."

Our analysis reveals that circulation trends are the leading cause of the observed drying in Central Chile and the US Southwest, and that models show the drying across Southern Hemisphere MCs is independent of trends in the Southern Annular Mode. All Mediterranean‐type climates have exhibited residual drying trends from both internal variability and externally forced thermodynamic processes.

However, much of West Antarctica is underlain by weak upper mantle, meaning these short‐term fluctuations may also cause viscous (transient or steady‐state) deformation of the Earth. We model the viscoelastic response of the Earth to surface mass balance (SMB) variability in the Antarctic Peninsula and find an improved fit to GPS data at most sites compared to elastic only.

Through combining high‐resolution satellite and simulation data, we demonstrate that energetic submesoscales are present within TC‐induced cold wakes across the northwestern Pacific, which can produce strong upward vertical heat flux (VHF) in the upper ocean. Further analysis reveals that submesoscales are more active in stronger cold wakes induced by slower‐moving and stronger TCs and they may be generated through a combination of baroclinic instability and strain‐induced frontogenesis. Crucially, submesoscale VHF can accelerate the post‐TC temperature recovery of cold wakes which may influence the sequential TC intensification. Our results improve the understanding of TC‐ocean feedback and underscore the necessity of resolving or parameterizing submesoscales in TC prediction models."

Reactive transport models illustrate that intrinsic rock properties like grain size and kinetic rates constants mutually modify (234U/238U)river and δ7Liriver values whereas extrinsic forces like fluid infiltration and rock uplift rates mostly impact δ7Liriver values. These results delineate how given rock types denude and highlight the utility of these proxies in building process‐based models of landscape denudation over the Quaternary Period."

 Aromatic rings, also known as arenes, containing two or more adjacent different substituents are ubiquitously found in small molecule drugs1. Strategies that can rapidly introduce diverse vicinal substituents to readily available precursors would greatly benefit generation of analogues of bioactive compounds2, which, however, remain challenging to realize to date. The existing approaches for preparing vicinal difunctionalized arenes lack modularity, or regioselectivity, or generality. Here we report a nickel-catalyzed vicinal diborylation method that can directly install two chemically differentiated boryl groups in a regio- and site-selective manner using readily available aryl triflates or chlorides as substrates. This reaction operates under simple and mild conditions and is scalable. It also shows a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Given that each boryl group can be independently transformed into various functional groups, this method offers a modular, regioselective, and divergent approach to access diverse vicinal difunctionalized arenes, showing promise for constructing analogue libraries. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a highly unusual reaction pathway, involving the formation of a dearomatized gem-diboryl species and 1,2-boron migration. The site- and regioselectivity of this reaction are proposed to be controlled by steric interactions of the boryl groups with the nickel catalyst. The mechanistic insights gained in this investigation could have broad implications on developing other boron-mediated functionalization reactions."

This paper demonstrates on a superconducting quantum processor that the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm is poised to complement its classical counterparts at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems. 
 The estimation of low energies of many-body systems is a cornerstone of the computational quantum sciences. Variational quantum algorithms can be used to prepare ground states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, but their lack of convergence guarantees and impractical number of cost function estimations prevent systematic scaling of experiments to large systems. Alternatives to variational approaches are needed for large-scale experiments on pre-fault-tolerant devices. Here, we use a superconducting quantum processor to compute eigenenergies of quantum many-body systems on two-dimensional lattices of up to 56 sites, using the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm, an analog of the well-known classical diagonalization technique. We construct subspaces of the many-body Hilbert space using Trotterized unitary evolutions executed on the quantum processor, and classically diagonalize many-body interacting Hamiltonians within those subspaces. These experiments demonstrate exponential convergence towards an estimate of the ground state energy, and show that quantum diagonalization algorithms are poised to complement their classical counterparts at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems.

 A promising approach to attain long-distance coherent spin propagation is accessing topological spin-polarized edge states in graphene. Achieving this without external magnetic fields necessitates engineering graphene band structure, obtainable through proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. In particular, proximity-induced staggered potentials and spin-orbit coupling are expected to form a topological bulk gap in graphene with gapless helical edge states that are robust against disorder. In this work, we detect the spin-polarized helical edge transport in graphene at zero external magnetic field, allowed by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet, CrPS4. We show the coexistence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) states and magnetism in graphene, where the induced spin-orbit and exchange couplings also give rise to a large anomalous Hall (AH) effect. The detection of the QSH states at zero external magnetic field, together with the AH signal that persists up to room temperature, opens the route for practical applications of magnetic graphene in quantum spintronic circuitries. Graphene was one of the first materials proposed to host the quantum spin Hall effect.

 Little is known about the genetic connection system and community organization of Late Neolithic and Early Copper Age populations of the Carpathian Basin.

 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50. AMD and cardiovascular disease share risk factors including age, impaired lipid metabolism, and extracellular lipid deposition. Because of its importance in age-related diseases, we hypothesize that apolipoprotein M (ApoM), a lipocalin that binds sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), might restore lipid homeostasis and retinal function in AMD. In support, we find that human patients with AMD demonstrate significantly reduced ApoM compared to controls. In mice with impaired retinal cholesterol efflux, ApoM improves retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function and lipotoxicity in an S1P- and S1P receptor 3-dependent manner. Ultrastructural evidence of enhanced melanosome-lipid droplet interactions led us to hypothesize and demonstrate that ApoM-S1P signaling drives RPE-specific lysosomal lipid catabolism. RPE-specific knockout of lysosomal acid lipase recapitulates features of AMD. Our study defines a novel role for ApoM/S1P signaling in AMD driven by RPE lipotoxicity, mediated by cell-autonomous lysosomal lipid catabolism.

 The development of non-human primate models is essential for the fields of developmental and regenerative biology because those models will more closely approximate human biology than do murine models. Based on single cell RNAseq and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we report the identification and functional characterization of two quiescent stem cell populations (skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells termed fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)) in the non-human primate Microcebus murinus (the gray mouse lemur). We demonstrate in vivo proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal of both MuSCs and FAPs. By combining cell phenotyping with cross-species molecular profiling and pharmacological interventions, we show that mouse lemur MuSCs and FAPs are more similar to human than to mouse counterparts. We identify unexpected gene targets involved in regulating primate MuSC proliferation and primate FAP adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, we find that the cellular composition of mouse lemur muscle better models human muscle than does macaque (Macaca fascicularis) muscle. Finally, we note that our approach presents as a generalizable pipeline for the identification, isolation, and characterization of stem cell populations in new animal models.

 Avoiding severe global warming requires large-scale removals of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Forest regeneration offers cost-effective carbon removals, but annual rates vary substantially by location and forest age. Here we generate grid-level (~1-km2) growth curves for aboveground live carbon in naturally regrowing forests by combining 109,708 field estimates with 66 environmental covariates. Across the globe and the first 100 years of growth, maximum carbon removal rates varied 200-fold, with the greatest rates estimated in ~20- to 40-year-old forests. Despite a focus on new forests for natural climate solutions, protecting existing young secondary forests can provide up to 8-fold more carbon removal per hectare than new regrowth. These maps could help to target the optimal ages and locations where a key carbon removal strategy could be applied, and improve estimates of how secondary forests contribute to global carbon cycling.

This study examines the links between irrigation expansion and child diet diversity across 26 countries in the global south. 
 Irrigation expansion has been promoted as a way to improve global nutrition and health by increasing food production and income. However, its impact on the health and nutrition of local communities is unclear and might vary substantially across contexts, depending on who reaps the benefits and how. Here we combine georeferenced survey data from 9,144 rural communities (70,817 households) across 26 global south countries with data on global patterns of irrigation infrastructure changes to examine linkages between irrigation expansion and local changes in child diet diversity—a key indicator of micronutrient intake and development. We found a positive link between irrigation and child diet diversity, with substantial regional differences. Irrigation benefits were concentrated in regions without sufficient water resources to support it, suggesting trade-offs between dietary improvements and water stress. By contrast, irrigated areas with sufficient water tend to produce higher fractions of cash crops and export-oriented food items, with weaker associations to improved local diets. These findings suggest that while irrigation access is associated with overall improvements of child diet diversity in rural communities, water stress conditions can influence these outcomes. Nutrition-sensitive strategies thus need to be considered as an essential component of sustainable irrigation planning in the future. Irrigation is an important component of agricultural productivity, but its influence on health and nutritional outcomes—especially those of children—remains unclear. This study examines the links between irrigation expansion and child diet diversity across 26 countries in the global south."

 Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are among the deadliest manifestations of volcanic eruptions, commonly associated with volcanoes characterized by intermediate to felsic magma compositions and related to eruption column collapse, lateral blasts, or gravitational failures of lava-domes. However, even basaltic, small-moderate eruptions have recently generated potentially lethal PDCs. We analyzed the PDC from the lava fountain of 10 February 2022 at Mt. Etna’s South East Crater. We integrated field, remote sensing and petrological data on the PDC products, together with video-recordings of the eruptive activity and numerical modeling to evaluate its propagation dynamics. Our analysis suggests that hot, altered portions of steep volcanic edifices may collapse and remobilize large amounts of deposits, constituting precursors of highly mobile granular flows. Monitoring their pre-eruptive trigger conditions continuously is therefore crucial for a robust assessment of the potential hazard, especially in the proximal areas of very active basaltic volcanoes frequented by numerous tourists.

 Wildfires can dramatically alter water quality, resulting in severe implications for human and freshwater systems. However, regional-scale assessments of these impacts are often limited by data scarcity. Here, we unify observations from 1984–2021 in 245 burned watersheds across the western United States, comparing post-fire signals to baseline levels from 293 unburned basins. Organic carbon and phosphorus exhibit significantly elevated levels (p ≤ 0.05) in the first 1–5 years post-fire, while nitrogen and sediment show significant increases up to 8 years post-fire. During peak post-fire response years, average carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations are 3–103 times pre-fire levels, and sediment 19–286 times pre-fire concentrations. Higher responses are linked with greater forested and developed areas, which respectively explain up to 31 and 33% of inter-basin response variability. Overall, this analysis provides strong evidence of multi-year water quality degradation following wildfires in the western United States and highlights the influence of basin and wildfire features. These insights may aid water managers in preparation efforts, increasing resilience of water systems to wildfire impacts.

 Urban greenspaces are widely recognized as an effective nature-based strategy to mitigate urban heat. However, previous studies have often oversimplified the cooling process of greenspaces, leaving their cumulative cooling effect insufficiently quantified. To address this gap, we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) quantitative model to evaluate spatially accumulated cooling benefits. A total of 668 greenspace patches across 37 cities globally, representing varying climatic conditions, were selected. We then tested the relative importance of intrinsic drivers (landscape composition and spatial configuration) versus built environment drivers (landscape patterns of surrounding areas) in explaining the cooling effect. The results indicate that greenspaces provide an average cumulative cooling effect of 4.92 °C on the surrounding land surface temperature (LST), with a maximum reduction of up to 25.3 °C, far exceeding expectations. The cooling effect is primarily and positively influenced by patch area, the intrinsic green-blue proportion, and surrounding socioeconomic characteristics. More importantly, we emphasize the necessity of an accumulated perspective in the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) assessments, as existing quantitative frameworks tend to largely underestimate the cooling benefits of large greenspaces. Our analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between the aridity index and TVoE. To maximize cumulative cooling efficiency, optimal greenspace areas were identified as 2.25 ha for arid cities, 1.48 ha for semi-arid cities, 1.64 ha for dry sub-humid cities, and 1.8 ha for humid cities. This work opens new avenues for quantifying cumulative cooling effect from a 3D perspective, which may also scientifically inform urban greenspace planning and climate adaptation strategies."

 Frequency decomposition offers a promising approach for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) by separating anomalies from redundant backgrounds. However, an improper decomposition strategy may cause domain shifts in the low-frequency component (LFC) and excessive suppression of the high-frequency component (HFC), ultimately affecting detection performance. To address those challenges, we propose a novel frequency decomposition framework wavelet-enhanced diffusion framework for HAD, termed as WDHAD. Following a 2D discrete wavelet transformation, the LFC and HFC are processed in parallel: 1) The LFC is handled via a Low-Frequency Diffusion Model (LFDM), which employs a Low-Frequency Denoising Autoencoder (LFDAE) with spatial-frequency attention to recover key features and remove background noise. 2) The HFC is processed through a High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM) that preserves edges and textures to improve anomaly detection. Both components are then fused and passed through a 2D inverse wavelet transformation, with the detection map obtained by a Reed-Xiaoli detector. In addition, a negative log-likelihood noise loss is introduced to model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on six public and two real-world UAV datasets demonstrate that WDHAD achieves robust generalization and cross-domain adaptability.

 Data-driven models applied to landslide prediction have historically been mostly confined to the pure spatial context, as per landslide susceptibility requirements. Its standard definition assumes that the occurrence probability is conditional on a broad set of static predictors and that in turn, it does not change with time. To find data-driven models where the probability is temporally dynamic, we need to explore early-warning systems. However, these models traditionally rely only upon rainfall (intensity-duration characteristics) and neglect influences from terrain, geological, and other thematic contributors. Space-time data-driven models can incorporate both static and dynamic predictors, allowing for a rich description of the landslide process and for the susceptibility to change both in space and time. In this work, we present an overview of potential variations of space–time landslide susceptibility models for an area in Chongqing, China. In doing so, we present space–time models suited for long-term (yearly or seasonal models) or short-term (monthly or daily) planning. Therefore, the manuscript presents elements of a review as well as elements of methodological innovation.

 Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) suffers from adverse air quality particularly during the winter season, thereby affecting climate, health, and economic activities, warranting the need for information on key species, sources and atmospheric pathways causing intense particulate pollution. Using over one month (February–March) of sub-micron particle (PM1) chemical composition data and κ-Köhler theory at a Delhi background site, we estimate that the water uptake ability of both PM1 (kappa, κ = 0.52 ± 0.10) and its organic component (κOA = 0.22 ± 0.04) during the late winter season are almost twice as that of global average for continental aerosols. Our results indicate that apart from previously identified ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), the semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosols (SVOOA) directly increase the PM1 water uptake ability, and undergo co-condensation with water vapor under high RH and low temperature conditions during early morning hours, thereby increasing the cloud condensation nuclei counts (CCN vs SVOOA, linear correlation R = 0.81) and total PM1 mass (CCN vs PM1, R = 0.88) in the Delhi region. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) results of both gas and particle phase organics suggest that semi-volatile oxygenated organic compounds were mainly associated with solid-fuel and traffic-related combustion emissions, whereas correlation with source-specific tracers suggest non-combustion emissions for NH4Cl.

 Three years (2021 – 2023) of in-situ ground-based observations from a high-altitude site in Western Ghats, India, have been utilized to study the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and closure during the monsoon (JJAS, June to September), including its transition periods (May and October). Aerosol-CCN characteristics showed an apparent temporal variation between monsoon and its transition periods. The estimated aerosol bulk hygroscopicity (κ) showed a narrow (broad) distribution during monsoon (transition periods). Aitken mode was dominant during JJAS, while Aitken-accumulation mode was dominant during the transition periods, suggesting that these modes primarily control the bulk hygroscopicity of the total aerosol population. These further indicate the increased wet scavenging of larger aerosol particles during JJAS compared to transition periods. The CCN closure study was performed using different κ values. The analysis showed a good closure in JJAS when κ = 0.15 was considered, while the transition periods showed a good closure at various κ and supersaturation (SS) values. This suggests that the CCN closure is less sensitive to the change in SS or κ during JJAS than the transition periods. Hence, the assumption of a single κ (e.g., κ = 0.15) or a narrow range of κ (= 0.15 – 0.20) can be considered during monsoon, while the same assumption cannot be applied during the transition periods for the study region.

 A large spread exists in future precipitation projections based on climate models, particularly at regional scales, and efforts are needed to reduce uncertainties for effective regional adaptation strategies. Using outputs of 27 CMIP6 models, this study investigates uncertainties in mean and extreme precipitation projections over China. It is shown that uncertainties in the fractional change of mean precipitation are proportional to the magnitude of projected changes, being higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast, while extreme precipitation exhibits a more uniform spatial distribution. An analysis of uncertainty decomposition reveals that internal variability dominates short-term projection uncertainty, particularly for extreme precipitation. By the end of the 21st century, model uncertainty emerges as the largest contributor to mean precipitation uncertainty and accounts for more than one-third of extreme precipitation uncertainty. Optimal model selection method can reduce model uncertainty up to about 40 %, and it is more effective for mean precipitation than for extreme precipitation. Besides, the effectiveness of the method varies largely with the evaluation metrics and regions considered, emphasizing the need for metric-specific and region-specific model evaluations. These findings highlight the importance of tailored strategies to improve the reliability of future regional precipitation projections."

This paper presents the first comprehensive review of AML research, with a focus on the Micro Rain Radar (MRR), a specialized precipitation profiler based on K-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. We have organized the literature into four main themes: AML detection using MRR, comparisons with other instruments (e.g., radiosonde, scanning weather radar, satellite, and lidar) and reanalysis data, spatiotemporal variations in AML height, and methods for classifying precipitation event types (e.g., convective vs. stratiform). The in-depth critical review highlights strengths in the MRR's high temporal and spatial resolution, portability, and ability to continuously monitor precipitation microphysics. MRR provides multiple moments (e.g., reflectivity, and fall velocity) invaluable for AML studies, and their combination can enhance the consistency of AML detection, and event type classification. Nonetheless, limitations such as the single-polarization design, signal attenuation during heavy rainfall, and limited vertical range necessitate complementary datasets and advanced data processing techniques including artificial intelligence. Key findings underscore opportunities for gap filling and regionalization of AML observations, using mobile setups and multi-sensor campaigns. Also, modeling AML using surface weather variables can help link climate change studies and precipitation projections to anticipated AML behavior. The review concludes by outlining future directions and opportunities to advance AML research and applications."

Warming has emerged over more than 90% of the global land surface as of 2020, and had emerged over more than 50% of the earth’s land surface by 2000. Emergence occurs despite observational and model uncertainty creating delays of more than 10 years over 75% of the land surface. These conclusions demonstrate that accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty is necessary for robust detection of climate change emergence."

It is found that models exhibit a large diversity in the western extension of the IPO, leading to distinct global impacts. The IPO-related sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies extend more westward to the equatorial western Pacific (WP) in the low-resolution (LR) models, along with a westward shift of atmospheric responses. However, such biases are largely reduced in the high-resolution (HR) models, ascribing to better behavior in reproducing the mean-state SST in the cold tongue. In general, the HR models simulate smaller zonal advection in the equatorial WP due to a weaker zonal SST gradient compared to the LR models. In addition to the tropics, the intensity of IPO-related SST over the North Pacific is also improved in the HR models due to their benefits in simulating the Kuroshio extension. These findings suggest that the HR models have superior capabilities in predicting and projecting future changes in the IPO."

Part of the problem is the existence of ‘hot spots’ of methane flux, which have not been clearly identified and studied at multiple scales. Methane has a short lifetime compared to carbon dioxide; thus, efforts to avoid methane hot spots from constructed wetlands can promptly decelerate the rate of atmospheric warming. In this study we measured methane fluxes using flux towers in a restored oligohaline wetland in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, where we previously identified a hot spot of methane flux using footprint-weighed flux maps and chambers. Our main objectives with this study were to determine why this hot spot occurs and what are the biogeochemical and microbiological conditions that lead to these high methane fluxes. We found four main mechanisms that explain the existence of the hot spot. (1) The hot spot was associated with areas where the water level was closer to the surface (2) Methane originated mostly from older unoxidized peat in deeper layers, which had a shorter migration pathway to the atmosphere at the hot spot location due to soil disturbance during wetland construction. (3) Relatively lower methane oxidation in the hot spot in the upper soil layer (10–30 cm under the surface), deduced from isotopic profiles in porewater carbon and upper-level methanotroph abundance. (4) Higher ebullition events at the hot spot that can be related to low water levels and lower bulk density throughout the soil profile. This study thus suggests that mitigating soil disturbances during wetland construction and managing water level can reduce the occurrence and magnitude of hot spots of methane flux in constructed wetlands."

Using observational datasets, we uncover significant multidecadal shifts in the northern and southern edges of the WPWP. Heat budget analysis based on century-long ocean model hindcast simulations reveals that the meridional displacements of the WPWP northern edge are mainly caused by surface heat flux variations, while the southern edge’s shifts can be primarily attributed to meridional oceanic heat advection associated with the wind-driven Ekman transport. These meridional movements largely covary with the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), expanding poleward during AMV’s ascending phases and contracting equatorward during descending phase. Multi-model idealized AMV± experiments estimate that trans-basin forcing of the AMV accounts for 47% ± 8% of the observed northern edge shifts and 26% ± 7% of the southern edge changes. Reducing model uncertainties in AMV teleconnections will help to better quantify their impacts on the Pacific decadal climate variability."

However, this relationship did not hold for agricultural soil extracts collected in the UK and Canada. To explain this difference, we propose that as the complexity of the sample increases, the hydrophobic interfaces in the bulk compete with the air–water interface. 
 Organic matter in agricultural soil dust can enhance dust's ice-nucleating ability relative to mineral dust and thus impact local cloud formation. But how is this organic matter able to nucleate ice? We hypothesised that hydrophobic interfaces, such as the air–water interface, influence how organic matter nucleates ice, which can be quantified by measuring surface tension. Here, we investigated correlations between surfactant properties and ice-nucleating activities of amphiphilic macromolecules common in agricultural soils and known ice nucleators, namely lignin and macromolecules from Snomax. Lignin and Snomax solutions were analysed using our droplet freezing technique, FINC, and an optical contact angle tensiometer. Results showed that lignin and Snomax solutions of increasing concentrations had increasing ice-nucleating activity and decreasing surface tension. In addition, high-speed cryo-microscopy of the same solutions revealed a preference for freezing at the air–water interface, consistent with these proxies being ice-active surfactants preferentially residing at the air–water interface, and thus hydrophobic surfaces. We then tested this relationship in field-collected agricultural soil extracts from the UK and Canada. Despite the trend observed for lignin and Snomax, there was no clear correlation between surface tension and freezing temperature of the soil extracts. This discrepancy may arise from the high complexity of the soil solutions, where hydrophobic interfaces in the bulk potentially compete with the air–water interface. Overall, we present further evidence of the role of hydrophobic interfaces in the heterogeneous ice nucleation of organic aerosols with implications for aerosol–cloud interactions."

Using machine learning, it identifies the most influential factors affecting soil DOC levels and maps global DOC patterns. The findings help guide soil management and climate strategies, with the dataset available for further research. 
 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) constitutes the most active carbon pool in soils and plays critical roles in soil carbon cycling, plant productivity, and global climate change. Accurately assessing soil DOC quantity is essential to elucidate ecosystem functions and services. However, global driving factors and the spatial distribution of soil DOC remain poorly quantified, largely due to limited large-scale data. Here, we compile a comprehensive global database of soil DOC concentrations, encompassing 12 807 observations extracted from 975 scientific publications published between 1984 and 2020. We also record detailed geographic locations, climatic variables, and soil properties as predictors. Machine learning techniques were employed, including 10-fold cross-validation and evaluating model performance by R2 and root mean square error values, to predict the relative importance of various predictors and the global distribution of soil DOC concentrations. Worldwide soil DOC concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 7859 mg kg−1, averaging 222.78 mg kg−1. The 14 selected predictors, including elevation, soil properties, and climate, explained 63 % of the variance in soil DOC concentrations. Elevation played the most important predictor for soil DOC prediction, followed by soil organic carbon, seasonal variability of temperature, and soil clay content. Soil DOC decreases initially but increases when soil clay content exceeds 20 % and seasonal variability of temperature exceeds 0.7. Using these findings, a global map of predicted soil DOC concentrations was produced at a 0.05° by 0.05° resolution. Global soil DOC concentrations generally increased from the Equator to the poles wherein the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) holds 13.47 Pg of soil DOC with substantial variations across continents. These results inform soil management practices strategies, ecosystem services evaluations, and climate change mitigation efforts. Furthermore, we envision integrating our database with other carbon pools to advance understanding of total soil carbon turnover and to refine Earth system models.

Where possible, the model has been extended to neighbouring states, e.g., Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland or Austria.

After hydrothermal aging at 650 °C, the NH3–SCR activity of phosphorus-poisoned Cu/SSZ-13 catalysts with high phosphorus loading (0.6 mmol/gcat) cannot be effectively restored; however, the addition of Mg enables nearly complete recovery of their activity. Combining advanced microscopy evidence with complementary spectroscopy results, we reveal that Mg ions occupy the Brønsted acid sites in the six-membered rings (6-MRs) of SSZ-13, which regulates the distribution of subsequently introduced Cu ions while enhancing the stability of Cu2+ and the framework Al of SSZ-13, inhibiting the aggregation of Cu species after phosphorus poisoning and thereby improving resistance.

CH4 emissions from reservoirs, characterized by ebullition and diffusion, primarily increase with temperature but are suppressed when reservoirs are frozen.

The CH4 emissions from the Yonghwasil Reservoir in South Korea were measured using the eddy covariance method to analyze their behavior under varying meteorological conditions. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with air temperature with negligible emissions observed at air temperatures below 8 °C. Therefore, CH4 emission rates during the summer season are significantly higher than those in winter. From August to October, more than 60% of CH4 was emitted as ebullition. In contrast, from November to January, total CH4 emissions decreased, with a resulting 80% from diffusion.

However, its influence on sea‐air CO2 flux remains uncertain, despite the KE region being recognized as one of the principal oceanic carbon sinks globally. Utilizing observational data and a state‐of‐the‐art global ocean biogeochemistry model that assimilates both physical and biogeochemical observations, we reveal that the KE bimodal states substantially modulate sea‐air CO2 flux. During the KE stable state, oceanic CO2 uptake intensifies due to lateral divergence of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) within the mixed layer and increased surface wind speed. The DIC divergence results from the northward displacement of the DIC front associated with the northward‐shifted KE jet.

Systems with river runoff and strong evaporation can form a salinity maximum between the freshwater sources and the adjacent ocean, a so‐called salt plug. In this study, we explore the diahaline overturning circulation and the associated diahaline mixing in the Persian Gulf as a representative salt plug estuary. The overturning structure combines features of classical and inverse estuaries: Salt mixing per salinity class is the product of salinity and river runoff at low salinities, and salinity and evaporation at the high salinities of the salt plugs. Overall, riverine freshwater and hypersaline water are transformed by mixing toward the salinity of the outflowing water. For the case of the Persian Gulf, the dynamically important separation of the surface and bottom layers in summer is highlighted by the overturning analysis."

The model well reproduces the seasonal lake thermodynamics, highlighting the phases of summer‐autumn warm thermal stratification, late‐autumn overturning, winter‐spring inverse thermal stratification, and late‐spring overturning. Heat budget analysis underscores the importance of lateral heat transport and ice freeze‐thaw processes in shaping the horizontal thermal variability. During 2007–2017, lake surface temperature, as well as the duration, onset and end of warm thermal stratification, show significant interannual variations related to the surface air temperature and ice conditions. During winter‐spring, the lake water flow speed shows strong interannual variability related to wind speed and ice conditions. Nevertheless, a consistent circulation pattern is found, featuring a dominant mid‐lake cyclonic gyre, upwelling along the western coast, and strong coastal currents driven by the prevailing southwesterly winds during December–January, followed by weakened lake water motions during February–April when the packed ice inhibits the wind stress input. In contrast, the summer‐autumn lake circulation is weaker but more variable, with the mid‐lake circulation shifting between being cyclonic (caused by the combined effects of southwesterly winds, positive wind stress curl and density effects) and occasionally anti‐cyclonic (due to the presence of negative wind stress curl)."

Surface spectral emissivity matters more in cold and dry environments than in hot and humid environments. Recent modeling studies confirmed that, for current climate simulations, this process affects the polar climate more than the extra‐polar climate. As for the Snowball Earth, a period characterized by global polar‐like conditions of extreme cold and low humidity, including surface spectral emissivity could alter the simulated global radiation budget. This, in turn, could affect the simulated climate of the Snowball Earth. Here, we use an aqua‐planet slab‐ocean simulation of Snowball Earth by the ICON model to perform offline radiative transfer calculations to quantify such impact on the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The offline radiative transfer model is used to compute the clear‐sky OLR for two surfaces that would be present in the extremely cold simulation: ice and snow. Compared to the results with assumed blackbody surface, the global mean OLR decreases by 2.9 and 1.0 W m−2 for ice and snow surfaces, respectively. The impact of surface spectral emissivity on the OLR is strongest at the equator and weakens toward the poles, presenting a noticeable meridional gradient. Effects of surface emissivity are also larger during the summer than the winter.

For predicting the variability of wetland CH4 flux under warming, gross primary productivity (GPP) and LE, replacing wind direction (WD), were dominant variables for tropical swamps, while NEE was important for high‐latitude fens and bogs under warm temperatures. For wetland NEE, the role of TA and TS decreased across all wetland types with warming, while vapor pressure deficit (VPD) became more important for mid and high‐latitude wetlands.

Most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models overestimate the short‐rain response to IOD events in Eastern Africa, especially during negative events. This is due to enhanced zonal moisture transport anomalies, mainly related to amplified IOD intensity and the westward extension of the IOD eastern core. Mean‐state precipitation biases further contribute to overestimated short rains, traced back to the mean‐state positive IOD‐like biases. Under global warming, the contrasting short‐rain responses to IOD in the Horn of Africa and Southeastern Africa are primarily driven by the westward‐shifting IOD circulation. Enhanced impacts in the Horn of Africa are driven by stronger IOD‐related zonal winds and the more humid mean‐state atmosphere which is attributed to the IOD‐like warming pattern. In contrast, weakened impacts in Southeastern Africa are associated with anomalous meridional wind changes. Additionally, due to more extreme negative IOD events, the frequency as well as severity of droughts in the Horn of Africa are projected to increase.

Data are integrated with sediment load, wave dynamics, sea level, and surface elevation to analyze drivers of wetland gain and loss. Results indicate a minor net change of only 1.21 km2, with a total gain of 160.83 km2 and a total loss of 159.62 km2. Overall stability of wetland area masks significant regional variability, with notable wetland expansion in the interior and substantial losses along eastern and southeastern margins. Sediment diversion toward the interior of the delta lead to distributaries narrowing (Main Pass and Pass a Loutre) that further hindered sediment‐laden water transport into deltaic margins. Wetland dynamics along the edges were closely linked to wave action, with large‐scale retreat in northern (4.0 ± 9.9 m/yr), eastern (58.0 ± 48.2 m/yr), and southeastern (38.6 ± 15.8 m/yr) regions, while progradation in the southern (13.6 ± 10.1 m/yr) and western areas (7.4 ± 19.4 m/yr).

With the intensification of droughts under climate change, understanding ecosystem responses to these events is essential. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of droughts on Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in India over the 21st century. We tested two hypotheses: (a) increasing drought intensity and frequency will exacerbate NPP reductions, and (b) climate warming will diminish ecosystem resilience, leading to greater NPP reductions per drought event. To evaluate ecosystem responses, we employed a Multi‐Dimensional Resilience Index (MDRI), which integrates resistance and recovery time to quantify resilience. Our analysis revealed a substantial increase in extreme and moderate droughts, while mild droughts remained stable. Extreme droughts were projected to cause NPP reductions three times greater under the SSP2‐4.5 scenario and six times greater under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario compared to the baseline period (1850–2014). Ecosystems in the Western Ghats and lower Himalayan regions demonstrated moderate resilience due to prolonged recovery times and moderate resistance. Conversely, ecosystems in Northeastern India exhibited high resilience, characterized by strong resistance and shorter recovery periods. Interestingly, while resistance exhibited an increasing trend, likely influenced by carbon fertilization, recovery times showed a declining trend, potentially linked to rising temperatures. These findings do not support the second hypothesis, as no significant changes in overall ecosystem resilience were observed due to compensatory effects between resistance and recovery.

Large‐scale DAC deployment, though, will require significant cost reductions in part through policy and investment support. This study evaluates the impact of policy interventions on DAC cost reduction by integrating energy system optimization and learning curve models. We examine how three policy instruments—incremental deployment, accelerated deployment, and R&D‐driven innovation—impact DAC learning investment, which is the total investment required until the technology achieves cost parity with conventional alternatives or target cost. Our findings show that while incremental deployment demands significant learning investment, R&D‐driven innovation is considerably cheaper at cost reduction. Under a baseline 8% learning rate, incremental deployment may require up to $998 billion to reduce costs from $1,154 to $400/tCO2, while accelerated deployment support could save approximately $7 billion on that investment. In contrast, R&D support achieves equivalent cost reductions at less than half the investment of incremental deployment. However, the effectiveness of R&D intervention varies with learning rates and R&D breakthroughs. R&D yields net benefits in all cases except at extremely low breakthroughs (5%) and very high learning rates (20%), where they are slightly more expensive. For learning rates below 20%, R&D provides net benefits even at minimal breakthroughs.

This reveals that vector density, which depends on climate conditions, and EIR, which depends on both climate and population density, will rise significantly and permanently above the pre‐industrial background variability due to anthropogenic causes in Africa. Both the vector density and EIR have areas, mainly in central Africa, where anthropogenic causes have already significantly changed, and many more areas will experience anthropogenic caused changes in the period 2030–2050 and toward the end of this century.

 Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, with debris disks being the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few million up to a few billion years, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies1,2. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds, of astronomical units have been resolved with high-spatial-resolution, high-contrast imagers at optical and near-infrared or (sub)millimetre interferometers3,4. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals2,5. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2–10 MJ) of high-contrast imaging instruments (see, for example, refs. 6–9) before the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we have used the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument10,11 in the thermal infrared to search for such planets in the disk of the approximately 6.4-Myr-old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arcsec from the star, which is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet. Its estimated mass (about 0.3 MJ) and position (about 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.

 Aggregation pheromone, 4-vinylanisole (4VA), is specifically released by gregarious migratory locusts, and is crucial in forming locust swarms that cause destructive plagues1. Control of locust plagues relies heavily on the extensive application of chemical pesticides, which has led to severe environmental and health issues2. As pheromones are primary mediators of insect communication and behaviour3, exploring their biosynthesis can provide important cues to develop innovative behavioural regulators, potentially reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Here we resolve the biosynthesis of 4VA and behavioural responses of locusts when enzymes in the 4VA biosynthetic pathway are manipulated. The process initiates with phenylalanine derived from food plants and proceeds through three precursors: cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-vinylphenol (4VP). Notably, the conversion from 4VP to 4VA through methylation is unique to gregarious locusts. This step is catalysed by two crucial methyltransferases, 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2. Guided by the X-ray co-crystal structure of 4VPMT2 bound with 4VP and S-adenosyl-l-methionine, we developed 4-nitrophenol as a substrate surrogate. We identified several chemicals that can block 4VA production by inhibiting the enzymatic activities of 4VPMT proteins, thereby suppressing locust aggregative behaviour. The findings uncover the chemical logic behind 4VA biosynthesis and pinpoint two crucial enzymes as novel targets for locust swarm management. In locusts, the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole is derived from dietary phenylalanine, and its production is dependent on two 4-vinylphenol methyltransferases that are potential targets for locust pest control."

 All-solid-state batteries require advanced cathode designs to realize their potential for high energy density and economic viability1–3. Integrated all-in-one cathodes, which eliminate inactive conductive additives and heterogeneous interfaces, hold promise for substantial energy and stability gains but are hindered by materials lacking sufficient Li+/e− conductivity, mechanical robustness and structural stability4–14. Here we present Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4, a cost-effective halide material that overcomes these challenges. Leveraging reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox and rapid Li+/e− transport within its framework, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 achieves an electrode energy density of 529.3 Wh kg−1 versus Li+/Li. Critically, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 shows unique dynamic properties during cycling, including reversible local Fe migration and a brittle-to-ductile transition that confers self-healing behaviour. This enables exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 90% capacity retention for 3,000 cycles at a rate of 5 C. Integration of Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 with a nickel-rich layered oxide further increases the energy density to 725.6 Wh kg−1.

 The broad bandgap tunability of both perovskites and organic semiconductors enables the development of perovskite–organic tandem solar cells with promising theoretical efficiency. However, the certified efficiencies of reported perovskite–organic tandem solar cells remain lower than those of single-junction perovskite solar cells, primarily because of insufficient near-infrared photocurrent in narrow-bandgap organic subcells1–3. Here we design and synthesize an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), P2EH-1V, featuring a unilateral conjugated π-bridge to reduce the optical bandgap to 1.27 eV while maintaining ideal exciton dissociation and nanomorphology. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms efficient hole transfer from P2EH-1V to the donor PM6. Devices based on P2EH-1V exhibit reduced non-radiative voltage losses of 0.20 eV without compromising charge-generation efficiency. We achieve a 17.9% efficiency for the organic bottom cell, with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.60 mA cm−2.

 The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1–8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7–13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy.

 Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific concept1. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter, such as deconfined quark–gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions2 or expanding quantum degenerate gases3,4. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges5,6, levitons7 and anyon statistics8. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity9 as the number of interacting particles increases10 remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analysing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit at which the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet scattering experiments illustrate how coordinated behaviour emerges through interactions of only a few elementary constituents. Studying similar signatures in other physical platforms such as cold-atom simulators4,11 or collections of anyonic excitations8,12 may help identify emergence of exotic phases and, more broadly, advance understanding of matter engineering. The emergence of universal collective behaviour is demonstrated through collisions of electron droplets containing up to five particles, which exhibit strong all-body correlations characteristic of a Coulomb liquid."

 Prevailing frameworks to address planetary environmental challenges tend to focus on setting goals, targets, or boundaries to limit human harm to ecosystems or species. Here we propose an aspirational approach aimed at empowering people to shape a better future for all of life on Earth. We do this by building on the human development approach and its supporting metrics, especially the Human Development Index (HDI), a broadly influential framework that has contributed to decades of human progress by measuring and promoting people’s capabilities to lead the lives that they value. Rather than assessing the state or dynamics of the biosphere, we propose the Nature Relationship Index (NRI), which would focus on measuring the progress of nations towards delivering mutually beneficial relationships among people and the rest of the living world in terms that people widely understand and value. Through an open-ended process informed by expert consultation, international concept testing and indicator development, the NRI could help to incentivize progress towards a world in which humanity thrives together with the rest of life on Earth. We explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a robust NRI and invite broader participation to facilitate this development in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.

 The incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) enables customized chemistry to tailor protein functions1–3. Genetic code expansion offers a general approach for ncAA encoding by reassigning stop codons as the ‘blank’ codon; however, it is not completely orthogonal to translation termination for cellular transcripts. Here, to generate more bona fide blank codons, we developed an RNA codon-expansion (RCE) strategy that introduces and decodes bioorthogonally assignable pseudouridine (Ψ) codons (ΨGA, ΨAA or ΨAG) on specified mRNA transcripts to incorporate ncAAs in mammalian cells. The RCE strategy comprises a programmable guide RNA4, an engineered decoder tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. We first developed the RCE(ΨGA) system, which incorporates functional ncAAs into proteins via the ΨGA codon, demonstrating a higher translatome-wide and proteomic specificity compared with the genetic code expansion system. We further expanded our strategy to produce the RCE(ΨAA) and RCE(ΨAG) systems, with all three Ψ codon:(Ψ codon)-tRNAPyl pairs exhibiting mutual orthogonality. Moreover, we demonstrated that the RCE system cooperates compatibly with the genetic code expansion strategy for dual ncAA encoding. In sum, the RCE method utilized Ψ as a post-transcriptional ‘letter’ to encode and decode RNA codons in specific mRNA transcripts, opening a new route for genetic alphabet expansion and site-specific ncAA incorporation in eukaryotic cells.

 The Tweety homologues (TTYHs) constitute a family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that, on the basis of structural features, were recently proposed to contribute to lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes1. However, in the absence of supporting data, this function was hypothetical. Here through pull-down of endogenous proteins, we identify APOE as the interaction partner of human TTYH2. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry assays showed that both proteins colocalize in endosomal compartments. Characterization of the specific interaction between APOE and TTYH2 through binding assays and structural studies enabled us to identify an epitope in an extended domain of TTYH2 that faces the endosomal lumen. Structures of complexes with APOE-containing lipoprotein particles revealed a binding mode that places lipids in a suitable position to facilitate their diffusion into the membrane. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that lipid transfer is accelerated by TTYH2. Collectively, our findings indicate that TTYH2 has a role in the unloading of APOE-containing lipoproteins after they are endocytosed. These results define a new protein class that facilitates the extraction of lipids from and their insertion into cellular membranes. Although ubiquitous, this process could be of particular relevance in the brain, where APOE is involved in the transfer of lipids between astrocytes and neurons.

 Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis1–3. Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown4–8. Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Experiments in fission yeast show that cyclin-dependent kinase is first activated in the nucleus, from which the mitotic signal is propagated from CDK at the centrosome to the cytoplasm."

 Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics1–4. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware5–8, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modelled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities and may change their material properties with use9–12. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot’s actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots’ materials, actuation or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.

We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders. These studies provide a new framework for understanding and treating enteric neuropathies.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain malignancy1. Immunosuppression in the GBM tumour microenvironment (TME) is an important barrier to immune-targeted therapies, but our understanding of the mechanisms of immune regulation in the GBM TME is limited2. Here we describe a viral barcode interaction-tracing approach3 to analyse TME cell–cell communication in GBM clinical samples and preclinical models at single-cell resolution. We combine it with single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses, human organotypic GBM cultures, in vivo cell-specific CRISPR–Cas9-driven genetic perturbations as well as human and mouse experimental systems to identify an annexin A1–formyl peptide receptor 1 (ANXA1–FPR1) bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication pathway that limits tumour-specific immunity. FPR1 inhibits immunogenic necroptosis in tumour cells, and ANXA1 suppresses NF-κB and inflammasome activation in astrocytes. ANXA1 expression in astrocytes and FPR1 expression in cancer cells are associated with poor outcomes in individuals with GBM. The inactivation of astrocyte–glioma ANXA1–FPR1 signalling enhanced dendritic cell, T cell and macrophage responses, increasing infiltration by tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and limiting T cell exhaustion. In summary, we have developed a method to analyse TME cell–cell interactions at single-cell resolution in clinical samples and preclinical models, and used it to identify bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication through ANXA1–FPR1 as a driver of immune evasion and tumour progression.  Using viral barcode tracing to detect interactions between glioblastoma cells and non-malignant astrocytes in patient samples, investigators discovered a pathway that reduces tumour-specific immunity and identified potential therapeutic targets."

 The brain represents sensory variables in the coordinated activity of neural populations, in which tuning curves of single neurons define the geometry of the population code1,2. Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations3–8. Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.

 The global crisis of plastic waste accumulation threatens wildlife and ecosystems1. Catalytic processes that convert plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels offer promising solutions2. Recycling or upcycling of real-life plastic mixtures is challenging owing to their diverse composition and structure3. Here we propose a product-oriented strategy leveraging the orthogonality in reactivities of different functional groups in plastic mixtures to yield valuable products. This approach involves identifying functional groups followed by converting a selective component in the mixture to valuable products. We use mixtures of polystyrene, polylactic acid, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as real-life plastics, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The diverse physical and chemical properties of these components, which typically hinder direct recovery, offer opportunities for extraction and transformation with the proposed strategy. From a 20-g mixture of real-life plastics, including polystyrene foam, a polylactic acid straw, a polyurethane tube, a polycarbonate mask, a polyvinyl chloride bag, a polyethylene terephthalate bottle, a polyethylene dropper and a polypropylene bottle, we obtained more than 8 separate chemicals: 1.3 g of benzoic acid, 0.5 g of plasticizer, 0.7 g of alanine, 0.7 g of lactic acid, 1.4 g of aromatic amine salt, 2.1 g of bisphenol A, 2.0 g of terephthalic acid and 3.5 g of C3–C6 alkanes.

 Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine1. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine2. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons. The results also provide a rational explanation for the different neurotoxicity profiles of an important class of antineoplastic agents. Certain antimetabolites used to treat cancer are more neurotoxic than others, and it is now shown that this is due to their greater tendency to generate DNA double-stranded breaks, whereas less neurotoxic agents induce single-stranded breaks."

 Tailoring magnetic ordering in solid-state materials is essential for emerging spintronics1,2. However, substitutional lattice doping in magnetic semiconductors is often constrained by the low solubility of magnetic elements3–5, limiting the maximum achievable doping concentration (for example, less than 5%) and ferromagnetic ordering temperature6. The intercalation of magnetic elements in layered two-dimensional atomic crystals (2DACs) without breaking in-plane covalent bonds offers an alternative approach to incorporate a much higher concentration of magnetic atoms (for example, up to 50%) beyond the typical solubility limit. However, commonly used chemical and electrochemical intercalation methods are largely confined to a few isolated examples so far. Here we report a general two-step intercalation and cation-exchange strategy to produce a library of highly ordered magnetic intercalation superlattices (MISLs) with tunable magnetic ordering. Monovalent transition-metal cations Cu+ and Ag+, divalent magnetic cations Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, and trivalent rare-earth cations Eu3+ and Gd3+ have been successfully incorporated into group-VIB 2DACs, including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2, and group-IVB, -VB, -IIIA, -IVA and -VA 2DACs, including TiS2, NbS2, NbSe2, TaS2, In2Se3, SnSe2, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. We show that these MISLs can be prepared with tunable concentrations of magnetic intercalants, enabling tailored magnetic ordering across a diverse array of functional 2DACs, including semiconductors, topological insulators, and superconductors. This work establishes a versatile material platform for both fundamental investigations and spintronics applications.

 Lanthanides have shown magnetic memory at both the atomic1,2 and molecular3,4 level. The magnetic remanence temperatures of lanthanide single-molecule magnets can surpass d-transition metal examples5,6, and since 2017, energy barriers to magnetic reversal (Ueff) from 1,237(28) cm–1 to 1,631(25) cm–1 and open magnetic hysteresis loops between 40 K and 80 K have typically been achieved with axial dysprosium(III) bis(cyclopentadienyl) complexes7–17. It has been predicted that linear dysprosium(III) compounds could deliver greater mJ (the projection of the total angular momentum, J, on a quantization axis labelled z) state splitting and therefore higher Ueff and hysteresis temperatures18–21, but as lanthanide bonding is predominantly ionic22,23, so far dysprosium bis(amide) complexes have shown highly bent geometries that promote fast magnetic reversal24,25. Here we report a dysprosium bis(amide)–alkene complex, [Dy{N(SiiPr3)[Si(iPr)2C(CH3)=CHCH3]}{N(SiiPr3)(SiiPr2Et)}][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (1-Dy), that shows Ueff = 1,843(11) cm–1 and slow closing of soft magnetic hysteresis loops up to 100 K. Calculations show that the Ueff value for 1-Dy arises from the charge-dense amide ligands, with a pendant alkene taking a structural role to enforce a large N–Dy–N angle while imposing only a weak equatorial interaction. This leads to molecular spin dynamics up to 100 times slower than the current best single-molecule magnets above 90 K.

 An increasing number of scholars, policymakers and grassroots communities argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research—and computer-vision research in particular—has become the primary source for developing and powering mass surveillance1–7. Yet, the pathways from computer vision to surveillance continue to be contentious. Here we present an empirical account of the nature and extent of the surveillance AI pipeline, showing extensive evidence of the close relationship between the field of computer vision and surveillance. Through an analysis of computer-vision research papers and citing patents, we found that most of these documents enable the targeting of human bodies and body parts. Comparing the 1990s to the 2010s, we observed a fivefold increase in the number of these computer-vision papers linked to downstream surveillance-enabling patents. Additionally, our findings challenge the notion that only a few rogue entities enable surveillance. Rather, we found that the normalization of targeting humans permeates the field. This normalization is especially striking given patterns of obfuscation. We reveal obfuscating language that allows documents to avoid direct mention of targeting humans, for example, by normalizing the referring to of humans as ‘objects’ to be studied without special consideration.

 Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies1–7. However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations8–17, generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10−4), broadband (about 400–900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10−3) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts18,19 in the time domain.

But is all lithium metal equal? Here, the authors analyze the influence of lithium purity and show how different lithium metal samples can be, especially when electrodeposited in “anode-free” cells. 
 Recent studies emphasize that incorporating lithium metal electrodes can increase the energy density of next generation batteries. However, the production of lithium metal with high purity requires multi-stage purification steps due to its high reactivity. Furthermore, subsequent handling under inert conditions is required to prevent degradation. To circumvent handling of lithium metal and further improve energy density, researchers are exploring reservoir-free cells often referred to as “anode-free” cells. Reservoir-free cells are assembled without using lithium metal. Instead, lithium is electrodeposited at the interface between a current collector and a solid electrolyte from positive electrode materials during the first charge. Despite the potential of reservoir-free cells, there is limited understanding of the purity of electrodeposited lithium metal and how impurities might affect the electrochemical kinetics. This study examines first the purity of electrodeposited lithium at the steel|Li6PS5Cl interface. Then, it shows how impurities in lithium electrodes affect stripping capacity when using commercial lithium metal foils with both Li6PS5Cl and Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 as solid electrolytes. By using time-of-flight secondary mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, we reveal that a lithium layer with high purity is electrodeposited at the negative electrode in reservoir-free cells and that common impurities in lithium metal (reservoir-type) electrodes like e.g. sodium negatively influence the accessible lithium capacity during discharge.

 Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a lethal embryonal brain tumor entity. To investigate the intratumoral heterogeneity and cellular communication in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze in this work single-cell RNA sequencing of about 250,000 cells of primary human and murine ETMR, in vitro cultures, and a 3D forebrain organoid model of ETMR, supporting the main findings with immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics of human tumors. We characterize three distinct malignant ETMR subpopulations - RG-like, NProg-like and NB-like - positioned within a putative neurodevelopmental hierarchy. We reveal PDGFRβ+ pericytes as key communication partners in the TME, contributing to stem cell signaling through extracellular matrix-mediated interactions with tumor cells. PDGF signaling is upregulated in chemoresistant RG-like cells in vivo and plays a role in recruiting pericytes to ETMR TME by finalizing a signaling cascade which promotes the differentiation of non-malignant radial glia cells, derived from our 3D model, into pericyte-like cells. Selective PDGFR-inhibition blocked the lineage differentiation into pericytes in vitro and reduced the tumor cell population in vivo. Targeting ETMR-pericyte interactions in the TME presents a promising therapeutic approach. Embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a rare and aggressive paediatric brain tumour.

 Deep tissue imaging with high contrast close to or even below the optical resolution limit is still challenging due to optical aberrations and scattering introduced by dense biological samples. This results in high complexity and cost of microscopes that can facilitate such challenges. Here, we demonstrate a cost-effective and simple to implement method to turn most two-photon laser-scanning microscopes into a super-resolution microscope for deep tissue imaging. We realize this by adding inexpensive optical devices, namely a cylindrical lens, a field rotator, and a sCMOS camera to these systems. By combining two-photon excitation with patterned line-scanning and subsequent image reconstruction, we achieve imaging of sub-cellular structures in Pinus radiata, mouse heart muscle and zebrafish. In addition, the penetration depth of super-resolved imaging in highly scattering tissue is considerably extended by using the camera’s lightsheet shutter mode. The flexibility of our method allows the examination of a variety of thick samples with a variety of fluorescent markers and microscope objective lenses. Thus, with a cost-efficient modification of a multi-photon microscope, an up to twofold resolution enhancement is demonstrated down to at least 70μm deep in tissue.

Here, the authors show that a post-translational modification on microtubules encodes activity-dependent signals instructing neuronal remodeling in the central and peripheral nervous system. 
 Developmental remodeling shapes neural circuits via activity-dependent pruning of synapses and axons. Regulation of the cytoskeleton is critical for this process, as microtubule loss via enzymatic severing is an early step of pruning across many circuits and species. However, how microtubule-severing enzymes, such as spastin, are activated in specific neuronal compartments remains unknown. Here, we reveal that polyglutamylation, a post-translational tubulin modification enriched in neurons, plays an instructive role in developmental remodeling by tagging microtubules for severing. Motor neuron-specific gene deletion of enzymes that add or remove tubulin polyglutamylation—TTLL glutamylases vs. CCP deglutamylases—accelerates or delays neuromuscular synapse remodeling in a neurotransmission-dependent manner. This mechanism is not specific to peripheral synapses but also operates in central circuits, e.g., the hippocampus. Thus, tubulin polyglutamylation acts as a cytoskeletal rheostat of remodeling that shapes neuronal morphology and connectivity. Cytoskeletal breakdown is a hallmark of synapse elimination. Here, the authors show that a post-translational modification on microtubules encodes activity-dependent signals instructing neuronal remodeling in the central and peripheral nervous system."

 Macrocyclic peptides represent an attractive drug modality due to their favourable properties and amenability to in vitro evolution techniques such as phage or mRNA display. Although very powerful, these technologies are not without limitations. In this work, we address some of their drawbacks by developing a yeast display-based strategy to generate, screen and characterise structurally diverse disulfide-cyclised peptides. The use of quantitative flow cytometry enables real-time monitoring of the screening of millions of individual macrocyclic peptides, leading to the identification of ligands with good binding properties to five different protein targets.

This study models adaptive transitions in collective travel behaviour during flood events across different cities to quantify recovery and adaptive learning from failures and reveal adaptation drivers. 
 As extreme weather events enhanced by climate change pose challenges to the resilience of critical infrastructure, the ability to handle disruptions, avoid tipping points, adapt and transform in crises becomes essential. Despite advances in resilience research, there is a need to improve empirical evidence and mathematical models to quantify the systems’ adaptive capabilities to extreme climate-related phenomena, such as floods. This research fills this gap by integrating an agent-based multimodal traffic functional model with a compound failure model to provide valuable insights into adaptation patterns (that is, mode shift and route switching) and risk mitigation in response to flood-related disruptions. The proposed modelling approach not only quantifies the recovery and adaptive capacity against failures, going beyond traditional resilience analyses, but also unveils the key factors that drive adaptation of transportation to flood-induced disasters. These factors include variations in trip demand and network density, which together reveal a universal law of mode shift. The study provides valuable insights into the design of resilient and sustainable critical infrastructure systems, such as transportation, energy and communication systems capable of withstanding severe flood events while maintaining their functionality.

 Surface water resources are crucial for agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods, particularly in water-scarce regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In Lesotho, understanding the dynamics of seasonal and perennial water bodies is vital for informed water resource management and policy development. This study evaluates spectral indices for mapping and analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water across different agroecological zones (AEZs) in Lesotho from 2016 to 2024 water years. Using harmonized Sentinel imagery integrated into a Random Forest machine-learning framework, we applied a range of water, vegetation, and soil indices to map surface water monthly and distinguish between seasonal and perennial water surfaces. Our findings reveal that the water ratio index was the most effective for mapping surface water across AEZs, outperforming others in distinguishing water from rangeland, cropland, and bare soil. Additional indices further improved water delineation in specific AEZs. Although no significant differences in classification accuracy were observed across AEZs (p > 0.05), visual inspection revealed misclassifications, mainly false positives, which could lead to overestimates of water area. Surface water trends vary regionally, with a significant increase in perennial water in the Foothills and Mountains, while seasonal water shows a non-significant decline, indicating divergent hydrological trajectories. These findings underscore the need for region-specific assessments and management strategies to address the evolving hydrological regimes. Our study provides a scalable framework for water resource assessment applicable beyond Lesotho, with significant implications for addressing water scarcity and guiding policies on water storage, climate-smart agriculture, and community-based governance in Sub-Saharan Africa."

This study examines the chemical evolution of aerosol species influenced by atmospheric ammonia (NH3) in Hongseong county, Chungcheongnam-do, Republic of Korea, during late spring 2024 (May 20 – June 18), a period characterized by intensive agricultural activity. Using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor and ammonia analyzer, an ammonium-rich atmospheric state (average NH3 concentration: 26.7 ± 12.4 ppb) was observed, with notable contributions from ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), and sulfate (SO42−), especially under high-humidity conditions. The relative contributions of nitrate to PM2.5 for low (0–15 μg/m3), medium (16–30 μg/m3), and high (over 30 μg/m3) concentration intervals were 13.8 %, 23.4 %, and 29.6 %, respectively. Elevated relative humidity (RH), averaging 63.1 % (low), 82.3 % (medium), and 91.7 % (high), played a significant role in nitrate formation for those concentration intervals.

 Knowledge about the dynamics of changes in PM10 lead concentration and the dependence of its levels on weather patterns is significant for health protection, especially in large cities. Also, it is important because of the need for effective environmental management. This study used the results of daily measurements conducted by the Polish State Environmental Monitoring and Weather Monitoring systems in 2010–2022. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique was most commonly used for the determination of PM10 Pb. Significant seasonal variability was observed (> 2 times higher values were determined in the heating period than in the non-heating period), while a downward trend in PM10 Pb concentration was demonstrated at the majority of the monitoring stations, which are mainly located in the southern part of Poland. In the heating period, the Pb concentration decreased on average by >4 times, while in the non-heating period it decreased by >2 times. The Pb concentration results are predominantly within two ranges: < 0.01 μg·m⁻3 and 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3. In the heating period, 32 % of results were in the <0.01 μg·m⁻3 range, and 66 % of results were in the 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3 range. In the non-heating period, it was the opposite: 65 % of results were in the <0.01 μg·m⁻3 range, and 34 % results were in the 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3 range. The annual norm, amounting to ≤0.5 μg·m⁻3 Pb in PM10, was not exceeded at any of the examined stations during the study years. A significant negative impact of meteorological parameters on Pb concentrations in PM10 was found in all the analyzed periods. Above average concentrations of Pb were accompanied by below average air temperatures and precipitation. The results of the study can help to develop pollution control policies and sector-specific health protection strategies so as to mitigate negative health effects related to exposure to particulate pollutants."

This study performs numerical simulations to investigate the conditions that were needed to cross between Taiwan and Yonaguni Island, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents, the Kuroshio, remains active. We combined simulations based on three ocean models with data from an actual experimental voyage conducted in 2019. The results showed that travel across this sea would have been possible on both the modern and Late Pleistocene oceans if a dugout canoe was used with a suitable departure place and paddling strategy. Recognizing the Kuroshio, paddling to counteract this current, and using high-level navigation were crucial to success. This suggests that the Paleolithic maritime expansion in the Western Pacific involved both advanced technologies and strategic challenges."

However, it is unclear how the biophysical adaptation of intracellular organelles responds to mechanical stress or how these adaptive changes affect cellular homeostasis. Here, using the tendon cell as a mechanosensitive cell type within a bioreactor, we show that the tension of the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptively increases in response to repetitive external stimuli. Depletion of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the highest expressed PM-ER tether protein, interfered with mechanotransduction from the PM to the ER, and affected the ER tension. We found that an optimized mechanical strain increased ER tension in a homeostatic manner, but excessive strain resulted in ER expansion, as well as activating ER stress. Last, we showed that changes in ER tension were linked with ER-mitochondria interactions and associated with cellular energetics and function. Together, these findings identify a PM-ER mechanotransduction mechanism that dose-dependently regulates cellular metabolism."

The Divalia Fossae, surface troughs comparable in size to the Grand Canyon, encircle two-thirds of the equator. Two giant impacts reshaped the southern hemisphere, where an older basin is partially superposed by the younger Rheasilvia basin. The origin of the Divalia Fossae is widely accepted as directly linked to the Rheasilvia impact, either by tectonics caused immediately by the impact, up-spinning, or secondary cratering. We present several geologic constraints that support a tectonic origin of the troughs due to the adjustment of Vesta’s spin axis to a geoid changed by both large impacts. The best fit to Vesta’s gravitational field corresponds to a spin axis reorientation of 3° that, when coupled with despinning, induces a stress state that predicts Divalia Fossae’s established location, fracture type, and orientation. These insights underline the importance of tectonic processes in the early evolution of protoplanets."

Using an integrated approach combining phylogenomic and ecomorphological data for 1051 ray-finned fishes, a time-dependent evolutionary model, and comparative genomic analyses of 205 marine vertebrates, we show that ecological interactions with modern cetaceans coincided with the evolution of endothermy in ray-finned fishes during the Eocene-Miocene. This result is supported by evidence of temporal and geographical overlap between cetaceans and endothermic fish lineages in the fossil record, as well as correlations between cetacean diversification and the origin of endothermy in fishes. Phylogenetic comparative analyses identified correlations between endothermy, large body sizes, and specialized swimming modes while challenging diet specialization and depth range expansion hypotheses. Comparative genomic analyses identified several genes under selection in endothermic lineages, includingcarnmt1(involved in fatty acid metabolism) anddcaf6(associated with development).

Here, we demonstrate the emergence of a Higgs echo in niobium superconductors. This approach disentangles unique quantum pathways involving the Higgs mode and QP excitations. Using Higgs echo spectroscopy, we also uncover unconventional echo formation caused by inhomogeneous broadening and “soft” QP bands, which dynamically evolve under terahertz (THz) driving. Specifically, THz pulse pairs modulate the superconducting gap, imprinting coherence and forming a temporal “Higgs grating.” This grating produces echoes with distinctive characteristics: (i) echo rephasing spectral peaks at superconducting gap frequencies, (ii) asymmetric echo formation delays unlike those observed in atoms or semiconductors, and (iii) negative-time echo signals stemming from Higgs-QP anharmonic interactions. Combined with advanced time-frequency analysis, these findings distinguish Higgs from QP responses and clarify their intricate interactions in THz-driven superconductivity."

We find that the firing rates of the somatostatin (SOM) interneurons align closely with the level of network synchrony irrespective of the target of modulatory input. Further analysis reveals that inhibition from SOM to parvalbumin interneurons must be limited to allow gradual transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and that the strength of recurrent excitation onto SOM neurons determines the level of synchrony achievable in the network. Our results are consistent with recent experimental findings on cell type–specific manipulations. Overall, our results highlight common dynamic regimes achieved across modulations of different cell populations and identify SOM cells as the main driver of network synchrony."

Previous research suggests that this process is best predicted by infant-directed communication, i.e., a mode of communication directed by caregivers to children. Despite its importance for language, whether infant-directed communication is unique to humans or rooted more deeply in the primate lineage remains unclear. To assess this, we investigated directed and surrounding vocal communication in human infants and infants of wild nonhuman great apes. Our findings reveal that human infants receive dramatically more infant-directed communication than nonhuman great ape infants. These data suggest that the earliest hominins likely relied more on surrounding communication to become communicatively competent, while infant-directed vocal communication became considerably more prominent with human language."

During neuroinflammation, we found increased perineural immune cells that had access to intracranial injected beads, dye, and bacteria. Additionally, we identified osseous channels connecting the environment surrounding olfactory nerves to bone marrow in the cribriform plate (cpBM). Notably, the cpBM undergoes myelopoiesis during EAE, has access to components of intracranial drainage, and is vulnerable to Mtb bacteria invasion during CNS-Mtb infection.

Microbial methane often deviates from isotope and isotopolog equilibrium in surface environments but approaches equilibrium in deep subsurface sediments. The origin of this near-equilibrium isotopic signature in methane, whether directly produced by methanogens or achieved through anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), remains uncertain. Here, we show that, in the absence of AOM, microbial methane produced from deep-sea sediments exhibits isotopolog compositions approaching thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy limitation. In contrast, microbial methane from salt marsh and thermokarst lakes exhibits significant hydrogen and clumped isotopic disequilibrium due to high free-energy availability. We propose that clumped isotopologs of methane provide a proxy for characterizing the bioenergetics of environments for methane production. Together, these observations demonstrate methane clumped isotopes as a powerful tool to better understand the relation between methane metabolisms and the energy landscape in natural environments."

We found that 8-month-old infants’ tonic pupil size mirrored trial-by-trial fluctuations in environmental volatility, while phasic pupil responses revealed that infants used this information to dynamically optimize their learning. This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity.

Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of YOD1 reduced Ang II– and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Subsequently, we used multiple proteomic analyses to identify and confirm STAT3 as a substrate protein for YOD1. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that the C155 site of YOD1 removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from K97 on STAT3, stabilizing STAT3 levels and enhancing its nuclear translocation in cardiomyocytes under Ang II stimulation. Notably, inhibiting STAT3 reversed the antihypertrophic effects of YOD1 deficiency in Ang II–challenged mice.

Nanotechnology has been applied to drug delivery for reducing drug toxicity and improving efficacy, but few studies have addressed hERG-related cardiotoxicity. We report the use of self-assembling dendrimer nanosystems for drug formulation and delivery, which effectively reduced hERG binding and associated toxicity while promoting therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, these dendrimer nanosystems efficiently encapsulated the antimalarial drug chloroquine, the anticancer agent doxorubicin, and the NUPR1 inhibitor ZZW115, all three having high affinity to hERG channels. These nanoformulations showed three- to eightfold reduced hERG binding affinity, which, in animal models, translated to abolished toxicity.

Here, we show that the sequential functions of the decidual reaction—implantation and decidualization—pivot on the time-sensitive loss of progesterone-resistantDIO2+stromal cells that form a specialized implantation niche and reciprocal expansion of progesterone-dependentPLA2G2A+predecidual cells. Simultaneously, uterine natural killer (uNK) cell proliferation results in the accumulation of immunotolerant subsets. Examination of endometrial biopsies from 924 women revealed that the recurrence risk of miscarriage closely aligns with the incidence of a weakened or stalled decidual reaction, more so than poor uNK cell expansion. Analysis of paired biopsies obtained in different cycles and modeling in assembloids intimated that prior miscarriages disrupt intercycle endometrial homeostasis and calibration of the decidual reaction.

The Ryukyu Islands in southwestern Japan, where archaeological sites suddenly appeared 35,000 to 30,000 years ago, are of particular interest in this regard because of the apparent difficulty in crossing the surrounding waters. In this study, we test if a non-sailing dugout canoe can be produced with Upper Paleolithic tools, and if it can cross the 110-kilometer-wide strait at the western entrance of the Ryukyus, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents intervenes. Our 7.5-meter-long dugout, manufactured with edge-ground stone axes, was speedy and durable enough to cross this strait. This supports the early development of functional boats, such as dugouts, while our experiment also highlighted that this type of sea travel was possible only for experienced paddlers with advanced navigational skills."

To overcome these challenges, we developed the SUSTAIN—a smart, ultra-long-lasting, sequentially triggerable, and artfully implantable nozzle system. The SUSTAIN integrates an osmotic pressure–triggered module, an airflow-generated T-pipe (AGT), and a drug infusion pump (DIP) for controlled subcutaneous drug release. The AGT enables tunable dosing by varying NaHCO3/KH2PO4powder amounts, while shear thinning of the β-cyclodextrin/Pluronic F-127 hydrogel in the DIP ensures sustained drug infusion. In vivo studies show that the SUSTAIN delivers at least four doses of levothyroxine sodium over 10 days and three doses of semaglutide over 42 days, maintaining effective blood drug levels with minimal invasiveness.

To enhance our understanding of their multifaceted functions, we developed copper-64–radiolabeled nanobodies targeting the human CD4 receptor (64Cu-CD4-Nb1) for positron emission tomography (PET). In human CD4-receptor knock-in mice,64Cu-CD4-Nb1 specifically accumulated in different orthotopic tumors, correlating with histological CD4+cell densities. Based on intratumoral CD4+cell distribution patterns within the core and periphery, we distinguished responders to combined αPD-1/4-1BB antibodies early on-treatment. CD4-PET identified resistance to αPD-1 monotherapy, which was mitigated by adding regulatory T cell–depleting α4-1BB antibodies. Patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant αPD-L1 therapy revealed low CD4+T cell densities in the tumor core. In human and mouse tumor tissues, regulatory T cells correlated with CD4+cell densities. Thus, visualizing the spatial distribution patterns of CD4+cells by PET offers mechanistic insights into CD4-mediated therapy efficacy, with great potential for guiding combinatorial immunotherapies in patients with cancer."

Here, we conducted a unidirectional crowd movement experiment, in which we tracked the movement of pedestrian crowds through foot tracking. We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained. We also demonstrate that pedestrians are most likely to synchronize their movements spontaneously at the onset of jamming. Our findings provide important insights into crowd dynamics."

We identified the polyketide ichthyotoxin leadbeaterin-1 from theC. leadbeateribloom and found potentially associated candidate PKS genes of which most were higher expressed at bloom stations. A relative depletion of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during the bloom was correlated with higher expression of genes involved in endocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal activity.

This study introduces a novel design framework that not only enhances transmission range and efficiency but also supports instrument miniaturization. 
 A new aerodynamic injection system has been designed for a wide particle size range, combining a new pre-focus structure, a smaller buffer chamber, and a five-stage lens. Compared with previous injection systems, the new design adds virtual impactors and pre-focus structures, while reducing the overall volume by 90 %. The newly developed pre-focus structure effectively addresses the challenges associated with the focusing and transmission of large particles, significantly reducing the beam width and dispersion angle of particles exiting the critical hole, thus preventing the buffer chamber from becoming excessively large. Furthermore, the focusing capability and transmission efficiency for large particles have been significantly enhanced, with the transmission range expanded to encompass particles from 100 nm to 10 µm. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the injection system can transmit particles within the 1 to 9 µm range with an efficiency exceeding 90 %. Additionally, the standard micro-sphere experiment verified the good consistency between the performance of the injection system and the simulation results. In the testing of standard dust, the wide-range particle size distribution obtained using the new injection system is highly consistent with the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS).

Walvoord,Permafrost–wildfire interactions: active layer  thickness estimates for paired burned and  unburned sites in northern high latitudes,"Wildfires have the potential to accelerate permafrost thaw and the associated feedbacks to climate change. We assembled a dataset of permafrost thaw depth measurements from burned and unburned sites contributed by researchers from across the northern high-latitude region. We estimated maximum thaw depth for each measurement, which addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on maximum thaw depth when measurement timing varies. 
 As the northern high-latitude permafrost zone experiences accelerated warming, permafrost has become vulnerable to widespread thaw. Simultaneously, wildfire activity across northern boreal forest and Arctic/subarctic tundra regions impacts permafrost stability through the combustion of insulating organic matter, vegetation, and post-fire changes in albedo. Efforts to synthesis the impacts of wildfire on permafrost are limited and are typically reliant on antecedent pre-fire conditions. To address this, we created the FireALT dataset by soliciting data contributions that included thaw depth measurements, site conditions, and fire event details with paired measurements at environmentally comparable burned and unburned sites. The solicitation resulted in 52 466 thaw depth measurements from 18 contributors across North America and Russia. Because thaw depths were taken at various times throughout the thawing season, we also estimated end-of-season active layer thickness (ALT) for each measurement using a modified version of the Stefan equation. Here, we describe our methods for collecting and quality-checking the data, estimating ALT, the data structure, strengths and limitations, and future research opportunities. The final dataset includes 48 669 ALT estimates with 32 attributes across 9446 plots and 157 burned–unburned pairs spanning Canada, Russia, and the United States. The data span fire events from 1900 to 2022 with measurements collected from 2001 to 2023. The time since fire ranges from 0 to 114 years. The FireALT dataset addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on ALT when measurements are taken at various times throughout the thaw season depending on the time of field campaigns (typically June through August) by estimating ALT at the end-of-season maximum. This dataset can be used to address understudied research areas, particularly algorithm development, calibration, and validation for evolving process-based models as well as extrapolating across space and time, which could elucidate permafrost–wildfire interactions under accelerated warming across the high-northern-latitude permafrost zone.

 Between 1993 and 2019, NASA and NSF sponsored 26 separate airborne campaigns that surveyed the thickness and radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet using successive generations of coherent VHF radar sounders developed and operated by The University of Kansas. Most of the ice sheet's internal VHF radiostratigraphy is composed of isochronal reflections that record its integrated response to past centennial- to multi-millennial-scale climatic and dynamic events. We previously generated the first comprehensive dated radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet using the first 20 of these campaigns (1993–2013) and investigated its value for constraining the ice sheet's history and modern boundary conditions. Here we describe the second version of this radiostratigraphic dataset using all 26 campaigns, which includes substantial improvements in survey coverage and was mostly acquired with higher-fidelity systems. We improved quality control and accelerated reflection tracing and matching by including an automatic test for stratigraphic conformability, a thickness-normalized reprojection for radargrams, and automatic inter-segment reflection matching. We reviewed and augmented the 1993–2013 radiostratigraphy, and we applied an existing independently developed method for predicting radiostratigraphy to the previously untraced campaigns (2014–2019) to accelerate their semi-automatic tracing. The result is a more robust radiostratigraphy and age structure of the ice sheet that covers up to 65 % of the ice sheet and includes > 58 600 km of newly traced reflections from the 2014–2019 campaigns. This dataset can be used to validate the sensitivity of ice-sheet models to past major climate changes and constrain long-term boundary conditions (e.g., accumulation rate). Based on these results, we make several recommendations for how radiostratigraphy may be traced more efficiently and reliably in the future. This dataset is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14182641 (MacGregor et al., 2025). It includes all traced reflections at the spatial resolution of the radargrams and grids (5 km horizontal resolution) of the depths of isochrones between 3 and 115 ka and ages between 10 % and 80 % of the ice thickness; associated codes are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14183061 (MacGregor, 2024a)."

Key drivers of forest cover changes are forestry activities (43.79 %), shifting cultivation (24.32 %), and forest fires (11.45 %). Both human activities and natural events widely impact forest ecosystems, with regional differences across tropical, temperate, and boreal zones. Forest fires concentrated in Siberia and North America; and shifting cultivation dominant in tropical areas. 
 Forests play a pivotal role in global carbon cycling and biodiversity conservation, yet they face increasing disturbances from both anthropogenic and natural drivers. This study presents the first high-resolution (30-m) global forest disturbance dataset (GFD) for 2000–2020, classifying 11 disturbance types by integrating Landsat-based Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time-series analysis with spatial metrics and machine learning. A total of 57,000 expert-validated samples were used to train and validate a decision tree model, achieving an overall accuracy of 94.88 %. The results reveal that forestry disturbance (43.79±0.31 %), shifting cultivation (24.32±0.28 %), and forest fires (11.45±0.05 %) dominate global forest loss. There are regional differences in global forest disturbance, such as farmland expansion in South America and Africa, forest fires in northern regions, and shifting cultivation in tropical regions. Disturbed forests span 1,247.06±11.18 Mha, accounting for 30.87 % of the global forest area. Notably, 2.76 % of global forests were newly established, primarily in China, India, and Brazil. Spatial consistency analysis with existing datasets (R2=0.93) confirms the reliability of the GFD product. The GFD dataset advances our understanding of forest dynamics and underscores the need for targeted conservation strategies in an era of escalating environmental change.

Nevertheless, current remediation approaches face critical limitations, including high energy consumption and interference from dissolved organic carbon (DOC). To address these challenges, we developed an innovative N,O-doped graphene-like coordinated single-atom iron catalyst (FeSA-N,O-GO) using silkworm excrement as a sustainable precursor. The catalyst features robust Fe−π interactions between high-spin Fe atoms and the N,O-GO support, generating a substantial surface electric field (∼146 mV). This unique configuration enables FeSA-N,O-GO to achieve remarkable degradation efficiency for multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), and norfloxacin (NFX), without requiring external peroxides or additional energy input. Complete antibiotic removal (100%) was attained within 90 min, accompanied by total organic carbon removal of 65.2–79.7%. Most importantly, the catalytic performance was further enhanced in DOC-containing real water samples, where synergistic coordination of DOC-antibiotics-H2O on FeSA-N,O-GO amplified the surface electric field effect. Our findings demonstrate the promising potential of harnessing electric energy generated through multicomponent coordination on single-atom catalysts for developing sustainable and cost-effective solutions for water micropollutant remediation."

Herein, a category of hitherto overlooked dynamic single-atom sites on heteroatom-doped carbons (HDCs) that mitigate the above problems was observed by coupling Fenton and activated carbon. Specifically, the defects on the carbon surface, particularly the heteroatom defects, coordinated with Fe3+ in the bulk solution to form dynamic single-atom sites that simultaneously suppress the Fe3+ hydrolysis and promote the Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion. This synergy sustains the efficient oxidation process of the coupled system through up to 5 cycles due to the optimized Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling. Moreover, dynamic single-atom sites enable the continuous removal of adsorbates from the carbon surface, extending the time before adsorption saturation and maintaining nearly 100% efficiency for 480 h. Mechanistic analysis revealed that dynamic single-atom sites optimize the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle through forming a carbon → ligand atoms → Fe ↔ H2O2 electron flux pathway. Their bidirectional electron flux with H2O2 enhances OH· production, thereby improving the Fenton oxidation process. These findings offer crucial insights for overcoming challenges in environmental engineering technologies and underscore the potential superiority of coupled systems in practical applications."

Conventional AOPs, e.g., the benchmark O3/H2O2 (peroxone), are not efficient in removing them from water/wastewater, because of their relatively low reaction rates with hydroxyl radical (•OH). We report here that Cl-OPFRs (i.e., TCEP, TCPP, and TDCPP) can be efficiently removed by catalytic ozonation with zinc oxide (O3/ZnO) through a novel reaction pathway. Based on in situ characterization with confocal Raman spectrum and fluorescence microscopy imaging, we confirmed that the ozone–ZnO interaction resulted in the formation of surface-bound •OH, with yields 50% higher than those of the peroxone system. Using TCEP as a model Cl-OPFR and ATR-FTIR characterization, we recognized the coordination between the phosphoryl oxygen and the surface Zn(II) of ZnO. The surface coordination improved the reactivity of TCEP toward the surface-bound •OH, which was confirmed with a competitive reaction on ZnO. The O3/ZnO was most effective at neutral pH for TCEP removal and can achieve partial mineralization and detoxification of the compound.

This repeated-measures prospective study, comprising 6160 observations (4098 participants at baseline and 2062 participants at the six-year follow-up) from the Wuhan–Zhuhai cohort, measured serum pyrethroids and glucose metabolic traits to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of pyrethroid exposure with glucose dyshomeostasis. Network toxicological analyses and gene-environment interaction analyses were integrated to identify the underlying targets and mechanisms. Cross-sectionally, multiple pyrethroids, particularly bifenthrin and fenvalerate, were positively associated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction. Longitudinally, serum bifenthrin and fenvalerate were associated with the annual change rate of glucose metabolic traits and an increased incident risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, pregnane X receptor (PXR) was predicted as a key molecular target for pyrethroid exposure-related glucose dyshomeostasis. PXR variants significantly interacted with bifenthrin exposure, with individuals carrying a high-risk PXR genotype and high bifenthrin exposure exhibiting higher FPG or lower β-cell function.

Although many advanced materials exist for photo- and electrocatalytic production, H2O2 output and stability depend on reactor design and water quality. This study explores a scalable photochemical system employing bismuth vanadate-coated polymeric optical fibers (POF-BVO) illuminated by 440 nm LEDs. A single 20 cm, 3 mm diameter fiber generates H2O2 at 4.3 mg H2O2 h–1 (430 mg H2O2 gcat–1 h–1), with enhanced rates achieved using bundled fibers. The bundled configuration increases fiber packing density in the reactor to >120 m2 m–3, tripling that of flat-plate photocatalytic reactors. High H2O2 production is achieved using oxygen-permeable hollow-fiber membranes to deliver pure O2 or air. The system performs consistently across pH 4–9 and in tap water, wastewater, or seawater. Phosphate ions improve H2O2 stability, resulting in higher concentrations. Over 21 days of continuous operation, the system produces >6 g L–1 of H2O2 with minimal  performance degradation. Energy analysis reveals a 2–30x reduction in energy use compared to traditional slurry-based photocatalytic systems, with a three-fiber bundle reaching 27 kWh kg–1─comparable to electrochemical processes.

While recent studies have investigated the photosensitized oxidation of SO2─typically focusing on inorganic sulfate formation─the mechanisms underlying the multiphase formation of organosulfate remain largely unexplored. This study identifies a potential pathway for organosulfate formation via a radical–radical mechanism under highly acidic conditions, involving an interaction between organic radicals and sulfate radicals generated through photosensitization chemistry. Using photosensitizing films composed of vanillin, 4-benzoylbenzoic acid, and humic acid in a vertical wetted-wall flow tube reactor, SO2 uptake was examined under both irradiated and dark conditions. Product analysis was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Results revealed substantial SO2 consumption under irradiation, with uptake rates significantly enhanced compared to dark conditions, likely due to oxidation by excited triplet states. The second-order rate constants for SO2 reacting on the irradiated films follow the order: 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (6.9 × 107 M–1 s–1) > vanillin (4.56 × 107 M–1 s–1), where the value for 4-BBA is the direct experimentally determined in Wang’s study (refer 21).

Also, there are methodological challenges in confirming the actual occurrence and visualizing the original morphology of MPs in the retrieved sperm samples. Here, we identified sub-10-μm polystyrene (PS) MPs with protein coronas in mechanically retrieved sperm specimens on PS plastic Petri dishes through optical photothermal infrared imaging. The particles were mainly generated by the tools that induced local polymer cutting deformation on the dishes, and a few originated from resin particles remaining on the dishes during manufacture. Each 5 mm scratch by the tools could produce 2.0–13 MPs (1.9–560 μm), depending on the extent of surface damage to the dishes. Most of the MPs (41.7–81.5%) derived from scratching could be retrieved along with sperm cells, with an estimated exposure dose of 100–22,000 particles/mL.

The RMW budget diagnostics reveal that the radial advection of momentum is balanced by the vertical advection of momentum and diffusion at the inner RMW. This dynamic balance maintains a near‐zero radial gradient of tangential wind tendency, thereby supporting a steady inner eyewall with a sharpening tangential wind profile.

Despite recent advancements in artificial intelligence‐based classification models, rely on supervised learning, which demands extensive manually labeled samples and data preparation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a self‐supervised neural network based on the masked autoencoder framework. The model first undergoes self‐supervised pretraining with a large amount of unlabeled lightning waveform to capture general signal features by reconstructing the masked parts, followed by supervised finetuning with minimal labeled data to further optimize its performance on classification task.

This extreme warm event was triggered by a favorable combination of El‐Niño‐induced westerly wind anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic and Rossby wave reflection at the western boundary, leading to an exceptionally strong downwelling Kelvin wave. The warm event was extinguished abruptly around May by a locally‐forced upwelling Kelvin wave, causing an unprecedented rapid transition to a cold phase which lasted until August. The cold event did not fully develop into an Atlantic Niña due to weak Bjerknes feedback, warming from surface heat fluxes, and thermocline deepening due to a series of equatorial wave reflections. Nevertheless, the cold event is consistent with a northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, increased rainfall over West Africa, Sahel, and Sahara, reduced rainfall over the Gulf of Guinea, and an earlier onset of the West African monsoon."

The constraint offers a simple method for estimating the mean level of convective neutral buoyancy, one that rises linearly with the energy of sea surface air.

The results show that streamers, which are a consequence of magnetotail flow bursts, strengthen as the simulation progresses. We calculated the contributions of different precipitating electron energy fluxes to streamer dynamics based on simple empirical proxies and found that monoenergetic precipitation dominates, followed by broadband, with little from diffuse precipitation. Poleward motion (∼1° magnetic latitude) of one streamer preceded its equatorward motion in the high‐resolution simulation.

We introduce a new method, based on the Elastic Net (EN) that predicts TC counts directly from global SST maps. We show it achieves performance on par with current models, without requiring manually constructed indices. To understand the performance of the EN we argue that, when TC counts are generated by independent Poisson draws, statistical models are subject to a lower limit on prediction error.

Cael,Climate Feedbacks Derived From Spatial Gradients in Recent Climatology,"Climate feedbacks, including Planck, surface albedo, water vapor‐lapse rate (WVLR) and cloud feedbacks, determine how much surface temperatures will eventually warm to balance anthropogenic radiative forcing. Climate feedbacks remain difficult to constrain directly from temporal variation in observed surface warming and radiation budgets due to the pattern effect and low signal‐to‐noise ratio, with only order 1°C historic rise in surface temperatures and high uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing. This study presents a new method to analyze climate feedbacks from observations by empirically fitting simplified reduced‐physics relations for outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) to observed spatial variation in climate properties and radiation budgets. Spatial variations in TOA outgoing radiation are dominated by the dependence on surface temperature: around 91% of the spatial variation in clear sky albedo, and 77% of spatial variation in clear sky TOA outgoing longwave radiation, is functionally explained by variation in surface temperatures. These simplified and observationally constrained relations are then differentiated with respect to spatial contrasts in surface temperature to reveal the Planck, fixed‐cloud albedo (λalbedo ${\lambda }_{\text{albedo}}$) and WVLR (λWVLR ${\lambda }_{\text{WVLR}}$) climate feedbacks spatially for both clear sky and all sky conditions. The resulting global all sky climate feedback values are λWVLR ${\lambda }_{\text{WVLR}}$ = 1.28 (1.13–1.45 at 66%) Wm−2K−1, and λalbedo ${\lambda }_{\text{albedo}}$ = 0.64 (0.53–0.74) Wm−2 for the period 2003–2023, reducing to 0.35 (0.29–0.41) Wm−2K−1 under 4°C warming after cryosphere retreat.

The size of TCs is measured by the mean radius of gale‐force winds at their lifetime maximum intensity. Our results reveal an abrupt decadal change in the ENSO‐TC size relationship: the annual mean TC size exhibited a strong correlation with the Niño 3.4 SST index before 1998, but this correlation has significantly weakened since then. This change is primarily attributed to the more uniform distributions of cyclone expansion rate (CER) across ENSO phases during the past two decades. Climatically, environmental conditions favorable for TC size expansion weaken with increasing latitude, resulting in a dominant meridional gradient of CER. Before 1998, TC activity displayed a pronounced north‐south contrast between El Niño and La Niña years, leading to a significantly higher mean CER for TCs during El Niño episodes. In recent decades, however, interannual variations in TC genesis density have shifted to a southeast‐northwest dipole pattern. This shift, along with changes in TC tracks, has substantially increased the latitudinal overlap of TC occurrences between warm and cold phases, thereby narrowing differences in CER distributions. Concurrently, changes in environmental conditions have become more favorable for TC size expansion during La Niña years, further reducing disparities in TC size distributions across ENSO phases."

The magnitude of possible latitudinal change in the position of climate belts is, however, poorly understood. Here, we address this issue based on a case study of the early Toarcian (late Early Jurassic) Oceanic Anoxic Event (T‐OAE, ∼183 Ma), one of the most significant global change events of the Phanerozoic, characterized by elevated humidity and major disturbances to terrestrial ecosystems on land. We present new leaf‐wax n‐alkanes δ13C data from the high‐paleo‐latitude Junggar Basin (northwest China) spanning the T‐OAE and develop a time–space framework of plant‐fractionation change, from low‐ to high‐paleolatitudes across this time interval. We show that significant latitudinal changes in humidity occurred across the T‐OAE (∼10°), likely because of a significant northward expansion of the low‐latitude arid belts to mid‐paleo‐latitudes, and by inference a latitudinal expansion of the Hadley cells.

We assess the effectiveness of two SAI experiments, G6Sulfur and Geo SSP5‐8.5 1.5 (here called Geo‐SAI), using the CESM2(WACCM6) model to reduce hydrological changes under high‐emission SSP5‐8.5 (no mitigation) pathway. Geo‐SAI stabilizes near surface global temperatures at 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, whereas G6Sulfur limits temperature rises to those under the SSP2‐4.5 scenario. In our findings, Geo‐SAI reverts many, but not all, hydrological changes induced by SSP5‐8.5 restoring global and regional means, seasonal amplitudes, and peak timings. G6Sulfur delivers smaller restorations, as expected, due to its smaller prescribed forcing. In hyperarid regions such as the Middle East, both SAI scenarios improve water storage compared with both SSP5‐8.5 and present conditions. However, in wetter or cooler climates, such as the Amazon, middle and southern Africa and east Europe, they only partly reverse the reductions in available water (AW) and runoff caused by high GHG emissions. Residual warming and snowmelt dynamics play an important role in runoff at mid‐to‐high latitudes. Additionally, SAI does not completely suppress GHG‐induced vegetation expansion and so over‐reduces global runoff in three latitude bands: 45°–65°N, 45°–65°S, and 30°S to 0 with end‐of‐century decreases of 4.1% under G6Sulfur and 7.3% under Geo‐SAI despite mean AW levels remaining close to present‐day. These findings emphasize that although SAI mitigates many climate‐driven hydrological disruptions, its unintended effects on runoff, vegetation feedback, and regional water availability warrants study—especially in regions heavily dependent on surface water resources."

Understanding the relationship between TP soil moisture (TPSM) and summer precipitation in Northwest China (NWC) is essential for improving climate predictions for East Asia. However, most existing studies have focused on the connection between TPSM and the climate of East Asian monsoon region, whereas the mechanisms by which TPSM influence precipitation in NWC, a nonmonsoonal area, remain underexplored. This study investigates how spring anomalies of TPSM persist into summer and influence summer precipitation in NWC. The results indicate that anomalies in spring TPSM can initiate a positive feedback with precipitation, which affects the intensity of plateau monsoon and contributes to the persistence of SM anomaly from spring to summer. During summer, positive SM anomalies in northern TP facilitate maintaining cyclonic circulation anomalies over western TP and trigger eastward‐propagating Rossby waves that induce anticyclonic circulation anomalies over eastern NWC. The anomalous circulation results in upward motion in the western NWC and subsidence in the eastern NWC enhancing precipitation in the western NWC while reducing the precipitation in the north. Finally, the findings from the circulation analysis are validated through numerical model simulations. This study provides valuable insights into the climatic effects of TPSM and offers important implications for precipitation prediction in NWC."

We examine precipitation and its drivers in one of the wettest regions in the world, the Southern Alps of New Zealand (NZ), using the first multi‐decadal simulation by a convection‐permitting regional climate model across all mainland NZ at 2.2 km grid‐scale. Model skill is primarily assessed against direct measurements by more than 170 rain gauges to avoid uncertainty commonly introduced by gridded observations in remote regions. Peak intensity and duration of sub‐daily rainfall over mountains appear markedly improved in the 2.2 km model relative to the 12 km driving model. The orientation of water vapor flux relative to the mountain barrier strongly affects both climatological and daily extreme precipitation. Transects illustrate the influence of steep local topography on strong landfalling atmospheric rivers to produce high vertical velocities and extremely high accumulations of rainfall over windward upper mountain flanks, which do not appear unreasonable against available gauge observations. These transects also reveal the finer spatial structure of mountain waves in the 2.2 km model, which may contribute to its more realistic windward enhancement of orographic precipitation, but with excessive leeward precipitation and an annual mean dry bias over mountains. Despite the computational burden, these results support further targeted dynamical modeling at kilometer scales to improve physical understanding of precipitation in the current climate and its potential future change in NZ and other mountainous regions of the world."

 Aharonov–Bohm interference of fractional quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect generally reveals their elementary charge (e*)1–15. Recently, our interferometry experiments with several ‘particle states’ reported flux periods of ΔΦ = (e/e*)Φ0 (with Φ0 the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures16. Here we report interference measurements of ‘particle–hole conjugated’ states at filling factors ν = 2/3, 3/5 and 4/7, which revealed unexpected flux periodicities of ΔΦ = ν−1Φ0. The measured shot-noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the quantum point contacts of the interferometer was F = ν (ref. 17) rather than that of the elementary charge F = e*/e (refs. 18,19). These observations indicate that the interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles occurred for coherent pairs, triples and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate), deposited in the centre of the interferometer bulk, formed an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the perimeter of the (anti)dot. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the ‘bunched quasiparticles’ and, thus, recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary charge of the quasiparticles. However, the shot-noise Fano factor (of each quantum point contact) consistently remained at F = ν, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanying the conjugated states. The two observations—bunching and debunching (or dissociation)—were not expected by current theories. Similar effects may arise in Jain’s ‘particle states’ (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator fractional quantum Hall states20. The coherent bunching of anyons and their dissociation was observed in an interference experiment. "

 A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction1–3. However, with each physical qubit needing multiple control lines, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware4–6. A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired up by miniaturized interconnects7–10. Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise11,12. Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a ‘chiplet-style’ control architecture. CMOS-based circuits can be integrated with silicon-based spin qubits and can be controlled at milli-kelvin temperatures, which can potentially help scale up these systems."

 The nervous system has a pivotal role in cancer biology, and pathological investigations have linked intratumoural nerve density to metastasis1. However, the precise impact of cancer-associated neurons and the communication channels at the nerve–cancer interface remain poorly understood. Previous cancer denervation models in rodents and humans have highlighted robust cancer dependency on nerves, but the underlying mechanisms that drive nerve-mediated cancer aggressivity remain unknown2,3. Here we show that cancer-associated neurons enhance cancer metabolic plasticity by transferring mitochondria to cancer cells. Breast cancer denervation and nerve–cancer coculture models confirmed that neurons significantly improve tumour energetics. Neurons cocultured with cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass and subsequent transfer of mitochondria to adjacent cancer cells. To precisely track the fate of recipient cells, we developed MitoTRACER, a reporter of cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer that permanently labels recipient cancer cells and their progeny. Lineage tracing and fate mapping of cancer cells acquiring neuronal mitochondria in primary tumours revealed their selective enrichment at metastatic sites following dissemination. Collectively, our data highlight the enhanced metastatic capabilities of cancer cells that receive mitochondria from neurons in primary tumours, shedding new light on how the nervous system supports cancer metabolism and metastatic dissemination.

 Mantle upwellings drive large-scale surface volcanism and facilitate continental breakup and ocean basin formation. However, the spatial characteristics and internal composition of these upwellings alongside how they are modified by plate tectonics are poorly resolved. Afar, East Africa, is a classic triple junction comprising three rifts at various stages of evolution thought to be underlain by a mantle upwelling or plume, allowing examination of the controls on the mantle upwelling. Here we present geochemical data from >130 samples of ‘young’ volcanoes spanning the rifts defining the triple junction to show that the underlying mantle comprises a single, asymmetric upwelling. Using statistical modelling to integrate our data with existing geochemical and geophysical constraints, we suggest that Afar is fed by a spatially and chemically heterogeneous upwelling, which controls the composition and relative abundance of melt in all three rift arms. We identify repetitive signatures in mantle compositions in rift regions, whose variability is a longer wavelength in faster-extending rift arms. This suggests more rapid channelized mantle flow occurs where rifting rates are higher and the plate is thinner, aiding flow of the upwelling towards the faster-spreading Red Sea Rift. Our findings demonstrate how the evolution of mantle upwellings is influenced by the dynamics of overriding plates.

 Limiting climate warming to 1.5 °C requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removal. While various CO2 removal strategies have been explored to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and account for legacy emissions, additional exploration is warranted to examine more durable, scalable and sustainable approaches to achieve climate targets. Here we show that preserving woody debris in managed forests can remove gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere sustainably based on a carbon cycle analysis using three Earth system models. Woody debris is produced from logging, sawmill wastes and abandoned woody products, and can be preserved in deep soil to lengthen its residence time (a measure of durability) by thousands of years. Preserving annual woody debris production in managed forests has the capacity to remove 769–937 GtCO2 from the atmosphere cumulatively (10.1–12.4 GtCO2 yr−1 on average) from 2025 to 2100, if its residence time is lengthened for 100–2,000 years and after 5% CO2 removal is discounted to account for CO2 emission due to machine operation for wood debris preservation. This translates to a reduction in global temperatures of 0.35–0.42 °C. Given the large potential, relatively low cost and long durability, future efforts should be focused on establishing large-scale demonstration projects for this technology in a variety of contexts, with rigorous monitoring of CO2 removal, its co-benefits and side-effects. Land surface modelling suggests that preserving woody debris in managed forests could remove 769–937 GtCO2 from the atmosphere between 2025 and 2100."

 Frameshifts can be caused by specific combinations of tRNA and mRNA. The wildtype AGC-decoding E. coli tRNASer3GCU has been shown to induce −1 ribosomal frameshifting on GCA alanine codons, and proposed to read a two-base codon instead of a canonical triplet. However, it has remained unclear whether this type of non-cognate decoding can be accommodated by the ribosome. Here, we perform single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions on E. coli 70S ribosomes with the frameshift-inducing tRNASer3 bound to the non-cognate GCA codon or the cognate AGC codon in the ribosomal A site. The structures demonstrate that doublet decoding is made possible when A1493, the conserved monitoring base in 16S rRNA, mimics a first codon base, forming a Hoogsteen base pair with U36 from the anticodon and stacking with the mRNA. This interaction pushes the first two bases of the A-site codon in position for base pairing with C35 and G34 of the anticodon.

Here, the authors analyse the early stages of melanoma development in mouse models of minimal genetic induction, identifying melanoma emergence with little evidence of consistent DNA mutation or common copy number variation. 
 Melanomas are genetically heterogeneous, displaying mitogen-activated protein kinase mutations and homozygous loss of tumor suppressor genes. Mouse models combining such mutations produce fast-growing tumors. In contrast, rare, slow-growing tumors arise in mice combining Braf activation with heterozygous loss of Pten. Here we show that similar tumors can arise in albino mice bearing only a Braf mutation. Incidence kinetics suggest a stochastic event underlies tumorigenesis in tumors that arise with only a Braf mutation, yet de novo mutations or structural variants that could explain the incidence of most tumors could not be found. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumors identify a cell type resembling “neural crest-like” cells in human and mouse melanomas. These exist in normal mouse skin, expand upon Braf activation, and persist through serial transplantation; analyses of gene expression suggest they serve as precursors of malignant cells. This state may serve as an intermediate on a slow path to malignancy that may provide a diagnostically and therapeutically important source of cellular heterogeneity.

Here, the authors show that subdural electric field stimulation delivered across the injury via an ultra-thin implant improves functional recovery in rats. 
 Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, with limited therapeutic options available. Low-frequency electric fields with changing polarity have shown promise in promoting axon regeneration and improving outcomes. However, the metal electrodes used previously were prone to corrosion, and their epidural placement limited the penetration of the electric field into the spinal cord. Here, we demonstrate that a thin-film implant with supercapacitive electrodes placed under the dura mater can safely and effectively deliver electric field treatment in rats with thoracic SCI. Subdural stimulation enhanced hind limb function and touch sensitivity compared to controls, without inducing a neuroinflammatory response in the spinal cord. While axon density around the lesion site remained unchanged after 12 weeks, in vivo monitoring and electrochemical testing of electrodes indicated that treatment was administered throughout the study. These results highlight the promise of electric field treatment as a viable therapeutic strategy for achieving long-term functional recovery in SCI.

 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis and mainly transmitted faecal-orally. HEV particles present in faeces are naked (nHEV), whereas those found in the blood are quasi-enveloped (eHEV) with a cell-derived lipid membrane. Despite its global health impact, the cellular life cycle of HEV remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the mechanisms of viral entry into host cells. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a high content RNA-FISH-based imaging assay that allows for the investigation of the entry pathways of both naked and quasi-enveloped HEV particles. Surprisingly, we find that integrin α3, previously implicated in nHEV cell entry, is not expressed in the cell types that are most permissive for HEV infection. Instead, we identify integrin β1 (ITGB1) pairing with different α-integrins as the key player mediating nHEV cell entry. Our results indicate that the interaction of nHEV with ITGB1 facilitates entry through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. In contrast, eHEV particles do not interact with ITGB1 and enter cells using a classical endocytic route via Rab5a-positive early endosomes. The entry of both types of HEV particles requires endosomal acidification and proteolytic cleavage by lysosomal cathepsins, which ultimately results in delivery of the HEV genome to the cytoplasm.

 As wildfires grow increasingly complex, institutional adaptation—adjusting institutions to respond effectively to environmental changes—is crucial for enhancing wildfire management capabilities. However, institutional adaptation is a challenge as the connection between environmental changes and human institutions remains poorly understood. Here, by analysing trends in five incident characteristics linked to institutional complexity at national and regional levels from 1999 to 2020 in the USA, we show national trends of increasing institutional complexity of wildfire indicators associated with wildfire governance, logistics, management, resource scarcity and network coordination. Substantial regional variation was observed, with some cases exhibiting trends in opposite directions. For example, while average jurisdictional complexity showed an increase in the west, it decreased in the east. These results offer insight into the linkage between environmental change and demands for institutional adaptation and provide an empirical basis for considering potential trade-offs of different institutional adaptations in light of competing pressures. Growing wildfire threats require governing institutions to adapt their responses for effective management, yet institutional adaptation remains unexplored.

Chalker,Sustainable gold extraction from ore and electronic waste,"Gold has a vital role in human society and the global economy, but its production currently causes high levels of environmental pollution. This work reports an approach that can effectively produce gold from both primary and secondary resources without the use of toxic substances such as mercury or cyanide. 
 Gold plays an essential role in the global economy and has wide applications in various industrial technologies. Currently, the gold supply relies heavily on mining processes that employ toxic substances such as cyanide salts and mercury metal, leading to substantial environmental pollution. Gold extraction approaches that do not rely on cyanide and mercury are needed to improve the overall sustainability of gold production. Here we develop an approach for gold leaching and recovery from ore and electronic waste. This approach first uses trichloroisocyanuric acid, activated by a halide catalyst, to oxidatively dissolve gold metal from ore and electronic waste, and then applies a polysulfide polymer sorbent to selectively bind gold from the leachate. The gold can be recovered in high purity by pyrolysing or depolymerizing the sorbent. The efficacy of this approach in gold extraction was validated using ore, electronic waste and other gold-containing waste. Overall, this work provides a viable approach to achieve greener gold production from both primary and secondary resources, improving the sustainability of the gold supply. Gold has a vital role in human society and the global economy, but its production currently causes high levels of environmental pollution. This work reports an approach that can effectively produce gold from both primary and secondary resources without the use of toxic substances such as mercury or cyanide."

 The bathymetric data is of great significance to coral reef protection. Traditional measurement methods have low efficiency, high cost, and are easily affected by natural conditions. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) in the shallow water area has high efficiency. However, the accuracy of conventional single-band, logarithmic ratio, and multi-band model is easily affected by the difference of sediment types, that is, the portability of a single model is poor. It is necessary to take into account the coral reef sediment types and improve the accuracy of SDB. Fine sediment classification relies on field acoustic and spectral measurements, which is costly and subject to many restrictions. In this study, a subregional shallow water satellite-derived bathymetry method in combination with sediment information (SDB_SS) is proposed by integrating various algorithms. Firstly, based on the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery, the study area is roughly divided into six types of sediment samples: Sand, Rubble, Seagrass, Rock, Microalgae mat, and Coral / Algae. Then, the sediment pixel information is counted, and the coral reef area is divided into three sub-regions of high, medium and low reflection by threshold segmentation method. Finally, combined with ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data, the improved subregional satellite-derived bathymetry model is constructed to obtain the shallow bathymetry results. Taking the Yongle Islands in the South China Sea as an example, root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the retrieval results are 0.97 m, 0.90 m and 21.23 %, respectively, compared with the measured depth. Compared with conventional single-band, logarithmic ratio, multi-band and other models, they are reduced by 0.27 m ∼ 1.65 m, 0.11 m ∼ 1.76 m and 2.5 % ∼ 65.27 %. It is proven that the proposed method can provide a reference for improving the SDB accuracy of coral reefs without measured spectral data."

 Accurate and timely mapping of agricultural products is a crucial component in management and decision-making for promoting food security and sustainable development. The intricacy of differentiating diverse croplands due to the existence of small and winding agricultural fragments contributes to the complexity of crop classification in arid environments. In this study, we employed a novel hybrid approach, integrating time-series analysis, noisy data quality control, and different machine learning and deep learning models to classify croplands of complex multi-crop systems in central Iran. The classification was based on time series spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images and indices of crop growth phenology, providing valuable insights into the growth cycles of different crops in the region. Additionally, a neural network-based method was used to assess and enhance the quality of training data before modeling. For crop classification, we used four machine learning and deep learning methods including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN), and compared their results before and after quality control measures. The results indicated that after quality control, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the analyses were considerably improved. RF and TCNN methods demonstrated superior prediction and modeling performance compared to XGBoost and SVM models. The overall accuracy of the four methods increased from 91 %, 87 %, 83 %, and 91 % before quality control to 96 %, 94 %, 89 %, and 95 % after quality control, respectively. The results of this study highlight the effectiveness of employing time-series data and quality control procedures to enhance crop classification in complex agricultural systems. By improving the precision and accuracy of agricultural classifications our findings can contribute to optimizing resource management, food security, and sustainable development goals."

 Satellite-based optical Remote Sensing (RS) presents a unique opportunity for monitoring the water quality of complex riverine systems stretching over large regions. However, due to the weak reflectance and resulting low signal-to-noise ratio of water bodies, interference of clouds and cloud shadows significantly impacts the accuracy of remotely sensed water quality parameters. This study presents a scalable, innovative cloud and cloud-shadow masking using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a spatially aggregated reflectance sampling approach that can robustly monitor the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and turbidity over selected sections of the study site, the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. The statistical resampling approach based on GMM was applied to Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to produce input to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to retrieve the TSS and turbidity for target river sections. The resampled reflectance data was spatially aggregated over the selected regions of interest to further improve the input quality. Out of 80 cloud-contaminated images, we were able to use 70 images with 40%–50% clouds/cloud shadows for TSS and turbidity retrievals after applying the GMM-based masking and spatial aggregation. The resampled spectral data and in-situ TSS and turbidity measurements were used to train four ML models: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our approach improved the estimation accuracy of the TSS by 33% and turbidity by 28% compared to the input processed using the built-in Sentinel-2 cloud and cloud shadow masks. This work emphasizes the importance of careful satellite image preparation for cloud and cloud-shadow screening and the utility of spatially aggregated reflectance samples over homogeneous regions of interest to enable robust water quality assessment under variable atmospheric conditions."

These analyses demonstrate that carbonaceous materials are important PM constituents throughout the world. Mean EC/PM ratios were lowest in PM10 in Sahelian Africa and Europe (∼0.01), highest (>0.07) in PM2.5 at urban sites in North America, South America, and Japan. Mean OC/PM ratios were lowest in PM10 in the Sahel (∼0.06) and in PM2.5 in China and Thailand (0.10), and highest in central and eastern Europe (∼0.3) and North America (∼0.4). OC/EC ratios were elevated in western and northern Europe, and at regional background sites in North America. EC/PM increased with PM10 in Thailand, while OC/PM increased with higher PM mass in Thailand, India, and North America, highlighting the specific contribution of carbonaceous aerosols to PM pollution in these regions. At European and North American background sites, OC/EC ratios increased with PM mass. Higher OC/EC ratios in dry periods indicate influence of wildfires, prescribed burns, and secondary aerosol formation.

 Unraveling the variations in δ2Hp and δ18Op within precipitation events of different intensities is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of meteorological phenomena and climate change processes. This study systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of δ2Hp and δ18Op in 539 atmospheric precipitation samples collected from 6 stations of the North China along a longitudinal gradient of East Asia during 2020–2022. This analysis also investagted moisture transport pathways and precipitation source composition. The results show that: (1) Precipitation events of varying intensity exhibit significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity within the study area. The δ2Hp and δ18Op values of all precipitation events are enriched in summer and autumn (δ2Hp: −54.8 ± 32.3 ‰; δ18Op: −8.5 ± 4.5 ‰) and depleted in winter and spring (δ2Hp: −32.8 ± 36.9 ‰; δ18Op: −5.4 ± 4.83 ‰). (2) The fluctuation of δ2Hp and δ18Op were less in the coastal sites between different precipitation intensities, while larger fluctuation appeared in the inland region. (3) Different geomorphological sub-regions exhibited notable heterogeneity in their Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL).

 The electric field and current intensity within the discharge channel are the key parameters for lightning research and protection. Aiming at the difficulty that the electric field in the channel cannot be directly measured, based on the dependence of spectral line broadening on the electric field, this paper developed a method for indirectly measuring the electric field within the lightning channel according to the experimental spectrum. Based on the lightning spectra and the synchronous ground electric field change waveforms caused by lightning, the basic parameters reflecting the current-carrying capacity of the channel, such as electron density, conductivity, and radius, were calculated, and the inner electric field at the bottom of the lightning discharge channel was further obtained. In the calculation, two methods are adopted for the spectral line broadening: direct measurement of the spectral line profile and inversion from the electron density calculated by the Stark broadening theory of spectral lines. The results show that the radial electric field near the lightning channel and the axial electric field inside the channel are respectively 2.31–22.78 × 104 kV/m and 1.30–13.14 kV/m. The internal electric field values calculated by the two methods are in good agreement. To further confirm the reliability of the calculation results, the axial current in the channel is calculated by using Ohm's law from the calculated internal electric field, and compared with the peak current estimated by the synchronous electric field change waveform. It is found that they have a good positive correlation. Moreover, the peak current and the axial current are positively correlated with the radius of the current-carrying core channel, respectively."

 To elucidate the impact of boundary-layer meteorology on persistent heavy haze pollution, we analyzed 2018–2019 observational data from a 255-m meteorological tower in Tianjin. The boundary-layer evolution demonstrated that during the pollution period, the nocturnal static stability significantly intensified, with a daily maximum averaging approximately 18 K/km, accompanied by a jet stream structure. During the dissipation period, the ventilation coefficient, mechanical turbulence, and turbulent kinetic energy values were 1.5–3 times those recorded during the pollution period. Regarding the turbulent motion states, the continuous accumulation of PM2.5 was accompanied by enhanced turbulent intermittency. Over 80 % of the turbulent motion was in an intermittent state at heavy pollution levels. During the pollution accumulation period, the turbulent intermittency was more intense in the lower atmosphere, implying a stronger turbulence barrier effect restraining the upward diffusion of surface pollutants. The substantial increase in static stability, which hindered downward momentum transmission, was an important cause for weakening mechanical turbulence and enhancing turbulent intermittency. The negative correlation between the boundary-layer height and PM2.5 concentrations did not apply universally. During the pollution accumulation phase, no significant correlation was observed between these two parameters, suggesting a possible more direct impact by other physical processes. Spectral analysis of a case study showed significantly correlated semi-diurnal periodic signals between surface pressure and PM2.5 concentrations during the pollution accumulation period. A 2 hPa pressure oscillation could cause a 40–50 μg/m3 variation in PM2.5, leading to bimodal peaks of PM2.5 concentrations at night and late morning."

 The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), a pivotal climate system impacting a substantial portion of the global population, is one of the most influential monsoon systems due to its intensity and its crucial role in supporting agriculture and driving socio-economic development in India through seasonal rainfall. The 21st century has witnessed notable changes in the ISM dynamics attributed to global warming, resulting in spatiotemporal variabilities and heightened extreme weather events across the nation. Recent advancements in climate modeling, particularly the application of CMIP6 models, have facilitated a comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on the ISM, enabling more accurate predictions of future variations in this monsoon system. This review synthesizes findings from recent research, emphasizing the examination of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) variability and the principal climate drivers influencing it. CMIP6 models, distinguished by their enhanced resolution and incorporation of intricate physical processes, have demonstrated superior capabilities in simulating ISMR patterns compared to their predecessors. Teleconnections, notably El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM) play a central role in ISMR modulation, across climate scenarios, with amplified influence under the high emission SSP5–8.5 scenario. Insights from the reviewed literature underscore the improved precision of CMIP6 models in projecting ISMR changes, particularly in association with air-sea interactions and sea surface temperature fluctuations across different oceans. The study encompasses an in-depth examination of extreme conditions such as droughts and floods, emphasizing their increasing frequency in recent years. Against the backdrop of evolving ISMR dynamics due to climate change, the review advocates for further investigations into the influence of additional climate factors on ISM under future warming scenarios."

In this work, we describe the changing genetic and cultural landscapes of early Holocene West Anatolia using 30 new paleogenomes. We show that Neolithization in West Anatolia was a multifaceted process, characterized by the assimilation of Neolithic practices by local foragers, the influx of eastern populations, and their admixture, with their descendants subsequently establishing Neolithic Southeast Europe. We then coanalyzed genetic and cultural similarities across early Holocene Anatolian and Aegean Neolithic villages using 58 material culture elements. Cultural distances among villages correlate with their spatial distances but not with their genetic distances after controlling for geography. This suggests that cultural change was often decoupled from genetically visible mobility."

Conventional approaches in estuarine flood mitigation have involved building and heightening hard-engineering structures. Recent evidence from small- to medium-sized estuaries highlights that managed realignment (MR)—relocating flood defences landward—is potentially more sustainable. However, the effectiveness of such MR on estuary-scale flood hazard reduction in large, urbanised estuaries where space for large-scale MR is limited remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we applied a calibrated 2D hydrodynamic simulation of the large (120 km2) urban Clyde estuary on Scotland’s west coast and compared it with existing simulations from eight other UK estuaries of varying size. Our simulations of varying MR sizes (0.15–3.3 km2) along the Clyde resulted in minimal estuary-scale reductions in peak water levels, flood extent, and tidal prism volume. In contrast, similar realignment measures applied to much smaller UK estuaries (3–108 km2) yielded more significant estuary-scale flood attenuation. Our results show that MR exhibits scale-dependent behaviour: the effectiveness of estuary-scale flood risk reduction is proportional to the size of MR relative to estuary size. Larger estuaries require significantly more realignment space to achieve meaningful estuary-scale flood hazard reduction. Conversely, smaller estuaries achieve flood hazard reduction benefits with comparatively smaller interventions as they are more sensitive to geometric changes. The scale-dependent behaviour identified here requires consideration when designing tidal flood risk alleviation strategies for estuaries around the globe, particularly where existing land uses and plans in highly urbanised estuaries may limit available space and/or increase the cost of realignment. Moreover, it also provides evidence that avoiding buildings (re)-development in the tidal floodplains of large estuaries is the best means of minimising future flood risk in a rapidly warming world."

In Bolivia, it is particularly important for mitigating drought impacts and sustaining municipal supply. Yet national planning still lacks a clear picture of how groundwater recharge is changing. This study maps potential groundwater recharge change for all 338 municipalities from 1983 to 2022 and presents a policy-oriented risk indicator. Monthly precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (R) were obtained from TerraClimate (≈4 km) and FLDAS (≈10 km). A water-balance model converted these variables to potential groundwater recharge. Mann–Kendall and Theil–Sen statistics quantified long-term trends, and Pettitt’s test located years of abrupt change. The Annual Reduction of Potential Groundwater Recharge (RAPReHS) was derived to classify each municipality into one of five risk levels based on long-term groundwater recharge trends. Negative trends are significant in 65% of municipalities, and 71% record at least one breakpoint, most often between 2012 and 2015. Santa Cruz shows the steepest mean decline (–1.9 mm yr−1), yet similar losses occur along the Chapare–Yungas corridor of La Paz and Cochabamba, the southern lowlands of Beni, and the Chaco of Tarija. By contrast, Pando and parts of northern Beni retain near-neutral or slightly positive slopes, highlighting strong hydro-climatic heterogeneity. Spatial comparison between RAPReHS results and, deforestation and fire statistics reveals strong alignment. Municipalities in the ‘high’ and ‘severe’ classes spatially overlap with the main zones of primary forest loss recorded in Bolivia between 2000 and 2022.

While traditional budgets at the reach- and sub-basin-scale have focused on hinterland sediment supply, the role of alluvial storage in modulating sediment fluxes remains poorly understood, particularly in data-scarce Himalayan large rivers. To address this, we compiled sediment load data from existing studies across different sub-basins of the large Ganga River system to construct a basin-scale sediment budget. Using this integrated sediment budget, we examined spatial variability in sediment generation, transport and deposition across the Himalayan hinterland and alluvial plains. Our analysis reveals strong regional contrasts in sediment dispersal, driven by differences in uplift rates, precipitation and subsidence. The western Ganga rivers, covering 27% of the basin area, contribute only 9% of the total sediment load (385 Mt a−1) due to lower uplift rates and precipitation. This results in a supply-limited system with entrenched rivers and minimal sediment storage in the adjacent low-subsiding plains. In contrast, the Eastern Himalayan Hinterland is the dominant sediment source, generating 51% of the total load from 11% of the basin area; however, ∼45% of this sediment is trapped in the subsiding alluvial plains, forming aggradational channels. The Transitional Himalayan Hinterland bridges these extremes, contributing 23% of the sediment load from the hinterland covering 9% of basin area due to intermediate uplift and precipitation rate. This increases to 29% in the alluvial plains, where low subsidence—similar to the Western Ganga Plains—facilitates efficient sediment transfer downstream. We propose that transient storage in the Eastern Ganga Plains may become a key control on sediment dispersal over a centennial timescale, as increasing extreme precipitation events could shift the system from transport-limited to supply-limited. Accounting for these shifts is essential for effective sediment management and future planning."

The use of local forecast, however, faces challenges by increasing climate variability, which undermines farmers’ confidence in their forecast. This study addresses these challenges by developing a hybrid forecast that integrates both scientific and local forecast using machine learning techniques to improve precipitation predictions in northern Ghana. Results show that the hybrid forecast improves precipitation forecast accuracy by 23% and 33% compared to scientific forecast and local forecast, respectively. The best performance is achieved by combining two random forests (RFs) or a voting classifier and a RF. This research highlights the potential of machine learning to develop more accurate hybrid forecast than other statistical methods. Such enhanced precipitation forecasts could enable smallholder farmers in the Global South to make better-informed agricultural decisions, ultimately enhancing their livelihoods."

However, the increasing frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme climate events, especially in warm and humid regions, pose great challenges to the carbon sequestration efficiency and ecological stability of forest ecosystems. Consequently, understanding the different performances of planted versus natural forests under extreme conditions in such vulnerable regions is urgently needed. This study investigated the impacts of drought and heatwave events on the gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE) of natural and planted evergreen forests. The response of ecological stability to event intensity and duration was assessed by anomalies, and resistance and resilience were calculated using the GPP and WUE, respectively. Our findings revealed that (1) GPP anomaly was more sensitive to heatwaves, whereas WUE anomaly was more sensitive to drought in both forest types; notably, natural forests presented smaller GPP and WUE anomalies during extreme events; (2) natural forests presented superior resistance across varying intensities and durations, whereas planted forests generally presented greater resilience; and (3) threshold comparisons indicated that natural forests could withstand more intense drought and heatwaves. In terms of duration, natural forests presented greater resistance to drought events lasting up to three months, whereas planted forests presented greater resilience to heatwave events lasting more than two months. These findings provide valuable insights and guidance for forest management under climate extremes and contribute to a more reliable foundation for strategies to mitigate global warming."

Compared with β-lactam and sulfonamide antibiotics, tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics have longer environmental half-lives and are more widely used, particularly in agriculture, aquaculture, and healthcare. In this study, the composition, spatial distribution, potential sources, and ecological risks of 4 tetracycline and 20 quinolone antibiotics were systematically investigated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the surface seawater of the Northeastern Indian Ocean for the first time. A total of nine antibiotics were detected in seawater samples, including tetracycline (detection rate: 100%), oxytetracycline (100%), chlortetracycline (100%), doxycycline (100%), ofloxacin (100%), ciprofloxacin (100%), norfloxacin (92.3%), enrofloxacin (96.2%), and fleroxacin (23.1%). Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enrofloxacin were widely distributed throughout the study area, with tetracycline antibiotics (83.8%) being significantly more prevalent than quinolone antibiotics. Among them, oxytetracycline was the dominant tetracycline antibiotic. The concentrations of tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics ranged from 0.258 to 23.521 ng l−1 (mean: 16.813 ng l−1) and 0.016–9.480 ng l−1 (mean: 3.261 ng l−1), respectively.

The results point to the importance of the fall speed of hydrometeor particles and to a simple relationship: the faster a condensate falls, the less there is of it. Implications for the energy balance and precipitation properties are discussed. 
 Cloud microphysics is a prime example of processes that remain unresolved in atmospheric modeling at storm-resolving resolution. In this study, we explore how uncertainties in the representation of microphysical processes affect the tropical condensate distribution in a global storm-resolving model. We use ICON in its global storm-resolving configuration, with a one- or two-moment microphysical scheme and perform several sensitivity runs, where, in each, we modify parameters of one hydrometeor category of the applied microphysics scheme. Differences between the one- and two-moment schemes are most prominent in partitioning frozen condensate in cloud ice and snow and can be understood in terms of the habit's definition for each scheme, which is associated with different process rates. Overall differences between the simulations are moderate and tend to be larger for individual condensate habits than for more integrated quantities, like cloud fraction or total condensate burden. Yet, the resulting spread in the tropical energy balance of several W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface is substantial. Although the modified parameters within one scheme generally affect different process rates, most of the change in the condensate amount of the modified habit and even the total condensate burden can be attributed to a single property: the change in fall speed. The tropical-mean precipitation efficiency is also well explained by changes in the relative fall speed across different habits in both schemes."

We traced water vapor paths, showing their impact on water supply and climate. This insight is key for predicting future water resources and climate patterns, offering a clearer understanding of our interconnected environmental systems. 
 Understanding water vapor sources and transport paths is essential for assessing the water cycle and predicting precipitation accurately. Utilizing water vapor diagnosis and calculations, this study determined the water vapor sources and transport paths leading to precipitation in the Dongting Lake basin in four seasons (represented by January, April, June, and October). In January, the water-vapor-generating precipitation originated from the Arabian Peninsula, driven by the southern branch of the westerlies over the southern side of the Tibetan Plateau, along the northern side of the Indian Peninsula through southwestern China to reach the Dongting Lake basin. In April, two transport paths emerged: one aligned closely with the January transport path but with the location shifted slightly northward by 1° of latitude and another driven by the weak subtropical high over the southwestern Pacific, bringing moist air from the western Pacific via the South China Sea and Indochinese Peninsula. In June, the vapor sourced from the northern branch of the southern Indian Ocean subtropical high crossed the Equator and transported through various waterbodies to southwestern China, finally reaching the basin. October saw a water vapor transport path from the western Pacific, crossing the South China Sea and entering the Dongting Lake basin, influenced by the East Asian monsoon system. In different seasons, the variations in water stable isotopes along water vapor transport paths show some agreement with Rayleigh fractionation and water balance principles, as reflected in the model simulations and observations. These findings highlight the impact of atmospheric circulation on precipitation and isotopes, providing a framework for understanding water vapor isotope mechanisms and reconstructing past atmospheric conditions. This research explored how water vapor transports influenced the precipitation isotopes in the Dongting Lake basin in representative months of different seasons. By tracking water vapor from its source regions, we revealed the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on the transportation of water vapor to the Dongting Lake basin. The changes in water stable isotopes along the water vapor transport paths highlighted the isotopic fractionation and water vapor exchange that occurred along these paths, while the isotopic changes in the precipitation reflect the cumulative influences of water vapor transport on the local precipitation. These comprehensive insights have clarified the influences of atmospheric circulation on water vapor transport and precipitation isotopes and are thus essential for predicting regional precipitation patterns."

By adding unsupervised pre-training before supervised classification, our algorithm reduces manual labeling effort while maintaining high accuracy. It outperforms fully supervised models across datasets of varying sizes and categories, showing strong generalization ability. This method improves ice crystal classification techniques, making it adaptable to different environmental datasets. 
 The shapes of ice crystals play an important role in global precipitation formation and the radiation budget. Classifying ice crystal shapes can improve our understanding of in-cloud conditions and these processes. Existing classification methods rely on features such as the aspect ratio of ice crystals, environmental temperature, and so on, which bring high instability to the classification performance, or employ supervised machine learning algorithms that heavily rely on human labeling. This poses significant challenges, including human subjectivity in classification and a substantial labor cost in manual labeling. In addition, previous deep learning algorithms for ice crystal classification are often trained and evaluated on datasets with varying sizes and classification schemes, each with distinct criteria and a different number of categories, making it difficult to make a fair comparison of algorithm performance. To overcome these limitations, a contrastive semi-supervised learning (CSSL) algorithm for the classification of ice crystals is proposed. The algorithm consists of an upstream unsupervised learning network tasked with extracting meaningful representations from a large number of unlabeled ice crystal images, and a downstream supervised network is fine-tuned with a small subset of labeled images of the entire dataset to perform the classification task. To determine the minimum number of ice crystal images that require human labeling while maintaining the algorithm performance, the algorithm is trained and evaluated on datasets with varying sizes and numbers of categories. The ice crystal data used in this study were collected during the NASCENT campaign at Ny-Ålesund and CLOUDLAB project on the Swiss Plateau using a holographic imager mounted on a tethered balloon system. In general, the CSSL algorithm outperforms a purely supervised algorithm in classifying 19 categories. Approximately 154 h of manual labeling can be avoided using just 11 % (2048 images) of the training set for fine tuning, sacrificing only 3.8 % in overall precision compared to a fully supervised model trained on the entire dataset. In the four-category classification task, the CSSL algorithm also outperforms the purely supervised algorithm. When fine-tuned on just 2048 images (25 % of the dataset), it achieves an overall accuracy of 89.6 %, nearly matching the 91.0 % accuracy of the supervised algorithm trained on 8192 images. When tested on the unseen CLOUDLAB dataset, CSSL shows superior generalization, improving accuracy by an average of 2.19 %. Our analysis also reveals that both CSSL and purely supervised algorithms exhibit inherent instability when trained on small dataset sizes, and the performance difference between them converges as the training set size exceeds 2048 samples. These results highlight the strength and practical effectiveness of CSSL in comparison to purely supervised methods and the potential of the CSSL algorithm to perform well on datasets  collected under different conditions."

However, little is known about the spatial distribution of the cultivated pastures due to the difficulty in distinguishing them from natural grasslands with remote sensing. For the first time, we have mapped the cultivated pastures on the plateau at a resolution of 30 m with decent accuracy. This dataset is valuable to scientists, policymakers, conservationists, and pastoralists. 
 Cultivated pastures have rapidly developed across the Tibetan Plateau over the past several decades, raising concerns about grassland degradation. Accordingly, considerable attention is paid to the protection of Tibetan grassland ecosystems. However, high-resolution spatial distribution of cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau remains poorly understood, primarily due to the difficulty in discriminating cultivated pastures from other land cover types using remote sensing techniques. The absence of such information hinders efficient agricultural and livestock husbandry management, making it challenging to support ecological protection and restoration efforts. Here, we mapped the cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau at a 30 m resolution for the years 1988 to 2021 using Landsat data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. We built a random forest (RF) binary classification model with inputs of the spectral–temporal metrics of Landsat data acquired in the growing season, as well as ancillary topographic data. The model was trained using carefully selected training samples and was validated against 2000 independent random reference points in two pilot study regions with different climates and landscapes. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.05 % ± 0.4 % and an F1 spatial consistency score of 82.51 % ± 14.22 % (precision: 90.04 % ± 6.18 %; recall: 76.74 % ± 9.91 %), suggesting high confidence in mapping the distribution of cultivated pastures on the plateau. Using the RF model, we then produced a dataset of cultivated-pasture maps for the years from 1988 to 2021 for Qinghai Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the Tibetan Plateau, covering 77 % of the plateau. At both the province and county levels, the cultivated-pasture areas estimated in this study matched well with government statistics for recent years. The area of cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau experienced a significant expansion from 0.46 Mha in 1988 to 1.57 Mha in 2021, with an average annual growth of 33.5±2.5 Kha.

 Rice cultivation faces multiple challenges from rising food demand as well as increasing water scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying the tension of the food–water–climate nexus. Process-based modeling is pivotal for developing effective measures to balance these challenges. However, current models struggle to simulate their complex relationships under different water management schemes, primarily due to inadequate representation of critical physiological effects and a lack of efficient spatially explicit modeling strategies. Here, we propose an advancing framework that addresses these problems by integrating a process-based soil–crop model with vital physiological effects, a novel method for model upscaling, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization algorithm at a parallel computing platform. Applying the framework accounted for 52 %, 60 %, 37 %, and 94 % of the experimentally observed variations in rice yield, irrigation water use, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions in response to irrigation schemes. Compared with the original model using traditional parameter upscaling methods, the advancing framework significantly reduced simulation errors by 35 %–85 %. Moreover, it well reproduced the multi-variable synergies and tradeoffs observed in China's rice fields and identified an additional 18 % areas feasible for irrigation optimization, along with an additional 11 % and 14 % reduction potentials of water use and methane emissions, without compromising production. Over 90 % of the potentials could be realized at the cost of 4 % less yield increase and 25 % higher nitrous oxide emissions under multiple objectives. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for multi-objective optimization of rice irrigation schemes at a large scale.

However, the environmental risks of PFOA degradation products have rarely been studied. In this study, PFOA (C8) was photocatalytically degraded with N-CQDs/TiO2, producing C3–C7 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and fluoride ions. We investigated bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of PFCAs in a model food web of Chlorella sp., Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio (zebrafish). Degradation-induced acidification of the solution increased the bioaccumulation of both residual PFOA and the newly formed PFCAs, and the long-chain PFCAs (C6–C8) were able to undergo trophic transfer. Unexpectedly, the degradation products exhibited higher acute toxicity than PFOA in all three organisms, with zebrafish showing the highest sensitivity. Subsequently, concentration-dependent transcriptomics and adverse outcome pathway (AOPs) analysis indicated lipid metabolism disorders, oxidative stress, skeletal toxicity, and neurotoxicity in zebrafish, which were verified by biomarker tests. The toxic contributions of PFCAs, fluoride ions, and acidic pH in degradation products were further assessed by exposing zebrafish to them individually or in combination. The results indicated that lipid metabolism disorders stem from the abnormal activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor (LXR) by PFCAs. Skeletal toxicity and oxidative stress are induced by the strong binding of fluoride ions to metallic elements. The solution acidification exacerbates toxic effects. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to exposure according to the lowest threshold concentration for neurotoxicity-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The degradation products impair neuronal development and disrupt neurotransmitter signaling. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the degradation of PFOA molecules does not equate to risk elimination; instead, incomplete degradation may heighten ecological toxicity and health risk."

Herein, in a root-box system isolating the rhizosphere and bulk soils, we explored the combined effects of NPs and a kind of typical plastic additive di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) on soil health via combining the evidence from in situ zymography, the microbiome, and metabolism. The plastic additive dominated the risks of plastic pollution to plants, and the coexistence of NPs did not mitigate the DEHP threat to microorganisms and increased that to food safety. Compared to single DEHP, combined NPs and DEHP inhibited β-glucosidase activity to limit soil organic carbon (C) decomposition and stimulated acid phosphatase activity to increase P uptake by tomato roots and enriched the relative abundance of C-fixed bacteria and P-dissolution bacteria, while inhibiting that of chemical heterotrophic bacteria in rhizosphere soils, which further stimulated the synthesis and metabolism of phospholipid and fatty acid and triphosphate cycle and increased nutrients bioavailability for plants. Therefore, rhizosphere effects optimized the root nutrient acquisition strategy, microbial community structure, and their metabolic processes to reduce the threat from NPs and plastic additives to plants.

This study developed and applied a method to quantify the yields for HO• and 3DOM* (expressed as ⌀HO• and fTMP, respectively) from far-UVC (UV222) photolysis of DOM. ⌀HO• at 222 nm (0.64–0.82%) is 13–34 times higher than at 254 nm and 136–213 times higher than at >290 nm. fTMP at 222 nm (293–1011 M–1) is 3.6–8.4 times and 1.8–19 times greater than at 254 nm and >290 nm, respectively. Electron-accepting moieties (e.g., carbonyl-containing compounds) are likely the major precursors of 3DOM* under UV222 irradiation. Despite DOM’s light-screening and radical-scavenging effects, the high ⌀HO• at 222 nm ensures that DOM has a negligible impact on HO• concentrations in the absence of other radical precursors (e.g., NO3–). Concurrently, enhanced 3DOM* generation accelerates the photosensitized activation of NH2Cl by 3-fold under UV222 irradiation compared to UV254. Given the critical roles of HO• and 3DOM* in micropollutant degradation, oxidant activation, and reactive species transformation, this work advances both the fundamental photochemistry and the practical application of far-UVC-driven water treatment technologies."

We provide the first experimental and modeling assessment of gas-particle multiphase OH oxidation of BPA and six common bisphenol alternatives. We examine the transformation of condensed-phase BPA and its alternatives using an oxidation flow reactor with products monitored by online mass spectrometry. Fourteen products were identified and used to develop a generic mechanism applicable to all bisphenols and to provide inputs into an environmental fate model (PROduction-to-Exposure; PROTEX). Our modeling results highlight the role of heterogeneous surface reactions in determining the indoor retention of these chemicals and their relative environmental persistence indoors and outdoors.

In this study, we demonstrate that shifting the UV irradiation wavelength from 254 nm (UV254) to 222 nm (UV222) in the UV/sulfite ARP enhances the eaq– yield by 48.67-fold. Leveraging experimentally determined parameters, including the molar absorption coefficient of sulfite (1145 ± 11 M–1 cm–1) and its quantum yield for photolysis (0.104 ± 0.0070 mol Einstein–1) at 222 nm, we developed a kinetic model to predict eaq– concentrations in the UV222/sulfite system under diverse environmental and operational conditions. Using real tap water and surface water matrices, we show that the UV222/sulfite ARP reduces energy consumption by a factor of 4.19–16.18 compared to the conventional UV254/sulfite process during the degradation of halogenated contaminants, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).

However, their precise inhibitory mechanisms and toxic targets within the photosynthetic pathways remain poorly understood. Through a combination of physio-biochemical indicators, multiomics analysis, and molecular docking simulation, this study systematically explored the photosynthetic toxic effects of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q on Ceratophyllum demersum L. (C. demersum). Transcriptomic data identified photosynthetic antenna proteins as primary molecular targets, with both contaminants perturbing the transcriptional regulation of genes and impairing the structural plasticity of associated proteins. These molecular perturbations consequently disrupted the photosynthetic electron transport efficiency. Metabolomic evidence revealed subsequent carbohydrate metabolism imbalances, suggesting compromised carbon fixation capacity of C. demersum. Additionally, molecular docking simulations demonstrated superior binding affinities for both compounds with antenna proteins, particularly emphasizing the enhanced interactions mediated by 6PPD-Q’s quinone structure. Comparative analysis indicated that 6PPD-Q’s structural modifications may confer greater photosynthetic toxicity compared to the parent  compound 6PPD. This multiomics investigation reveals the mechanistic basis of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q-driven photosynthetic toxicity and underscores their potential to destabilize aquatic ecosystems by disrupting primary productivity."

Recent research has highlighted a positive trend in jet stream waviness from 1990 to 2010, with a hypothesized connection to Arctic amplification of anthropogenic warming. However, an increase in jet stream waviness has also been hypothesized to contribute to the winter “warming hole” (WH) in eastern North America, a cooling phenomenon from 1958–1988, beginning several decades prior to the recent waviness trend. These potentially conflicting hypotheses highlight the uncertainty of long‐term jet stream waviness variability prior to the satellite era (1979–present). Here we develop a new record of wintertime jet stream waviness spanning 1901–2023 based on self‐organizing maps and nine different temperature and reanalysis data sets with the dual purpose of (a) understanding the historical variability of polar jet stream waviness in the eastern United States, and (b) quantifying the impact of jet stream waviness on WH‐era surface temperatures. Our analysis reveals elevated jet stream waviness in the 1960s–1980s that surpassed modern waviness levels, and we find that jet stream waviness contributed to two‐thirds of winter WH cooling beginning in 1958. These results are consistent with a strong connection between temperature trends in the eastern U.S. and jet stream troughing but indicate that additional mechanisms also contributed to the WH. Our analysis further highlights that recent increases in jet stream waviness are well within the range of early to mid‐20th century variability, prior to the emergence of Arctic amplification."

To enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of land surface‐atmosphere interactions and reduce the mismatches between Noah‐Multiparameterization Land Surface (Noah‐MP) simulations and observational data, we optimized the seven most sensitive parameters in the Noah‐MP for a 9‐day period (2–10 April 2016) at the Southern Great Plains site using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The implementation of Noah‐MP in the single‐column Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the application of BO allow for site‐level parameter estimation. The Noah‐MP shows an improvement in the simulation of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux when we use optimized parameters instead of the default parameters according to data from flux tower observations. The optimized parameter values indicate that the top layer (0–20 cm below the ground surface) of soil at the Southern Great Plains site may contain a higher sand content than indicated by the silty‐clay‐loam soil classification provided by AmeriFlux agricultural records. These optimized parameters also improve the simulation of atmospheric state variables, especially the 2‐m specific humidity, and result in improved top‐layer soil moisture and temperature simulations.

Intensification occurred despite inhibiting factors such as high axial tilt, high vertical wind shear, low atmospheric moisture, and transit over a relatively shallow continental shelf. Using a high‐resolution simulation of Hurricane Ian from the Hurricane Weather Research Forecasting (HWRF) model, we examine the factors that both hindered and supported rapid intensification (RI) by blending various methods. We show that an increase in diabatic heating in the eyewall led to an inward radial advection of momentum, seen in both the absolute angular momentum budget and in the azimuthal wind budget. Analysis of the moist static energy budget indicates that the substantial latent heat flux from the surface was enough to balance heat losses through storm outflow. For instance, surface latent heat fluxes exceeded 1,500 W m−2 on the West Florida Continental Shelf. As suggested by actual ocean temperature observations that substantially exceeded those in the HWRF simulation, the latent heating may have even been larger. Physical explanations for discrepancies between the simulated Hurricane Ian and observations are provided, particularly those pertaining to the coastal ocean at the time of Ian's passage. This research provides a comprehensive explanation of the RI of a hurricane using momentum budget analyses as part of a coupled air‐sea analysis.

An important characteristic of MPCs is how the cloud phases are mixed, which affects interactions between ice and liquid. Observations show that phase tends to be nonuniform with ice and liquid forming spatially separated single‐phased “pockets” not accounted for in climate models. These pockets may vary in size from the micron‐scale to several hundred kilometers making them notoriously difficult to study, and the factors influencing cloud‐phase heterogeneity remain uncertain. We quantify size distributions of phase pockets in an observed and modeled Arctic MPC occurring 12 November 2019 in Ny‐Ålesund, Svalbard. The case is simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting model constrained with representative aerosol concentrations following measurements from the Ny‐Ålesund Aerosol Cloud Experiment. We find that phase pockets exhibit broad size distributions with the smallest pockets occurring most frequently. Observations reveal mean pocket lengths of 2 km, whereas the simulated pockets are about 5 times longer on average. Simulated pocket size distributions are highly sensitive to prescribed aerosols. Moreover, we observe a pronounced increase of 6.5 km in the mean length of mixed‐phase pockets when secondary ice production is enhanced in simulations. These results shed light on the link between cloud microphysics and the in‐cloud distribution of phase and provide a potential framework for representation of sub‐grid scale phase variability in climate models."

Here, the authors perform single cell RNA sequencing of PDX-derived samples from pediatric T-ALL patients at diagnosis and relapse and without relapse and identify treatment-resistant stem-like cells. 
 T-ALL relapses are characterized by chemotherapy resistance, cellular diversity and dismal outcome. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying relapses, we conduct single-cell RNA sequencing on 13 matched pediatric T-ALL patient-derived samples at diagnosis and relapse, along with samples derived from 5 non-relapsing patients collected at diagnosis. This comprehensive longitudinal single-cell study in T-ALL reveals significant transcriptomic diversity. Notably, 11 out of 18 samples exhibit a subpopulation of T-ALL cells with stem-like features characterized by a common set of active regulons, expression patterns and splice isoforms. This subpopulation, accounting for a small proportion of leukemia cells at diagnosis, expands substantially at relapse, indicating resistance to therapy. Strikingly, increased stemness at diagnosis is associated with higher risk of treatment induction failure. Chemotherapy resistance is validated through in-vitro and in-vivo drug testing. Thus, we report the discovery of treatment-resistant stem-like cells in T-ALL, underscoring the potential for devising future therapeutic strategies targeting stemness-related pathways.

Here, the authors show that HBV promotes HCC formation only in response to environmental carcinogens, involving increased IL-33 signaling and regulatory T cells. 
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Considering that most HBV-infected individuals remain asymptomatic, the mechanism linking HBV to hepatitis and HCC remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that HBV alone does not cause liver inflammation or cancer. Instead, HBV alters the chronic inflammation induced by chemical carcinogens to promote liver carcinogenesis. Long-term HBV genome expression in mouse liver increases liver inflammation and cancer propensity caused by a carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). HBV plus DEN-activated interleukin-33 (IL-33)/regulatory T cell axis is required for liver carcinogenesis. Pitavastatin, an IL-33 inhibitor, suppresses HBV plus DEN-induced liver cancer. IL-33 is markedly elevated in HBV+ hepatitis patients, and pitavastatin use significantly correlates with reduced risk of hepatitis and its associated HCC in patients. Collectively, our findings reveal that environmental carcinogens are the link between HBV and HCC risk, creating a window of opportunity for cancer prevention in HBV carriers.

 The seasonal freeze-thaw (FT) cycles of the permafrost active layer and seasonally frozen ground have significant impacts on ecosystems. Advances in remote sensing have enabled global monitoring of seasonal surface FT cycles. However, previous studies have generally overlooked the impact of remote sensing dataset accuracy on multiple FT parameters and have failed to sufficiently explore the changes in thawing and freezing intervals (TI/FI) in the Northern Hemisphere. This study evaluates the FT-ESDR remote sensing product using site-observed soil temperature data and provides a comprehensive analysis of surface FT characteristics in the Northern Hemisphere, with a focus on freezing and thawing intervals based on FT parameters calculated using a 15-day moving window method. The results indicate that the FT status calculated from site data shows strong agreement with remote sensing data products, with this agreement varying by season, land cover type, air temperature, precipitation. Compared to the FT parameters calculated from site data, FT-ESDR dataset underestimate several FT parameters. Combined analysis of site observation data and remote sensing data products indicates the presence of permafrost degradation, characterized by a longer thawed duration (TD), shorter frozen duration (FD), earlier start of thawing (SOT) and end of thawing (EOT), delayed start of freezing (SOF) and end of freezing (EOF), and reduced FT frequency (FTCF1/FTCF2) for both thawing and freezing seasons. The variations in FT parameters differ based on vegetation and permafrost types. The thawing interval (TI) and freezing interval (FI) show a shortening trend at most sites, indicating an acceleration of the surface thawing and freezing processes. The shortening of TI/FI during thawing/freezing is associated with increased/decreased air temperatures during the corresponding periods. Notably, the variation characteristics of sites in agricultural land differ from those in other land cover types. Overall, our results highlight the underestimation of FT parameters derived from the FT-ESDR dataset and their sensitivity to environmental factors. It also emphasizes the acceleration of surface thawing and freezing processes, which are influenced by air temperature."

 Recently, graph clustering has been applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering and proves to be effective on capturing the complex affinity among hyperspectral samples to a certain extent. However, graph clustering based on sample-level affinity usually suffers from a heavy computation overhead due to the generation of coefficient matrices. Meanwhile, since the spatial information of HSIs may not be sufficiently utilized in these methods, it is difficult for them to obtain robust clustering performance when processing various HSIs. In order to alleviate the negative effect of sample-level affinity, we achieve evolving superpixel-level affinity (ESA) by collaboratively integrating the sample-level contrastive learning (CL) for learning discriminative features with finding the inter-superpixel good neighbors (GN) of each sample. Initially, CL is operated based on the assumption of homogeneous superpixels to pull together samples from the same superpixel and the learned features are fed to the smooth representation model to pursue the representation coefficients that used for generating GN. Then, the superpixel-level affinity is updated by simply converting the similarity between samples in each pair of GN into the similarity of the corresponding superpixels. By combining the homogeneous assumption of superpixels with the updated superpixel-level affinity, further CL is achieved to acquire more GN. In this way, CL and generation of GN works collaboratively to evolutionarily solve the superpixel-level affinity. When the process finishes, density-based spectral clustering is first implemented on several affinity matrices selected by designed growth rate of Eigenvalues of normalized Laplacian matrix to obtain clustering results of superpixels. The superpixel-to-pixels projection is then applied to these results to gain clustering maps. Finally, the majority vote strategy is adopted to realize the final clustering. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark HSIs demonstrate that the proposed ESA method is superior to the considered baseline counterparts in terms of clustering accuracy."

 This study explored the combustion characteristics, kinetics, pollutant formation, and reduction mechanisms of corn straw (CS)-processed fuels in residential applications. CS was collected to prepare CS briquettes (CSB) and CS charcoal (CSC). Derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) peaks implied that the combustion of CS, CSB, and CSC was dominated by pyrolysis, pyrolysis and char combustion, char combustion, respectively. Briquetting considerably decreased the devolatilization index (D) (66.4 %) and the maximum weight loss rate (DTGmax) (55.0 %); therefore, the CSB exhibited controlled pyrolysis and lower pollutant emissions than CS. Moreover, carbonization led to a considerable reduction in volatile matter (VM) content; thus, CSC exhibited lower pollutant emissions than CS. Both CSB and CSC successfully achieved significant emission reductions compared to CS for SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and its sub-factions include organic carbon (OC), element carbon (EC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), inorganic ions and metals. CSC is a little more effective in most pollutants' reduction, and much more effective in EC reduction, yet less effective in ions reduction compared to CSB. EC emissions positively correlate with VM content (R2 = 0.989), which lead to the more remarkable EC reduction in CSC for CSC's much lowered VM content.

 In recent years, the frequency of Dry-wet abrupt alternation (DWAA) has gradually increased. However, the climate factors of the spatio-temporal pattern of DWAA events on a national scale are still not well understood, and the research on the correlation of DWAA with rain belt/season in China has not been investigated so far. This study explored the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the frequency, intensity, and alternation timing of DWAA events over the whole China during 1961–2018, and then intensively investigated the relationship between the changes of DWAA and the summer rain belt/season in the whole China. The research results can be summarized: (1) The DWAA events primarily occurred in the eastern China, the frequency of wet-to-dry (WTD) events declined significantly from 1961 to 1990, and future trends in DWAA frequency and intensity are expected to follow the historical patterns in the whole China. The intensity of DWAA events with alternation timing in May and August was stronger than that in June and July. (2) In the eastern China, the alternation timing of dry-to-wet (DTW) events and WTD events corresponded well to the advance of summer rain belt, and the alternation timing of DWAA during 1991–2018 occurred earlier than that in 1961–1990, driven by the decadal advance of the onset of the SCSSM. In the western China, the alternation timing of DWAA was aligned with the seasonal shift between the rainy and dry periods. (3) The five Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) indices showed a strong correlation with DWAA in the eastern China, and a weaker correlation in the western China. Moreover, the correlation between DWAA and WPSH in the eastern China strengthened in 1990–2018 compared to that in 1961–1990. The composite DWAAI tended to be higher (lower) in the strong (weak) WPSH years. Therefore, the activity of WPSH was an important factor affecting the frequency and intensity of DWAA."

 The Canary Archipelago, due to its location between the tropics and subtropics, represents a key region for studying precipitation moisture sources. This study provides a high-resolution (20 km) climatological analysis of the moisture sources for potential precipitation in the archipelago from 1985 to 2022, applying a dynamic downscaling methodology (WRF-ARW) and a Lagrangian approach considering the trajectories of potentially precipitating particles (FLEXPART-WRF model). The analysis differentiates between precipitation and non-precipitation days, western and eastern islands, and moisture transport above and below the trade wind inversion layer (at 900 hPa). Results indicate that the main moisture source for the archipelago is the North Atlantic (up to 74 % annually), and a crucial contribution comes from the northeast region of the islands, especially under prevailing trade wind conditions. During the summer, moisture from the African continent further enhances its contribution up to 16 % for the total moisture transported. The moisture pattern is more pronounced on days with precipitation, extending longitudinally towards the western Atlantic, and showing the largest positive anomalies during intense precipitation events. Notably, our findings highlight the strong contribution of moisture from the northeast above the inversion layer, even on non-precipitation days.

 The Bay of Bengal storms (BoB storms) are the most catastrophic weather conditions in the region of Bay of Bengal and pose a significant threat to countries within and adjacent to the region, highlighting the urgent need for accurate forecasts to increase disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. However, sparse observations limit the accuracy of the BoB storm forecasts. Current numerical forecast systems adopt “target observation” strategy to increase additional observations and improve the forecast skill, but still face challenge of low efficiency and allow more model error effects on efficacy of additional observations. The study adopts a highly efficient Artificial Intelligence-driven “Pangu-Weather” model and constructs an optimization system for identifying sensitive areas of target observations associated with the BoB storm track forecasts based on the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) method. The CNOP method comprehensively accounts for nonlinear processes and has been verified to be superior to traditional linear approximation methods, such as singular vector, adjoint sensitivity, and ETKF. Based upon this system, the sensitive areas for target observations were determined for 12 forecasts of four strong BoB storms and their roles were evaluated in terms of the improvement of the storm track forecast level through observing system simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that preferentially improving the accuracy of the initial conditions in the sensitive areas, compared with doing it in randomly selected areas, can be more significant to upgrade the storm track forecast level; however, such upgrades only hold for the forecast duration of 24 h. This result provides hints for the potential of the Pangu-Weather model in forecasting BoB storms and has the implication that the predictability of the “Pangu-Weather” model with respect to the BoB storm tracks is dominantly constrained by model error effects after 24 h. It suggests that the improvement of model architecture is necessary for prolonging the predictability time of Pangu-Weather with respect to the BoB storms."

However, the mechanisms underlying cellular adaptation of m6A modification and their impact on protein synthesis machinery remain unclear. VIRMA, the largest and evolutionarily conserved core of the m6A methyltransferase complex, is highly expressed in the embryonic brain and various cancers. Here, we demonstrate that VIRMA-mediated m6A modification is essential for active ribosome biogenesis. VIRMA depletion destabilizes the entire writer complex and reduces m6A levels, leading to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of neural progenitor/stem cells, ultimately causing severe forebrain developmental defects. Mechanistically, VIRMA depletion impairs ribosome biogenesis by inhibiting mRNA decay, triggering a p53-dependent stress response and compromising global protein synthesis. These findings extend to some cancer cells, suggesting a potential conservation of this mechanism.

We address this gap by presenting ochre tools from Blombos Cave, South Africa, found in Still Bay to pre–Still Bay layers dated 90 to 70,000 years ago. Seven ochre pieces were deliberately modified into lithic retouchers, showing clear use-wear patterns and evidence of intentional shaping. Targeted experiments confirm that some were used for pressure flaking and were rejuvenated to maintain function. These findings provide direct evidence of ochre being used to retouch lithic artifacts during the MSA, highlighting its role in technological systems of this period.

In this study, we examine how diurnalT/RH hysteresis modulates VPD across different climates using observational data alongside high-resolution reanalysis and simulations. Here, we find that regions exhibiting strong diurnalT/RH hysteresis, especially in some waterside and montane regions, experience earlier daily VPD peaks. We also demonstrate that global warming weakens diurnalT/RH hysteresis, leading to amplified VPD increasing trends and greater ecosystem stress.

Vincent,Automorphy as a self-organizing DPP-dependent process that translates patterns into mechanical programs during Drosophila embryogenesis,"Morphogens provide developing tissues with positional information to ensure coherent morphogenesis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) initially form a gradient to pattern the dorsal domains of theDrosophilaembryo. Here, we show that the BMP homolog decapentaplegic (DPP) endows dorsal domains with specific mechanical programs to organize morphogenesis. These domains self-organize using high local DPP activities, a process we call automorphy. Automorphy is key to inducing specific morphological changes while being faithful to the initial positional information. The BMP morphogen therefore uses a series of automorphic events to translate each position into physical potentials that later produce a contractile amnioserosa and a dorsal epidermis displaying plasticity. Plasticity allows cell elongation in wild-type embryos, and perturbations of cellular patterns reveal its crucial role in adapting to mechanical constraints.

The magnetic hydrogels are facilely prepared by mixing neodymium-iron-boron particles with an aqueous poly(acrylic acid–co–acrylamide) solution, which spontaneously forms supramolecular network with carboxylic–ferric ion coordinates as physical cross-links. This network enables dynamic control of viscoelasticity by localized laser heating, which reduces the pinning force of gel matrix and allows for reorientation of magnetic particles under a modest magnetic field. We demonstrate that the same hydrogel sheet can be reprogrammed to exhibit various complex deformations and locomotion. This versatile approach to developing magnetic hydrogels with adaptive responses offers exciting potential for soft robotics and biomedical devices."

Gentleman,Pathways of blue carbon export from kelp and seagrass beds along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia,"Coastal vegetated ecosystems are recognized for their role in cycling and storing carbon in the world’s oceans (i.e., blue carbon); however, high uncertainty in carbon sequestration rates is partly due to an absence of studies estimating carbon export to the deep sea. We modeled export from nearshore kelp forests and seagrass beds, showing variability by orders of magnitude across spatial scales (3 to hundreds of kilometers), kelp and seagrass species, seasons, and carbon forms, raising caution in using generalized export rates in blue carbon accounting. Our results also show rapid (20 to 30 days) and extensive export of neutrally buoyant dissolved organic carbon particles to the shelf break (up to 44% within 90 days), contrasting sinking particulate organic carbon particles that largely remained within 100-meter water depth in the nearshore. These results improve estimates of carbon sequestration by blue carbon ecosystems and reveal contrasting patterns of export relative to other regions of the globe."

InXYZhalf-Heusler (HH) compounds, complex interactions between constituent atoms, featuring both covalent and ionic characters, are supposed to affect mechanical and thermoelectric behavior. We use a data-driven approach based on first-principles calculations to identify promising HH compounds and explore the correlations between bonding-related features and functional properties. Our analysis suggests that enhancedY─Zbonding correlates with greater bulk modulus (B), larger Grüneisen parameter, and enhanced power factor. Tungsten-iron-lead stands out with excellentB= 162.4 gigapascals and a low lattice thermal conductivity of ~7.7 watts per meter per kelvin, leading to a figure of merit of ~0.52 (at 526 kelvin) without any nanostructuring, surpassing that of vanadium-iron-antimony by ~80.8%. These findings highlight how chemical bonding characteristics, interpreted from electronic structure and orbital-resolved bonding analysis, provide in-depth insights into the structure-to-property correlation to accelerate the screening out of potential thermoelectrics."

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) modulates the subcellular localization of host proteins to suppress immune activation, license viral gene expression, and achieve translational shutoff. To spatially resolve dynamic protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks during infection with an immunostimulatory HSV-1 strain, we integrated nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation with thermal proximity coaggregation analysis (N/C-TPCA). The resulting expanded depth and spatial resolution of PPIs charted compartment-specific assemblies of protein complexes throughout infection. We find that a broader suite of host chaperones than previously anticipated exhibits nuclear recruitment to form condensates known as virus-induced chaperone-enriched (VICE) domains. Monitoring protein and RNA constituents and ribosome activity, we establish that VICE domains sequester ribosome biogenesis factors from ribosomal RNA, accompanying a cell-wide defect in ribosome supply. These findings highlight infection-driven VICE domains as nodes of translational remodeling and demonstrate the utility of N/C-TPCA to study dynamic biological contexts."

However, achieving directional carrier dynamics in metals remains challenging due to strong carrier scattering within a multiband environment, typically expected for isotropic carrier relaxation. In this study, we demonstrate epitaxial RuO2/TiO2(110) heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy to engineer polarization selectivity of ultrafast light-matter interactions via anisotropic strain engineering. Combining spectroscopic ellipsometry, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we revealed the strong anisotropic transient optoelectronic response at an excitation energy of 1.58 eV in strain-engineered RuO2/TiO2(110) heterostructures along both in-plane [001] and [11¯0] crystallographic directions. Theoretical analysis identifies strain-induced modifications in band nesting as the underlying mechanism for enhanced anisotropic carrier relaxation observed at this excitation energy.

Soft wearable sensors offer a promising approach by continuously monitoring plant physiology. However, challenges remain in identifying direct physiological indicators of plant stresses, hindering the development of accurate diagnostic models for predicting symptom progression. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-powered spectral-dominant multimodal soft wearable system (MapS-Wear) for precise, long-term, and early-stage diagnosis of stresses in tomatoes. MapS-Wear continuously tracks leaf surrounding temperature, humidity, and unique in-situ transmission spectra, which are critical stress-related indicators. The machine learning framework processes these multimodal data to predict gradual stress progression and diagnose nutrient deficiencies in plants over 10 days earlier than conventional computer vision methods. Moreover, MapS-Wears enables portable and large-scale screening of grafted tomato varieties in greenhouses, accelerating the identification of compatible grafting combinations.

Dean,Metabolic regulation of visual acuity,"Photoreceptors signal ON and OFF pathways via a synapse with bipolar cells that are transmitted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) for luminance and contrast detection. Retinal neurons metabolize glucose whose transport is mediated by photoreceptor contact with the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Rod loss in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) reduces RPE contact, diminishing glucose transport. We show diminished glucose leads to light hyperresponsiveness driven by deregulated ON cone bipolar signaling. Transmission of this constitutive signal to RGCs causes ON > OFF signaling imbalance and failure to detect luminance and contrast changes. Our results suggest that the aspartate-malate shuttle in GABAergic amacrine cells metabolizes glucose to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which in turn regulates the ON cone bipolar signal. GABAAreceptor agonists such as Ativan are a widely prescribed first-line therapy for seizures initiated by low brain GABA, and we show that Ativan restores ON cone bipolar cell regulation in RP where retinal GABA is diminished, reestablishing luminance and contrast detection."

Developing an efficient scintillator that combines inorganic properties with flexibility is a desirable yet highly challenging goal. We pioneered an inorganic metafabric scintillator paradigm through self-sustained slip system engineering, transforming brittle all-inorganic scintillation materials into ductile textile architectures, yielding intrinsically conformally flexible scintillators that adhere seamlessly to complex, curved surfaces. The ultimate all-inorganic scintillator delivers near-unity quantum yield, with scintillation output more than 10 times higher than that of previous polymer matrix–based flexible scintillators. Using these metafabric scintillators, a multimodal x-ray interactive wearable platform (X-Wear) was developed, and their applications in body-centered flexible detection and imaging, mobile health, visual radiation monitoring, and breathable radiation shielding were successfully demonstrated. This work offers a previously undefined paradigm for a scintillator system design strategy that maintains the high performance of inorganic scintillators while adding the functionality of being conformally flexible and wearable of fabrics."

However, an in-depth understanding of mechanical strain, including residual strain in halide perovskites, remains incomplete, coupled with the critical challenge of decoupling strain effects from other interferences. Here, we examine the relaxation of residual tensile strain in three-dimensional (3D) halide perovskites through 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction formation. The 2D perovskite induces structural fragmentation in 3D perovskites, facilitating plastic relaxation of tensile strain. By isolating extrinsic crystalline phase interference and exciton-related optical disturbances, we observe that 3D perovskites retain high crystallinity only with moderate tensile strain relaxation. This moderate relaxation enhances optoelectronic properties in 3D perovskites, including broadened band-to-band absorption and prolonged charge carrier lifetime, markedly contributing to an increase in the maximum attainable power conversion efficiency in photovoltaic devices. Our findings outline conditions for strain relaxation that optimize optoelectronic properties, advancing strain engineering in halide perovskites."
