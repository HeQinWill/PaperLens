Ng,OH-Initiated Photooxidation of Gas-Phase Atmospherically Relevant Monoterpene-Derived Organic Nitrates,"Monoterpene-derived organic nitrates (MT-ONs) can influence NOx recycling, secondary organic aerosol, and ozone formation. While OH-initiated photooxidation is considered a sink for MT-ONs, the rate constants and mechanisms remain poorly constrained. We investigate the gas phase photooxidation of three synthetic ONs derived from α-pinene, β-pinene, and d-limonene (3°_ApHN, 1°_BpHN, and 2°_LmHN) through chamber experiments. The photooxidation rate constants for MT-ONs range from (5.7 ± 0.5) to (11.0 ± 1.5) × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, with corresponding lifetimes of 1.7–3.2 h under ambient OH concentrations. If we consider that products without a nitrooxy group (CHO) represent MT-ONs undergoing photooxidation to form NOx or nitric acid, our measurements suggest that up to 85%, 49%, and 23% of 3°_ApHN, 2°_LmHN, and 1°_BpHN, respectively, contribute to NOx recycling. The prevalence of CHO products is influenced by the molecular structure of MT-ONs and different peroxy radical chemistry. These results are different from prior studies that suggest that photooxidation leads to the complete degradation of MT-ONs into NOx or nitric acid. We propose photooxidation mechanisms, highlighting both OH addition and H abstraction as important processes. This study provides fundamental data to evaluate the contributions of MT-ON photooxidation to NOx recycling and offers new insights into the broader implications of ON chemistry in the atmosphere."

While water-lean and biphasic solvents have been developed to lower energy consumption and control capture costs, however, their high organic content introduces new challenges, such as amine loss and solvent component imbalance. Herein, an innovative and feasible integrated solution─water scrubbing coupled with reverse osmosis (WS-RO)─was proposed, based on the synergistic regulation of multiphase mass transfer and separation in the complex CO2 capture process. The pilot-scale experiments confirmed the inverse effect of solvent concentration on the reduction of energy consumption and the inhibition of amine escape: while energy consumption could be reduced to 2.47 GJ/t CO2, the total amine emissions were up to 216 mg/m3. The multistage water washing was well validated in controlling amine escape, including aerosols and gaseous amines. Coupling with efficient washing liquid separation by reverse osmosis, amine escape could be reduced to below 1.5 mg/m3, with approximately 99% of the amine components returning to the system, ensuring material balance. This study offers a viable strategy to simultaneously address energy consumption and amine loss in novel concentrated solvents, facilitating their industrial deployment."

In this study, 12 solutions─including four hand-held OGI cameras, hand-held NextGen solutions, and mobile solutions (automobile- and drone-based)─were evaluated using a single-blind controlled testing protocol at an outdoor facility designed to simulate emissions from a simplified onshore North American oil and gas production facility. Three solutions were retested 3 to 12 months after the initial assessment using the same protocol and facility to evaluate how performance changed over time. Results indicated that hand-held OGI cameras generally achieved better emission source localization accuracy as well as lower 90% probability of detection and false positive fraction compared to other solution categories. The false negative fractions of OGI cameras were comparable to those of hand-held NextGen solutions but generally lower than those of mobile solutions, which exhibited shorter survey durations relative to other categories of hand-held solutions. The performance of two of  three solutions improved with repeat testing, highlighting the potential benefit of regular, comprehensive testing for the development of solutions. Overall, the study findings suggest that while several emerging survey solutions showed promising detection and localization capabilities, hand-held OGI cameras demonstrated higher efficacy in identifying and accurately localizing small emission sources."

We introduce a two-tiered mobile measurement approach, using a mobile laboratory to measure methane concentrations across 125 well pads (approximately 750 wells) distributed among four major production blocks (Changning, Weiyuan, Fuling, and Luzhou). These blocks contributed 84% of China’s total shale gas production in 2023, providing the first comprehensive ground-level measurements. Stationary downwind monitoring of well pads revealed emission rates from 0.002 to 98.86 kg/h, validated through mobile observations of methane concentrations across the region. Notably, emissions were highly concentrated, with 89% originating from just 10% of the well pads. For 2023, the extrapolated methane emissions from China’s shale gas production were estimated  at 16,842 t (6,444–29,991 t, 95% CI), corresponding to a  methane leakage rate of 0.10% (0.04%–0.17%, 95% CI). This rate is lower than major U.S. fields and similar to that of U.S. dry gas fields. Our research identifies gas lift venting, incomplete combustion from compressors, and process venting as significant sources of super-emissions in China’s shale gas upstream production chain. The methodology employed, based on comprehensive and targeted field measurements, demonstrates its effectiveness in providing a scientific basis for formulating precise and effective regulatory policies on methane emissions."

Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we systematically evaluated the neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and molecular effects of 6PPD at environmentally relevant (5 μg/L) and sublethal (300 μg/L) concentrations. 6PPD exposure caused developmental abnormalities, including microphthalmia, exophthalmos, cardiac malformations, and hypopigmentation. Notably, benchmark dose (BMD) modeling identified the eye as a sensitive target, with microphthalmia likely impairing retinal development, photoreception, and circadian regulation. 6PPD increased neuronal apoptosis; impaired central nervous system and lateral line development; and, at high doses, reduced vitality, rhythmicity, and responsiveness. Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), a synaptic receptor enhancing glutamatergic and suppressing GABAergic signaling, was identified as a potential target mediating neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperactivity at low doses. Consistently, behavioral tests confirmed a biphasic hormetic response: hyperactivity at low doses and hypoactivity at high doses. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and xenograft tumor assays revealed a close association between 6PPD exposure and gliomagenesis, suggesting its potential risk of inducing glioma. Overall, these findings provide the first integrated phenotypic, behavioral, and molecular evidence of 6PPD-induced neurotoxicity and highlight CRHR1-mediated hormetic responses as critical considerations for risk assessment."

Gore;April Z. Gu,Discovering Polyphosphate and Polyhydroxyalkanoate-Accumulating Organisms Across Ecosystems: Phenotype-Targeted Genotyping via FACS-Sequencing,"Intracellular biopolymers serve versatile functions, allowing microbes to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. The metabolic interdependence of dual biopolymers polyphosphate (polyP) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a defining feature of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), the key agents enabling enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). Beyond EBPR, PAOs accumulating both polyP and PHA (PHA–PAOs) in natural environments remain unexplored due to limited detection tools, despite hypothesized roles in nutrient cycling. This study presents a novel phenotype-targeted approach integrating triple-stained fluorescence-activated cell sorting with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (TriFlow-Seq) to detect, quantify, and phylogenetically characterize PHA–PAOs, validated by fluorescence imaging and single-cell Raman spectroscopy. TriFlow-Seq of EBPR samples confirmed known PAOs, including Candidatus Phosphoribacter, Tetrasphaera, and Ca. Accumulibacter, and revealed new candidate PHA–PAOs within the Rhodobacteraceae family. In maize rhizosphere, TriFlow-Seq led to the discovery of diverse PHA–PAOs, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, and Nannocystis. These genera participate in plant-growth-promoting functions including phosphate solubilization and phytohormone production, yet their simultaneous polyP and PHA accumulation has never been reported. Our findings revealed high PHA–PAO prevalence and distinct phylogenetic patterns associated with different maize genotypes, suggesting an overlooked role of biopolymer costorage in rhizosphere dynamics. This study establishes a pioneering approach to investigating PHA–PAO identities and roles across ecosystems."

Evidence-Based Insights for Environmental Protection,"A substantial body of evidence exists demonstrating that exposure to environmental contaminants can alter animal behavior. Moreover, methodological and technological advancements, as well as increasing standardization, mean that behavioral ecotoxicity studies are more rigorous and reliable than ever before. Despite this, behavioral data are still seldom used in the risk assessment and regulation of chemicals. This is partly due to a lack of clarity among some stakeholders about whether changes in behavior at the individual level result in population-level outcomes. To address this, we first consider the state of evidence within the field of behavioral ecotoxicology linking individual-level behavioral alterations with population-level consequences. We then assess the evidence from behavioral ecology and other neighboring fields that supports this link. Further, we evaluate whether some behavioral endpoints are more easily tied to population-level changes than others. In this regard, we propose combining insights from two complementary ecological frameworks─the functional trait framework and the limiting traits framework─to evaluate which behaviors should be prioritized in ecotoxicological research and regulatory efforts. We contend that the link between behavioral changes and population-level outcomes is evident, with behavioral endpoints representing a highly valuable yet so far underutilized line of evidence in applied environmental protection."

We examined potential FPV interactions with avian biodiversity, using previously modeled technical potential of FPV in the northeastern United States. We developed a vulnerability index based on avian species’: (i) morphological traits, (ii) level of conservation concern, and (iii) habitat requirements. Using eBird participatory science data, we assessed the risk of FPV to 291 species of birds occurring at FPV-suitable waterbodies based on their vulnerability index and estimated relative abundance at each location. The greatest risk of FPVs to birds was associated with waterbodies near the Atlantic coast and Great Lakes, and most (80%) of these high-risk waterbodies were smaller waterbodies. Because the avian risk at FPV-suitable waterbodies was not correlated with estimated energy generation, reducing risk to birds might not require energy trade-offs. Moreover, avoiding FPV installations at waterbodies predicted to pose high risk to birds is likely to return social and recreational benefits while minimizing risk of biofouling. Our analysis provides a framework for proactively evaluating risk, reducing potential adverse impacts of FPV to birds, and identifying cobenefits of sustainable FPV siting across waterscapes."

This study investigated the temporal variations and spatial patterns of legacy and emerging PFAS in soil of Shanghai, China, by analyzing 162 soil samples collected in 2007, 2012, and 2017. The results revealed that sum PFAS concentrations ranged from 110 to 18000 pg/g, with an upward trend over the decade (median levels: 1090, 1190, and 2390 pg/g in 2007, 2012, and 2017, respectively). Long-chain PFAS dominated the contaminant profile with perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (1370–2090 pg/g) consistently exceeding perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (145–466 pg/g). For soil samples collected in 2017, a significant amount of F-53B was noted (median: 148 pg/g) as compared to PFOS (median: 95.7 pg/g) and PFOA (median: 1250 pg/g), highlighting the importance of measuring this compound in the Chinese environment. Spatially, PFAS contamination expanded over time, with the pollution center shifting from urban Shanghai to the southwest, forming a new hotspot in that sector. However, no significant correlation was observed between the PFAS distribution and land use. A mass balance analysis indicated that unidentified organofluorine constituted a substantial proportion of extractable organofluorine (90.1, 92.7, and 88.2% in 2007 (target PFAS 11), 2012 (target PFAS 11), and 2017 (target PFAS 20), respectively), highlighting significant gaps in current contaminant identification. These findings provide critical insights into the long-term dynamics of PFAS in a soil environment and underscore the need for future research to prioritize the characterization of unknown fluorine compounds in environmental monitoring."

Conjugated nitrogen species (e.g., graphitic, pyridinic Ns) are well-known for enhancing the catalytic activity of carbon materials. However, the mechanistic role of nonconjugated nitrogen species (e.g., amine, amide) in persulfate activation remains unexplored due to their thermal instability during pyrolysis. In this study, we synthesized three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels (NGAs) enriched with nonconjugated nitrogen via hydrothermal assembly and systematically compared them with their pyrolytic counterparts. Hydrothermal NGAs exhibit abundant edge-located nonconjugated nitrogen species, which enhance surface hydrophilicity and accelerate mass transport to promote efficient nonradical activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) through outer-sphere electron-transfer process (ETP). Upon pyrolysis, these nonconjugated functionalities are transformed into conjugated nitrogen embedded within the carbon lattice, improving conductivity and creating electron-rich domains that favor peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation via inner-sphere ETP. Techno-environmental-economic assessment further demonstrated that the hydrothermal NGA/PDS system is significantly more cost-effective, requiring one-eighth the synthesis energy and only one-third the oxidant cost of PMS-based systems. This work highlights the underappreciated role of nonconjugated nitrogen in PS-AOPs and offers new insights to carbon catalysts for wastewater treatment."

Phage replication requires maintaining infectivity and finding the right host. Yet, there are limited data on phage persistence and transport in soil under field conditions. The potential presence of hosts enabling phage replication impedes the assessment of the mobility of autochthonous phages in soils. In lysimeters installed in forest and pasture topsoil, we elucidated the transport of the tailed marine Pseudoalteromonas phage HS2 in comparison to deuterium. Transport of infectious phages as well as numbers of tracer phage genomes and tracer capsid-bound genomes were quantified to account for phage retention and inactivation. Phages were transported up to 4 times faster than the simultaneously applied deuterium tracer, which was attributed to pore size exclusion. Retention in immobile regions and remobilization during precipitation caused pronounced tailing in tracer breakthroughs. High phage survival in pasture soil resulted in mass recoveries of infectious phages that were up to 6 times higher than those in forest soil. However, long-term observations showed that the infectivity was also preserved in forest soil, enabling event-driven remobilization. This remobilization underscores the importance of distinguishing between phage retention and inactivation, which is crucial for accurately predicting phage transport dynamics and their ecological impact in terrestrial environments."

Observations in nonarid areas suggested significant influences from aqueous-phase oxidation on FAA compositions and abundances. However, the origins and processing of aerosol PrM in arid and dusty areas remain poorly understood. The characterizations of CAAs and FAAs in PM2.5 and dust from leaf surfaces, roads, and buildings were investigated throughout the cold seasons in arid Lanzhou (northwest China). Leucine dominated CAAs in both PM2.5 and dust samples. This finding, combined with evidence from amino acid nitrogen isotope signal and Mantel test analysis, strongly suggests that soil (/dust) is the main contributor (up to 38%) to total aerosol amino acids in Lanzhou, followed by vegetation and biomass burning. Glycine dominated aerosol FAAs during winter (relative humidity = 50 ± 14%) and correlated significantly with atmospheric oxidation levels, while these patterns were absent during the drier spring with higher atmospheric oxidation capacity. We propose that low relative humidity (33 ± 15%), rather than weak aerosol acidity (pH = 8.1 ± 1.0), constrains PrM degradation during spring, leading to a significant reduction in free glycine mass fraction. This study presents the first observational evidence for constrained PrM degradation under dry conditions."

McIntyre,Climate-Associated Oxythermal Squeezes Elevate Mercury in a Lacustrine Food Fish,"Climate change is heating surface waters while deoxygenating bottom waters of lakes, compressing vertical habitat for cold-water fish. Resulting increases in the volume of water lacking dissolved oxygen (anoxia) could facilitate the formation of toxic, bioaccumulating methylmercury (MeHg). Oxythermal squeezes, where thermally stressful surface water pushes cold-water fish species against or into low-oxygen deep water, could enhance mercury bioaccumulation. Here, we test this hypothesis using high-resolution oxygen data and brook trout muscle mercury data for 16 neighboring lakes (Adirondack Park, New York, USA) collected in the fall of two consecutive years. In four anoxic lakes that underwent oxythermal squeezes in both years, muscle mercury concentrations were consistently elevated (0.40 μg/g mean (0.08 μg/g SD) length-adjusted wet weight concentration), and averaged more than double the levels in well-oxygenated lakes. Importantly, lakes with substantial anoxic zones yet no oxythermal habitat compression showed intermediate concentrations, indicating that forcing fish to reside next to oxygen-depleted water plays a key role in boosting their methylmercury exposure. Climate change is pushing many lakes toward such oxythermal habitat squeezes; hence, our findings suggest that higher fish mercury contamination is to be expected, even when external loading of mercury to aquatic ecosystems is stable or declining."

In this study, amides and alcohols were identified as the most permeable substances, exhibiting permeation rates 30 to 90 times higher than those of inorganic ions and carboxylic acids. Systematic molecular parameter analysis revealed that molecular polarity, alongside van der Waals volume, determines transport behavior. By incorporating the molecular polarity index into the solution-friction model, it successfully explained transport differences between compounds of similar size but different functional groups. Theoretical calculations revealed the transport mechanism for charge-neutral organics: highly polar organic molecules preferentially partition at the membrane interface through hydrogen bonding, and are subsequently transported across the membrane channels via water clusters. A predictive model was developed, achieving >85% accuracy for diverse charge-neutral organics under environmentally relevant concentrations (μg·L–1). These findings advance the mechanistic understanding beyond size exclusion effects for RO and guide membrane design optimization for enhanced organic rejection."

Here, authors present a machine learning framework that resolves this mismatch, enabling the rational design of durable and stretchable zinc-ion batteries. 
 Aqueous zinc-ion batteries offer inherent safety and low cost, yet performance is limited by unstable zinc metal negative electrodes and dissolution-prone positive electrodes, causing dendrite growth, sluggish ion transport, and rapid capacity decay. Replacing both electrodes with intercalation hosts provides a solution, but progress is slowed by the lack of a universal principle for selecting kinetically compatible pairs. Most existing efforts optimize single components rather than addressing the electrodes’ kinetic mismatch governing full-cell stability. Here we show a machine-learning-assisted kinetic-matching framework that quantitatively evaluates ion-transport compatibility in intercalation-type zinc-ion batteries electrodes. By correlating interlayer spacing with Zn2+ diffusion behavior, the model introduces two descriptors predicting synchronized ion flux for rational electrode pairing. Using this framework, an optimized Zn3V3O8 | |NH4V4O10 system achieves a specific capacity of 310 mAh g-1 and retains over 12,000 cycles at 5 A g-1. The strategy further extends to deformable formats through conductive hydrogel architectures, enabling omnidirectionally stretchable, all-hydrogel zinc-ion batteries with an areal capacity of 1.2 mAh cm-2 and an energy density of 1070 μWh cm-2.

 Oral antibiotics are a mainstay for treating bacterial infections, but unabsorbed portions can reach the caecum and colon, leading to gut dysbiosis. Herein, we engineer a biohybrid delivery system through the integration of milk extracellular vesicles with liposomes. The hybrid vesicles employ targeting mechanisms via neonatal Fc receptor and peptide transporter 1, facilitating antibiotic transport across the proximal small intestine. These vesicles exhibit superior drug encapsulation efficiency, stable release behavior, efficient mucus traversal, higher endocytosis, increased basolateral exocytosis, and improved oral absorption, achieving a 3.24-fold increase in oral bioavailability compared to free antibiotics. In lung bacterial infections and bacteremia models, hybrid vesicle-encapsulated cefdinir outperforms free antibiotics in eliminating infections. Notably, this approach also mitigates adverse effects on the intestinal microbiota, safeguarding the animals from dysbiosis-associated metabolic syndromes and opportunistic pathogen infections. This innovative hybrid vesicle system holds promise for the oral delivery of other drugs that suffer from limited absorption or cause gut dysbiosis. In this work, authors present a biohybrid delivery system aimed at overcoming low oral bioavailability and antibiotic-induced dysbiosis by enabling efficient antibiotic transport in the proximal small intestine."

Here, the authors achieve a high piezoionic flex-sensitivity by tuning hydrogel-ion interactions, and decoupling of multi-degree-of-freedom bending via a square prism-shaped fiber structure. 
 Accurate body motion capture is of great significance for biomechanical assessment and immersive virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems. Piezoionic flex-sensors, which mimic the ionic transport sensing mechanism of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, promises a self-powered approach for wearable body movements detection. However, their practical utility has been limited by low piezoionic flex-sensitivity (typically below 0.5 mV/degree) and unidirectional bending response, which restricts their ability to resolve complex multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-Dof) body motions. Here we report a soft, piezoionic and multi-Dof (SPIM) flex-sensor that overcomes these limitations. It ingeniously integrates zwitterionic dipole-ion interactions and size-induced steric hindrance effects to enable fast ion channels formation and amplified cation/anion transport imbalance, thus cooperatively contributing to a record-high piezoionic flex-sensitivity of 3.2 mV/degree. Theoretical simulations combining poroelastic mechanics and Poisson-Nernst-Planck model corroborated the synergistic enhancement. Furthermore, a unique architecture of square prism-shaped fiber with two pairs of symmetric nanomesh electrodes allows the SPIM flex-sensor to decouple multi-Dof joint flexion to distinguish complex body movements. We demonstrate a SPIM flex-sensor platform for metaverse applications, including a digital-twin of free-pose hand motions and complex yet intuitive VR control via single-joint dexterity equipped with a single compact sensor device.

 α-Synuclein (α-syn) fibrils accumulate in Parkinson’s disease, spreading between cells to template misfolding and drive neurodegeneration. α-Syn fibril entry into healthy neurons is a key step. Here, we comprehensively assessed the membrane proteome for α-syn fibril binding. We identified mGluR4 and NPDC1 as nigral surface proteins binding and internalizing α-syn fibrils. While striatal α-syn fibril injection led to nigral dopamine neuron loss in wild type mice, deletion of either Grm4 or Npdc1 provided protection of dopamine neurons. We observed mGluR4 and Npdc1 to form a complex regulating mGluR4 function. Cultured neurons lacking both Grm4 and Npdc1 fail to bind α-syn fibrils, to accumulate phosphorylated α-syn and to lose synapses. Transheterozygous Grm4, Npdc1 mice showed protection of nigral neurons from α-syn fibrils, demonstrating genetic interaction. For transgenic α-syn A53T mice, double Grm4, Npdc1 heterozygosity increased mouse survival, motor function and spinal motoneuron number. Thus, a cell surface mGluR4–NPDC1 complex participates in α-syn neurodegeneration. How α-synuclein interacts with the neuronal cell surface to contribute to disease pathology is not fully understood.

Here the authors show that calcium channel blocker use increases AAD risk, worsens disease progression in models and patients, and may impair post-repair outcomes, warranting caution in at-risk hypertension. 
 Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) are life-threatening conditions without effective medications. Impaired contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is strongly linked to AAD, but the role of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which directly inhibits VSMC contractility, in AAD remains unclear. Here we showed data from 501,878 initially AAD-free participants in UK Biobank. Over a median follow-up of 13.5 years, CCB users had higher AAD risk (HR = 1.31) than hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive treatment. In mouse models of AAD, CCBs significantly aggravated aortic stiffness and AAD development. For patients with type B aortic dissection who underwent endovascular repair, CCBs limited AAD regression compared with other antihypertensives. Moreover, silencing of protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (PRKG1) significantly mitigated CCB-aggravated AAD progression. These findings suggest that CCBs may increase AAD risk and post-stent surgery prognosis, highlighting the need for caution when prescribing CCBs to hypertensive patients at risk for AAD.

 Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting, while charge-density waves show broadband noise and AC-DC interference once their phase is depinned. We identify an analogous phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley-coherent (IVC) state frequently observed in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. We show that a static magnetic field drives an oscillating intervalley current, which produces an oscillating orbital magnetization and thereby a detectable AC Hall response. This mechanism is similar to the Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current is the AC Josephson current. We provide microscopic calculations of all the phase-number free-energy parameters in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, establishing this effect as an experimental signature of IVC order.

Here, the authors report polymer particles that change shape with polarised light, and therefore create flow patterns with unusual paths. 
 Colloidal particles at liquid interfaces experience long-ranged capillary interactions, whose magnitude and directionality depend on the particle shapes. When particle shapes are determined by fabrication or synthesis, the resulting shape-mediated interactions are predefined and often lead to the formation of persistent interfacial structures. Here, we introduce polymer particles at water-air interfaces whose shape and, therefore, interactions can be altered by illumination with polarized light. Specifically, we selectively trigger capillary self-assembly by anisotropically deforming the particles at the interface. Intriguingly, further deformation of already assembled particles induces sustained interfacial flows with velocities of up to 90 μm/s. Benefitting from polarization-defined deformation directions, we create flow-patterns that do not simply follow the illumination intensity pattern, such as shear flows along a single rectangular illumination stripe. We anticipate that this interplay between photo-deformation and capillary interactions of particles will enable various forms of mixing, manipulation, and assembly of soft matter at liquid interfaces. Colloidal particles experience capillary interactions at liquid interfaces, but modifying these interactions is challenging as shape change is required.

This study finds divergent behaviour in migration rates for rivers in discontinuous versus continuous permafrost, driven by changes in permafrost thaw and river ice. 
 Arctic rivers mobilize vast stocks of permafrost carbon as they migrate across floodplains. However, there is no consensus about whether Arctic rivers are responding to regional warming by speeding up or slowing down. Here we reconstruct migration rates over the period 1972–2020 for Arctic and sub-Arctic rivers spanning approximately 1,500 km of distance and a variety of channel sizes and floodplain environments. We find that rivers in warmer, discontinuous permafrost settings experienced a systematic acceleration over the past 50 years, whereas rivers in colder, continuous permafrost regions experienced a systematic slowdown. We identify two competing mechanisms responsible for this bifurcating behaviour: thaw of permafrost floodplains has driven faster migration, whereas a decline in the intensity of river-ice breakup has slowed migration. Using a mechanistic model, we find that the relative balance of these two controls is well described by air temperature, revealing a simple organizing framework for how Arctic rivers respond to warming. Whether rivers are speeding up or slowing down in a warming Arctic is unclear, but has implications for carbon cycling and infrastructure.

 The global transition to low-carbon energy depends on energy transition minerals (ETMs). Yet, the extraction of these minerals often occurs in biodiverse and carbon-rich forests, potentially undermining their climate benefits. Here we provide global, causally identified estimates of deforestation and related GHG emissions attributable to ETM mining, combining nearly 3,000 projects with satellite-based forest-change data. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that ETM mining causes sustained forest loss—averaging ~20% within 10-km buffers over 15 years—comparable in magnitude to traditional minerals such as coal and gold. These losses are disproportionately concentrated in tropical forests with high climate mitigation potential. Incorporating deforestation-related emissions increases the mining-stage carbon footprint of ETMs by 63% on average and up to 98% for certain minerals. Our findings reveal mining-induced land-use change as a major but overlooked source of emissions in global energy transition.

In Australia’s Macquarie basin, environmentally minded management can ensure agricultural needs are met without sacrificing environmental outcomes. 
 Freshwater resources need to simultaneously support environmental and agricultural outcomes; this is a critical challenge under climate change. Many environmental and agricultural outcomes have contrasting requirements for water, leading to difficult trade-offs which should be supported by integrated assessments. Here we analysed the effect of climate change and climate variability on key ecological values and agricultural economic activity simultaneously in the Macquarie catchment in Australia and assessed the effect of plausible management adaptation options. Under severe climate change, ecological outcomes were rarely met while the impact on agricultural outcomes was less severe; annual cropping reliant on insecure water allocations was most vulnerable. Under moderate climate change, altering flow delivery patterns was as effective as altering the total licence volume of environmental water. Neither change adversely affected agricultural benefits. Thus, environmental water management can potentially influence environmental outcomes, while continuing to meet the needs of core agricultural activities. Demand for agricultural water resources under climate change may come into conflict with achieving positive environmental outcomes. In Australia’s Macquarie basin, environmentally minded management can ensure agricultural needs are met without sacrificing environmental outcomes."

 The bimodal distribution of tropical cyclone (TC) lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) has strengthened in recent decades, yet the mechanisms underlying this distribution and its recent changes remain debated. Here, we introduce a rate-duration framework that decomposes LMI into two fundamental components: mean intensification rate and intensification duration. Using global observations, we show that intensification duration is closely tied to genesis locations, and has decreased by 1.4 h per decade (3.4%) during 1982–2023, primarily due to poleward and landward shifts in genesis. This shortening suppresses TC intensification, offsetting nearly half (48.7%) of the rate-induced increase in strong TCs. High-resolution climate models corroborate these findings, revealing that future warming further shortens intensification duration, partially counteracting the increase of LMI. Our results highlight the importance of timescale constraint on TC intensity, providing a quantitative attribution of the competing roles of rate versus duration in shaping LMI and its response to warming."

 Understanding the high mercury concentrations observed in Arctic ecosystems requires in-depth knowledge of mercury cycling. Here, we show that variations in mercury concentration in the sediments of the North American Arctic Margin and the Arctic Ocean basins can be explained by carbon sources and cycling. Sedimentary mercury concentrations are predicted (p < 0.001) considering three carbon sources and, in some areas, the recapture of soluble mercury released during burial. Terrigenous organic carbon dominates mercury delivery (50-90%) in the western North American Arctic Margin, whereas inorganic carbon predominates at many eastern sites (40-70%). Marine organic carbon contributes <15% of the total mercury concentration. Mercury–organic carbon endmember ratios of terrigenous and marine organic carbon are higher in deep Arctic Ocean basins than in the continental margin, likely due to greater organic matter remineralization during transit. The observed enrichment in mercury toward the sediment surface results from remineralization of organic carbon, not from an increase in mercury flux. Mercury concentrations in sediments of the North American Arctic Margin and the Arctic Ocean basins can be entirely explained by carbon sources and cycling, according to analysis of sediment cores from the polar ocean."

 Meeting the growing demand for maize while reducing nitrogen losses remains a key challenge for sustainable agriculture. Here, we present a market-based nitrogen insurance concept that allows farmers who apply excess fertilizer to reduce nitrogen use without financial risk. Using a large-scale process-based crop model dataset covering 4270 maize fields in Illinois, over 30 years of weather data, and 33 fertilizer rates, we found that the insurance is profitable for farmers applying at least 40 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare above recommended rates, yielding average annual gains of 14 dollars per hectare for farmers and 10 dollars per hectare for insurers. Applied across the eligible Illinois maize area, the insurance annually reduces nitrate leaching by 31% and lowers greenhouse gas emissions by 682,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This self-sustaining approach could be extended to other nitrogen-intensive crops and regions, providing a globally relevant pathway to reconcile farm profitability with environmental stewardship.

 Accurate tree volume and structure are crucial for forest biomass estimation and ecosystem investigations. While terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers non-destructive pathways for the detailed three-dimensional tree reconstruction, current methods overestimate small branch volumes and often require tree segmentation and leaf–wood separation as a priori. This study introduces and validates RayExtract, a novel method for reconstructing woody volume from TLS data, utilising tools from the RayCloudTools library, to automate the extraction of tree structural metrics from point clouds. Our method incorporates two key morphological rules — Self-Similarity and Leonardo’s Rule — to aid branch radius and taper calculations. Likewise, it enables rapid and automated plot-scale reconstruction by integrating tree segmentation and woody structure modelling without requiring leaf point classification. In this study, RayExtract demonstrated high accuracy across four high-quality destructive harvest reference sets with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) values ranging from 0.82 to 0.97 (n=124). To explore algorithm behaviours under different leaf conditions and point densities, we implement a framework using TLS simulation of highly realistic synthetic trees. Results from the simulation framework show consistent high accuracy of total woody volume, with CCC ranging from 0.97 to 0.98 (n=18) across four distinct scanning configurations. Fine-scale volumetric analysis revealed that incorporating simple morphological rules can effectively inform branch taper and reduce woody volume overestimation, particularly in smaller components. Furthermore, it identifies a limitation in volumetric accuracy in trees exhibiting significant taper in the lower stem. Analysis of RayExtract’s computational efficiency demonstrates that runtime and memory usage scale predictably with input data size, primarily driven by point count and the associated structural complexity within the point cloud, positioning the algorithm as well suited for large-scale applications.

 The Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) onboard Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) features three unique channels with a broader spectral range compared to previous thermal infrared multi-channel sensors. The split-window (SW) and temperature-and-emissivity separation (TES) algorithms are suitable for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from TIS data. However, both SW and TES require auxiliary information, and the temporal and spatial inconsistency of auxiliary information can lead to errors in LST retrieval. We propose a wide-band atmospheric correction TES algorithm, which can retrieve LST without any auxiliary atmospheric and land surface parameter input. By leveraging the stability of wide-band imaging, atmospheric transmittance and upward radiation are modeled, thereby reducing the number of unknowns in the radiative transfer equation. Additionally, a transmittance ratio refinement module is incorporated, which iteratively refines the transmittance. Experiments conducted on simulated datasets demonstrate that this method achieves an RMSE of 1.32 K, remaining stable at 1.39 K with estimated transmittance, indicating strong robustness to variations in water vapor content. Cross-validation results for the Wuhan region show a bias of −1.79 K and an RMSE of 2.28 K when compared to MODIS temperature products, suggesting that the retrieved LST captures more detailed information. Furthermore, a comparison with the general split-window (GSW) algorithm and MODTRAN-TES was conducted, selecting 108 validation points at Heihe, SURFRAD, ICOS, TERN, and BSRN stations for ground validation, yielding root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.07 K, 1.55 K, 1.84 K, 1.72 K, and 2.14 K respectively, with an RMSE of 1.95 K across all validation sites. These results represent improvements of 0.25 K and 0.55 K over GSW and MODTRAN-TES, respectively, confirming the high accuracy of the proposed method."

 Forests are a critical component of the Earth system, accounting for approximately one-third of global photosynthetic activity and carbon storage. They also provide essential habitats for countless species and vital resources for human activities. Low-frequency (L-band; 1–2 GHz) microwave radiometry enables the measurement of forest soil moisture (SM) and L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD), offering valuable insights into processes such as tree growth, water infiltration, soil fertility, fuel moisture, carbon stocks, wildfire vulnerability, and biodiversity dynamics. These measurements also support the study of carbon and water fluxes, tree responses to hydrological stress (e.g., drought), and fuel moisture estimation. However, existing algorithms for retrieving SM and L-VOD were primarily developed for low-biomass vegetation types (e.g., grasslands and croplands), differing structurally from forests. This motivates the present review to evaluate the current retrieval approaches, their performance assessment methods, and available validation resources. The review found that systematic uncertainties persist in forest retrievals, despite the demonstrated sensitivity of L-band brightness temperature (TB) to forest SM and L-VOD. Moreover, the focus on non-forest ecosystems has led to a lack of suitable ground truth and reference data for validating forest SM and L-VOD products, and current validation techniques remain underdeveloped. To fully harness the potential of L-band radiometry in forest monitoring, new retrieval algorithms that account for the unique structural and compositional characteristics of forests are required. Additionally, validation efforts must be enhanced both quantitatively and qualitatively—particularly for L-VOD—to improve confidence in these remote sensing products."

 Surface reflectance, a fundamental parameter for deriving high-level satellite products, is typically obtained through atmospheric correction. However, in rugged terrains, topographic effects substantially distort surface reflectance estimates. Many post-topographic correction methods for surface reflectance were proposed and applied to mitigate topographic effects. However, the coupled atmospheric and topographic influences in radiative transfer processes cause significant errors when these corrections are performed separately. For example, we observed over 50 % of pixels in the official Landsat 8 surface reflectance data across a complex terrain exhibited physically implausible negative values, predominantly in shadowed areas. Moreover, traditional pixel-by-pixel methods failed to leverage valuable spatial information for estimation. To address these limitations, we developed an integrated atmospheric and topographic correction framework, Unet-TopoFlat, leveraging a spatial-spectral Attention U-Net algorithm and a novel pseudo-topographic synthetic strategy. The pseudo-topographic synthetic strategy generated sufficient and robust topographically incorporated TOA radiance samples across different terrains, surfaces, and atmospheric conditions, using surface reflectance over flat terrains based on radiative transfer models, atmospheric parameters, random forest regression, and a mountainous radiative transfer parameterization scheme. Using Landsat 8 data as a proxy for evaluation, the Unet-TopoFlat was trained on 47,398 samples (256 × 256 pixels), leveraging multiple datasets. The Unet-TopoFlat model effectively captured the spatial and spectral relationships between TOA radiance and surface reflectance, achieving a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 4.5 %–6.2 % across 20,314 samples spanning different terrain, temporal, and spectral bands. Compared to the baseline Unet-FLAT model, which lacked topographic consideration and exhibited substantial uncertainties, Unet-TopoFlat effectively reduced topographic effects, lowering negative reflectance ratios from 55.5 % to 2.8 % while accurately recovering surface information and preserving spectral information. Moreover, the leaf area index (LAI) and snow cover mapping using our estimated surface reflectance were superior to those using official products, and deviations reached up to 2.4 for LAI and 8 % for snow cover mapping at the regional scale. Our proposed framework is not sensor-specific and can be potentially applied to multiple optical remotely sensed data."

 Ocean lidar technology, an emerging active remote sensing method, excels at revealing the vertical structure of subsurface ocean layers, addressing challenges in carbon flux, phytoplankton analysis, and biogeochemical monitoring. Current lidar inversion methods, however, rely on empirical formulations for homogeneous waters and overlook photon multiple scattering, which introduces significant uncertainties, especially in complex coastal ecosystems. To overcome this, we present an iterative hybrid multiple scattering-corrected retrieval method based on 117,456 vertical profiles (2017–2024) in the South China Sea. The model combines the optimization of backscatter–attenuation ratios, lidar ratios, and semianalytical simulations of multiple scattering effects integrated with XGBoost machine learning to relate lidar-derived optical properties (Kd, bbp) to biogeochemical parameters (Chl, POC). Compared with the satellite ocean color products, the retrieval results derived from airborne and shipborne lidar observations show strong agreement: Kd (R = 0.76, RMSD = 0.01 m−1, MAPD = 6.58 %), bbp (R = 0.80, RMSD = 0.00 m−1, MAPD = 28.93 %), Chl (R = 0.61, RMSD = 0.29 μg/L, MAPD = 32.82 %), and POC (R = 0.88, RMSD = 20.55 μg/L, MAPD = 18.14 %). These results bridge active and passive remote sensing. This study also reveals the dynamic three-dimensional characteristics of the subsurface phytoplankton layer in the South China Sea, revealing spatial and temporal heterogeneity influenced by environment factors. The nearshore subsurface phytoplankton layer shows diurnal variations in thickness and intensity driven by tidal processes: it thickens and ascends during the day and thins and descends at night. Larger tidal amplitudes are linked to shallower layers and higher chlorophyll-a concentrations. These findings demonstrate the potential of lidar technology for large-scale, long-term monitoring of subsurface ocean profiles, offering an important complement to in situ and passive satellite remote sensing data."

 The occurrence of landslides can potentially cause considerable economic impact on a global scale, resulting in damage to exposed structures and infrastructures, including buildings. In order to determine the most efficacious risk mitigation strategies, the scientific community is engaged in the analyses aimed at assessing the expected consequences of landslide activation/reactivation. This approach involves the implementation of quantitative risk assessment procedures, based on the definition of the landslide susceptibility and intensity, the identification of exposed elements, and the vulnerability assessment, which represents the most challenging parameter. The present work proposes an approach to the quantitative vulnerability assessment for buildings exposed to slow-kinematic landslides via empirical fragility and vulnerability curves, which express the probabilistic relationship between the damage severity to exposed buildings and the intensity of the landslide. A comprehensive database was compiled, collating information on landslide-induced damage to over four thousand buildings in the Northern Apennines of Central Italy. The landslide intensity is evaluated by exploiting the worldwide freely accessible Sentinel-1 SAR images, which have been processed by using the Parallel-Small BAseline (P-SBAS) – Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) processing chain. The Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA) of the National Research Council (CNR) of Italy is responsible for the processing of the Sentinel-1 SAR images, within the framework of an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (MASE) for the detection and analysis of ground displacement over the entire Italian territory. The ultimate objective of the present study is the exploitation of the derived vulnerability curve into the quantitative risk assessment procedure for a comprehensive evaluation of buildings in the Northern Apennines."

 As a key biophysical parameter describing forest vegetation structure, Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential and widely used indicator for evaluating forest ecosystem function and health. LAI retrieval from remote sensing observations primarily relies on canopy radiative transfer models (RTMs) that quantitatively characterize the complex relationship between canopy parameters and reflectance. However, most physical models currently used for LAI retrieval are one-dimensional (1D) RTMs, which typically assume the canopy to be horizontally homogeneous and thus fail to capture the inherent heterogeneity within the canopy. Although three-dimensional (3D) RTMs can better characterize the structural complexity of forest canopies, their high computational demand and the difficulty of parameterization often limit their application to large-scale remote sensing retrievals. In this study, a novel 3D Look-Up Table (3D-LUT) approach was developed for retrieving forest LAI from Landsat by accounting for the heterogeneity within forests through the integration of LiDAR-based scene reconstructions to parameterize the RTM. Instead of using idealized homogeneous layers or simple geometric objects, our approach used airborne LiDAR data to reconstruct realistic and structurally representative 3D forest scenes for typical forest types, including Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF), Deciduous Needleleaf Forest (DNF), Evergreen Broadleaf Forest (EBF), and Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF). Based on these reconstructed forest scenes, type-specific LAI look-up tables (LUTs) were built by coupling the 3D RTM Large-scalE remote Sensing data and image Simulation (LESS) with an analytical model PATH_RT, an accurate and efficient RTM based on 3D path-length distribution and spectral invariant theory, enabling accurate LAI retrieval from Landsat imagery. This method was compared against field observations collected from 16 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites and 8 Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) sites, which comprise a representative sample of different forest types. Additionally, intercomparison was conducted using the High-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) LAI product, Simplified Level-2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) algorithm and the MODIS LAI product. Validation against in situ data demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve high-accuracy retrieval of LAI across four forest types, with RMSE ranging from 0.93 to 1.20 m2/m2 and MAE from 0.73 to 1.00 m2/m2. The intercomparison results revealed that retrieval algorithms based on the PROSAIL model, such as SL2P, tend to underestimate forest LAI. In contrast, the proposed algorithm shows strong overall agreement with the Hi-GLASS LAI product and MODIS LAI product, which are derived from a deep learning framework and a 3D RTM, respectively, supporting its reliability for regional-scale forest LAI retrieval. By generating the simulated dataset derived from realistically reconstructed 3D forest structures using LiDAR data, this study further advances the application of LiDAR in quantitative remote sensing retrieval."

 Chlorophyll is a fundamental component of photosynthesis and a key indicator in quantitative vegetation remote sensing. However, accurate retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content from top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance is often hindered by soil background and canopy structural effects. To address these challenges, we developed the Interference-Mitigation Chlorophyll Index (IMCI), derived from the spectral properties of leaves and soils together with canopy radiative transfer processes, to enhance robustness under complex soil and canopy conditions.The development of IMCI consists of three steps. First, the soil single-scattering component (ρs1) is removed from TOC reflectance using two spectral features: (a) vegetation reflectance remains equivalent at 598 and 694 nm regardless of leaf color, while soil reflectance differs; and (b) soil reflectance exhibits an approximately linear dependence on wavelength within 590–750 nm. These features enable accurate estimation and correction of ρs1, yielding soil-adjusted TOC spectra (ρc∼). Second, a proxy for the vegetation single-scattering component (ρl1) is constructed from soil-adjusted red-edge difference–ratio reflectance values (∆ρc∼λj/∆ρc∼λi). Exploiting the linearity of the red-edge, we demonstrated that the extrapolated intersection of ∆ρc∼ and ρl1 in the red-edge region converges to a reflectance value approaching 0 and further derived that ∆ρc∼λj/∆ρc∼λi can serve as a direct approximation of ∆ρl1λj/∆ρl1λi, which was adopted as the basic form of IMCI. Furthermore, under the chlorophyll-induced red-edge shift, we established a quantitative relationship between IMCI and red-edge displacement, confirming its sensitivity to chlorophyll content. Theoretical derivations and assumptions underlying these steps were extensively validated empirically.The proposed IMCI was evaluated using multi-species and multi-scale field datasets as well as synthetic datasets. Results demonstrated strong agreement between estimated and measured Cab, with R2 consistently ranging from 0.87 to 0.97 and RMSE from 2.87 to 6.47 μg·cm-2. Tests on hyperspectral imagery with different spatial resolutions further confirmed the robustness of IMCI in heterogeneous canopies. Overall, IMCI improves the accuracy and reliability of chlorophyll estimation from TOC reflectance and provides new insights for quantitative vegetation physiology remote sensing and practical monitoring applications."

 Ice clouds, composed of irregular ice crystals, play a critical role in the Earth's radiative balance and climate regulation. Satellite polarimetric observations, such as those from the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance-3 (POLDER-3), exhibit high sensitivity to particle characteristics, making them valuable for deriving ice cloud microphysical properties. Conventional ice cloud remote sensing methods typically rely on single-particle models, which assume a prior particle shape across entire regions, thereby neglecting the inherent spatial heterogeneity. Under this context, the super-ellipsoidal particle model was developed, enabling continuous variation in surface morphology through three parameters (i.e., aspect ratio, roundness, and surface roughness), thus facilitating the retrieval of particle shape variations. To comprehensively consider the spatial heterogeneity of ice crystals and assess the effectiveness of the super-ellipsoidal multi-particle model, a synergistic retrieval of particle shape parameters and ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) was conducted across six tropical cyclone (TC) and cloud cases. The retrieval framework was built upon vector radiative transfer simulations derived from the adding-doubling model, linking POLDER-3 observations with the super-ellipsoidal particle models and IOT. The retrieved particle shapes and IOT were validated by comparing re-simulated radiance with satellite observations. The findings indicate an order-of-magnitude enhancement over single-particle models in retrieval performance, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) for normalized radiance decreasing from [0.0371, 0.1063] to [0.0023, 0.0042], and for polarized radiance reducing from [0.0036, 0.0061] to [0.0008, 0.0018].

 Information on forest structure is needed for many management aspects, from carbon stock evaluation to fire hazard prediction. Such information is increasingly available from remote sensing data, including light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors. However, continuous forest monitoring is hindered by the limited temporal availability of lidar acquisitions. This study focused on integrating temporally consistent optical acquisitions with temporally sparse lidar acquisitions to provide long term information on forest structural characteristics across the peninsular Spain. We evaluated different modeling approaches including machine learning and advanced deep learning models to ascertain their limitations for long-term forest monitoring. Subsequently, annual estimates of forest structural attributes were generated from 1985 to 2024. Across all forests, height (H), canopy cover (FCC), and above ground biomass (AGB) increased by 34 %, 29 % and respectively 17.5 % from the first (1985–1989) to the last lustrum (2019–2024). By biome, the increase in H, FCC and AGB was larger over the Mediterranean (35 %, 33 %, and 18 % respectively) when compared to the Atlantic (33 %, 10 %, and 15 % respectively) forests. For the model training year, deep learning models improved estimation accuracy by 27 ± 2.6 % (mean value across regions and variables) when compared to machine learning models. However, when applied to data from other years (temporal inference), model precision was similar except for height in the Mediterranean were deep learning models improved RMSE estimates by 7 %. Overall, the deep learning models presented significant computational drawbacks when applied to large geographic extents and extensive temporal ranges, substantially increasing both training and prediction times without providing a clear improvement in accuracy compared to machine learning across years. Therefore, the long-term forest database was generated using machine learning models. This database provides a spatially explicit understanding of forest structural changes over nearly four decades, offering a valuable resource for forest management, ecological assessments, and climate-related policy-making."

 Phytoplankton underpin marine food webs and drive essential biogeochemical processes. Their pigment composition serves as a vital indicator of community structure and physiological state. In this study, we developed a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model to estimate the concentrations of 26 pigments and infer phytoplankton community structure in global surface waters. By integrating prior knowledge and quantifying through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we selected a physically meaningful subset of 10 input features to construct pigment inversion models, including environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), and sea surface height (SSH), as well as remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at seven spectral bands. For 24 pigments, the model achieved high predictive accuracy and strong generalization performance, with an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 and median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of 12.01 % under random cross-validation, and slightly lower accuracy under temporal cross-validation (R2 = 0.67; MAPD = 14.35 %). Feature analysis revealed that Rrs, particularly spectral regions encompassing absorption peaks and adjacent gradients, dominated pigment predictions. Moreover, the model captured nonlinear thermal responses of phytoplankton to SST, consistent with known ecophysiological patterns, and reflected synergistic interactions between SST and SSS affecting pigment variability. The inferred phytoplankton community structures, estimated via Diagnostic Pigment Analysis (DPA), showed strong agreement with previous studies, validating the model's ecological reliability. Additionally, Hydrolight simulations based on in situ aph spectra demonstrated that the model performs reliably under water conditions with suspended particulate matter (SPM) ≤ 1 g m−3 and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440 nm is ≤0.25 m−1, maintaining MAPD below 25 %. Our research demonstrates that neural networks operate in a physically informed manner rather than as purely data-driven models, enabling them to represent complex interactions between phytoplankton and ecological environment. This underscores the necessity of designing ecologically informed and physically interpretable input features in remote sensing applications, offering valuable guidance for future biogeochemical modeling efforts."

 In recent years, optical remote sensing imagery has played an increasingly vital role in Earth observation, but cloud contamination exists as an inevitable degradation. Combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data with machine learning offers a promising solution for reconstructing clear-sky satellite imagery. Nevertheless, several challenges persist, including insufficient attention to large cloud cover, difficulties in restoring temporal changes, and limited practicality of deep models. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel deep learning-based cloud removal framework, termed Began+, which integrates bi-temporal SAR-optical data to deal with cloudy images with high cover ratios. The Began+ framework comprises two primary components: a deep network and a flexible post-processing step, combining the strengths of data-driven models for restoring change information and traditional gap-filling algorithms for mitigating radiance discrepancies. First, a bi-output enhanced generative adversarial network, abbreviated as Began, is designed for image synthesis, featuring an enhanced channel-wise fusion block (ECFB) and a multi-scale depth-wise convolution residual block (MDRB). By applying the dual-tasking optimization and co-learning strategy, the Began model identifies potential change areas from bi-temporal SAR and pre-temporal optical inputs, guiding the synthesis of target optical images. Second, a range of cloud masking and gap-filling techniques can be optionally employed to effectively reduce radiometric discrepancies between the synthesized images and the cloudy data, ultimately yielding high-quality, clear-sky imagery. To meet the big data requirements of deep learning, we constructed two globally distributed cloud removal datasets, named BiS1L8-CR and BiS1S2-CR. Supported by these datasets, extensive experiments demonstrated that the Began+ framework effectively captures bi-temporal change features, reconstructing precise surface information in both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images under large cloud cover. Compared to the latest solutions and algorithms, our proposed Began+ framework exhibits significant advantages from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives in both simulated and real experiments. Furthermore, without strict constraints on input timing, the Began+ framework enables accurate reconstruction of large-scale dual-sensor imagery under high-ratio cloud cover, effectively restoring changing surfaces and improving the quality of unsupervised vegetation extraction."

 This paper introduces a general formulation for the fusion of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) of variable length from several sensors at different spatial resolutions and acquisition times over the same geographical area. In this formulation, all the spectral bands from all the input sensors are predicted at the best input spatial resolution, and at any observed or non-observed acquisition time requested. To address this general problem, an advanced Masked Auto-Encoder training strategy is proposed, utilising two new loss functions: a Linear-Regression Learned Perceptual Image Similarity term to favor high spatial frequency details, and a mask-contrastive term to ignore clouds and other non-informative areas in the input data. This strategy is applied to the training of Temporal Attention Multi-Resolution Fusion of Satellite Image Time-Series (TAMRF-SITS), a novel Deep Learning architecture designed to implement the proposed general formulation. Experiments with joint Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2 time-series were conducted on four different tasks from the literature and demonstrate that a single pre-trained TAMRF is on par with or better than existing ad-hoc methods. For instance, TAMRF provides a gain of 0.01 surface reflectance Root Mean Square Error on a Spatio-Temporal Fusion task when compared to competing algorithms, while showing the highest spatial frequency content. Moreover, the proposed method relaxes unrealistic assumptions routinely found in the literature, including: same or similar spectral bands in different sensors, same-day acquisitions, and scale-invariance of the relationship between high and low resolution images. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve this range of capabilities with a single model, without making any of these assumptions.

 Precise estimation of shrub above-ground biomass (AGB) in arid regions is crucial for carbon cycle research and ecosystem assessment. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) -borne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become a key tool for quantifying three-dimensional vegetation structure and estimating AGB. However, the short stature of arid zone vegetation, combined with sparse and low-quality point clouds acquired by UAV, limits high-accuracy shrub AGB estimation. To address this issue, this study selected Caragana korshinskii, a typical psammophytic shrub in Ordos City, as the research object. By integrating UAV-based multispectral and LiDAR data, a biomass estimation method based on a novel Shrub Structure Index (SSI) was proposed. The SSI workflow reconstructs the three-dimensional shrub structure under sparse point cloud conditions and improves AGB estimation accuracy. This workflow comprises Object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification for individual shrub extraction, Delaunay linear up-sampling, voxel-based partitioning, and dynamic stratification by height percentiles. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) The individual shrub extraction method utilizing the large-scale mean shift (LSMS) segmentation algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) classification achieved a total quadrat segmentation accuracy of over 90.61 %, an overall classification accuracy of 91.51 % (Kappa = 0.86). (2) In SSI construction, the height-percentile stratification thickness, point-cloud sampling, and voxel edge length together set Caragana korshinskii stratification accuracy and density scale; the 5 % height percentile interval, a sampling size of 100 points, and 0.04 m voxel edge length proved optimal. (3) Comparative experiments showed that the three-dimensional feature integrated SSI significantly outperformed single-feature, two-feature, traditional allometric equation, and random forest (RF) models, with the SSI-based model achieving R2, RMSE, MAE, and rRMSE of 0.90, 529.01 g, 432.58 g, and 26.54 %, respectively. These results indicate that SSI more effectively captures shrub spatial structure and improves AGB prediction under sparse UAV-LiDAR conditions."

 Canopy gap fraction (GF) is one of the most important vegetation structure parameters widely used in forest ecology and meteorology. Small-footprint airborne LiDAR has gained great popularity for canopy GF retrieval in the past decade; yet most studies were carried out at individual sites using different commercial-off-the-shelf instruments, often ignoring possible inconsistency due to the use of different instruments or scanning configurations. This study aims to provide an assessment of the performance of canopy GF retrieval from small-footprint airborne LiDAR under different collection scenarios. We utilized small-footprint airborne LiDAR data and field digital hemispherical photo (DHP) measurements from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), encompassing 30 sites across 16 eco-regions in the United States from 2016 to 2022. A total of eight baseline cases together with different instrument configurations were included in this analysis. LiDAR-based canopy GF was first retrieved using established methods and then compared to a total of 4596 DHPs from 383 plots. Results show that all instruments could reach an accuracy better than 10 % RMSE under a proper configuration, however, the difference of using waveforms and point clouds alone could reach an RMSE up to 18 %. Scan angle showed the greatest impact among all sensor related parameters and could lead to a mean bias up to 5 %. Interestingly, waveforms did not always outperform point clouds, likely due either to the varying pulse shape of transmitted waveform or to low digitizer performance. In sum, our results caution the use of airborne LiDAR as the only means for validating large-scale satellite vegetation structure products or monitoring subtle long-term canopy changes. Assessing both instrument and acquisition specifications can help minimize potential bias in canopy GF retrieval over different ecosystems."

 In the 21st century, forest edge-to-interior gradients have exhibited remarkable spatiotemporal variation in China. In this study, we employed a high-resolution framework integrating NDVI, tree cover, canopy height, and forest age to evaluate edge effects on forest growth, structure, and maturity in China from 2000 to 2020. The results revealed that (1) the proportion of forest edges within 60 m declined from 38 % (653,000 km2 out of 1,694,000 km2) in 2000 to 33 % (680,000 km2 out of 2,033,000 km2) in 2020, accompanied by an increase in interior forests (>300 m) from 22 % (381,000 km2) to 29 % (590,000 km2); (2) NDVI, tree cover, canopy height and forest age increased from the forest edge toward the interior, with the strongest effects occurring within 300 m of the edge and detectable up to 1.2 km into the interior. However, the edge forests demonstrated faster temporal increases in NDVI and tree cover; and (3) these effects varied with the land cover types adjacent to the edge. Specifically, NDVI (0.862) and tree cover (81.17 %) peaked at cropland edges and were lowest at grassland edges (0.793 and 41.24 %), while canopy height ranged from 9.77 m at grassland edges to 12.76 m at waterbody edges. These findings are valuable for advancing forest restoration, mitigating fragmentation, and enhancing natural carbon storage potential in China."

 Accurate accounting of microwave land surface emissivity (MLSE) facilitates applications associated with monitoring the ecohydrological dynamics in global terrestrial ecosystems, quantifying cross-sphere carbon and water exchanges, and meeting the critical accuracy required for assimilation in the global precipitation retrieval algorithm. However, collaborative applications of emissivity retrieved from individual sensors are severely hampered by discrepancies in retrieval techniques, instrumental configurations, calibration errors, and broken temporal periods. To mitigate this gap, we present an innovative framework to retrieve harmonized emissivity from observations of five passive microwave sensors, namely, GPM-CO/GMI, Fengyun-3B, −3C and −3D/MWRI, and GCOM-W1/AMSR2. Six geostationary visible and infrared imagers onboard three geostationary platforms, i.e. GOES-16/ABI, Himawari-8, −9/AHI, and MSG-1, −2, −3/SEVIRI, were collocated to jointly provide clear-sky masks covering the globe. The simultaneous conical overpass (SCO) recalibration technique was applied to scale all emissivity subsets retrieved from different sensors to be aligned with the GMI retrievals across various land types. Quantitative analyses reveal exceptionally strong consistency among emissivities across different subsets (Pearson R ≈ 0.95, RMSD <0.011, and mean bias within ±0.005). Our estimates at 10.65 GHz show strong agreement with in-situ radiometer measurements over two grass and crop fields, with errors generally within ±0.01 at vertical polarization and a systematic underestimation of approximately −0.02 at horizontal polarization. Globally, we evaluate the recalibrated emissivities against four reference datasets derived using various techniques, which includes three single-sensor retrievals from GMI and AMSR-E, as well as a climatology emissivity atlas generated using the Tool to Estimate Land Surface Emissivity at Microwaves and Millimeter waves (TELSEM). The results demonstrate strong consistencies at both vertical (R = 0.8–0.9, RMSD <0.015 or ∼ 1.5 %) and horizontal (R = 0.9–0.95, RMSD <0.02 or ∼ 2 %) polarizations on a monthly scale. The observed discrepancies are primarily attributed to differences in instrumental configurations, calibration accuracy, and retrieval methodologies. The harmonized retrieval algorithm and the sophisticated cross sensor calibrations facilitate its implementation as a self-consistent emissivity data for various applications associated with terrestrial ecohydrological dynamics, surface hydrological properties estimation, as well as the physical-based precipitation retrieval algorithms over land."

 Coastlines serve as dynamic interfaces between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. While advances in satellite remote sensing have promoted coastline monitoring, no comprehensive global coastline dataset derived from Sentinel-2 imagery has been produced, despite its 10-m resolution and frequent revisit capabilities. To address this, we propose S2Coast, a knowledge-based framework based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, designed to automatically detect the unified High Water Line (HWL) from annually composited Sentinel-2 imagery, termed HWLSentinel-2. This method integrates multi-temporal observational information, spectral characteristics, and spatial features to delineate the stable extent of high seawater submergence captured in cloud-free satellite images over a year. The boundaries in the resultant “Land-Water” binarization image represent HWLSentinel-2, derived through integrated threshold segmentation for three decision layers. Subsequently, raster-to-vector conversion and optimization steps were performed. Following the sequential execution of 12,275 sub-tasks, the resultant S2Coast-2023 dataset includes approximately 2.17 million kilometers of coastline for 2023, covering all continents and most islands larger than 100 m2, excluding Antarctica and remote polar islands. Global validation based on 1146 samples demonstrates that the developed tool, S2Coast, exhibits robust stability and universality, with average 88 % of sampled coastline segments falling within a 10-m buffer when comparing repeatedly generated coastlines from consecutive years (2021 to 2023). For positional accuracy, using 532 coastline samples with very high resolution image-based OpenStreetMap coastlines as reference data reveal an average positional deviation of −1.10 m (95 % CI: −2.06 to −0.15 m) and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 17.40 m (95 % CI: 16.23 to 18.65 m). As the first global coastline dataset with 10-m resolution and a unified coastline indicator, it will serve as a crucial foundational resource for future coastal research."

 Ocean eddies in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) play a crucial role in sea-ice dynamics and polar ocean-atmosphere interactions; however, their detection remains challenging due to their complex surface signatures. In this study, we developed MIZ-EDYOLO, a deep learning model customized for detecting MIZ eddies from dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Built upon the YOLOv9-t architecture and enhanced with specialized modifications, the model was trained on a dataset containing over 20,000 slices extracted from 1370 SAR images. The MIZ-EDYOLO model achieves high detection accuracy (∼80 % F1-score) on the test set and performs reliably on 200 full-scene images, enabling efficient and automated eddy identification. Using this model, we constructed the first six-year (2018–2023) SAR-based MIZ eddy dataset for the East Greenland region, comprising over 10,000 eddy instances. Analysis of this dataset reveals that eddy distributions are related to boundary currents, topographic forcing, and seasonal variations of the MIZ. Cyclonic eddies (CEs) outnumber anticyclonic eddies (AEs) by a factor of 8.4, while AEs exhibited an average radius about 1.8 times larger than CEs. The observed asymmetries between CEs and AEs are linked to their rotational dynamics and the associated sea-ice responses.

 Cloud masking is an essential task for satellite-based Earth monitoring, and the quality of cloud masks can directly impact the solutions of the downstream Earth monitoring tasks. While significant progress has been made especially for data with desired bands (e.g., thermal bands in Landsat-8), the masking quality on small satellites with higher resolution but fewer spectral bands is still unreliable at high latitudes, where confusion with snow and ice makes the task significantly more challenging. We propose a novel learning-enabled cross-platform ability transfer paradigm that offers a scalable and effective solution to tackle this challenge through a case study using PlanetScope images in the Arctic. A unique characteristic of the new paradigm is that it does not require manual annotations to be collected for PlanetScope images, which is often the bottleneck and the most time-consuming part of machine learning-based cloud masking, especially given the similarity between clouds and snow/ice. To realize this, our approach first designs and creates a new training dataset, Co-Clouds, which contains around 45,000 coincident pairs of PlanetScope and Landsat-8 image patches collected within a nearly simultaneous temporal window. This coincident dataset offers a way to generate large volumes of training data and builds a bridge to transfer Landsat-8’s stronger cloud masking skills in the Arctic to PlanetScope images via data-driven learning. We also show the feasibility of the ability transfer from spectral signatures (e.g., thermal bands) to spatial signatures (e.g., textures). Using our Co-Clouds dataset, we train several deep learning models including both regular-size deep learning models and large foundation models. To validate the quality of the masks, we further create a manually labeled cloud mask dataset for PlanetScope images in the Arctic. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show significant improvements over the current operational cloud masks by PlanetScope. For example, the large foundation models such as SegFormer achieve approximately 20 % higher overall accuracy and 28 % higher producer’s accuracy than the operational cloud masks, while maintaining comparable or better user’s accuracy exceeding 90 %. The new approach is also very easy to implement and extend to other platforms, opening new opportunities for broadcasting advanced skills from one platform to others."

 Flood-pulsed wetlands are characterized by significant seasonal water fluctuations, which play a critical role in the dynamics of these sensitive ecosystems. Among the growing number of existing remote sensing products, we explore the potential of interferometric (InSAR) coherence time series, derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images, to characterize the hydrological dynamics of the Okavango Delta, a vast flood-pulsed wetland. Interferometric coherence reflects changes in surface conditions, making it a powerful tool for detecting flood propagation. By fitting harmonic functions, we produce parameters that quantify the seasonality of coherence time series with short isotemporal baselines (12 days). In particular, we developed a normalized seasonal index based on the ratio between the seasonal amplitude and the root-mean-square error of the fitted harmonic function, to map the seasonality of the coherence time series. A multi-annual analysis of coherence time series reveals a strong relationship between their seasonality, land cover, and flood frequency. Unsupervised clustering applied to statistical and seasonal metrics of coherence time series yields consistent classifications that map the variability of flood frequencies across wetland areas and clearly distinguish wetlands from dry zones. Similarly, thresholds applied to normalized seasonal indices delineate the year-to-year extent of flood pulses with accuracy around 79 %. We show that coherence time series in never flooded areas exhibit a pronounced seasonal pattern driven by rainfall cycle, whereas this seasonality is disrupted by flood pulses in wetlands. Building on this, we developed a change-detection approach to map the floods by identifying the date when coherence time series diverge from their seasonal pattern. The resulting flood arrival dates achieve 74–83 % accuracy compared to a reference dataset derived from optical data. Our results highlight the potential of coherence time series as a robust indicator of seasonal variations in inundation extent in flood-pulsed wetlands."

Ice motion vectors provided by HV had consistently greater tracking cross-correlation coefficients (with the average value of 0.56) than those derived from HH (average value of 0.45), implying a higher confidence. The RCM HH + HV ice motion agreed well with the existing passive microwave products from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) with RMSEs of 4.19 km/d and 5.03 km/d respectively. We introduced an aggregated sea ice motion pan-Arctic gridded product at 2 km resolution that combines individual RCM ice motion products (HH and HV) derived over 3- and 7-day rolling time windows. A greater number of vectors was derived from HV compared to HH across the pan-Arctic domain, except for the situations where the HV signal is low, such as over smooth land fast ice. The new RCM HH + HV products generated since mid-May 2022 will substantially benefit various applications that require sea ice motion at high spatial resolution including accurate computation of sea ice deformation."

 Recent record-breaking fire activity in the western US poses clear threats to humans, ecosystems, and climate. Larger and faster fires increase the challenges for fire managers and further motivate the need for improved tracking of extreme fire behavior. There are also known limitations to our current ability to monitor fires from space. These include infrequent coverage from moderate resolution (≤ 1 km) sensors, smoke and cloud obscuration, omission of small or low-intensity fires, and atmospheric attenuation of fire radiative power (FRP). These effects diminish our ability to quantify fire behavior and emissions, including persistent burning behind the flaming fire front, particularly in ecosystems with high fuel loads. In this study, we examined the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery and data products to assess the utility of candidate fire pixels in addition to the low/nominal/high confidence 375-m fire detections already included in the active fire product. We found that these candidate pixels added 45% more daytime detections and 12% more nighttime detections for large fires in the western US 2020 fire season. Candidate fires were highly consistent with areas of flaming and smoldering fire activity identified by near-coincident airborne data as well as patterns of known active or candidate fires in sequential VIIRS overpasses, without significantly increasing false detections (commission errors). The candidate fire detections helped fill data gaps due to cloud obscuration during large fires that generated pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds. Including this additional information also impacted estimates of fire activity, increasing fire persistence by 20% and FRP by 7% across our sample. Although the contribution from candidate fire detections to total FRP was relatively small, including these additional pixels could provide a more consistent estimate of fire emissions for smoke models and air quality forecasts by filling gaps in active fire information and improving the representation of smoldering fire activity. These results demonstrate the potential to augment the standard VIIRS product with candidate fire information for known large fire events to improve fire tracking and downstream products. Such approaches to leverage additional VIIRS information may be suitable for other biomass burning regions where global fire detection algorithms provide incomplete information for specific fire types and observing conditions."

 We examine how, over its first decade, the Sentinel-1 mission has advanced the estimation of ocean surface winds over tropical cyclones, supported their global monitoring, and fostered related research. C-band S1 Synthetic Aperture Radar have been instrumental in refining wind retrieval algorithms, relying on the co- and cross-polarized normalized radar cross-section sensitivity to the ocean wind–waves, especially for major category (3-5) tropical cyclones observed in wide swath modes. Systematic comparisons with airborne multi-frequency radiometer measurements confirm the ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar to provide estimates of the ocean surface wind field at kilometer resolution during a tropical cyclone (bias of 0.08 m/s, standard deviation of 3.84 m/s, correlation of 0.97) and to extract its main characteristics, including the center of the wind circulation, the maximum possible extent of a given wind speed around the tropical cyclone and the radius of maximum wind. Now available globally and in near-real time at operational tropical cyclone forecasting centers, Synthetic Aperture Radar observations are part of the mix used to diagnose the state of the tropical cyclones and issue warning bulletins. Sentinel-1 decametric-backscatter and kilometric-wind resolutions have also been shown to be a reference for interpreting and calibrating other satellite, in situ measurements, and algorithms. Sentinel-1 synoptic observations benefit from new observing systems. Their synergistic use enables us to provide improved temporal resolution of TCs inner core structural parameters. Research efforts exploiting Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements to document such a dynamical system, infer tropical cyclone boundary layer properties, TC-generated waves, and interactions with the upper ocean are presented. This growing increase in acquisitions from multiple C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar missions (e.g. the Radarsat Constellation Mission) over TCs (a factor of 4 over the last decade), combined with other observational data and numerical models, opens opportunities to revisit robust data-driven approaches. These advances shall support a better representation of tropical cyclones in digital twin frameworks. Both algorithm improvements on existing and future Synthetic Aperture Radar missions are attractive perspectives to provide more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of these complex weather systems."

 Swath-based remote sensing data often exhibit spatial discontinuities after mapping to latitude-longitude grids at a regular spacing due to uneven sampling caused by varying viewing angles and limitations of the conventional center point-based gridding method (CPGrid). A more complex area-weighted gridding method can enhance spatial continuity, but it requires geometric calculations for each grid and is computationally intensive, especially for large-scale satellite imagery. To balance accuracy and efficiency, we proposed a probabilistic area-weighted gridding method (PAGrid), which approximates area-weighting by aggregating results from multiple randomized spatial perturbations. The performance of PAGrid was evaluated using all available Sentinel-3A and 3B observations in 2022 over Germany. Using the canopy absorption coefficient by chlorophyll in the red-edge band (αRE) as a test variable, we generated 8-day composites and compared results from CPGrid and PAGrid methods. PAGrid increased the median percentage of valid grid cells from 85% to 93% and reduced temporal fluctuations by 21% compared to CPGrid. Additionally, PAGrid improved the correlation (R2) between Sentinel-3A and 3B αRE from 0.73 to 0.84, indicating enhanced data consistency. These improvements indicate that PAGrid is a practical and efficient approach for generating consistent and continuous gridded time series from swath-based satellite observations."

 The long-term over-extraction of groundwater in the North China Plain (NCP) has resulted in permanent loss of groundwater storage, leading to geo-disasters, including surface subsidence, ground fissures, and seawater intrusion. Through integrating wide-area InSAR survey data with a mechanical model, this study reveals the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of aquifer system deformation and groundwater storage loss (GWSL) across the entire plain. We used a Sentinel-1 A SAR dataset from 2017 to 2023, covering two ascending orbits (T40 and T142) with eight frames, along with time-series InSAR technology and a wide-area multi-track network adjustment model that incorporates spatial constraints. This allowed us to obtain seamless, millimeter-level accuracy time-series deformation sequences for the NCP. Three severe subsidence areas were identified, with the maximum vertical velocity exceeding −150 mm/year and the cumulative subsidence reaching up to 1 m. Thereafter, the time-series InSAR results and groundwater level data were modeled using cross-wavelet analysis to quantify the elastic recovery capacity of the Quaternary aquifer system in the NCP (with the elastic skeletal storage coefficient ₖₑSₖₑ ranging from 0.0002 to 0.021). This revealed significant differences in the aquifer response between the piedmont plain (mostly elastic deformation) and the flood plain (mostly plastic deformation). There was no elastic recovery in the subsidence funnel areas of the flood plain. Subsequently, InSAR observations were integrated with the volume strain model (InSAR-VSM) to construct a novel groundwater loss inversion model, yielding the first 2-km resolution dataset of GWSL for the NCP. The average annual groundwater loss from 2017 to 2023 was estimated to be −4.346 × 108 to −8.692 × 108 m3/yr. Finally, we systematically investigated the spatiotemporal variation patterns of land subsidence over the past 63 years in the NCP, under the combined influence of human activities (such as over-extraction of groundwater, the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), and policies prohibiting groundwater extraction) and natural factors (such as extreme rainfall events and geological structures). The deformation shows a spatial migration characteristic from urban areas to agricultural land, with different deformation trends in the NCP. While urban deformation has stopped or reversed, agricultural areas continue to experience intensifying subsidence. This study characterizes the stress evolution features of the aquifer system at an ultra-high spatial resolution, providing crucial scientific support for adaptive groundwater management and the development of subsidence mitigation strategies in water-scarce sedimentary basins."

 Passive satellite products are a primary source for estimating surface total solar radiation (TSR) and its components—direct (DIR) and diffuse (DIF). However, existing satellite-based methods typically treat aerosol and cloud effects separately. Overlooking aerosol-cloud coexistence may introduce substantial uncertainties that have received little attention. Therefore, this study combines radiative transfer simulations, multi-source satellite data, and ground-based validation to systematically evaluate the impact of overlooking coexistence on DIR, DIF, and TSR estimates. Simulations show that as cloud optical thickness increases from 0.2 to 5, the mean DIR overestimation due to ignoring aerosols drops from 261.58 W m−2 to 1.02 W m−2, and DIF shifts from an underestimation of 165.75 W m−2 to an overestimation of 102.41 W m−2. Ignoring clouds in coexistence cases yields similar patterns but greater biases. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation indicate that about 15 % of global samples exhibit aerosol-cloud coexistence, with hotspots concentrated in central Africa. Ground validation shows that ignoring coexistence increases the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of AQUA-based DIR, DIF, and TSR estimates by 19.19 %, 26.22 %, and 1.95 %, respectively, and Himawari-8-based estimates by 31.21 %, 30.09 %, and 3.60 %. To mitigate these uncertainties, two strategies are tested. Filling missing aerosol or cloud properties using MERRA-2 or MYD08M3 data reduces DIF rRMSE by 7.17 %–10.45 %; incorporating aerosol-cloud coexistence samples into the lookup table reduces it by 3.30 %. Both strategies have minimal impact on DIR and TSR. These findings highlight significant errors from overlooking aerosol-cloud coexistence in passive satellite-based solar radiation estimates and emphasize the need for greater awareness and methodological refinement."

 Wildfires, intensified by climate change, necessitate advanced methods for accurate and near-real-time fire severity mapping to improve emergency response and post-fire recovery strategies. Satellite remote sensing, combined with supervised learning approaches, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of fire severity mapping. This study introduces Decision-Based Hierarchical Learning (DBHL), a novel multi-sensor fire severity classification model that integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1 backscatter) and optical (Sentinel-2 reflectance) data. The model was applied to assess wildfire impacts on temperate forests during the 2019/20 “Black Summer” wildfire season in south-eastern Australia. DBHL incorporated SAR-based RADAR-Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (R-VSPI) and optical-based Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) as candidate indices. By integrating these complementary datasets, DBHL leverages both structural and physiological changes as fire severity indicators, addressing limitations in single-sensor approaches. A pixel-wise approach was employed to spatially upscale the applicability of the R-VSPI and VSPI indices for fire severity assessment across the entire region. Using field data, the sensitivities of the R-VSPI and VSPI indices were validated during the immediate post-fire to one-year post-fire period. DBHL was trained and evaluated with a focus on comparing its performance against independent R-VSPI and VSPI classifications. The findings reveal the unique strengths of each index across various fire severity classes, demonstrating their complementary value. R-VSPI is more sensitive to structural changes in forests, while VSPI excels in identifying changes related to canopy-level disturbances. One-year post-fire recovery analysis shows distinct spatial patterns, with VSPI indicating faster recovery in surface vegetation and R-VSPI highlighting prolonged structural recovery. The DBHL model demonstrates the complementary strengths of the indices, allowing fire severity assessments to be contextualized across vertical vegetation strata, distinguishing between canopy-based damage indicators and underlying structural changes. DBHL outperformed single-sensor approaches, achieving the highest classification accuracy (overall accuracy=88.89%, kappa=0.86), particularly improving differentiation of Moderate (partial canopy scorch) and High (full crown scorch) severity with a producer’s accuracy of 100%, and 80%, respectively. Future research is aimed at integrating multi-wavelength SAR, including L-band (1.25 GHz) and P-band (0.43 GHz), along with LiDAR measurements to enhance structural fire severity assessments."

 Green Area Index (GAI) is a key crop trait obtained through remote sensing with wide applications in agriculture. Although 3D model-driven approaches to retrieve GAI from multispectral reflectance observations are appealing, they are constrained by limitations in the realism of simulated datasets used for training. This study comprehensively explored how to integrate prior information—such as soil background, leaf optical properties, and canopy structure—into radiative transfer models to improve GAI retrieval. A suite of models (MARMIT-2 for soil reflectance, PROSPECT for leaf optical properties, ADEL-Wheat for canopy structure, and LESS for radiative transfer) was employed to generate five simulation datasets incorporating different combinations of prior information. Support Vector Regression (SVR) models were independently trained on these simulated datasets and validated against an extensive data set made of 310 samples of GAI ground measurements and the corresponding SuperDove satellite data. Our results show that stage-specific GAI retrieval integrating detailed prior information on soil and leaf properties (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.47) notably outperforms standard model inversion approaches (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.73). The improved realism of the training dataset stems from three key strategies was discussed in detail including: (1) employing models that integrates physical and biological knowledge; (2) narrowing the training space; and (3) minimizing distribution shifts. While this study focused on GAI estimation for wheat crops using SuperDove observations, the findings can be extended to other crops, vegetation variables, and satellite systems."

 Urban overheating, a confluence of urban heat island and climate change, is escalating alongside the rapid global urbanization. While previous studies have examined how urbanization and vegetation influence surface urban heat islands (SUHI), their nonlinear effects across climate zones remain insufficiently understood. Here, we present a globally consistent assessment of 6022 cities using MODIS Aqua data (MYD11A2) from the summer of 2019, validated with multi-year records (2017–2021), through a self-developed, scalable SUHI quantification method that enables cross-climate comparisons. Our results reveal distinct rapid- and slow-growth zones in SUHI intensification with urban size, with the fastest increase occurring in small cities below the top 20% of global urban size. This uneven rise in SUHI intensity stems from the synergistic effects of urban expansion and vegetation loss. Vegetation cooling exhibits a clear saturation beyond an inflection point, with the equatorial zone showing both weaker cooling efficiency and earlier saturation onset. Using a dual-perspective framework that integrates absolute and relative temperature metrics, we further show that Global South cities experience compounded thermal stress—featuring not only 3.37 ± 0.14 °C higher absolute temperatures due to their geographical setting, but also 0.24 ± 0.05 °C greater SUHI intensity than cities in the Global North. Together, these findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of heat mitigation strategies varies across climates and urbanization stages, underscoring the heightened vulnerability of smaller cities and the need for context-specific, climate-sensitive planning interventions. This study provides a globally integrated yet regionally differentiated understanding of surface urban heat and establishes a planning-relevant framework to guide targeted and climate-sensitive urban heat mitigation strategies."

 Forest ecosystems, covering about one-third of the Earth’s mainland, are vital for providing essential ecosystem services. However, their extent and health are threatened by climate change. Remote sensing has the potential to evaluate the condition and functionality of global forests, but methodological and technological challenges impede the quantitative estimation of forest traits from spaceborne imagery. The development of next-generation sensors and advanced retrieval algorithms offers the chance to overcome these obstacles, though such data and models need development and testing. In this study we investigated and compared the potential of machine learning regression algorithms (MLRA) and hybrid approaches combining MLRA and radiative transfer simulations for the retrieval of forest traits from PRISMA spaceborne imagery. We tested the method in the Ticino Park, a mid-latitude forest located in northern Italy. We conducted an intensive field campaign in the summer of 2022 concurrently with four PRISMA overpasses to collect trait samples for calibrating and validating the retrieval schemes. Our results demonstrated the capability of PRISMA images and hybrid models to accurately quantify Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) (r2=0.67, nRMSE=13.5 %), Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC) (r2=0.82, nRMSE=9.5 %), Leaf Water Content (LWC) (r2=0.98, nRMSE=3.5 %), Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) (r2=0.93, nRMSE=6.6 %) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) (r2=0.83, nRMSE=11.7 %) in forest ecosystems. Conversely, Leaf Carotenoid Content (Ccx) yielded a lower accuracy (r2=0.43, nRMSE=13.5 %), indicating potential for improvement. The results evidenced a slightly superior performance of hybrid approaches over purely statistical approaches. The application of the models to PRISMA images acquired before and after a severe drought event corroborated the effectiveness of the models to provide reliable estimates in operational conditions. This underscores the valuable role of next-generation models and hyperspectral spaceborne imagery for forest monitoring. To our knowledge, this is the first study to appraise hybrid retrieval schemes with real spaceborne hyperspectral data for mapping multiple forest traits, thereby providing a reference framework for future applications."

 Green tides in the Yellow Sea are recurrent hazardous algal blooms whose optical monitoring is often hindered by cloud cover, while existing SAR approaches remain sensitive to sea state and look-alike targets and frequently require per-scene tuning or curated labels, limiting transferability and temporal consistency. To address this, we develop a label-free, fully automatic Sentinel-1 workflow that operationalizes three empirical signatures of green tides: spatial anomaly pre-location using local standard deviation on VV, edge-guided intensity separation via edge-balanced Otsu, and temporal anomaly screening using Z-scores with adaptive thresholding; an automatic object-level filter then removes non-algal marine targets. Implemented on Google Earth Engine at 10 m resolution, the pipeline delivers rapid processing without manual parameters. Validation shows high mapping accuracy: with a global stratified sample set, F1 equals 0.96 in 2019 and 0.97 in 2021; with a local edge validation set, F1 equals 0.94; in an all-pixel assessment over more than 2.5 billion pixels against a baseline, overall F1 equals 0.91. Qualitative comparisons likewise show fewer omissions of low-contrast filaments and fewer perforations within mats than GA-Net and UDNet. An ablation analysis clarifies the role of each module: the spatial pre-locator supplies contiguous candidates; the edge-guided intensity module sharpens boundaries and limits leakage; the temporal module suppresses transient bright seawater and consolidates persistent mats. Used jointly, the three constraints provide complementary information that yields the most stable cross-year performance and a favorable balance between precision and recall. Overall, the framework offers a simple, scalable, and operational pathway for fine-scale, all-weather monitoring and consistent multi-year assessment of green tides in the Yellow Sea."

The dataset includes event camera, RGB cameras, LiDAR sensors, a tactical-grade IMU, and GNSS, covering a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments with diverse motion types and illumination conditions. High-precision ground truth is obtained using motion capture systems indoors and GNSS/IMU integration with bidirectional smoothing outdoors. The dataset is structured into 23 subsets categorized by motion dynamics and lighting, supporting the development and evaluation of robust localization and SLAM algorithms.

We quantitatively evaluated the influence of diverse desert expansion and contraction scenarios on the ecosystem photosynthetic peak (GPPmax). Results indicate that the average GPPmax in high-intensity expansion regions (HIEs) is 8.23 g C m−2 8d−1, whereas medium- to low-intensity expansion regions (MIEs) show a value of 8.95 g C m−2 8d−1. By contrast, medium- to low-intensity contraction regions (MIRs) and high-intensity contraction regions (HIRs) demonstrate markedly higher GPPmax values of 10.64 g C m−2 8d−1 and 17.64 g C m−2 8d−1, respectively. Regarding the photosynthetic peak difference (ΔGPPmax), expansion scenarios (HIEs, MIEs) significantly decrease ecosystem photosynthetic potential, with average ΔGPPmax reductions of 1.19–3.95 g C m−2 8d−1 relative to contraction scenarios (HIRs, MIRs). The most pronounced losses occur in South America, North America, and Eurasia, with South America exhibiting reductions exceeding 6 g C m−2 8d−1. Additionally, ecosystems with initially higher photosynthetic potential experience greater GPPmax declines under intense desert expansion. This study provides the first global-scale evidence revealing how different desertification pathways modify ecosystem photosynthetic peaks and their regional disparities, offering critical scientific support for ecological restoration, carbon sequestration strategies, and land management across arid landscapes."

 The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is experiencing rapid mass losses due to global warming in recent decades. Understanding high-resolution seasonal ice speed variability is essential for uncovering the spatiotemporal dynamics of glaciers and ice shelves and their response to ongoing climate change. Here, we present Sentinel-1 satellite-based observations of seasonal flow velocity changes in 581 glaciers on the AP during the period 2018–2023. We find that the glacier surface velocities exhibit an acceleration since the 21st century, with this trend intensifying substantially in recent years. Summer velocity acceleration was particularly pronounced in 2018–2023, with an average increase of 6.22 ± 5.90 % while annual speed increased by > 1.0 %. The summer acceleration of glacier flow was most notable on the Larsen Ice Shelf. Western AP glaciers showed higher velocities and experienced more rapid acceleration than those in the eastern. These changes are primarily driven by warming ocean waters and intensified surface melt. As climate warming persists, the observed acceleration of glacier flow and associated ice shelf mass loss on the AP are projected to persist, depending on the rate and magnitude of future forcing."

 Climate conditions such as the dynamics of temperature and precipitation significantly influence agricultural production. Therefore, the climate-induced agricultural economic consequences cannot be neglected. This study employs machine learning models with time series climate data, a panel of state-by-year total factor productivity estimates (1960–2004) for 48 contiguous states of the United States (U.S.), and the yield data for corn and soybean (1960–2020) in the main producing states to quantify the potential climatic effects on U.S. agricultural productivity under different climate scenarios. The results show that the climate change impacts are spatially heterogeneous under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2050. However, the effects on future agricultural productivity are consistently negative regardless of the region. The negative climatic effects on productivity growth will offset the advancements of U.S. agricultural productivity after 5–25 years under various climate change scenarios assuming the same advancement rates as the past. The predictions of the impacts could advance our understanding of future productivity growth in U.S. agriculture under climate change. The analysis results could also shed light on policy planning to mitigate various effects and threats to food security due to the changing climate."

 For routine road maintenance, accurate and efficient crack detection holds significant research value and practical importance. With advances in computer vision, image processing-based crack detection has achieved promising results. However, in complex environments, factors such as illumination and weather introduce noise interference, especially in high-resolution crack images where fine fracture features show heightened complexity and diversity. This often leads to degraded detection accuracy in such challenging scenarios. To address this, we propose FE-SegNeXt, a convolutional neural network segmentation framework tailored for high-resolution crack detection in complex environments. The algorithm leverages distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in crack images: average pooling separates these features, while a dedicated Frequency Collaborative Enhancement Module (FCEM) independently enhances high- and low-frequency components before fusing multi-band information. This design significantly improves the model’s ability to extract subtle cracks from high-resolution images under noisy conditions. Additionally, we introduce a Locally Enhanced Feed-Forward Network (LE-FFN) to amplify perception of weak crack signals in local regions, further refining fine-grained feature extraction. Experimental results on the public datasets Sun520, Rain365, and BJN260 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves F1-scores of 61.55%, 62.57%, and 60.31%, respectively, outperforming existing crack detection algorithms."

 Urban streets form the backbone of cities, and variations in street-junction spatial configuration provide valuable insights into urban form and function, both of which exhibit fractal and scaling characteristics in their structural and statistical properties. However, these patterns emerge from the interaction of multiple spatial processes operating at different scales, making it difficult to capture and compare their form-function relationships using single-scale analyses. To address this challenge, this study proposes a new α–β framework for multi-scale urban form comparison, grounded in fractal theory. Using a progressive clustering method, we construct scaling profiles for multiple cities, deriving the α (form) and β (function) parameters to systematically compare urban structures with differing morphologies and to identify urban clusters at their characteristic scales. This approach transforms the subjective perception of morphology into an actionable analytical tool, enabling integrated form-function assessment and overcoming the challenges of comparative studies from different urban systems. Overall, the proposed α–β framework effectively deconstructs urban complexity, as evidenced by its application to a comparative analysis of nine global metropolises."

 Satellite monitoring of non-optically active nutrients remains an ongoing challenge due to their weak spectral signals. While artificial intelligence (AI) methods can improve estimates by incorporating spatiotemporal information, their dependence on simple geographic coordinates tends to oversimplify the complex dynamics of nutrient distribution in coastal waters, especially in data-sparse regions. To address this gap, we propose the Spatiotemporal Kernel Density Estimation Deep Neural Network (ST-KDE-DNN). This model leverages precomputed spatial influence fields, derived from river outlet locations using KDE, as direct inputs to establish a source-driven spatial prior that reflects complex mixing patterns. We applied the ST-KDE-DNN framework to retrieve Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) and Phosphorus (DIP) from Landsat-8/9 imagery in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), a typical multi-outlet coastal system. Compared with models incorporating standard spatiotemporal predictors, incorporating the KDE achieved significantly higher precision, with a reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 45% for DIN and 29% for DIP, respectively. The most prominent improvements occurred in complex mixing zones where river plumes overlap. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) analysis confirmed that the KDE features were dominant predictors, which enhances model transparency and grounds its predictions in physical processes. Based on this framework, we generated high-resolution time series of DIN and DIP for the PRE, and further revealed their seasonal and inter-annual variabilities. The ST-KDE-DNN offers a scalable, physically-informed, and interpretable solution for advancing nutrient monitoring in complex estuarine and coastal systems worldwide."

However, acquiring comprehensive elevation data at global scale remains challenging, particularly for oceanic regions, with the current open-access global open DEM resolution limited to 15 arc-seconds (approximately 450 m). In order to further improve the global DEM resolution, we propose an innovative Relay Residual Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RRDPM) for DEM super-resolution tasks based on diffusion model principles. Our model achieves distribution transformation between high- and low-resolution DEMs through tens of steps. Moreover, RRDPM introduces two types of inherently indivisible sampling equations, and we prove that each of them has different advantageous positions, and integrate these advantageous positions using a “relay race” approach. In addition, we discard the conventional downsampling-super-resolution paradigm, by utilizing paired datasets of global 15 arc-second and local 3 arc-second DEMs, so that our method can be trained and tested in real-world situations. The experimental results show that the RRDPM reduces the RMSE by 20.73 % and 22.77 % for land and seabed regions, respectively, and improves the PSNR by 2.23 dB and 2.34 dB, respectively, for the same areas, representing significant advancements in the current global DEM detail recovery.

 The depth of melt ponds upon Arctic sea ice is a critical indicator for understanding the state of sea ice and the progression of climate change. The advent of the ICESat-2 lidar altimeter offers a promising avenue to monitor melt ponds, and existing studies are capable of detecting melt pond location and depth. Here we propose a novel approach that incorporates ICESat-2 photon positioning and elevation uncertainties. By converting the photon elevation distribution along the satellite track into a two-dimensional image where horizontal and vertical axes represent track distance and elevation, we employ image classification techniques to distinguish the surface and bottom of melt ponds. This provides a fully automated method for identifying melt ponds, and then the estimation of their depths. Converting photon information into images effectively simplifies the computation. We tested this method on 100 randomly distributed melt pond samples of varying sizes and depths. Out of these, 97 melt ponds were successfully identified. A comparison with manually annotated data revealed an average absolute bias of 5 cm and a correlation coefficient of 0.86, outperforming other methods. This approach can detect large and deep melt ponds with widths greater than 17 m and depths ranging from 0.3 to 2 m, which can be further used to monitor the melt ponds in the whole Arctic. It facilitates the acquisition of more detailed melt pond depth information, which is crucial for quantifying the surface melt of Arctic sea ice."

 Tracking moving vehicles in satellite videos presents several challenges, including complex background interference and the difficulty of detecting small targets. Most existing multiple object tracking (MOT) methods utilize convolutional models to capture local semantics or self-attention mechanisms to address global semantics for moving target detection. However, these methods tend to struggle with small and visually similar targets, making them particularly vulnerable to complex background interference, which often results in a large number of false positives and missed detections. Furthermore, many current approaches rely on the Hungarian matching algorithm or other intricate, unlearnable association optimization methods to achieve effective tracking once relevant information is gathered. This reliance often yields suboptimal outputs from the network models. To tackle these issues, this article presents an end-to-end graph network based on spatiotemporal high-order relation learning and reasoning for vehicle tracking in satellite video. The representation module of spatial high-order relations is designed to capture the spatial high-order relations between moving vehicles and their local environments, as well as global key references. Meanwhile, the temporal semantic reasoning module focuses on analyzing the evolution of these spatial high-order relations over time, thereby constructing the spatiotemporal high-order connections among the targets of interest and ensuring the continuous and stable detection of moving vehicles. Ultimately, a graph network based on spatiotemporal high-order relation reasoning is developed to perform learnable associations of target information across video frames, achieving a globally optimal solution to the tracking problem. Comparative experiments on the SatVideoDT, CGSTL, and ShuangQing-1 satellite video datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enables end-to-end tracking of moving vehicles, attaining state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation metrics. On the SatVideoDT dataset, the model achieves a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 65.1% and an Identity F1 Score (IDF1) of 70.9%. The proposed network model holds significant promise for the automated interpretation of satellite video data. The code is available at https://github.com/zsspo/GHOST-R."

 Malaria, a life-threatening disease, remains a major global health challenge, particularly in Africa. While Anopheles gambiae sensu lato has long been the primary vector in Africa, the recent invasion of Anopheles stephensi—an urban malaria vector native to South Asia, poses a growing threat to malaria control and elimination efforts. Understanding An. stephensi environmental suitability and its spread dynamics is critical for designing effective surveillance and vector control strategies. Although previous studies have mapped potential environmental suitability for An. stephensi, most have focused on temperature or environmental variables, overlooking other critical factors affecting mosquito life cycles. Moreover, little is known about the species’ historical spread speed or projected expansion. While An. stephensi is already spreading in the region, this study aims to enhance predictive modeling of suitable habitats and identify areas at ongoing or future risk of invasion. Our approach integrates meteorological, environmental, geophysical, and socioeconomic variables, alongside an expanded occurrence dataset and ecologically constrained pseudo-absence sampling. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in predicting An. stephensi locations during the 2021–2024 test period, outperforming previous studies in the region. We analyzed historical spread patterns, revealing a rapid increase in spread speed from 20 km/year in 2012 to over 120 km/year by 2024. Future spread was projected using environmental suitability, road connectivity, and population density, with the spread model achieving a temporal correlation of 0.66. Projections suggest continued expansion into western Ethiopia, southern Somalia, and southern Kenya, with climate change likely to increase environmental suitability in highland regions. This high-resolution, spatiotemporal framework provides actionable insights for current and future transmission hotspots and supports urgent, targeted interventions to mitigate the spread of An. stephensi under a changing climate."

 Accurately locating goafs is essential for assessing and mitigating surface instability risks, protecting infrastructure, and guiding urban planning and ecological restoration efforts. The Probability Integral Model (PIM), Improved PIM (IPIM), and Probability Density Function (PDF) models have demonstrated effectiveness in locating underground goafs. However, due to the specific assumptions underlying each model, their applicability is limited under different extraction conditions. To this end, a novel inversion framework, termed the Locating Goaf Method based on an Integrated Probability Model (LGM-IPM), is proposed to locate underground goafs under different extraction conditions using InSAR-derived deformation. First, an integrated probability model (IPM) is developed by systematically analyzing the applicability boundaries of the PIM, IPIM, and PDF models. The proposed model accurately characterizes the relationship between surface deformation and the geometric parameters of underground goafs under varying mining intensities. Subsequently, an Adaptive Mining-Affected Pixel identification algorithm (AMAPI) is developed based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of mining-induced deformation, enabling efficient input data reduction and significantly improving computational efficiency. The geometric parameters of the underground goafs are then estimated using the Genetic Algorithm-Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO). These results from the Qianyingzi coal mine, China, demonstrate that the proposed LGM-IPM effectively estimates goaf parameters under different extraction conditions. The integrated AMAPI algorithm achieves a 91% reduction in computation time by effectively filtering out unaffected pixels. Moreover, the LGM-IPM model yields the highest precision, with an average relative error of 6.38%, representing improvements of 59.89% over LGM-PIM (15.90%) and 25.69% over LGM-IPIM (8.58%). These findings demonstrate that the proposed LGM-IPM framework provides a computationally efficient and more generalizable solution for InSAR-based goaf locating under different mining conditions."

 The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission has significantly advanced marine gravity recovery, yet its wide-swath measurements reveal the effects of strong sea level variability, emphasizing the need for effective correction methods. This study reveals that traditional correction strategies, such as stacking method, are insufficient for SWOT gravity recovery in high-variability environments, and quantifies the conditions under which more targeted correction approaches are necessary. Experimental results in the Kuroshio indicate that strong sea level variability directly affects SWOT observations, leading to gravity anomaly disturbances of approximately 2 mGal. To mitigate these disturbances, two strategies are implemented: stacking and sea level anomaly (SLA) model correction. Using SLA model correction, deflection of the vertical (DOV) accuracy improves by ∼40 % in regions of strong sea level variations, while gravity anomaly accuracy is enhanced by 0.25 mGal (∼9%). To determine the conditions under which correction becomes necessary, this study evaluates gravity anomaly accuracy across varying sea level variability levels, quantified by the standard deviation of sea level anomaly (STD-SLA). Results show that when STD-SLA is below 15 cm, gravity recovery remains largely unaffected. However, above this threshold, SLA-induced disturbances become non-negligible, and applying correction improves gravity anomaly accuracy by more than 0.1 mGal on average. Global analysis reveals these regions exceeding this threshold, where correction is essential, are predominantly located along major Western Boundary Currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These findings underscore the need to reassess standard correction approaches in SWOT-era gravity recovery, and provide quantitative guidance on where SLA-based correction should be applied."

 Compound drought and heatwave events (CDHEs), as critical extreme climate phenomena, have attracted substantial scientific attention because of their profound impact on the sustainability of socioecological systems. Nevertheless, current identification methods rely only on the combined influence of precipitation and temperature changes and fail to consider the contribution of evapotranspiration in drought‒heatwave. This resulted in a low estimation of the spatial extent and severity of such compound events. Here, we developed a new standardized compound drought and heatwave index (SCDHI) using the Gaussian copula probability distribution modeling, combining the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) with the standardized temperature index (STI). We found that compared with the existing indicator, the SCDHI improved significantly in monitoring accuracy and monitoring capability for CDHEs, particularly in assessing vegetation responses. By explicitly considering the impact of evapotranspiration on the intensification of droughts, the SCDHI effectively corrected the underestimated deviations that are commonly present in traditional methods in vegetation areas. The proposed index demonstrates strong potential for multiscale monitoring of CDHEs, enhancing assessments of their impact on the environment and society."

 Recent climate warming has accelerated permafrost thaw and dynamics of thermokarst lakes (TLs) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Yet, owing to the lack of long-term monitoring of TLs, our understanding of lake evolution processes and their driving factors remains uncertain. Here, using the global surface water product and time-series Landsat imagery, we identified 58,538 TLs (0.01–3 km2) and determined the primary occurrence year of lake changes from 1990 to 2022. Our results indicated that TLs on the TP are primarily located in the central inland region, over 82 % of lakes experienced area expansion, and only 15 % in the northwest show decrease in area. Annual number of lake expansion peaked in 2016, whereas lake shrinkage was most common in 2019. The calculated lake area errors, field investigations, and validation of lake disturbance time demonstrated high accuracy and consistency. We applied the optimal machine learning regression model to distinguish the different drivers for lake expansion and shrinkage. The topographic and climatic factors are primary drivers for lake expansion, while differences in evaporation trend and soil temperature trend might contribute to lake shrinkage.

To address these issues, we propose a novel simulation-to-real style-transfer pipeline for fine-grained ship imagery, comprising three modules: the Simulation Image Generation (SIG) module, the Conditional Image Generation (IG) module, and the Wake Inpainting (WI) module. In the SIG module, we construct an optical remote sensing imaging system capable of producing high-resolution simulated images containing fine-grained ship objects. To overcome the loss of detailed features inherent in global style-transfer methods, the IG module introduces the SPAM-ControlNet algorithm, which generates fine-grained ship images with accurate characteristics. In the WI module, we generate the inpainting region at the stern based on the ship wake model, then apply Stable Diffusion Inpainting to synthesize realistic wake patterns, thereby harmonizing the generated ship objects with the ocean background. This pipeline enables the synthesis of seamless, high-resolution remote sensing images populated with detailed ship objects. Building on this pipeline, we also release a hybrid dataset, FGSCR-SR-12, which combines real and synthetic images across 12 ship classes to mitigate long-tail distribution challenges caused by scarce classes.

 Cloud cover constitutes a formidable obstacle in the field of optical remote sensing image processing, substantially impeding the extraction and utilization of surface information. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, serving as a complementary informational resource, is capable of furnishing crucial auxiliary data for optical images. In recent years, diffusion-based cloud removal methodologies have made significant progress. Nevertheless, their inherent generative diversity and randomness pose challenges in meeting the realism requirements for cloud removal in optical remote sensing imagery. To address this, this paper presents a SAR-guided optical imagery cloud removal method based on global–local interaction and conditional consistency-constrained diffusion models (GLCdiffcr). Specifically, the method integrates a multi-scale residual self-attention network in the denoising module. This network captures both global and local details of SAR imagery and the captured details provide precise guidance for cloud removal. Additionally, within the reverse diffusion framework, the method directly predicts cloud-free optical images and iterates over multiple steps, reducing errors caused by generative randomness and improving consistency. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the realism of the generated images, the method employs a novel multi-condition consistency-constrained loss function, which combines pixel-level errors with structural similarity measures. Through this loss function, the gap between the generated images and real-world land cover types is further minimized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly in complex regions, with higher accuracy and reliability."

 Soil moisture, a pivotal component of the hydrological cycle, exerts a profound influence on land surface exchange processes, but its spatial variability poses challenges for large-scale field observations, increasing reliance on satellite-based retrievals. However, spaceborne estimates face limitations due to model uncertainties and sensor-related constraints. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising alternatives to traditional methods by enabling data-driven estimation of soil moisture without strong physical assumptions. Thus, a critical review of emerging AI-based soil moisture retrieval methods with respect to their advantages and disadvantages is vital to ensure the best utilization of such tools for soil moisture sensing, especially with novel sensors and data constantly being generated.In this comprehensive review, we furnish the first structured overview of AI methods and their applications in soil moisture retrievals from remote sensing. AI is able to enhance soil moisture retrieval by learning complex (highly nonlinear) relationships between satellite observations and ground reference data, to support time series reconstruction by filling gaps in data sets, to estimate subsurface soil moisture conditions from surface signals and auxiliary inputs, to enable spatial scaling by translating soil moisture estimates across different resolutions using multi-resolution data, to predict temporal dynamics as a soil moisture forecast, and to contribute to broader assessments of the water cycle and beyond by integrating soil moisture with further hydrological variables. Future directions for each method are also identified to address the scientific challenges of soil moisture retrieval and help focus the research community on the key open questions in the new era of rapidly expanding AI applications."

 Cropland non-agriculturalization refers to the conversion of arable land into non-agricultural uses such as forests, residential areas, and construction sites. This phenomenon not only directly leads to the loss of cropland resources but also poses systemic threats to food security and agricultural sustainability. Accurate identification of cropland and non-cropland areas is crucial for detecting and addressing this issue. Although remote sensing and deep learning methods have shown promise in cropland segmentation, challenges persist in misidentification and omission errors, particularly with high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Traditional CNNs employ static convolution layers, while dynamic convolution studies demonstrate that adaptively weighting multiple convolutional kernels through attention mechanisms can enhance accuracy. However, existing dynamic convolution methods relying on Global Average Pooling (GAP) for attention weight allocation suffer from information loss, limiting segmentation precision. This paper proposes Frequency-Aware Dynamic Convolution (FADConv) and a Frequency Attention (FAT) module to address these limitations. Building upon the foundational structure of dynamic convolution, we designed FADConv by integrating 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (2D DCT) to capture frequency domain features and fuse them. The FAT module generates high-quality attention weights that replace the traditional GAP method, making the combination between dynamic convolution kernels more reasonable. Experiments on the GID and Hi-CNA datasets demonstrate that FADConv significantly improves segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. For instance, ResNet18 with FADConv achieves 1.9% and 2.7% increases in F1-score and IoU for cropland segmentation on GID, with only 58.87M additional MAdds. Compared to other dynamic convolution approaches, FADConv exhibits superior performance in cropland segmentation tasks. The code is obtained from this link: https://github.com/er-go-proxy/FADConv."

 Seagrass meadows are vital blue carbon ecosystems that protect shorelines, support biodiversity and store carbon, but they face accelerating losses from environmental change and human disturbance. Disentangling these drivers is particularly challenging in data-scarce and operationally difficult regions such as the Nansha Islands. This study proposes SeagrassMNet, a physics-informed, domain-adaptive deep model for shallow-water seagrass mapping. The network couples dual attention transformers with adversarial domain adaptation to handle spectral variability and sparse in situ labels. Applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, SeagrassMNet achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 92.56 %, outperforming several state-of-the-art models (UNet++, HRNet, DeepLab v3+, ViT-Adapter-L, SegFormer and Swin Transformer V2). Cross-reef and cross-year tests, together with cross-regional point-based checks on open data (SeagrassSpotter), indicate that the model has promising transferability across broad areas and complex marine environments. The resulting maps provide the first comprehensive record of seagrass distribution for the Nansha Islands and reveal a 47.7 % decline in seagrass cover from 2019 to 2023. Association analyses over this period indicate that environmental factors, particularly sea surface temperature anomalies and sea surface height variability, are systematically correlated with spatial and temporal patterns of seagrass change. Large-scale artificial island construction and coastal modification show even stronger correlations with observed losses, especially where reclamation footprints overlap mapped seagrass meadows, underscoring the need for spatially targeted management in these vulnerable reef systems."

 Accurate estimation of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for terrestrial carbon cycling, global climate change research, degradation assessment, and sustainable land management. This study employs XGBoost model, combined with feature selection via Random Forest & Pearson correlation, alongside SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to enhance AGB predictions across diverse grassland ecosystems in China. Results indicate that incorporating vegetation height significantly improves model performance, increasing test R2 values by 0.01–0.07 (final range: 0.59 to 0.68), and reducing the errors nRMSE to ≤ 0.04. This underscores the critical role of vegetation height in improving biomass estimation accuracy. SHAP analysis further reveals the relative importance of key predictors, offering insights into their individual contributions to model performances. Spatiotemporal analysis (2001–2021) reveals rising AGB trends in highly productive regions, whereas arid and degraded grasslands exhibit stability or continue to decline, highlighting their vulnerability to climatic changes and anthropogenic pressures. Although the model demonstrates strong predictive capability, regional heterogeneity and complex feature interactions warrant further investigation. This research highlights the effectiveness of machine learning combined with remote sensing in monitoring grassland degradation, providing valuable insights for ecosystem restoration, carbon sequestration strategies, and policy-driven conservation efforts."

 Gap probability (P) is a key indicator of vegetation canopy structure and can be effectively estimated using intensity data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds. However, point cloud intensity is highly susceptible to radiometric effects. Even for a specific natural target, its intensity can vary across three-dimensional space, which may reduce the accuracy of P estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for estimating P that corrects the influence of radiometric effects on point cloud intensity (PRE_COR). The method consists of the following main steps: first, laser pulses are classified into vegetation-ground, pure-vegetation, and pure-ground pulses. Then, the intensity of vegetation-ground pulses is corrected using the inverse distance square law and the cosine law of incidence angle. Finally, the corrected intensity values are used to estimate the vegetation-ground reflectance ratio based on a linear relationship between their return energies. This ratio is then used to calculate the canopy P. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated ALS point cloud data and (National Ecological Observatory Network) NEON ALS point cloud data. The results show that for the simulated data, under varying canopy cover, flight altitudes, and mean scan angles, the proposed method achieved relative root mean square errors (rRMSE) below 5.37%, 5.94%, and 21.51%, and mean absolute errors (MAE) below 0.025, 0.011, and 0.067, respectively. Compared with the traditional PFitted method, rRMSE was reduced by up to 1.90%, 1.94%, and 21.20%, and MAE decreased by up to 0.010, 0.003, and 0.096, respectively. For the NEON ALS data, when the scan angle exceeded 20°, the proposed method may improv accuracy by more than 5.39%, with possible MAE improvements exceeding 0.019. Overall, these results demonstrate that correcting radiometric effects on point cloud intensity can substantially enhance both the accuracy and stability of canopy P estimation, with particularly notable benefits under large scan angle conditions."

 Road infrastructure plays a vital role in national and regional development, particularly in Southeast Asia, where rapid economic growth is increasing pressure on transport systems. However, uneven investment, environmental stressors, and limited data-driven tools continue to hinder effective road maintenance planning. Previous studies have utilized remote sensing and statistical models for infrastructure analysis, but the integration of long-term environmental indicators with spatial prioritization methods remains limited. This study addresses this gap by developing a Road Maintenance Priority Index (RMPI) using ten parameters, including nighttime lights, population density, industrial zones, land surface temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. These variables were analyzed through machine learning regression and multi-criteria decision analysis to classify road segments into priority levels. Results show that 45.08 percent of roads fall into the low-priority category, followed by moderate (39.69 percent), high (9.06 percent), and very high (0.88 percent). Countries such as Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia exhibited the highest RMPI scores, reflecting urgent maintenance needs, while Timor-Leste, Myanmar, and Laos scored lowest. The findings offer a transferable and scalable framework to support evidence-based infrastructure planning in economically and environmentally diverse regions."

 The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly improved the perception and decision-making abilities of autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet real-time and accurate road marking detection remains difficult under faded markings, nighttime scenes and adverse road–weather conditions. This paper presents RoadGPT, a vision–language pipeline that couples a CLIP-based detector (RoadCLIP) with a planner-facing, LLM-generated advisory layer. The model is trained and evaluated on 3,696 road marking images covering 14 UK Highway Code classes, comprising 2,576 real images (69.7 %) from Google Street View and 1,120 text-to-image synthetic images (30.3 %) that broaden rare appearances and degraded conditions. We use 2,968 images for training (2,072 real, 896 virtual) and 728 images for testing (504 real, 224 virtual), keeping the same 70:30 real–virtual ratio in both splits. On this test set, RoadCLIP attains 98.5 % precision, 97.9 % recall and 98.2 % F1 for non-lane markings, while lane-marking subclasses reach up to 89.8 % F1. The advisory layer transforms recognised markings into structured driving prompts and is assessed via semantic similarity using Sentence-BERT (all-mpnet-base-v2) cosine scores against Highway Code-based references, achieving 89.3 % similarity, alongside an external LLM-as-judge rating of 4.68/5 for accuracy, completeness, and concise effectiveness. The full camera-to-advisory path runs in real time at 135 FPS (batch size 1, 224 × 224) on an RTX 4070 under a unified timing protocol. A remaining limitation is that visually similar lane-marking classes and extreme low-light scenes still reduce discriminability compared with symbol-like, non-lane markings."

 Individual tree-level fine-scale (especially stem- and branch- scales) structural parameters constitute a critical foundation for tree structural trait assessments, biomass component estimations and tree physiological property evaluations. However, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Laser Scanning (ULS) has limitations in sampling distance and penetrating capability in dense tree canopies, thus restricting its ability to extract detailed stem- and branch-scale structural parameters. The emergence of both advanced ULS and Backpack Laser Scanning (BLS) technologies have potential to precisely extract fine-scale structural parameters of individual trees. In this study, we proposed an advanced ALE-CS-NGMS approach for individual tree (Poplar (Populus spp.)) stem- and branch- scale structural parameters extraction by ULS and BLS point clouds. First, an Adaptive Least-squares Ellipse (ALE) fitting algorithm was developed to accurately derive the stem diameter of individual trees. Second, a Canopy-stem Separation (CS) model was built by identifying canopy point cloud through derivatives based on the vertical distribution profile of individual trees, while canopy volume was delineated by the AlphaShape as well as a voxel-based algorithm. Finally, a method integrating Neighborhood Graphs and Minimum Spanning (NGMS) was developed to extract individual tree stem, and stem taper curves were fitted to estimate individual-tree stem volume. The results demonstrated that the developed ALE approach yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.87 cm, representing an accuracy enhancement approximately 0.47 cm for DBH estimation. The NGMS approach produced RMSEs of 0.33 m3 and 0.40 m3 for stem volume estimation by using BLS and BLS + ULS data. The CS model achieved RMSEs of 6.48 m3 and 3.48 m3 for canopy volume estimation with the BLS and BLS + ULS data, respectively. Branch inclination angles exhibited an increase with stand age, generally ranging between 60° and 100°. The distribution of branch inclination across stands of varying ages revealed that in the 8-year-old and 12-year-old plots, branch angles fell within the 60°-90° interval."

To date, 43 cities worldwide have obtained this certification, whose dynamic assessment depends on precise mapping of land use and wetlands. Existing global land cover datasets often show low accuracy in identifying wetlands and limited capacity to characterize wetland types within urban areas. we developed a hybrid Wetland City Map (WCM), by fusing three global 10 m-resolution products: Dynamic World, ESA WorldCover, and ESRI Land Cover. We applied a Weighted Voting and Knowledge-based Decision Rule method to achieve this fusion. This method overcomes the limitations of the input datasets by combining their complementary strengths to improve overall wetland classification and by applying expert-derived rules to enhance the delineation of wetland types within cities. The WCM achieves an average overall accuracy of 86.93 % and a kappa of 0.825. In all cities, its accuracy surpasses the three land cover products by 2 %-26 %. The visual comparison shows WCM performs better in wetland classification and spatial detail, with F1 scores of 90.33 % (water), 64.09 % (marsh), 71.67 % (tidal flat/flooded flat), and 92.17 % (mangrove). It more accurately reflects wetland coverage and changes. Wetland coverage varies across cities, with higher coverage in Asia and lower in Europe and Africa.

 Growing demands in sustainable development and resource management are driving increasing reliance on remote sensing-based Earth observation and image interpretation.

Translated images preserve structure and semantics while adopting target characteristics, thereby facilitating collaborative use.

 The precise prediction of dam deformation is essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and mitigating geohazards, particularly in regions characterized by limited monitoring studies. This research concentrates on the Oldman River Dam in Alberta, Canada, where Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-based deformation monitoring and prediction remain inadequately explored. A novel framework that integrates a Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (GAT-LSTM) has been developed to address the limitations of existing methods, which neglect spatial dependencies among InSAR-derived points and the increased model complexity stemming from point clustering or InSAR time series decomposition. Sentinel-1 data from three passes were processed utilizing a full-resolution InSAR technique, resulting in semi-vertical deformation velocities that demonstrated consistent subsidence along the dam crest, with rates fluctuating from 5.08 to 6.23 mm/yr. A robust correlation between deformation and reservoir water levels was noted, with accelerated crest deformation during the 2017–2019 drawdown period and a potential risk identified due to a significant decline in water levels projected for 2023–2024. The GAT-LSTM model, which captures both spatial and temporal dynamics, outperformed the standard LSTM, achieving 83.64% accurate points compared to 76.90% for the LSTM in short-term forecasting, exhibiting notable reliability along the crest. The peak performance was observed on September 9, 2021, with a Root Mean Square Error of 0.30 ± 0.013 mm and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.22 ± 0.012 mm.

The outcome of this exercise is then statistically analysed in comparison with two similar ETa products provided by the MODIS and LSA SAF systems at 500 m and 5 km resolutions, respectively. The analysis relies on the triple collocation strategy and comprises the following two steps: i) examination and inter-comparison of the spatial and temporal ETa variations which occur in 12 areas of the region representative of different climatic conditions and biome types; ii) repetition of these operations at pixel level. The experimental results indicate the existence of clear spatial and temporal ETa variations over most of the region which are differently represented by the three ETa products. The MODIS ETa estimates are significantly higher and lower than those of the other two products for forest and non-forest areas, respectively; the ETa trends estimated by MODIS are poorly concordant with those of the other products, particularly for forests. Consequently, the MODIS ETa estimates reflect only marginally the ETa increases which are evidenced by the other two methods over most of the region. Out of these methods, NDVI-Cws allows a more spatially detailed prediction of the local ETa variability depending on the NDVI dataset used. The implications and consequences of these findings are finally discussed, together with the main future research prospects."

 Satellite radar altimeters were originally designed for water applications, but their echoes over land surfaces remain less well understood. In this study we analyze how Sentinel-3 (S3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimetry waveforms respond to different surface types and what physical characteristics are encoded in the signal. To probe this, we conduct classification experiments with a feature-enhanced one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and analyze its performance. Since surface type information is relevant for climate, hydrology, and biodiversity applications, understanding these signal responses shows to what extent altimetric waveforms may provide consistent class-specific information despite their large elliptical footprint and heterogeneous landscapes. This study investigates the response of Sentinel-3 altimetry waveforms to different land cover types by employing a 1D-CNN to extract land cover information, complemented by a visual analysis of waveform patterns in relation to surface structures. Our results show that information about the underlying surface is embedded in the signals and can be extracted. They further reveal the sensitivity of Sentinel-3 altimetry to variations in land cover. By enhancing our 1D-CNN model with shape-based and contextual features, it effectively captures surface characteristics despite the large altimeter footprint. An ablation study highlights the complementary role of these features, as their removal negatively impacts performance. The best-performing 1D-CNN achieves a macro-averaged F1 (Macro-F1) score of 0.57 and an overall accuracy of 0.67, outperforming both a random forest and a dummy baseline. The classification includes six surface types: Tree, Shrub, Grass, Crop, Bare/Sparse Vegetation, and Water. Although some misclassification occurs, particularly in transition zones and among classes with similar vegetation structures and soil properties, the model provides valuable insights into systematic waveform behavior, highlighting the potential of SAR altimetry signals to capture broad surface characteristics."

 Multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image change detection (CD) represents a significant focus in remote sensing interpretation research. Recently, matrix low-rank decomposition theory has gained popularity in this field to exploit inherent structural information without requiring annotated data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on an idealized assumption that defines changed regions as spatially localized and sparse. This assumption introduces critical theoretical limitations: its sensitivity to change scales results in sparsity constraints failing to characterize large-scale continuous changes and accumulating decomposition errors, while the neglect of low-rank coupling between changed regions and backgrounds further undermines theoretical completeness. To address these issues, we propose a Foreground and Background dual-path collaborative optimization CD framework, namely FBCD. Specifically, a foreground change saliency model is constructed under generalized low-rank constraints, integrating low-rank consistency and local correlation mechanisms to capture complex change patterns. In addition, a background stability model based on low-rank self-representation learning achieves precise background separation through multi-view consistency constraint. Once generating reconstructed difference map, a self-supervised graph-optimized label propagation algorithm is designed to transform binary classification into a graph partitioning optimization problem, which further improves the CD accuracy. Extensive experiments on seven bitemporal benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method: Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, it achieves average Kappa coefficient improvements of 2.50% for large-scale continuous changes and 4.48% for small-scale localized complex changes. Furthermore, the method also shows strong applicability in short-term time series datasets. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/95xiaoli/FBCD."

 Remote sensing-detected phenological differences among cover crops, cash crops, and soil backgrounds are crucial for detecting cover cropping practices. However, variations in detection performance with satellite data of different spatial, temporal, and radiometric characteristics and the potential factors affecting the performance remain unclear. Building on the previously developed framework, we aimed to evaluate the performance of multiple satellite sensors, leverage multi-scale ground truth data, and identify potential factors for improving field-level cover cropping detection. Specifically, we (1) compared widely-used NDVI time series from Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS, ∼3-day and 30 m), MODIS (daily and 250 m), and PlanetScope (near-daily and 3 m, requiring radiometric calibration), (2) quantified discrepancies between county-level data from National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and field-level data from Indiana State Department of Agriculture (ISDA), and (3) analyzed the impacts of cover cropping field sizes, regional adoption rates, and cover crop species on cover cropping detection. We found that (1) HLS outperformed MODIS and MODIS-calibrated PlanetScope (CPS) with an average accuracy of 76.2 % ± 3.0 % across Indiana in 2017. (2) Significant discrepancies between ISDA and NASS data were found in 9 % of counties and were negatively correlated with detection accuracies in counties where ISDA-reported adoption was substantially higher than that reported by NASS (r = -0.54, p < 0.005). (3) Detection accuracy was higher in larger cover cropping fields, positively correlated with regional adoption rates (r = 0.42 and p < 0.001), with the highest accuracy for wheat (88.95 %), followed by winter grains (77.73 %), ryegrass (75.52 %), barley (75.35 %), and cereal rye (68.59 %).

 Monitoring mangrove forest degradation is challenging compared to deforestation because degradation involves the loss of ecosystem structure and function without changing forest cover, and selecting appropriate degradation references is difficult. Existing remote sensing time-series approaches offer a practical way to monitor forest degradation, but they mainly monitor degradation that occurred after images became available and focus on the forest’s horizontal dimension. This study proposes a novel approach for quantifying mangrove forest degradation. The approach evaluates the degree of mangrove degradation by comparing degradation indicators (canopy cover, canopy height, and aboveground biomass) with benchmark values inside environmentally homogeneous land capacity sub-regions. The benchmark values are determined by combining the LandTrendr algorithm and land capacity knowledge, accounting for temporal and spatial reference types. Large-area mangrove degradation indicators were estimated using improved hierarchical models with a “feed-forward” strategy. We applied this approach to mangrove forests on Hainan Island, China. The results showed that the overall accuracy of degradation identification was 95%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.90. The overall mangrove degradation degree in 2022 was 30.78% on Hainan Island, with reductions of 38.01% in canopy height, 28.04% in canopy cover, and 26.27% in aboveground biomass, indicating that mangrove dwarfing was the most serious degradation issue. Protected areas exhibited lower degradation (29.89%) than unprotected areas (35.31%). The findings also showed that the approach successfully detected degradation signals earlier than those from traditional satellite remote sensing data could to a certain extent (e.g., Landsat imagery dating back to ∼1985). The R2 values (RMSE) for the canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass models were 0.72 (1.03 m), 0.85 (0.11), and 0.69 (43.99 Mg/ha), respectively. The proposed approach can be an alternative to time series-based methods when mangrove degradation has a long-term history and can provide critical information to support mangrove conservation and restoration efforts."

 High resolution textures play a vital role in enhancing realism of urban digital twins, particularly in applications such as urban planning, energy analysis, and geospatial visualization. While textures can provide valuable surface-level details—such as material types (e.g., windows, green façades, bricks) and sunlight reflectance (albedo), these details are often missing in existing 3D city models. Existing 3D city models lack very high-resolution textures, limiting their realism and use cases. Manual texture mapping is labor-intensive and becomes impractical at city scale, often requiring days to weeks of effort. To address this gap, we present the CityJSON Texture Mapper, a Python-based software tool for the automated texture mapping of CityJSON 3D city models from oblique and nadir aerial imagery. The tool assumes that interior and exterior orientation parameters are available, ensuring spatial alignment between the 3D geometry and the images. Our approach introduces a novel image selection algorithm based on ray-tracing visibility analysis and integrates optimization techniques such as occlusion-aware texture mapping, texture atlassing, and optimization methods. Experimental results demonstrate the tool’s effectiveness in producing high-quality, visually enriched 3D models, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual processing. Proposed optimization methods reduce the number of textures by 97%, the total texture size by 63%, and the CityJSON file size by 37% relative to the non-optimized model. Although this study focused on one urban area, the methodology is scalable to large city datasets and suitable for national-level applications involving thousands of buildings.

 As high-resolution road-surface imagery provides a dynamic digital twin of pavement conditions, accurate crack segmentation serves as a key step in constructing intelligent maintenance systems. However, most existing segmentation models assume uniform sampling conditions and rely on fixed parameters, limiting their generalization under diverse real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Orthogonal-Enhanced Generative Model (DORGM) for robust pavement crack segmentation. The proposed framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an orthogonal constraint module that enforces feature disentanglement in the latent space, separating condition-specific noise from intrinsic crack patterns to reduce interference; and (2) a soft-label routing mechanism that adaptively assigns samples to specialized pathways, capturing subtle distributional shifts through Bayesian clustering within a variational framework. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing segmentation architectures, improving adaptability without additional retraining. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including DeepCrack, CRACK500, CFD, and NHA12D show consistent improvements — approximately 5% increase in mIoU and mDice — over baselines such as PSPNet, DNLNet, PointRend, SegFormer, and VPD. By enforcing orthogonality in the latent space, DORGM effectively disentangles environmental variations (e.g., lighting or weather-induced noise) from core crack features, yielding stable and interpretable segmentation across heterogeneous data sources. This disentanglement further mitigates domain shifts that hinder digital twin applications, enabling more reliable integration of crack data with other urban layers such as traffic flow and structural health metrics."

 Landslide Susceptibility Analysis (LSA) is essential for effective geological hazard management, particularly in karst regions where complex terrain and dense vegetation present significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative LSA framework that integrates a low-InSAR deformation sampling strategy (BL-InSAR) to mitigate InSAR errors in surface deformation measurements over densely vegetated areas and reduce uncertainty in non-landslide sample selection. Focusing on Bijie District in Guizhou Province, a karst-dominated region, we incorporate karst hydrogeological data into the LSA process. Utilizing a C-Support Vector Machine (C-SVM) model, we analyze 14 factors, including karst hydrogeology, to generate four landslide susceptibility maps employing BL-InSAR and three conventional sampling methods. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm is applied to elucidate both global and local landslide mechanisms. Our findings identify karst hydrogeology, precipitation, lithology, and slope as key factors influencing landslide susceptibility, with high-risk areas concentrated in the northwest, central, and northeastern regions. The BL-InSAR method achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8885, outperforming other methods by 2.69 %, 3.66 %, and 8.45 %, respectively. This framework enhances the interpretability of landslide susceptibility models by considering landslide creep dynamics through InSAR and integrating karst hydrogeological data.

 Under rapid urbanization, traditional single-class LCZ mapping methods fail to represent the coexistence of multiple land-cover types within the same block, resulting in blurred boundaries and reduced accuracy for urban heat-island modeling. To address this, LCZ mapping is reformulated as a mixed-scene unmixing task and tackled with a novel deep-learning framework, MSU-Net. Real street-block morphologies from OpenStreetMap are combined with 1 m Google Earth imagery to create multi-scale inputs that preserve both global block layouts and local detail. MSU-Net comprises a primary unmixing branch reinforced by two auxiliary guidance branches—one driven by purified-image semantic cues, the other by sparse local spatial reconstruction, and a Dual Cross-Attention Fusion (DCAF) module that integrates global–local and global–purified features under non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints. Two block-level datasets covering Wuhan and Shenzhen were created. MSU-Net outperforms existing methods on these datasets, boosting overall accuracy by 15–17 %, reducing mean absolute error by over 35 %, and cutting weighted-difference error by around 30 %.

 Accurate mapping of photovoltaic (PV) power plants is critical for monitoring the development of solar energy generation and supporting PV operational management, policy-making, and environmental analysis. However, existing geospatial datasets of PV power plants are either limited in spatial coverage, insufficient in resolution and accuracy, or outdated and lack timely updates, thus failing to meet these demands. To address this, we develop an efficient framework for global PV mapping that integrates the proposed adaptive normalized difference photovoltaic index (ANDPI) with a multi-source data fusion algorithm to extract accurate contours of PV power plants from Sentinel-2 imagery. We generate the global mapping product of PV power plants at 10 m resolution from 2019 to 2025. This mapping achieves an overall accuracy of 91.16 %, outperforming existing PV mapping products, while maintaining the processing speed of 140 km2 per second. Our analysis reveals that the global PV area expanded from 8432 km2 in 2019 to 16289 km2 in 2025, with China contributing 61 % of the growth. Besides, PV power plants are primarily deployed on rangeland (44.0 %) and cropland (40.1 %). Cropland held a slight dominance before 2021, after which rangeland accounted for a larger proportion. To the best of our knowledge, this geospatial dataset represents the most comprehensive global PV mapping product, offering the global spatial coverage, the highest resolution, and the most up-to-date information.

 Accurate semantic information about Martian rocks from rover images is crucial for scientific investigation and safe rover navigation. Due to the high cost and difficulty of obtaining dense manual annotations in Martian rock imagery, existing studies have focused mostly on semi-supervised and transfer learning strategies. However, segmentation under extremely sparse annotation conditions has not yet been investigated sufficiently. To fill this gap, we proposed a weakly supervised learning (WSL) framework, namely, Scribble-guided Object Uncertainty-aware Learning (SOUL), for Martian rock segmentation using scribble annotations. SOUL comprises two key components: an Object-level Pseudo-label Generation (OPG) strategy to generate pseudo-labels with accurate boundary characterization and an Uncertainty-aware Prototype-guided (UAPG) loss to refine the noisy pseudo-labels. Specifically, OPG generates object-level pseudo-labels by integrating instance decomposition with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), scribble-guided label assignment, and similarity-based label propagation. UAPG estimates pixel-wise uncertainty via modeling prototype-based feature similarities, enabling confidence-aware optimization. Extensive experiments on the TWMARS, MarsData-V2, and MSLRock datasets demonstrated that SOUL effectively increased segmentation quality under sparse supervision, outperforming six recent benchmarks. Moreover, ablation studies illustrated that both OPG and UAPG are crucial for enhancing segmentation performance. Furthermore, SOUL narrows the gap between weak and semi-supervision and between weak and full supervision. Overall, SOUL has great potential to reduce manual annotation effort while retaining competitive accuracy. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Tong-777777/SOUL."

 Nighttime light imagery plays a crucial role in diverse applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and economic analysis. Although NPP-VIIRS provides a long and continuous Nighttime light time series, its relatively low spatial resolution limits detailed spatial analysis. Achieving Nighttime light data with both high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of several deep learning–based super-resolution (SR) models for enhancing NPP-VIIRS Nighttime light imagery using Luojia1-01 data as high-resolution reference imagery. Five representative models—ESPCN, RDN, SRFBN, SwinIR, and RealESRGAN—were selected to cover a range of network architectures including CNN, RNN, ResNet, DenseNet, Transformer, and GAN. A paired SR dataset was constructed from Luojia1-01 and NPP-VIIRS images, and the selected models were trained and evaluated on this dataset. Model performance was assessed across different urban scales and lighting conditions (e.g., dense urban cores, road networks) using PSNR, SSIM, FSIM, and the 95th percentile metrics. Results indicate that model performance varies substantially across scene types, with RealESRGAN showing superior detail recovery and overall image quality (PSNR = 31.96, SSIM = 0.85, FSIM = 0.85). The 95th percentile distribution of the RealESRGAN-enhanced images closely matches that of high-resolution reference data.

 Accurate measurement of soil moisture content has significant scientific value and social benefits for studying global or regional water cycle mechanisms, developing climate and hydrological models, and advancing sustainable agricultural development. The Alpha approximation algorithm is regarded as one of the primary representatives among change detection methods and has been widely applied in soil moisture inversion. However, as the inversion time extends, the accumulation and propagation of inversion errors lead to a decrease in the inversion accuracy of the alpha approximation algorithm. In this study, three soil moisture observation networks, Tianjun, Nagqu, and Daman, in northwestern China are used as the research region. The optimization of the constraint strategy of the Alpha approximation algorithm is conducted by combining the Dubois model and Juxtaposition approach. The underdetermination issue of the Alpha approximation algorithm is also resolved by incorporating multi-angle synchronous observations to enrich the number of effective equations. Finally, we obtain an improved Alpha approximation algorithm based on the above approaches, and its inversion accuracy is also validated in the three study areas. Compared to the original alpha approximation algorithm, the improved algorithm demonstrates a significant enhancement in inversion accuracy. The RMSE, Bias, and R2 of the retrieval results in Tianjun region are 0.074 cm3/cm3, 0.452, and 0.682, respectively. Furthermore, the improved Alpha approximation algorithm also shows satisfactory performance across different regions and land surfaces. The RMSE, Bias, and R2 of the retrieval results in Nagqu observation networks are 0.076 cm3/cm3, 0.437, and 0.732 respectively. The RMSE, Bias, and R2 of the retrieval results in Daman observation networks are 0.05 cm3/cm3, 0.269, and 0.533, respectively. Meanwhile, the freezing and thawing processes, vegetation changes, and agriculture practices are the major considerations influencing the inversion accuracy of the Alpha approximation algorithm."

 Deep learning-based multimodal remote sensing image (RSI) semantic segmentation models have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to leverage complementary information across modalities, resulting in more robust and accurate Earth observation. However, most existing approaches rely predominantly on convolutional neural networks with limited receptive fields or transformer-based architectures that are computationally intensive. In this study, we proposed a multimodal cross fusion Mamba (MCF-Mamba) network for multimodal RSI semantic segmentation, aiming to collaboratively enhance accuracy and efficiency. The proposed network features three core components: a dual-branch VMamba encoder, a multimodal cross-Mamba fusion module, and a U-shaped Mamba decoder. The architecture with a unified structure centered on the selective state space model ensures that it achieves global perception with linear complexity. Furthermore, for addressing the constraint of limited labeled samples in practical applications, we developed a generative multimodal complementary masked self-supervised (CMSS) strategy. It leverages abundant unlabeled RSIs to learn generalized multimodal representations by modeling intermodal complementary consistency. Extensive experiments on three public datasets involving optical-SAR and optical-DEM modalities demonstrated that the proposed network and strategy are superior to other advanced segmentation models and self-supervised methods in land cover mapping and building extraction tasks. The MCF-Mamba network achieves the highest accuracy while significantly reducing both model size and computational cost, and further improves the accuracy and generalization through the CMSS strategy.

 Potato is the world’s most important non-cereal food crop, crucial for global food security and agricultural sustainability. Large-scale potato mapping faces persistent challenges, primarily due to scarce training samples, complex background crop compositions, and limited spectral distinctiveness compared to staple crops. To overcome the persistent limitations in ground data dependency, we propose a novel Potato Mapping Index (PMI) that leverages Sentinel-2 temporal phenology to enable scalable potato identification without field sampling. The PMI operates dynamically based on crop phenological stages, utilizing Sentinel-2 bands (B8 (NIR) and B12 (SWIR-2)) and indices (normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and red edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI)) to accentuate spectral differences between potatoes and background crops. This approach effectively isolates the unique spectral signature of potato crops, facilitating accurate and efficient mapping. Validated across multiple years and in six key potato-producing countries (Belgium, China, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States), the PMI achieved an average overall accuracy (OA) of 92% and Kappa coefficients exceeding 0.8. These performance metrics are notably higher than those of the traditional supervised classifier, random forest (RF) model, which yielded an average OA of 90% and an average Kappa coefficient of 0.72. The resulting maps show high agreement with reference datasets, demonstrating robust spatiotemporal generalization. These findings offer a novel and valuable approach for global-scale potato mapping."

 This work explores the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series imagery to investigate the differences in vineyards associated with varying soil substrates. The investigation was carried out by selecting vineyards in the Piana Rotaliana wine growing area of the autonomous province of Trento (Italy). Consistent time-series datasets were defined by selecting vineyards trained under the same trellis system and avoiding plantation renewal between 2017 and 2023. To extract Land Surface Phenology (LSP) the best configuration between vegetation indices and fitting methods for deriving LSP features was investigated. The results indicate that Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) provides better stability with respect to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). For each vineyard statistical metrics were derived like LSP, Growing Season (GS; good observation within the LSP time period) and off Season (good observation outside the LSP time period) metrics. Eight datasets were defined and a Random Forest model was employed to assess classification accuracy and evaluate its stability across the years. Findings suggest that the substrate effect can be distinguished both from off Season and Growing Season metrics. Vegetation water content indices, such as the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI), emerged as the most effective and temporally stable predictors. The off Season datasets provided generally better results with respect to GS datasets when the model of one year was tested over the remaining years. The results provide valuable insights into the potential influence of soil characteristics on grapevine response over time, by highlighting the water retention capacity of the substrate and the vineyard response."

 Reliable quantification of carbon fluxes in humid tropical regions is constrained by persistent cloud cover, heterogeneous land mosaics, and the limited resolution of existing products. To address these challenges, this study developed a Cloud-Resilient Fusion Network (CRFNet) that integrates Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter with cloud-screened Sentinel-2 NDVI using a CNN–BiLSTM–multi-head attention architecture. The framework reconstructed 10 m NDVI time series in Kuala Selangor, Malaysia (2020–2024), achieving annual R2 above 0.82 and RMSE below 0.12, thereby improving temporal continuity under heavy cloud–rainfall interference. The reconstructed NDVI was used to drive a light-use-efficiency model for net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation, supported by temperature-based heterotrophic respiration. Results showed a 7.4 % decline in mean annual NEP across five years, with degraded mangroves and sloping croplands emerging as hotspots of sink-to-source transitions. Landscape analysis revealed strong structure–function coupling: stable forests and mangroves were characterized by large cohesive patches with largest patch index values above 40 % and edge density below 20 m ha-1, while croplands and degraded slopes exhibited higher patch numbers, reduced patch dominance, and greater edge complexity, which increased carbon source risk. By linking fine-scale NDVI reconstruction with process-based carbon modeling and landscape metrics, this study provides a transferable workflow for high-resolution carbon flux monitoring and a robust scientific basis for carbon budget assessment, ecosystem management, and carbon-neutrality planning in tropical monsoon regions."

 Understanding vertical forest structure is essential for forest management and is strongly linked to ecosystem functioning. In countries with protective forests, sustainable management is key to protecting humans and infrastructure from natural hazards. Well-structured forests usually feature multiple canopy layers, enhancing resistance and resilience to natural disturbances, reducing vulnerability to natural hazards, and improving adaptation to environmental changes. Forests with a single canopy layer often require prioritised and targeted management to increase their structural complexity. Hence, mapping forest canopy layering is crucial for effective forest management and risk mitigation.We developed a reproducible method for large-scale mapping of forest canopy layering to support sustainable forest management. Using airborne laser scanning data, we combined tree- and area-based methods to distinguish between single- and multi-layered forest areas in Switzerland. Our study encompasses four forest ecoregions, seven altitudinal vegetation belts, and a variety of topographic and climatic conditions. The resulting canopy layering map (resolution 10 x 10 m) was validated against two forest structure data sets, one from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (279 plots) and an Independent Forester Assessment (198 plots), yielding overall accuracies of 68 % and 81 %, respectively. Our study provides a robust and scalable method for mapping forest canopy layering across large mountain areas, which is transferable to other regions. Validation across various environmental settings demonstrates the suitability of the approach for nationwide use. Our forest canopy layering map supports sustainable, climate change-adapted forest management decisions, helping to set management priorities that promote well-structured forests for the future."

 Assessing long-term changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) together with Aerosol Radiative Forcing Efficiency (ARFE, defined as radiative forcing per unit visible AOD) provides critical insight into the evolving role of different aerosol species in regional climate forcing. In this study, we analyse two decades of AOD trends (2001–2020) across eight climatically diverse regions using a multivariate regression framework, and quantify species-specific radiative effects with the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. The regions were chosen to represent contrasting trends in total AOD. Our results show that sulfate aerosols, which account for the largest share of AOD over India (∼36–45 %), are the primary driver of increasing AOD and associated atmospheric warming. Black carbon (BC), although contributing only a minor fraction to total AOD (2–10 %), emerges as the dominant warming agent across most regions, with particularly strong forcing signals over the Middle East. In contrast, sea-salt (SS) aerosols exert the largest cooling influence, most prominently over the Southern African (SAF) region, partially offsetting warming from absorbing species. Europe, despite an overall decline in AOD, exhibits a slight increase in SS that sustains a regional cooling effect. These findings demonstrate that species composition, vertical distribution, and optical properties govern ARFE more strongly than the total AOD magnitude alone. By linking AOD trends with species-resolved radiative forcing efficiency across multiple regions, this study advances the interpretability of ARFE as a climate indicator and highlights its potential to inform policy-relevant assessment of aerosol-driven warming and cooling."

 Carbon monoxide (CO) is a trace gas that affects atmospheric oxidative capacity and climate change, making accurate source apportionment crucial. Here, for the first time, we identified the isotopic signatures (δ18O) of industrial-related CO sources in Changzhi of Northern China. And total 21 ambient CO samples were collected from July 17 to July 21, 2023 with the duration of 2 h. These signatures were integrated with the Stable Isotope Analysis in R (MixSIAR) model to apportion CO sources. During the observation period, the average CO mixing ratio was 0.73 ± 0.26 ppm, which exceeded the summer average levels in both China and globally. Industrial-related sources exhibited distinct δ18O enrichment (24.5 ± 1.0 ‰ for steel industry to 29.2 ± 0.1 ‰ for heavy-duty diesel trucks). They are clearly separated from existed δ18O signatures from secondary formation and vehicle sources, thus providing essential reference data for isotopic source apportionment. The δ18O values of ambient CO varied by 3.5 ‰ overall, while diurnal fluctuations were minor (approximately 0.3 ‰), indicating relative stability on diurnal scale. Incorporating industrial-related isotopic signatures into MixSIAR, contribution of primary emissions decreased from 73.6 % to 56.0 %. These results indicate only based on existed source spectra (non-methane hydrocarbons oxidation and light-duty vehicle emissions) substantially overestimate the contribution of primary sources. These findings fill a knowledge gap concerning the isotopic signatures of industrial CO emissions and emphasize the importance of incorporating localized isotopic signatures into source apportionment. This work also provides basis for developing targeted mitigation strategies in industrial cities."

 In the hilly areas of Northeast India, extensive forest cover is cleared and burned to prepare the land for shifting cultivation. A monitoring campaign was undertaken in shifting cultivation areas of West Garo Hills District of Meghalaya in Northeast India to assess the contribution of biomass burning to particulate matter (PM) bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The study was conducted across three stages viz., pre-burning, burning, and post-burning, corresponding to the timing of the burning activities of shifting cultivation. During the burning stage of shifting cultivation, there was a substantial rise in atmospheric total PAHs levels. PM10 bound PAH averaged at 1098 ± 482 ng m−3 and PM2.5 bound PAH at 854 ± 330 ng m−3, marking an increment of 16–17 times, respectively, compared to the pre-burning stage. Subsequent rainfall events reduced total PAHs levels during the post-burning stage by 30 and 25 times, respectively for PM10 and PM2.5 bound PAHs compared to the burning stage. Diagnostic ratios of specific PAH isomers suggested biomass burning as the major contributor to PM loading in the study area. Other sources include long-range transport of vehicle emissions, soil, and dust from surface mineral. Multiple Pathway Particle Dosimetry model indicated that inhaling smoke from biomass burning in the area increased PM deposition in the alveolar region by 9–10 times compared to non-burning stage.

 Diesel engines are highly efficient and proven workshorse for heavy-duty automotive applications globally. However, they face challenges in controlling particulate matter emissions. Gasoline compression ignition technology simultaneously controls engine-out particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. This study employed gasoline compression ignition technology using a 70:30 % (v/v) gasoline-diesel blend (G70) as a low-reactivity test fuel and an optimised fuel injection strategy. An open electronic control unit operated the engine in gasoline compression ignition mode. Tests were performed at different engine speeds (1500–2500 rev/min) and loads (5 and 10-bar brake mean effective pressure). The engine was also operated using a stock electronic control unit in baseline conventional diesel combustion mode. Particle numbers and soot mass were measured for all test cases. Soot morphology and nano-structures were analysed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the soot particle's graphene layer. Trace metal elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soot were assessed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results concluded that gasoline compression ignition emitted a lower PM mass than the baseline diesel. Diesel soot showed larger primary particles and compact aggregates, whereas chain-like soot aggregates were seen in the G70 soot. The primary particle diameter increased with engine speed but decreased with engine load. Twenty-seven trace elements and 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the soot sample, accounting for ∼6.64–8.85 % (w/w) of the particulate matter mass."

 Growing epidemiological evidence has reported neurological effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), showing stronger effects of certain PM2.5 constituents. Among the neurologic outcomes examined so far, pediatric seizure has been rarely assessed. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study using pediatric seizure outpatient data from a children's hospital in Shanghai. Individual-level daily concentration of PM2.5 and its chemical components (black carbon, organic matter, nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) were estimated with a satellite-based spatiotemporal model. A conditional logistic regression with distributed lag model (DLM) was applied to estimate the associations of PM2.5 and components with pediatric seizure risk over 14 days preceding to the onset date. Quantile-based g-computation (qgcomp) approach was used to assess the joint effect of a mixture of PM2.5 components. Analyses were further stratified by sex, age, onset with/without fever, and onset with/without epilepsy. A positive association between PM2.5 or each of the components, except organic matter, and pediatric seizure onset was observed with lag windows ranging from 0 to 7 days up to 0–14 days. In the multi-pollutant model, per interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure to the mixture of all five PM2.5 components were associated with a odds ratio (OR) of 1.03 (95 % CI: 0.95, 2.57). Black carbon and nitrate contributed the most to the positive association, accounting for 47 % and 42 %, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed a larger effect size in children under 5 years old, males, children with concomitant seizure and fever, and children without epilepsy, respectively. Short-term (daily average) exposure to PM2.5 may be a risk factor for the onset of pediatric seizure. Black carbon and nitrate were the two most important constituents contributing to the PM2.5 effect. In addition, younger children, males, and children with seizure and fever co-occurring, and children without epilepsy appeared more susceptible."

 Airborne contamination by non-dioxin-like (NDL) and dioxin-like (DL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is a prevalent and significant issue affecting industrial cities worldwide and is a potential health hazard for humans and wildlife. This study investigates the contamination and health risks of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in indoor and outdoor dust from Hefei, China. The mean concentrations of ΣNDL-PCBs were 56.27 ng/g and 7.47 ng/g for indoor and outdoor dust, respectively, while ΣDL-PCBs averaged 98.81 ng/g in indoor dust and 92.86 ng/g in outdoor dust. A probabilistic health risk assessment was conducted for different age groups. The results revealed distinct PCB distribution patterns, with PCBs primarily concentrated in finer particle sizes (26–62 μm) indoors compared to outdoors (>62 μm). The health risk assessment is based on a probabilistic human health risk assessment model developed by Monte Carlo simulation methodology for five different age groups, highlighting the acceptable noncarcinogenic health effects indicated by the hazard index (HI) values. The Monte Carlo simulation was conducted with 10,000 iterations, and the 95 % confidence interval was used to express the uncertainty of the risk estimates. Exposure parameters, such as the dust intake rate, body weight, and exposure parameter, were incorporated as probabilistic inputs based on established literature or survey data. However, concerning indoor dust, the study raises concerns regarding infants' exposure to DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs, with a total cancer risk (TCR) probability close to 5 % and exceeding the acceptable risk level of 1.00E-6 as defined by the US EPA. DL-PCBs consistently demonstrated higher hazard index and TCR values than NDL-PCBs across all scenarios. These findings highlight health concern for infants and underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate PCB contamination and reduce exposure, particularly in indoor environments."

 Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is a major global health concern, yet the potential relationships between its chemical and microbial components remains poorly understood, particularly in rapidly urbanizing, understudied settings.

Microbial analysis revealed that the richness and community structure of the airborne bacterial and fungal communities varied with land-use type, linked with PAH/NPAH abundance, PM size fraction, and season. Spearman correlation coefficient confirmed that bacterial communities were more strongly associated with PAH and NPAH compounds, whereas fungal communities were shaped primarily by environmental factors. One bacterial genus, Sphingobium, exhibited evidence of selective enrichment within the PAH rich PM2.5 size fraction, highlighting the potential for direct interaction between the biological and chemical compositions in air. We provide a critical baseline for African cities where air quality data are scarce.

 The health effects of combined exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on lung function in adults with asthma remain unclear, and the underlying metabolic mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this panel study, 53 adult asthma patients underwent repeated home visits where indoor air samples were collected for VOC measurement, lung function was assessed, and exhaled breath condensate samples were obtained for untargeted metabolomic analysis. We used linear mixed effects models to evaluate associations between individual VOCs and lung function parameters. VOCs exhibiting significant individual effects were further analyzed using quantile g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression models to assess combined exposure effects and identify key contributors. Metabolic pathways were explored through mediation analysis. The linear mixed effects models identified 11 VOC components significantly and negatively associated with lung function: methacrolein, acetone, butyl acetate, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, n-hexane, octane, and hexadecane. The quantile g-computation model revealed a significant negative joint effect of these VOCs on lung function, with ethylbenzene and methacrolein contributing most substantially. These findings were corroborated by the Bayesian kernel machine regression model, supporting the robustness of the results. Mediation analysis demonstrated that proline, glycine, putrescine, and phenylethanolamine mediated the effect of trichloroethylene on reduced percent predicted peak expiratory flow, accounting for 31.0 %–41.6 % of the total effect. In conclusion, combined exposure to indoor VOCs adversely affects lung function in adults with asthma, mediated in part by specific metabolites. These findings underscore the importance of addressing indoor air quality in asthma management strategies."

 ObjectiveAlthough the benefits of green and blue spaces on human health are widely recognized, their modifying effect on the association between particulate matter (PM) exposure and the mortality risk of myocardial infarction (MI) remains insufficiently documented.MethodsA time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to analyze PM exposure and 13,629 MI-related deaths in Anhui Province from 2019 to 2023. Conditional logistic regression combined with natural cubic splines was used to estimate exposure–response relationships. Modification effects were evaluated for green spaces within 500–5000 m buffers and for different blue spaces.ResultsFor every interquartile-range increase in PM2.5 and PM10 exposure during the lag period of 0–1 days, the odds ratios (OR) of MI mortality were 1.14 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.11, 1.18) and 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.06, 1.13). Significant effect modification was observed only for green space within the 3000 m buffer (P < 0.05), with ORs of 1.10 (95 % CI: 1.05, 1.15) and 1.18 (95 % CI: 1.14, 1.23) in the high and low green space groups. PM10-related risk was lower in the high blue space group than in the low blue space group (OR: 1.06 vs 1.13), with marginal statistical significance was detected (P = 0.063). Stronger PM–MI associations were observed in the cold season and among individuals aged ≥65 years (P < 0.05).ConclusionGreen space, particularly within 3000 m of the residence, may mitigate PM-related MI mortality risk, whereas the modifying effect of blue space was not significant."

 Vegetation is increasingly used in urban areas to improve microclimate and reduce pollutant exposure, yet its effect on pollutant dispersion within street canyons remains complex. This study combines high-resolution wind tunnel experiments and Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) using uDALES to provide a detailed three-dimensional characterization of airflow and pollutant concentration along the canyon.Special attention is given to the consistent scaling of velocity and scalar fields, using friction velocity and canyon geometry as reference quantities, and to the role of tree drag length in aligning the aerodynamic resistance of physical and numerical vegetation. The simulations reproduce key mean-flow structures, including large-scale recirculations, but tend to underestimate turbulent kinetic energy and local scalar fluxes.By jointly analyzing high-resolution wind-tunnel experiments and LES, we (i) confirm the spanwise and longitudinal concentration patterns observed experimentally, (ii) assess their sensitivity to the modeled tree drag, (iii) provide the first detailed experimental–numerical comparison of rooftop mean and turbulent mass fluxes, showing that bulk canyon ventilation exhibits no systematic dependence on tree number or drag intensity, and (iv) identify the specific strengths and limitations of each approach. This integrated analysis offers novel insights into the interplay between trees, turbulence, and boundary-layer forcing, informing strategies for modeling urban ventilation and pollutant dispersion in tree-lined streets."

 The open burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) remains a prevalent yet underreported source of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions, particularly in developing and transition economies. This study updates the 2006 IPCC activity inventory methods and subsequent refinements to quantify emissions from open waste burning (OWB) in Asian countries. The emissions from OWB were estimated using updated emission factors for particulate matter 10 μm (PM10), 2.5 μm (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and dioxins, estimating a total release of approximately 16.51 Megatons (Mt) of CO, 1.50 Mt of PM10, 1.42 Mt of PM2.5, 0.50 Mt of NOx, and 0.20 Mt of SO2 annually. The total annual climate impact is estimated at 249 Mt CO2-equivalents (CO2e), with South Asia accounting for over 39 % of these emissions owing to high population densities and limited formal waste services. These findings highlight the urgent need to explicitly incorporate open burning in national emission inventories and waste strategies while also strengthening institutional capacity, regulatory enforcement, and community-based interventions to reduce this overlooked source of pollution and climate impact."

 Free amino acids (FAAs) in ambient PM2.5 samples were investigated at a forest site in the Qinling Mountains region of central China to explore their chemical characteristics, potential atmospheric processes, and sources across four seasons of 2021–2022. A total of 14 FAAs were quantitatively characterized using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The mass concentrations of total FAAs varied from 6.4 to 48.5 ng m−3 (mean 23 ± 11 ng m−3) over the study periods, with higher levels in spring and summer. The compositional characteristics of total FAAs varied in different seasons. Among them, valine was mostly abundant, accounting for 39 ± 5 % of total FAAs, followed by alanine (14 ± 5 %) and glycine (14 ± 6 %). The correlations of FAAs with oxidants O3 and NO2 suggest that atmospheric oxidation capacity promoted their production, but the effects on individual ones varied. The total FAAs correlated negatively with ambient relative humidity but positively with temperature, indicating that meteorology was important factors governing the FAAs formation. Seven sources for PM2.5 and FAAs, including biomass burning, gasoline vehicles exhaust, biological emissions, coal combustion, secondary formation, dust, and agricultural activities, were resolved from positive matrix factorization analysis. Biological emissions and agricultural activities were found to be the dominant sources of FAAs in this forest atmosphere. The contributions of these sources to individual FAAs varied substantially across different seasons. This study highlights the seasonal variability in the compositional characteristics of FAAs affected by the environmental factors and sources."

 ""Iron-fisted Smog Control '1 + 9' Action Plan"" in Shaanxi Province in 2017 promoted clean heating in rural households including ""coal-to-gas"" and ""coal-to-electricity"" conversions. This study collected PM2.5 samples in Xi'an during three periods (pre-, mid-, and post-policy implementation from 2016 to 2021) and quantified policy-driven changes in particulate toxicity and underlying influence factors through DCFH-based oxidative potential (OP) measurements. The results demonstrated significant decreases in characteristic metals from residential combustion sources (As, Pb, K) alongside increases in vehicular emission tracers (Cu, Mn) during policy implementation. A progressive decline in OP (16.28 ± 2.43, 14.41 ± 2.59, and 13.77 ± 2.62 nM H2O2 m−3 in pre-, mid-, and post-policy implementation periods) confirmed the efficacy of clean energy projects in reducing oxidative stress potential. OP showed strong positive correlations (R = 0.35–0.47, P < 0.01) with water-soluble toxic metals (Fe, Cu, Mn). The source apportionment of PM2.5 OP was conducted using a combined approach of positive matrix factorization and multilayer perceptron. The results revealed that the contribution of residential combustion sources to OP decreased from 32.1 % before the policy implementation to 25.9 % afterward, showing a significant response to the clean energy policies enacted in the Guanzhong region. Meanwhile, in the post-policy period, vehicle emissions (37.3 %) surpassed residential combustion as a major contributor to OP. This study verifies that policy interventions focusing on replacing scattered coal and biomass burning effectively reduced PM2.5 OP through decreasing toxic coal/biomass combustion components (As, Pb, K), achieving dual-control strategies targeting both mass concentration and toxicity reduction in precision air pollution management."

 India is the 3rd largest emitter of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2), highlighting the critical need to understand CO2 dynamics for effective carbon management. This study investigates the CO2 variability and its dynamics over India using ground-based in situ measurements (11 sites), satellite observations and model simulations. The analyses reveal distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns, along with a consistent increasing trend with global-mean CO2 concentrations. The amplitude of seasonal cycles (SCAs) vary geographically, with deeper SCAs observed in northern India and shallower ones in the south, primarily influenced by the monsoon system and temperature-dependent vegetation dynamics. The lowest SCA is observed over the high-altitude site at Hanle in north India (7.4 ppm), followed by the coastal sites at Pondicherry (8.0 ppm) and Thumba (8.5 ppm) in south India. The deepest SCA of 26.7 ppm is observed at Mohali, with one of the peaks observed in November attributed to crop residue burning in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. We have used an Atmospheric Chemistry Transport Model (ACTM) to understand spatial and temporal variations in CO2. The model simulates the phase of the SCAs reasonably well at only a few sites, e.g., Thumba, Gadanki, and fails to capture details at most sites. Coarse horizontal resolution of ACTM (2.8o × 2.8°) limits the reproduction of observed diurnal pattern at the sites near strong fluxes. Satellite observations of total column CO2 (XCO2) anomalies (2014–2024) show negative values (indicative of sink) over India during post-monsoon season, and positive values (indicative of source) during premonsoon season. The regional mean XCO2 SCA (5.45–5.65 ppm), trend (2.44–2.51 ppm y−1) and interannual variability in growth rates (∼1.0–3.9 ppm y−1) are consistently estimated from two satellites during 2009–2024."

 High-latitude regions are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and global warming. Organic aerosols are widespread and play a vital role in the Earth's climate; therefore, monitoring their molecular distributions, sources, and formation processes is essential. The present study investigates water-soluble dicarboxylic acids and related secondary organic compounds in aerosols from the Gruvebadet observatory in Ny-Ålesund during summer 2023 to gain insights into the formation processes of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the Arctic atmosphere. The results indicate that oxalic acid (C2) was the most abundant, followed by succinic (C4) and phthalic (Ph) acids, as well as malonic (C3) and azelaic (C9) acids. The higher abundance of C4 over C3 (on average) suggests relatively fresh emission sources. The high fumaric-to-maleic (F/M) ratios (mean: 1.14 ± 0.46) and diacids-C/TC ratios (16.4 ± 6.67 %) indicate that photochemical processes were a significant source of diacids throughout the sampling period. The mass diagnostic ratios indicate that the photochemical oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) enriched in the sea-surface micro-layer is the primary source of SOA, followed by the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHCs). Furthermore, quantification of C2 associated with the photooxidation of UFAs was conducted using a linear relationship-based approach. The results show that on average, 61 ± 20 % (range: 9–83 %) of C2 was derived from the oxidation of UFAs, with the rest was attributed to the photooxidation of AHCs. The present study also highlighted potential uncertainties in using regression-based source apportionment of C2 with bootstrap analysis. These findings will improve our understanding of the transformation processes of organic aerosols, which are vital for climate modellers to accurately estimate SOA mass and its climatic effects, especially in the Arctic environment."

 Urban air pollution requires analytical tools that capture complex temporal dynamics while remaining interpretable for policy purposes. This study applies Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to hourly concentrations of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 measured in 2024 at eight monitoring stations in Madrid. By transforming high-dimensional time series into smooth functional data, FPCA identifies dominant modes of variability and reveals structural differences among sites.Across all pollutants, the first three components explained more than 85% of total variance. PC1 represented the main seasonal cycle, PC2 reflected short-term fluctuations driven by traffic and meteorology, and PC3 captured episodic peaks. The score plots highlighted consistent clustering: background stations (Casa de Campo, Sanchinarro) showed low levels and weak seasonality; traffic-oriented stations (Plaza Elíptica, Cuatro Caminos, Escuelas Aguirre) displayed high concentrations and stronger cycles; and intermediate sites (Castellana, Plaza Castilla, Méndez Álvaro) exhibited mixed patterns.These findings confirm FPCA as an efficient diagnostic framework for air quality assessment, offering both dimensionality reduction and interpretability. Beyond methodological value, the approach enables classification of monitoring sites and supports targeted mitigation strategies. FPCA thus provides a transferable tool for urban air quality management and a solid basis for functional data analysis in environmental policy contexts."

 Subway systems provide an important mode of sustainable urban public transportation reducing traffic congestion and vehicle emissions. However, there are increasing concerns over the elevated levels of particulate matter (PM) concentrations found in the subway and the potential health effects from train-related emissions. These emission sources are common worldwide with the highest concentrations driven by lack of ventilation, tunnel depth and distance from tunnel openings. The aim of this study was to assess PM2.5 mass concentrations, particle number concentrations and particle number size distributions by taking measurements inside a train carriage in a London Underground deep-tunnelled line. A fully portable, battery powered Mobile Reference Station (MoRS) was developed to obtain simultaneous measurements of oxides of nitrogen, ozone and all size fractions of PM in train carriages across 16 distinct Bakerloo Line subway journeys. In the tunnelled sections of the Bakerloo line mean PM2.5 concentrations were 343 (115) μg m−3, with mean concentrations peaking at 550 (45) μg m−3 at Marylebone Station. A moderate negative correlation between PM2.5 and NO2 was demonstrated likely influenced by a complex relationship linking tunnel depth, ventilation, ambient air, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations. PM2.5 concentrations and particle size distributions were seen to be driven by the piston effect of moving trains and settling processes. Using particle number size distributions, ultrafine particles were found to constitute 84 % of subway particle number concentrations with 99 % of subway particles having a diameter less than 530 nm. Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA) was used to estimate PM exposure during the subway journeys. Importantly, total LDSA for PM2.5 was higher in the subway than at a London roadside site. Overall, this study provides a basis to begin to control specific train related emission sources and to improve air quality management through focused mitigation strategies in the London Underground and worldwide subway systems."

 Accurate methane concentration measurements are essential for trace gas flux studies in agricultural and environmental research, such as estimating emissions from rice paddies. We developed a novel direct calibration method with high pressure cylinders for determination of methane in atmospheric pressure portable bags using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. This advanced approach eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone indirect calibration process frequently used in real practice. We modeled gas behavior in the sample loop, ensuring consistent pressure across container types. Four sampling configurations were tested, with Configuration 1 achieving negligible biases (−0.083 to −0.310 μmol mol−1) across methane concentrations of 27.9–48.6 μmol mol−1 in N2 or synthetic air, compared to significant biases (−4.1 % to −11.4 %) in Configurations 2–4 due to improper gas flow. A strong linear cause-and-effect relationship (R2 = 0.9953) was established between gas pressure bias in the SL and methane concentration bias. The single-point-through-origin calibration model, supported by a detailed uncertainty estimation, showed a maximum relative bias of −0.83 % for Configuration 1, statistically insignificant at the 95 % confidence level (expanded uncertainty 1.1 %, 0.31 μmol mol−1). The equivalence decision criterion (D ≤ 1.0) confirmed that methane concentrations in Tedlar bags were statistically indistinguishable from calibration cylinders. This analytical approach enhances the practical benefits of portable bags, including their lightweight design and ease of handling, for reliable sample storage and transport. The findings provide theoretical insights and practical guidance for reliable methane quantification, applicable to greenhouse gas analysis across various sectors, improving the accuracy of trace gas flux measurements."

 This study examines tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column densities (VCDs) over Thailand using ground-based Pandora observations in Bangkok and S5P/TROPOMI satellite data at the national scale. Pandora measurements reveal distinct diurnal and weekly cycles, with sharp rush-hour peaks and lower weekend values, reflecting strong anthropogenic influence. Monthly and seasonal analyses show that NO2 is highest in winter and lowest during the monsoon, influenced by the height of the boundary layer, precipitation, and photolysis rates. A comparison of Pandora and S5P/TROPOMI monthly averages shows strong temporal agreement while revealing a consistent low bias in S5P/TROPOMI. A seasonal breakdown shows the highest agreement in summer, moderate agreement in winter, and the poorest performance during the rainy season. At the national scale, the highest NO2 levels are concentrated in central Thailand, especially Bangkok (5.59 × 1015 molec/cm2). Elevated column amounts also appear across the Bangkok Metropolitan Region and the Eastern Economic Corridor, consistent with urban–industrial sources, while Lampang exhibits a distinct hotspot associated with emissions from the Mae Moh power plant. The seasonal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) also follows the NO2 pattern, with high AOD corresponding to elevated NO2 levels during winter in central Thailand and during summer in northern Thailand. In contrast, both AOD and NO2 decrease substantially during the rainy season due to enhanced wet deposition and more efficient atmospheric cleansing. These results highlight the dominant influence of traffic, industry, and power generation on Thailand's NO2 burden."

 Accurate, high-frequency monitoring of aerosols is essential for understanding their dynamic behaviour, regional transport pathways, environmental and climatic impacts. Geostationary satellites are particularly well-suited for this purpose. In this study, we utilized INSAT-3DR satellite observations to retrieve high-quality sub-hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) using a data-driven approach guided by a physically meaningful and interpretable machine learning framework. For this, we constructed a novel fused AOD product by integrating ground-based and satellite-based observations through hybrid statistical approach. The fused AOD showed a strong correlation coefficient (r ∼ 0.95) and low root mean square error (RMSE ∼ 0.06) with ground-based observations. Making use of this fused AOD as the target variable, an XGBoost machine learning model is trained with features derived from INSAT-3DR visible and infrared channels. The resulting model demonstrates strong performance in retrieving AOD from INSAT-3DR (r ∼ 0.839 and RMSE ∼ 0.081; relative to fused AOD), effectively capturing the regional distribution of aerosol hotspots, sub-hourly variability, and key pollution events, indicating robust generalization across diverse aerosol regimes and surface types. Furthermore, INSAT-3DR AOD exhibits strong temporal consistency with the ground-based observations at sub-hourly and seasonal scales with site-specific RMSE generally within 0.10. These findings establish INSAT-3DR as a valuable platform for continuous aerosol monitoring and present a transferable framework for future geostationary missions aimed at environmental and climate applications."

 The Sichuan Basin is one of China's most haze-prone regions due to its unique topography and stagnant meteorological conditions. To understand the winter haze formation mechanisms in the Sichuan Basin, a field campaign was conducted in a previously identified pollution hotspot (Southern Sichuan, December 2024 to February 2025). During this campaign, PM2.5 concentration averaged 63.79 ± 42.92 μg m−3, and we identified three haze episodes (H1-H3) during this campaign. The chemical speciation of fine aerosol was characterized using a quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor (Q-ACSM), and the apportionment of organic aerosols (OAs) was solved by EPA PMF 5.0. The results indicated that OAs dominated the PM2.5 composition throughout this campaign, with OA concentrations particularly high in H1 (64.63 ± 20.77 μg m−3) and H2 (64.11 ± 19.05 μg m−3). Biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOA) and oxygenated organic aerosols (OOA) were the primary contributors to these high concentrations. The haze episodes resulted mainly from early-stage biomass burning emissions and less-aged OOA, occurring concurrently with the highest levels of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), suggesting the humid air can favor the formation of haze. In addition to local emissions, regional transport synergized with meteorological conditions also significantly contributed to haze formation during this campaign, especially in H2 (38.2 %), quantified by a machine learning based deweathering analysis. This study underscores the intricate interplay between emissions, regional transport, and meteorology in driving haze formation in the Sichuan Basin and demonstrates the utility of machine learning aided diagnostics for source attribution and regulatory insights."

 Organic peroxyl radicals (RO2·) serve as crucial intermediates in atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) degradation process, playing a pivotal role in the formation of secondary air pollution in the atmosphere. Among naturally generated RO2 radical species, the Isoprene peroxyl radical derived from the oxidation of isoprene produced by plants, exhibits a relatively high concentration. It can drive the formation of photochemical ozone (O3), facilitate the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and organic nitrates, and is of critical importance in modulating the atmospheric oxidation capacity. Consequently, the accurate detection of the chemical behavior of isoprene peroxyl radical is of great significance for simulating and predicting regional air quality and evaluating the impact of nitrogen deposition on ecosystems. In this study, we for the first time report a furan - based fluorescent probe (IND-F). Through a specific capture reaction, this probe enables the in-situ quantitative detection of isoprene peroxyl radicals (ISOP34O2) in the atmosphere for the first time. This method features high sensitivity and offers a novel tool for the direct and convenient monitoring of specific radical species in the atmospheric environment."

 Uncontrolled urbanization has deep-rooted impacts on the environment, including weather, climate, and pollution, threatening the sustainability of cities. The current study focuses on six cities of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), which act as hotspots of air pollution across the country. Machine learning (ML) algorithms were utilized to analyze and forecast four major air pollutants, viz., NO2, SO2, O3, and PM2.5. The model performances based on RMSE, MAE, and R2 values suggested that Linear Regression (LR) outperformed other models considered, and was more accurate in short-term prediction. In most of the considered cities, the overall trends (Mann-Kendall test) of four selected air pollutants are expected to remain unaltered in coming years, except for Delhi and Ludhiana. The PM2.5 concentrations exhibit a strong increasing trend both during the observed and forecasted period, except for Chandigarh-Mohali. Notably, Kolkata exhibited an increasing trend for all four air pollutants while demonstrating higher values of PM2.5 (200–450 μg/m3), which were greatly impacted by the pollution from nearby land and transport pathways over neighboring oceans. The analysis and forecasting (using ConvLSTM model) of urban land use was done to further associate urbanization with air pollution. Strong correlation signatures were noticed in all cities, either at the core or near the periphery (except for Chandigarh-Mohali), when the interplay was assessed through urban heat and pollution islands. Therefore, with prolonged exposure to air pollutants, the urban population is at higher risk of several pulmonary ailments, as the estimated mortality associated with PM2.5 for cardiovascular, respiratory, and lung infections indicated a constant increase over the years."

 Influenza is a serious respiratory infection that imposes significant public health challenges. However, the precise impact of pollutants on influenza virus activity remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of different air pollutants on the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza A (Flu A), and influenza B (Flu B) in China based on nationwide air pollution and influenza data from 554 sentinel hospitals across 30 provinces and municipalities from 2014 to 2017. A Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM) was employed to discern the lagged effects of six distinct air pollutants, namely PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, and NO2, on the incidence of ILI, Flu A, and Flu B. Our analysis indicated that the relationship between air pollutants and influenza varied among ILI, Flu A, and Flu B, with Flu B being more sensitive to SO2 than Flu A. Elevated levels of air pollutants were generally associated with an increased risk of influenza; however, relative risks declined slightly at extreme concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2.

 Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) is a key secondary organosulfur compound formed through aqueous-phase or heterogeneous atmospheric processes, significantly affecting the atmospheric sulfur budget. However, the relationship between HMS and PM2.5 components, as well as its formation mechanism, remains insufficiently explored. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of HMS at two sites in the North China Plain (NCP). Using offline filter analysis combined with theoretical calculations, we found that the HMS mass concentration in Gucheng during the winter of 2019 averaged 2.58 ± 2.56 μg/m3, approximately 1.5 times of that in Beijing during winter and 5.0 times of that in Beijing during autumn. This elevated concentration in Gucheng is attributed to higher relative humidity, elevated particle pH, and higher precursor concentrations. Correlation analyses demonstrated that aerosol liquid water content (AWC) is a key factor influencing HMS formation, while ammonium and nitrate may also contribute significantly. Theoretical calculations suggest that HMS formation primarily occurs through the reaction between SO32− and HCHO, with an additional contribution from the reaction of HSO3− with HCHO. Aqueous H2O and NH3 can act as catalysts, reducing the reaction barrier between HSO3− and HCHO from 9.76 kcal/mol (uncatalyzed) to 5.01 and 6.48 kcal/mol, respectively, thus promoting HMS formation. Increasing concentrations of aqueous H3O+ and NH4+ during polluted periods do not exhibit a catalytic effect but instead strongly inhibit HMS formation. These results indicate that a comprehensive consideration of the combined effects of various aqueous species is essential in atmospheric models."

 This study evaluates the sensitivity of the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model to three CO2 surface flux databases—GOSAT-IM, NASA-GEOS, and NOAA CarbonTracker (NOAA-CT)—in simulating the tropospheric CO2 seasonal cycle during 2010–2014. Model outputs, generated using common anthropogenic emissions and meteorological forcing, were compared against NOAA-ESRL GLOBALVIEW in situ observations from 54 stations worldwide. All simulations coherently reproduced the observed latitudinal gradient, with high CO2 concentrations (greater than 395 ppm) in the northern sub-polar region driven by fossil fuel emissions and shallow winter boundary layers, and lower concentrations (below 390 ppm) over the southern oceans due to strong uptake and vertical mixing. Among the simulations, the one using NOAA-CT input data showed the highest correlation (greater than 0.95) with observations in the northern mid-latitudes. This high correlation is attributed to the fluxes being constrained by actual observations. The simulation with GOSAT also captured the seasonal amplitudes in the northern hemisphere, although with lesser agreement, while the simulation with NASA-GEOS underestimated observed amplitudes in the tropics. Regional discrepancies, especially in the tropical and southern hemispheric regions, highlight the influence of convective processes and uncertainties in the flux datasets. Horizontal advection dominated seasonal variability at polar stations, whereas vertical transport was more important in the tropics. These findings emphasize the need for improved time-varying flux products, better parameterizations for vertical mixing, and the integration of new satellite observations to reduce model biases. This study highlights the crucial role of surface flux datasets, particularly the spatiotemporal resolution and observational constraints embedded in them in simulating the global CO2 seasonal cycle. Among the evaluated datasets, NOAA-CT most accurately captured the phase, amplitude, and transport-driven dynamics of atmospheric CO2, reinforcing its utility in model-data for carbon cycle assessments."

 The global phase-out of leaded gasoline marked a major milestone in pollution control, yet modern uses of lead (Pb) continue to pose significant health risks, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In the Philippines, significant data gaps still exist despite increasing exposure. This study presents to the best of our knowledge, the first Pb isotopic fingerprinting of atmospheric aerosols in Metro Manila, Philippines, covering fine (0.56–1 μm) and coarse (5.6–10 μm) fractions, collected in 2018–2019. Results show that local sources, mainly industrial activities (45–62 %) and fossil fuel combustion (30–45 %), are now the dominant contributors to airborne Pb, while a minor legacy leaded gasoline and geogenic Pb persists (<18 %) through soil resuspension. Stable isotopes show no clear seasonal pattern. Together with 25 fold higher Pb concentration in the fine fraction, these indicate limited transboundary input. Regional comparison highlights overlapping Pb isotopic composition across Southeast Asia, but is distinct from areas farther north due to intensive coal use in China. The consistency between isotopic fingerprinting and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) results demonstrates the value of combining methods for robust source apportionment. These findings demonstrate the continuing importance of isotopic monitoring for distinguishing contemporary and legacy Pb sources and informing targeted air quality management in rapidly developing regions."

 Delhi experiences severe air quality deterioration during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, driven by anthropogenic emissions and natural meteorological factors. This study investigates the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) characteristics during heavy air pollution and fog conditions over Delhi from October 2023 to February 2024 using ground-based Lidar, satellite, and reanalysis data. Lidar measurements reveal a persistently shallow ABL (<1 km) from November to January, with nighttime boundary layer height (BLH) suppressed by strong radiative inversions. Elevated PM2.5 concentrations during this period show an inverse, power-law relationship with BLH. The ventilation coefficient (VC) remained below 800 m2s-1 from November to January, indicating poor dispersion. INSAT-3D/3DR satellite data showed a peak fog occurrence of 75 % over Delhi, with the highest frequency in January. Analysis showed that the combined frequency of haze, fog, and low-level clouds reached 22.46 % during the study period, with the highest occurrences in November (45.10 %) and January (39.55 %). Ground-based Lidar observations captured fine-scale features such as shallow inversion layers, nighttime ABL collapse, and diurnal boundary layer development more accurately than reanalysis.

 Open Crop Straw Burning (OCSB) exerts significant impacts on air quality and the radiation balance through the concentrated short-term release of particulate matter and trace gases. However, previous studies have primarily focused on air quality impacts, with limited attention to the radiative effects (RE) induced by OCSB. This study integrates satellite observations with multi-year (2016–2020) simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to investigate the effects of burning events before spring plowing in Northeast China (NEC), a region representative of OCSB activity. We quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of OCSB emissions and evaluate their contributions to surface PM2.5 concentrations and radiative effects. Satellite data reveal a 54 % reduction in fire counts across NEC from 2016 to 2020, reflecting the effectiveness of straw-burning ban policies. This decline led to notable reductions in PM2.5 pollution. WRF-Chem simulations show that OCSB emissions contributed 28.74 μg/m3 to surface PM2.5 in 2016, decreasing to 6.78 μg/m3 in 2020. Correspondingly, the surface shortwave RE declined from −21.36 W/m2 in 2016 to −13.97 W/m2 in 2020, while atmospheric RE decreased from 16.47 W/m2 to 8.85 W/m2. For the first time, we present a multi-year, observation-constrained evaluation of atmospheric quality and radiative effects before the spring plowing season in NEC, filling the gap in the regional OCSB radiation assessment and informing the development of emission control policies."

 Ammonia (NH3) emissions significantly impact air quality and the Earth's radiation balance through their interactions with other atmospheric chemical species to form particulate matter. Reducing NH3 emissions from croplands without compromising productivity is challenging due to the widespread and diffuse nature of NH3 sources. In the absence of direct monitoring networks, emission inventories provide the crucial basis for designing and implementing emission control measures. In South Asia (SA), knowledge of NH3 emissions at the regional scale is limited by the coarse-resolution global emission inventories, which carry significant uncertainties due to generalized emission factors. Here, we estimated remote sensing-based NH3 emissions from SA croplands at a 250-m spatial resolution between 2003 and 2020 by incorporating local knowledge of farming practices. Our estimates reveal that an average of 5.7 Tg NH3 is emitted annually from SA croplands. We found a ∼25 % increase in total NH3 emissions over the period, attributable to cropland expansion and a shift toward more fertilizer-demanding crop cultivation. A comparison of the modeled annual NH3 fluxes with global emission inventories reveals discrepancies in the range of −10 to +30 %. The comparison of total column NH3 concentrations retrieved from satellite observations and simulated by chemical transport model simulations using our fine-scale NH3 emission inventory shows a high correlation coefficient (r ≥ 0.47) but indicates an average bias of −21 %. We estimated that without adopting any mitigation strategies to reduce NH3 emissions, future climate change under specific Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2-RCP4.5) will exacerbate environmental pollution by increasing NH3 volatilization by 6 % in the 2050s. However, mitigation strategies, such as incorporating fertilizers into the soil at the time of crop sowing, could decrease NH3 emissions by 18 % even under future climate conditions, relative to current levels. Our work highlights the importance of strategic agricultural management to make the SA food systems more sustainable and resilient to climate change."

 Kathmandu Valley is one of the most densely populated cities in Nepal, facing significant air quality challenges. This study presents a comprehensive analysis based on twelve months of continuous air quality measurement data collected at the Khumaltar Air Quality Monitoring Station (ICIMOD AQMS), which is located in the southern part of the Kathmandu Valley. The study investigates particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PMC (PM10–PM2.5)) alongside trace gases (O3, NOX, SO2, and CO), focuses on their seasonal, diurnal variations, interspecies correlations, potential sources, and the impact of regional atmospheric transport. The results reveal that the annual PM2.5 concentration (49 μgm−3) largely exceeds the WHO air quality guideline of 5 μgm−3. Pollutant concentrations show clear seasonal variation, with peaks during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, and a noticeable decline during the monsoon. A strong correlation (r = 0.82, p = 0.00) between PM2.5 and NOX indicates that fossil fuel combustion is a dominant source of fine particulate pollution. During the pre-monsoon season, O3 concentrations occasionally exceed 100 ppb (8-hr running average), with seasonal diurnal concentration observed close to 90 ppb in the afternoon. The study found that temperature and relative humidity significantly influence coarse PM levels, with a strong negative correlation (r = −0.89, p = 0.00) between coarse PM and the relative humidity, suggesting less resuspension under moist conditions. Furthermore, this study highlights the severe air pollution in the Kathmandu Valley throughout the year, driven primarily by local emissions, with regional atmospheric transport further contributing to poor air quality."

 Ultrafine particles (UFP, less than 100 nm in aerodynamic diameter) pose significant health and environmental risks. These particles can originate from anthropogenic sources such as traffic emissions and fuel combustion, or form through atmospheric reactions. To reduce human exposure to UFP, it is important to understand the processes that can increase UFP concentrations. Current methods typically use particle size data to identify processes such as nucleation events. Recent studies have applied machine learning, particularly the transfer learning method, to this task. However, particle size distribution data is not widely available at many monitoring sites. In this study, we aimed to identify UFP sources using machine learning classification models only based on high time-resolution total number concentration data, rather than size distribution data, making the approach applicable to locations where only total UFP measurements are available. We have previously analyzed particle size data ranging from 6 to 520 nm collected from 2006 to the end of 2021 at the Southern Ontario Centre for Atmospheric Aerosol Research (SOCAAR) near a busy roadway in downtown Toronto, Canada. The days were classified into five categories: Strong Nucleation, Midday Pollution, Traffic Pollution, Baseline, and Mixed. Two machine learning approaches were tried: (1) ensemble learning models, and (2) transfer learning models. Both approaches performed well, achieving average accuracies of 80% and 75%, respectively. While transfer learning models were more robust to missing values, the ensemble learning method was slightly more robust to moderate noise and was also less computationally demanding. The ensemble learning models were then applied to a second monitoring location with a lower UFP level. The predicted classes at this site had similar characteristics to the classified days at the first site, with 78%, 58%, and 50% of the Strong Nucleation, Baseline, and Traffic Pollution days identified at both sites being classified into the same respective categories. These results suggest that the ensemble learning models could be transferred to other locations."

 This study integrates in-situ and satellite observations to characterize urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across Houston, Texas USA. Surface-based background concentrations show seasonal reductions from ∼435 to ∼410 ppm for carbon dioxide (CO2) due to photosynthetic uptake, and from ∼2.02 to ∼1.88 ppm for methane (CH4) predominantly due to oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH). Boundary layer height corrected excess CO2 and CH4 (ΔCO2, ΔCH4) peak in winter (∼139.4 ppm, ∼5.5 ppm) and drop in summer (∼5.6 ppm, ∼0.08 ppm), highlighting emission seasonality. The observed annual ΔCH4/ΔCO2 ratio (9.4 ppb ppm−1) exceeds EDGAR and EPA inventory estimates by 65–70 %, and spatial mapping identifies key CH4 hotspots - such as McCarty and Blue Ridge landfills - with ratios larger than 40–70 ppb ppm−1, which are severely underrepresented in emission inventories.Satellite-derived enhancements from OCO-3 and TROPOMI offer broader coverage but lack sensitivity to surface plumes. For example, in situ bivariate plots show sharp ΔCO2 enhancements >30 ppm and ΔCH4 up to ∼0.3 ppm over industrial zones like the Ship Channel, while satellite ΔXCO2 (∼5–7 ppm) and ΔXCH4 (∼0.03–0.04 ppm) show moderate enhancements over the urban core. TROPOMI NO2 (∼1 × 10−4 μmol/m2) and HCHO (∼2.0 × 10−4 mol/m2) enhancements further confirm co-located industrial emissions. This synthesis underscores the value of combining surface and satellite data for robust urban emission assessments and improved emission inventory evaluation."

We investigated the optical properties, source contributions, and radiative impacts of CA at two climatically distinct regions in northwestern India: an arid region (AR, Jodhpur; post-monsoon) and a semi-arid region (SAR, Kota; winter). Mean absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) values were comparable between the two regions (AR: 1.416 ± 0.173; SAR: 1.395 ± 0.069), but temporal cluster analysis revealed source-specific variability, with lower AAE during traffic-dominated periods (∼1.30) and elevated AAE during solid fuel and biomass combustion (1.68 in AR and 1.52 in SAR). While equivalent BC (eBC) levels were higher in AR with a relatively uniform liquid-fuel contribution (BClf = 80.06 ± 1.98 %), the mass absorption cross-section of BC (MACBC) in SAR was ∼4.5X greater, driven by local solid fuel combustion and transported biomass burning emissions (BCsf = 34.61 ± 6.88 %). Mie modelling indicated higher SSA in AR due to higher contribution of mineral dust, in contrast to SAR, where carbonaceous aerosols caused stronger absorption, forward scattering, and higher imaginary refractive index (kOBD). Although absorption enhancement (Eλ) was slightly higher in AR (∼1.11 vs. ∼0.99), SAR aerosols nearly doubled the warming potential (ΔRFE), with RFE values of ∼0.87 W/m2 in SAR versus ∼0.43 W/m2 in AR. These findings highlight strong source-specific and site-specific variability in aerosol absorption and radiative, emphasizing the need to integrate region-specific parameters into climate models and air quality assessments for data-scarce arid and semi-arid South Asian environments."

 In this study, an emission inventory of 16 PAHs, including 7 carcinogenic PAHs, was developed using the latest data for Korea. The study incorporated emission sources that had been omitted in previous studies. PAHs emissions were estimated by region (at city, county, and district levels) and sector to enable a more precise identification of the emission status in Korea. The total annual emission of 16 PAHs in Korea in 2017 was 1259.7 Mg, with 7 PAHs contributing 41.77 Mg. The major sector of the emissions of the 16 PAHs was industrial process (33.5 %). For the 7 PAHs, other area source was the major emission sector (38.8 %), mainly due to wildfires. In terms of regional aspects, regions with high Industrial Process activities such as ULSAN, JEONNAM, CHUNGNAM, along with GYEONGGI, a major hub for Korean Energy Transport and Storage, showed the highest emissions. The developed emission inventory was intercompared with other inventories, ensuring the appropriate application of emission factors for each emission sector. Especially, it was found that the Korean PAH emissions reported in EDGARv6.0 were 1.9–5.1 times different from those estimated in this study, depending on the pollutant. It was discovered that the emission factors in the residential sector in EDGARv6.0 may differ from the actual emission characteristics in Korea. The PAHs emission inventory developed in this study is anticipated to be used for the establishment and regulation of PAHs policies in Korea. Furthermore, the research results are expected to be essential reference material for refining the emission inventory of PAHs for Korea, which is used in atmospheric transport modeling."

 The individual and joint effects of short-term exposure to heat waves and ozone (O3) on mortality, particularly on nervous system disease mortality, need further investigation, as global warming leads to frequent heat waves and increased O3 concentrations. Heat waves were identified when the daily maximum apparent temperature reached or exceeded the temperature threshold (the 90th percentile of the temperature in 2019–2023) for at least 2, 3, or 4 consecutive days. High-level O3 was defined as daily maximum 8-h average O3 concentrations above 100 μg/m3. Based on 51,073 death cases from the Shenzhen Mortality Surveillance System in 2019–2023, we found significant individual and joint effects of short-term exposure to heat waves and high-level O3 on mortality, including all-cause non-accidental mortality, circulatory disease mortality, and nervous system disease mortality, employing a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models. Excess fractions of all-cause non-accidental deaths, circulatory disease deaths, and nervous system disease deaths attributable to heatwave and high levels of O3 exposure could be as high as 6.42 %, 8.28 %, and 13.21 %. In addition, we found that the elderly and males were more susceptible to joint exposure to heat waves and O3. This study provided a reference for the development of a region-specific early warning system for joint heat waves and O3, and highlighted the priority protection of susceptible populations during heatwaves and higher O3 levels."

 This study investigated long-term anthropogenic contributions to airborne particulate matter (PM10) in the Upper Meža Valley, Slovenia, a region historically affected by ore mining, smelting, and, more recently, secondary Pb production. PM10 samples collected at five locations in the summer and autumn of 2018 and at one location in the spring and summer of 2021 were analysed for elemental composition and Pb isotope ratios to identify and quantify pollution sources. Elevated concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cd, and As were observed across all sites, with minimal temporal variations. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis indicated lower EF values for Zn and As, suggesting a primarily crustal origin. Conversely, higher EF values for Cd and Pb pointed to mixed crustal and anthropogenic sources. The proportion of PM10 samples with high Pb enrichment increased from 9.09 % in 2018 to 20.5 % in 2021, indicating a rising influence of anthropogenic emissions. This study represents the first application of Pb isotope composition and a two-endmember mixing model for detailed source apportionment of PM10 in the region. The Pb isotope ratios of PM10 samples fell between local geogenic background and known anthropogenic sources, with anthropogenic contributions accounting for 55.8 %–69.3 % of total Pb in PM10. These findings have important implications for local environmental management, as they can support targeted mitigation strategies, which are critical for public health protection."

 SM2RAIN-ASCAT, a bottom-up satellite-based precipitation product, has been increasingly used for drought monitoring due to its ability to estimate rainfall from soil moisture data. To determine its suitability for precipitation estimation and drought monitoring in Morocco, this study compares SM2RAIN-ASCAT dataset with observed data from 36 ground-based stations. This analysis examines the performance of the satellite product in a variety of climate zones across the country. The accuracy of the precipitation dataset was assessed using a suite of quantitative and qualitative metrics validated against observations. For the purpose of drought monitoring, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 month timescales. To evaluate the performance of the product, the evaluation was also stratified by climate zone. The mean correlation coefficient (CC) with ground observations strengthened from 0.45 (daily) to 0.67 (monthly), with monthly and 10 days aggregations providing the most consistent performance. The dataset had a high probability of detecting rain events, with a monthly Probability of Detection (POD) exceeding 0.75 for 89% of stations. While the product showed a tendency to underestimate intense rainfall, the relative bias was low at nearly half of the stations, and the lowest RMSE value was found at monthly scale. With an underestimation of precipitation in Mediterranean regions and an overestimation in arid regions of Morocco, the product exhibits climatic bias; yet, its efficacy for drought monitoring has been proven. The calculated SPI values for short to medium-term durations (1, 3, 6 and 12 months) align well with ground observations across several climate zones in Morocco. While the 1 month SPI shows only weak to moderate agreement with gauge data, the correlation strengthens markedly for 3 and 6 month periods, with a CC of approximately 0.70 and 0.80, respectively. Notably, the results for long-term hydrological drought monitoring (SPI-12) are particularly promising, demonstrating excellent agreement with ground observations across nearly all stations. SM2RAIN-ASCAT is a reliable option for drought analysis in many arid regions like Morocco, it excels at detecting droughts in arid zones over humid ones, and similarly, it performs highly at identifying wet periods in hot arid climates than in wetter zones. Finding show that the integration of bottom-up (SM2RAIN) and top-down approaches can improve precipitation and drought monitoring performance, compensating for the limitations of each method. Overall SM2RAIN-ASCAT product is particularly recommended for agricultural drought monitoring and water management."

 Severe wintertime PM2.5 pollution persists in the Urumqi–Changji–Shihezi urban agglomeration, China's largest arid-region urban cluster, despite emission controls that have improved air quality in eastern China. Using air quality monitoring data, radiosonde observations, and chemical transport model simulations for two winters (2022–2024), we investigated the combined roles of synoptic-scale circulation and basin terrain in modulating pollutant accumulation. Results show that PM2.5 pollution exhibits strong spatial synchrony among Urumqi, Changji, and Shihezi, indicating dominant regional meteorological control beyond local emissions. Stagnant westerly circulation with warm advections aloft fosters persistent cold-air pool within the Junggar Basin, producing strong thermal inversions, shallow boundary layers, and PM2.5 accumulation in the urban agglomeration. In contrast, Siberian cold surges and northwesterly flows channel cold air through low-elevation gaps on the basin's north and west margins, weakening stratification, enhancing surface winds via horizontal and partial downward momentum transport, and deepening the boundary layer, which promotes pollutant dispersion. These findings highlight the critical interplay between large-scale forcing and complex terrain in controlling air quality in arid basins and provide a scientific basis for improved forecasting and targeted mitigation strategies."

 Tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution is an emerging challenge in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, where extreme meteorology and multiple pollution gradients frequently occurred. However, altitude-dependent structure of O3 transport under such conditions has been rarely quantified. Here, we resolved horizontal and vertical O3 fluxes in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang across favorable/unfavorable meteorology, heatwaves, and varying pollution gradients through WRF-CAMx models. Results revealed strong spatial autocorrelation for O3 across “2 + 36” Chinese cities (Moran's I: 0.21–0.77), with pronounced clustering in autumn and winter. Dominant southwest-northeast corridors were identified, with episodic cross-sea inflows to Tianjin, contributing 12.1 %–21.5 % of total inflow. Horizontal inflow and outflow fluxes peaked on pollution days (e.g., exceeding 44 kt/d in Beijing) and bottomed on excellent days (e.g., 28.8 kt/d in Beijing), while net fluxes showed the opposite trend, ranging from 0.4 to 5.3 kt/d. Vertically, upward fluxes maximized during pollution days, with Beijing transitioning from a net “sink” (−24.0 to −55.7 kt/d in non-pollution scenarios) to a “source” (46.7–85.5 kt/d on pollution days), whereas Tianjin and Shijiazhuang consistently acted as a “source”. Furthermore, the vertical distribution of the horizontal and vertical net fluxes showed significant differences across scenarios, and the altitude at which the maximum flux occurs also varied with scenarios. Severe pollution episode analysis demonstrated the altitude-dependent and city-specific interplay between transport and photochemistry in driving episodic O3 extremes. These findings refine understanding of how altitude-scenario interactions shape O3 dynamics, supporting the coordinated control strategies."

 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a zonally oriented tropical band where trade winds converge, triggering deep convection and heavy rainfall, and produces about 32% of global precipitation. Studies indicate that the migration of ITCZ significantly influences the climate of tropical regions and adjacent areas. It is to be noted that during the summer monsoon (June–September) season, the ITCZ undergoes a pronounced northward shift in the South Asian monsoon region which is attributed to the displacement of zero absolute vorticity contour northward of the equator. However, changes in local precipitation are not necessarily correlated with the position of the zonal mean ITCZ, which point towards the importance of analyzing ITCZ dynamics on both regional and seasonal scales. A comparative analysis of various metrics based on precipitation, convection, moisture, and circulation reveals notable differences in estimating the ITCZ location. To address this, a multivariate probabilistic approach, combining precipitation and mean meridional mass flux, has been applied. This method effectively captures the seasonal migration of the ITCZ from boreal winter to boreal summer season, and also resolves its regional variations, providing a clearer picture of onset, peak, and withdrawal phases of South Asian Summer monsoon season."

 This study investigates the southward displacement of anomalous westerlies over the central equatorial Pacific during El Niño peak phase, using ERA5 reanalysis and long-term simulations from UKESM1.0-LL. The analysis reveals that this displacement is anchored by the seasonal migration of the tropical warm pool, thereby enhancing convection sensitivity to sea surface temperature (SST) south of the equator. The spatial structure and intensity of the westerly anomalies are further regulated by the nonlinear convection–SST relationship, with sensitivity peaking within the 27°–29 °C high SST range. Observation shows that, prior to 2000, stronger El Niño events produced more intense and spatially extensive southward-displaced westerly anomalies, whereas since the early 21st century, a La Niña–like mean-state change has weakened the convection–SST sensitivity and reduced the magnitude and extent of the westerly anomalies. Similar relationships among southward-displaced westerly anomalies, El Niño amplitude and convection-SST sensitivity were reproduced in UKESM1.0-LL model. Building on these findings, a synergistic framework is proposed, in which El Niño amplitude sets the scale of SST anomaly forcing, convection–SST sensitivity modulates the convective response, and the warm pool background constrains the spatial location of convection and associated wind anomalies. This thermodynamic mechanism complements existing dynamical explanations and highlights the role of convection–SST sensitivity in shaping El Niño-induced wind responses."

 Differential reflectivity (ZDR) observations from dual-polarimetric radars are directly related to the mean diameter of raindrops. To leverage this one-to-one relationship, the present study develops a mean diameter update (MDU) approach based on a local ensemble transform Kalman filter radar data assimilation system for ZDR assimilation, which enables the explicit updating of the mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm) of raindrops. A series of assimilation experiments using both pseudo and real radar observations is conducted to examine the feasibility of the MDU approach. The results of the scalar assimilation experiment indicate that explicitly updating Dm by the assimilated pseudo ZDR observation further enhances the accuracy of the Dm analysis. The single-pseudo-observation assimilation experiment reveals that the MDU approach effectively leverages the strong correlation between simulated ZDR and Dm, and more corrections are propagated to the grid points near the pseudo ZDR observation. In the observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for the Mei-Yu front case, assimilating pseudo ZDR observations with the MDU approach reduces analysis errors of simulated ZDR and rainwater state variables in each cycle. The forecast performance is the most favorable in terms of the forecast skill score and the rainfall probability when the forecast is initiated with more accurate microphysical states obtained by the MDU approach. Regarding the real-observation experiments, the analysis and forecast results are consistent with those of the OSSEs. The application of the MDU approach to both pseudo and real observations confirms its ability to exploit the intrinsic relationship between ZDR and Dm, improving the accuracy of analyses and forecasts."

However, full-day evolutions of PBL structure and PBL height (PBLH) remain limited as insufficient atmospheric vertical observations. Here, we comprehensively evaluate PBL features and PBLH detected from radiosonde, AMDAR, and lidar over Beijing, China.

Notably, some outlies with obvious discrepancies in PBLH detection among these three platforms are extracted and their underlying causes are revealed. Then, these outliers are removed and the consistency in PBLH detected from the three platforms markedly improved.

 Relatively little is known about the role of upper-tropospheric factors in monitoring and predicting tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, despite their significant contribution to TC development. Using data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) and cloud-top height (CTH) products from the Fengyun-4 A (FY-4 A) satellite, this study found that the mean CTH within a radius of 0–200 km from the TC center exhibited a correlation of 0.47 with TC intensity. This correlation was significantly higher than that of conventional predictors such as sea surface temperature (SST), which showed a correlation of 0.32. Moreover, changes in CTH typically preceded changes in TC intensity by approximately 12 to 15 h, suggesting that CTH may serve as a leading indicator of TC intensity. The study also examined the mechanisms through which CTH influences TC intensity. Results indicated that an increase in CTH was generally associated with enhanced TC outflow, which in turn strengthened the TC's secondary circulation. This process improved the efficiency of the TC Carnot heat engine and ultimately favored TC intensification."

This study provides a multi-year, observation-based assessment of the coupled dynamics between Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) and Urban Pollution Island Intensity (UPII) in Rome (Italy), focusing on the atmospheric conditions that modulate their relationship. Air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, together with major air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, NO, and O3), were analysed using an integrated statistical framework. Lag-correlation analysis revealed that the strongest UHII-UPII relationship occurs when nocturnal UHII is shifted backward by one day, reflecting daytime pollutant accumulation and nighttime trapping. Regression results highlighted daily mean air temperature and wind speed as the primary drivers modulating the UHII-UPII association. Spearman correlations showed negative associations between UHII and NO (−0.60), PM10 (−0.45), NO2 (−0.35), and PM2.5 (−0.34), alongside positive correlations with O3 (0.54) and NO2/NO (0.42). These correlations intensified during heatwaves and calm wind conditions, suggesting enhanced interactions under extreme weather and stagnant atmospheric conditions. UHII peaks in summer, while UPII maximizes in winter for all pollutants except for O₃, which exhibits an opposite pattern. These findings reveal a complex interplay between urban warming and pollutant accumulation, highlighting the need for integrated urban planning to address joint UHII-UPII challenges under ongoing urbanization and intensifying severe heat episodes."

 This study elucidates the mechanism by which Arctic-cooling-induced inner-continental warming over East Asia suppressed July precipitation extremes during 2013–2019 along the quasi-stationary rainy front in the outer-continental region encompassing eastern China, the Yellow Sea, and Korea (eCYK). Spatiotemporal variations in precipitation were analyzed using IMERG satellite data. At the same time, large-scale circulation, coupled with microphysical aerosol–cloud interactions and cloud properties, was investigated using ERA5 reanalysis, Terra-MODIS observations, and WRF-Chem simulations. Despite a general increase in summer precipitation and more frequent extreme events across the eCYK region, a marked weakening of extreme ascent was observed from 2013 to 2019, contributing to widespread drought conditions associated with pronounced Arctic cooling and intensified inner-continental warming. The warming-induced expansion of the upper-tropospheric Tibetan High strengthened the East Asian jet along its northern flank, while the southward intrusion of polar air contrasted with it. The resulting anomalous northwesterly flow over the eCYK region, situated near the East Asian jet exit, was further amplified by indirect circulation, which disrupted the transport of moisture from the tropical oceans surrounding Southeast Asia toward the rainy front. Terra-MODIS cloud observations revealed reduced convective cloud formation, which directly led to weaker precipitation extremes. Furthermore, WRF-Chem simulations showed that microphysical processes driven by anthropogenic aerosol indirect effects reduced precipitation by approximately 5.6 % across the eCYK region in July 2018. The combined impact of inner-continental warming and enhanced aerosol formation suppressed convective cloud development, thereby delaying the onset and reducing the intensity of extreme precipitation events."

 Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events in the southern hemisphere were found to have strong influences on the Earth's atmosphere. However, statistical evaluations of such events were rarely carried out. This study introduces a new definition to detect and monitor SSW events in the southern hemisphere from a statistical point of view. The new method accounts characteristics of such events and uses three metrics to monitor stratospheric warmings in the three altitude layers of 20–25 km, 25–30 km and 30–35 km. If one of the metrics is continuously larger than a minimum threshold for more than 5 days, then an SSW event is detected and a main warming phase is recorded. Subsequently, the onset date, warming strength, duration, mean warming area and location of an event are recorded. The new method is applied to 42 years' reanalysis data from 1980 to 2021. Results show that the new definition can detect both strong and weak events. The frequency of all SSW events is 0.38/year and of strong events is 0.26/year in this study. Seasonally, SSW events occur most often in the three months from July to September and geographically most often in the eastern longitude side of southern polar region. It is also found that the number, strength and duration of SSW events from the latter two decades of 2001–2020 are larger than that of the previous two decades of 1981–2000 in this study though further studies are required to consolidate this conclusion."

 This study aims to quantify the climatological contribution of Mediterranean Cyclones (MCs) to snowfall in Romania for 1981–2020. Daily snowfall data from ERA5-LAND were combined with MCs composite tracks, integrating 10 different cyclone tracking methods. Our results show that out of 2230 total MCs in the Mediterranean Basin, 789 (35.4 %) influenced Romania, with 625 of these associated with snowfall events. The monthly distribution reveals that while the highest number of MCs in the basin occurs in April, their snowfall impact over Romania peaks in January and February. The spatial density of MCs highlights a preference for southeasterly and southwesterly tracks, with reinforcement of MCs from the Black Sea. Our findings reveal that approximately 50 % of the total snowfall accumulation during the cold season in Romania is associated with MC activity. This contribution shows monthly variability, with the highest MC-linked snowfall percentages in transitional months: March (49 %), November (54 %), and April (62 %), while the lowest is in December (42 %). Additionally, spatial and temporal trends highlight a declining trend in MC-related snowfall in several regions (notable in the mountains), especially in February and March, although a slight increase is noted in November and January. The analysis of extreme snowfall events at ten representative weather stations further indicates that more than 70 % of heavy snowfall episodes are triggered by MCs, emphasizing their role in high-impact snow events. These results underline the changing nature of MC influence on southeastern Europe snowfall regime, with implications for understanding future snowpack dynamics and water resource availability under climate change."

This study critically examines the physical mechanisms driving this event across scales. Employing regional reanalysis datasets, we elucidate the localized characteristics responsible for extreme precipitation and systematically address the associated uncertainties. The investigation revealed that the spatiotemporal dynamics of moisture transport played a vital role in the increased moisture influx over the region. In particular, the local convection combined with heightened atmospheric instability and intensified advection in the surrounding areas played a pivotal role in the formation of significant mid-tropospheric cyclones. These developed atmospheric phenomena are rarely observed in this region, which typically experiences tropical cyclones and depressions more frequently.

 The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLRYR) are one of the main agricultural bases over East Asia, and the warm fronts induced extremes have profound impacts on the agricultural activity. Therefore, revealing the potential predictors for the warm front activity over the MLRYR is of significance. This study objectively identifies the warm fronts based on a commonly used thermal method for front detection. Results show that the warm front frequency (WFF) over the MLRYR exhibits a significant decreasing trend and strong interannual variability during 1979–2020. Further analysis indicates that the spring WFF over the MLRYR is associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and Bering Sea ice anomalies in the preceding winter. The El Niño-like SST anomalies could persist from the preceding winter to the following spring and excite an anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific. The winter Bering Sea ice anomalies can also persist into the following spring and trigger a downstream-propagating wave train, leading to an anomalous cyclone over Mongolia. The aforementioned anomalous anticyclone and cyclone enhance the equivalent potential temperature gradient over the MLRYR, favoring more warm front activities over the region. Comparatively, the decreasing trend of Bering Sea ice anomalies could contribute to the decreasing trend of WFF over the MLRYR. Further multi-linear regression and leave-one-out validation analyses demonstrate that preceding winter ENSO and Bering Sea ice anomalies could have a synergistic impact on spring WFF over the MLRYR, potentially serving as predictors for the spring warm front activity over the region."

 This study investigates how the duration and four calculated characteristics of precipitation events change in relation to the supposed increase in ground temperature during the 21st century in the warm part of the year. We analysed measured hourly precipitation totals at 97 stations in the Czech Republic during 1998–2014, hourly precipitation totals from a reanalysis for the period 1990–2014, and projected precipitation totals for the period 2026–2100 for two future climate scenarios (SSP5–4.5 and SSP5–8.5, which represents “middle of the road” and very strong impact of CO2 concentrations on climate, respectively).We defined a precipitation event (PE) as continuous sequence of hourly precipitation values with a threshold of at least 0.2 mm/h and a duration from 1 to 23 h. The ALADIN-CZ numerical weather prediction model was used to calculate reanalysed PE, while the ALADIN-CLIMAT-CZ climate regional model was used to calculate projected PE for 25 years long periods (2026–2050, 2051–2075 and 2076–2100). The two models are very similar and differ in the input data only. Both models belong to the so-called convection permitting models. A unique feature of the models is their high horizontal resolution of 2.3 km.We studied the four characteristics of PE in dependence on duration and ground temperature: (i) the relative frequency of PE; (ii) relative total precipitation of PE; (iii) relative mean precipitation of PE, and (iv) relative maximum precipitation of PE.We found that some characteristics of observed PE clearly differ from reanalysed data, while others are very similar. The main difference is that the reanalysed data give longer PE for higher temperature, where the measured data do not indicate any PE. In contrast, the reanalysed and projected PE show consistent results. The main result of the study is that the duration of PE does not exhibit any change with increasing temperature."

 This study specifically investigates the geochemical characterization and the identification of primary sources of atmospheric aerosols deposited in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park (PNOMP, Spanish Pyrenees) from 2016 to 2023. The primary objective is to unravel the sources of these aerosols, analyze their temporal variability, and discern the impact of certain aerosol types, especially African dust, on processes affecting the surrounding cryosphere.Methodologically, the study employs robust and established sampling and analysis techniques, including total aerosol deposition monitoring, widely accepted aerosol analysis methods, and the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) v5.0 source contribution model, which identifies key aerosol factors and sources, both natural and anthropogenic. Additionally, the study integrates air mass back-trajectories analysis, allowing for the identification of synoptic meteorological conditions associated with African dust intrusions. Between 10,3 and 19,5 % of the sets of back-trajectories computed from three different starting during the 2016–2023 period corresponded to configurations that facilitated the arrival of air masses from North Africa. During this period, the annual average contribution of African dust to total deposition was 12,8 g m−2 yr−1, accounting for 45 % of the overall input, underscoring the influence of this source compared to other aerosol contributions such as black carbon. These findings highlight the complex interplay between atmospheric transport, aerosol composition, and snowpack dynamics in high-mountain environments. This study ultimately demonstrates the importance of sustained monitoring and cross-disciplinary research to better understand how aerosol deposition on natural systems in combination with ongoing climate change in the Pyrenees and similar alpine systems."

 This study employs the GRASP/Component approach (GRASP: Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties) to simultaneously retrieve aerosol optical properties and chemical components from ground-based sun photometer observations in Tianjin during the period 2014–2024. Component-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed very good agreement with ground-based sun photometer measurements (R2 ≈ 1; RMSE ≤0.01), confirming the reliability of the inversion algorithm. Correlation analysis between aerosol components and optical properties reveal that fine-mode aerosols are the primary drivers of AOD variability. Black carbon (BC) dominates aerosol absorption across all wavelengths, while brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing dust (CAI) exhibit significant absorption only at shorter wavelengths. Aerosol components present distinct seasonal patterns: BC peaks in winter; CAI and scattering dust (CNAI) increase obviously in spring, consistent with frequent dust transport; fine-mode soluble salts (FNAS) and water content (FAWC) rise in summer due to enhanced photochemical activity and high humidity, whereas their coarse-mode counterparts decline due to wet scavenging. Fine-mode aerosol components in Tianjin have decreased significantly, which is driven by policy interventions. In contrast, coarse-mode components show greater variability, likely regulated primarily by natural processes. Furthermore, columnar BC concentrations and dust concentrations show strong temporal coherence with near-surface PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, further validating the applicability of the GRASP/Component approach for long-term monitoring of regional aerosol loading and chemical components."

This work aims to validate the accuracy of the official aerosol optical properties products including Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) retrieved from GEMS and understand the possible causes of retrieval errors.Validation with AERONET at 443 nm shows that about 63 % (Highly Absorbing Fine, HAF), 65 % (Dust), and 58 % (Non-absorbing, NA) of GEMS AOD matchups agree within 30 % expected error (EE). GEMS AOD exhibits underestimation at high aerosol loading (AOD > 0.4) and overestimation at low aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2). For the HAF type, GEMS AOD retrieval accuracy improves in the noon/afternoon compared to morning. However, the temporal variation in retrieval accuracy of Dust and NA types are comparatively less pronounced. Regional performance of GEMS AOD for HAF type performs better in Korea and Beijing, while worse in India and equatorial regions. GEMS SSA presents good performance in Korea and Beijing, with 81.1 %(HAF)/81.3 %(NA) and 72.5 %(HAF)/65.9 %(NA) falling within ±0.05 absolute difference, respectively. The limitations of GEMS aerosol classification algorithms based on UV-AI and Visible-AI are a significant cause of errors in AOD and SSA retrieval. Additionally, a priori ALH based on CALIOP ALH climatology also contribute to the AOD retrieval error, particularly for HAF type. These factors should be considered in future algorithm."

 Raindrop size distributions (DSDs) play a key role in revealing the underlying physical processes of rainfall. This study investigates the characteristics of the DSDs in Great Britain (GB) using data collected from eleven Thies laser precipitation monitors (LPMs) between 2017 and 2019. Around one million one-minute raindrop samples were fitted to a normalized gamma drop distribution model. This study examines the DSD characteristics from both temporal (seasons) and spatial (geography and topography) perspectives, considering different rain types (stratiform and convective) and rain rate clusters. The results indicate that the average mass-weighted mean diameter Dm and the average normalized intercept parameter log10Nw are influenced by geographical and atmospheric conditions. The Dm tends to be lower and log10Nw is higher in the western and hilly regions, with the opposite pattern observed over the eastern plain of GB. Both parameters are strongly correlated with rain rate. Compared to subtropical/tropical regions, stratiform rain in GB exhibits smaller Dm and larger log10Nw, while the characteristics of convective rain align with the maritime-like cluster. Significant differences in Dm are observed between stratiform (0.78–1.00 mm) and convective (1.30–1.74 mm) rain, with both showing a significant negative linear correlation with log10Nw. Moreover, extreme convective events show distinct seasonality, with larger Dm and lower log10Nw during the warm season. Furthermore, a bimodal distribution is observed for log10Nw in light rain events over western and hilly regions, highlighting the complexity of microphysical processes associated with small raindrops. The characteristics of DSDs observed in this study provide valuable insights for future investigations into GB's precipitation formation and quantitative precipitation estimation using weather radar."

 Based on the hindcast data from the operational climate prediction model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the correction effects of precipitation prediction biases over the Tibetan Plateau during summer, particularly in July from 2006 to 2020, were systematically evaluated using the non-parametric percentile mapping (CDF) and Kalman filter-type adaptive (KEM) bias correction methods. The results indicate that the CDF method performs better in correcting systematic biases, while the KEM method shows more significant improvements in spatial correlation and anomalous trends. On the seasonal scale, the CDF method effectively reduces the overall systematic precipitation bias in the plateau region, especially decreasing bias by 80 % in the south, with an overall spatial correlation ranging between 0.72 and 0.79, while the KEM method mainly reduces precipitation bias in the central plateau by 60 % to 80 %, achieving spatial correlations above 0.8 in six years. On the subseasonal scale, both bias correction methods exhibit effects on bias and spatial correlation similar to those observed on the seasonal scale, resulting in a modest improvement in the ability to discriminate precipitation events, with an increase of 0.01 in the area under the ROC curve (AROC). The KEM method effectively enhances the prediction capability for precipitation anomaly trends by increasing the overall PS score by 6.34, reaching 84.59. Particularly for precipitation prediction correction at varying thresholds in July, the KEM method yields results that more closely align with observations, demonstrating optimal performance for moderate to heavy precipitation. In summary, CDF and KEM are functionally complementary: CDF removes pointwise systematic bias and standardizes amplitude distributions, and applying KEM subsequently to the CDF-corrected fields restores spatial–phase coherence, refines the spatial structure of anomaly trends, and suppresses low-end outliers. Combining the two methods in a “CDF first, then KEM” sequence and integrating outputs via performance-driven weighted fusion leverages their respective strengths without requiring additional observations, enabling more targeted improvement of precipitation anomaly-trend correction across sub-seasonal to seasonal transition scales over complex plateau terrain."

 The chemical characteristics and photochemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated at Shennongjia (SNJ), a high-altitude site in central China, from July to August 2023. The mean mixing ratio of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 14.61 ± 1.64 ppbv, dominated by alkanes (35.4 %) and carbonyls (29.4 %). The northeastern air mass exhibited the highest VOC concentration (16.33 ± 7.62 ppbv), followed by the southeastern air mass (10.45 ± 3.25 ppbv). Analysis of potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) identified central/eastern Hubei and the Sichuan Basin as major source regions for VOCs at SNJ. An observation-based photochemical box model was employed to examine VOC photochemistry and in-situ O3 formation. Extremely low nitric oxide (NO) mixing ratios led to incomplete HOx cycling, and VOCs actively participated in the generation of free radicals. In-situ O₃ formation was governed by regionally transported air masses with distinct VOC compositions. Northwestern air masses, characterized by high temperature, high carbonyls, and low relative humidity (RH) despite lower TVOCs (8.10 ± 1.29 ppbv), yielded the highest net O3 production rate (1.27 ± 0.33 ppbv/h), with formaldehyde photolysis contributing 13.3 % to hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) generation. Conversely, the southeastern air masses, despite carrying the highest TVOC load, inhibited O3 formation due to elevated RH. Formaldehyde and isoprene dominated photochemical reactivity. Our results highlight that VOC speciation, especially reactive carbonyls and biogenic VOCs, critically controls radical cycling and O3 dynamics in remote regions."

 To construct appropriate initial perturbation methods for convection-permitting ensemble prediction system (CPEPS), this study analyzed the sensitivity of CPEPS to three single-scale singular vector (SV) perturbations with different configurations, and the strengths of multiscale SV initial perturbations relative to the single-scale SV perturbations were revealed. First, the SVs with a horizontal resolution of 2.5° and 1.5° exhibit a single-peaked energy norm structure, capturing initial condition uncertainties in the middle and upper troposphere. In contrast, the SVs with a horizontal resolution of 0.5° display a double-peaked distribution over targeted areas in southern China, capturing uncertainties in the lower atmosphere. Diverse SV initial perturbations have different perturbation magnitudes, ranges, energy spectra, and baroclinic instability characteristics. As forecast times increase, the 0.5° SV perturbations capture the perturbation energy growth associated with low-level humidity, whereas the 1.5° SV and 2.5° SV initial perturbations capture the perturbation growth associated with high-level winds. Second, among the single-scale SV initial perturbations, the 0.5° SV perturbations outperform the others in terms of spread–skill relationships for all variables, and probabilistic forecast skill for the mixing ratio, other low-level variables, and rainfall at most forecast hours. However, the 2.5° and 1.5° SV perturbations demonstrate better probabilistic forecast skills for winds and temperature at middle and high levels. Third, the multiscale SV initial perturbations incorporate multiscale characteristics, and further improve perturbation energy, spread–skill relationships, and probabilistic forecast skill for both dynamical variables and precipitation. Overall, these findings offer valuable insights for developing multiscale initial perturbation methods for CPEPS."

 Airborne microorganisms are integral components of the atmosphere, influencing air quality, climate processes, and bacterial dispersal across ecosystems. Their ecological and health implications are particularly pronounced in high-altitude environments, where bacteria are exposed to extreme conditions such as intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation, desiccation, and low temperatures. However, the lack of rapid and accurate detection methods limits our ability to monitor and understand airborne bacterial dynamics in these regions. This study establishes an optimized protocol for quantifying airborne bacteria collected on air filters using flow cytometry (FCM), with a particular focus on applications in high-altitude environments. The method was refined through orthogonal experiments to determine optimal conditions for cell detachment and dispersion. Key steps include fixation with glutaraldehyde, dispersal using Tween 80 and sodium pyrophosphate, combined with 20 min of ultrasonic treatment, and elution with PBS buffer. This optimized protocol was applied to assess spatial and temporal variations in airborne bacterial abundance across three high-altitude regions: urban, lake, and glacier. The results showed that the airborne bacterial concentration was the highest in urban areas (3.3 × 104 cells/m3), followed by lakes (1.0 × 104 cells/m3) and glaciers (7.7 × 103 cells/m3). The temporal variation of bacterial concentration in urban areas peaked in July and reached a trough in September. Model analysis indicated that PM10 was the main factor regulating bacterial concentration in urban air, while organic matter particles dominated in natural environments. The protocol developed in this study provides a rapid, reliable, and field-applicable tool for monitoring airborne bacterial abundance in high-altitude regions, offering valuable insights into atmospheric bacterial ecology and its environmental determinants."

 In June 2024 extremely hot weather was observed in Southeast Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Based on ensemble seasonal forecasts of the INM RAS Earth system model (INMCM6M), that is run operationally at the Hydrometeorological Research Center of Russia for monthly calculation of global seasonal forecasts, the prediction of tropospheric temperature anomalies in this region is studied. Obtained results show that, among the causes of this heatwave, the most important role was played by the reduced accumulation of soil moisture during the preceding months and the reduced cooling of the lower troposphere due to evaporation stress. The analysis of observational data indicates the increased (especially in the first half of June 2024) meridional transport of warm air masses along the western edge of the heatwave region towards the central Volga region and the north-east of European Russia (north-westward of Ural Mountains). Model experiments allow to conclude, that the meridional transport of air masses from the warmer region to the north, rather than particularly extreme warming in the Eastern Mediterranean, led to the formation of a region of positive temperature anomalies in the north-east of European Russia."

 Previous observation verified that large turbulent eddies (LEs) prevail in the tropical cyclones and significantly affect the vertical mixing in the planetary boundary layer. Recently, Li and Pu (2021) had parameterized the vertical eddy diffusivity (VED) associated with LEs (LP scheme). To further investigate their rationality, we conducted 79 sensitivity simulations of Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) through WRF model to examine the critical processes in LP scheme. The simulation indicates that the weak convergence flow lead to LEs covers more in the inflow region. Subsequently, strong negative momentum flux associated with LEs disrupts the inflow structure, resulting in a poor typhoon simulation. Adding a moderate divergence and Ri threshold, i.e., LED03-RI30, could suppress the excessive vertical mixing in the inflow region to ensure the typhoon intensification and lead to an intense typhoon as observed. Reducing the scale factor of LE intensity in LP scheme also result in stronger typhoon, however, it delays the intensification of typhoon. The use of planetary boundary layer height, fixed height, or height scaling can potentially improve the Hm (the height of maximum LE intensity) calculation and thus optimal LE parameterization. However, due to the gradient wind balance, the enhanced wind speed induced by the LE parameterization tends to result in a lower sea-level pressure than the best-track. Validation simulations of Typhoon Hato (2017) and Maria (2018) show a weak effect of LP scheme. Although VED has been enhanced, the vertical velocity gradient in typhoon Hato and Maria are weaker, making the flux, which is associated with LEs, is weaker than that in Typhoon Lekima. Therefore, the vertical structure should be taken into account in the LE parameterization such as LP scheme."

 The western North Pacific region has experienced Tropical Cyclones (TCs)-caused damages, including the heavy rainfall disaster brought by Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022) in South Korea. The future changes in the intensity and frequency of such a Violent Typhoon and its associated rainfall are global concern. This study adopted the storyline approach using the Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW) method to quantify the impact of climate change on Typhoon Hinnamnor and its associated rainfall. Furthermore, we employed the risk-based approach to examine the changes in frequency and intensity of TCs affecting South Korea. Our storyline approach showed the increase of maximum sustained wind speed by 15 %, the decrease of minimum sea level pressure by 2 %, and the increase of basin-average rainfall by 29.4 % over the Nakdonggang basin in the PGW experiment considering the 2090s SST condition under the SSP2–4.5 scenario in the Typhoon Hinnamnor simulation. Our risk-based approach examining the identified TCs in large ensemble climate dataset found that the maximum sustained wind speed increased by 14 % for Violent Typhoons under +4 K climate, while the minimum sea level pressure decreased by 1 %. Overall, the identified changes in the TC intensity were comparable between the storyline and risk-based approaches, highlighting the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in frequency of TCs affecting South Korea under climate change in the risk-based approach. While we found a decrease (−36 %) in frequency of all category TCs affecting South Korea, the frequency of Violent Typhoons increased (+27 %) under the 4 K warming climate. This study provides useful insights on the TC and its rainfall changes under climate change, which can be incorporated in the regional disaster risk assessment."

 Tornado has occurred frequently in the United States (US), with its seasonality and interannual variability tremendously discussed in previous studies. However, its long-term variabilities, including the interdecadal/multidecadal variabilities and the linear trend, have less been comprehensively discussed and quantified. In this study, we find that the tornado occurrence in the US shows salient interdecadal/decadal variabilities, in additional to the interannual variability. A modest positive linear trend is also present, qualitatively consistent with the thermodynamic influence of global oceanic warming (GOW) on convective available potential energy and low-level southerly winds. Two internal modes, namely the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), influence the interdecadal variabilities of tornado occurrence. The IPO stimulates a stationary wave train, propagating from the Pacific to North America, resembles the Pacific-North America pattern yet on the decadal time scale, and affects local circulations and hence tornado occurrence. The AMO induces a local dipole of circulation anomalies, resembling the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern, which triggers a northwest-southeast dipole change of tornado occurrence with the northwest component stronger. Furthermore, we quantitatively estimate the relative importance of IPO, AMO and GOW on the tornado occurrence from 1950 to 2021 based on a multi-regression model. The result shows that the IPO and AMO jointly contribute about 32.6 % (19.9 %) of the decadal (total) variance while the GOW contribution is secondary."

 Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) observations at alpine sites contribute significantly to improving the understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions under background atmospheric conditions. However, measurements of CCN activity under low supersaturation (SS) conditions in such environments remain limited due to technical constraints. In this study, aerosol microphysical and chemical properties were measured at Mt. Hua, in central China. Using an Aerodynamic Aerosol Classifier–Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (AAC–CCNC) system, size-resolved CCN activity at low SS conditions (0.07 % and 0.12 %) was characterized, and the corresponding hygroscopicity parameter (κ) was derived. During the campaign, the site was rarely influenced by local emissions or long-range transport of air pollutants, allowing the observations to represent the CCN activity of aerosols in the lower free troposphere over this continental region. The results show aerosols at Mt. Hua exhibited moderate CCN activity, with average κ values of 0.25 and 0.30 at SSs of 0.07 % and 0.12 %, respectively. The calculated CCN number concentrations averaged 2.3 × 102 cm−3 and 5.1 × 102 cm−3, and were in good agreement with concurrent bulk CCN measurements. The derived CCN spectrum parameters, C and k (NCCN(SS) = C × SSk), were 8.13 × 103 cm−3 and 1.3 on average, consistent with values observed at other alpine sites in polluted continental regions. No significant diurnal variation in aerosol CCN activity was observed, indicating a weak impact of local emissions or photochemical reactions on aerosol particle size and aerosol hygroscopicity in the lower free troposphere. Further analysis revealed that variations in CCN activity influenced by sulfate and nitrate were opposite, highlighting the complex effects of aerosol chemical reactions on aerosol CCN activity. This study offers new insights into aerosol CCN activity at the mountain and can promote the study of aerosol–cloud interactions under background conditions in the continental region."

 Ozone (O3) pollution in urban environments arises from complex photochemical interactions among volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and meteorological factors, yet the nonlinear and synergistic effects remain poorly constrained. Existing studies have identified key roles of humidity, temperature, and emission precursors, but how their interactions regulate O3 production under varying conditions is less understood. Here, we applied machine learning with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to disentangle the contributions of chemical precursors and meteorological factors on O3 formation in Huzhou, using continuous monitoring data from May to October 2023. Meteorological drivers accounted for 47.1 % of the total impact, with relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T) dominating. RH above 70 % consistently inhibited O3 production and attenuated temperature effects. Chemical precursors contributed 52.9 %; within the chemical contribution, OVOCs (27.7 %) promoting O3, while NO2 (25.9 %) and alkenes (15.8 %) exhibited negative effects. The positive role of OVOCs diminished under high-NOx conditions due to constrained radical propagation. During O3 pollution episodes, meteorological influence increased by 15 % relative to clean periods, primarily via RH, while VOCs contributions declined and NO2 effects strengthened, indicating a shift in the dominant O3 drivers. Combining SHAP attribution with theoretical calculations identified propylene, styrene, and acetone as key VOC species. Propylene and styrene exhibited negative effects on O3 formation, with styrene's suppression intensified under elevated NO2 and RH, whereas acetone enhanced O3 particularly under higher T. These findings highlight the dynamic chemical-meteorological interactions shaping O3 production and provide a framework for rapidly diagnosing local O3 drivers to inform targeted mitigation strategies."

 The measurement of accurate full drop size distribution (DSD) is critical for its precise modeling and hydro-meteorological application. However, its measurement hinders from instrumental limitation. We explored a way of constructing full DSDs by combining the 2D-Video Distrometer (2DVD) and Meteorological Particle Spectrometer (MPS) measurements based on instrumental uncertainty statistics, while other existing methods use a fixed critical diameter and weighting. First, the median relative bias (RB) of number concentration for each diameter between the two distrometers is used to determine the diameter range of their merging. Second, the weighting factors within the range were derived from normalized standard deviations of MPS and 2DVD number concentration by diameter during quasi-homogeneous microphysical process. The accuracy of derived full DSD is verified with the rainfall rate (R) and radar reflectivity (Z) from other independent instruments such as PLUVIO and Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System (POSS) that provide the best possible reference of R and Z. The new method is superior to the existing methods, providing relatively lower error statistics during summer rainfall events in 2022. Additionally, the impact of the new method is analyzed on DSD variability using double-moment scaling normalization to derive a stable generic function. Four different triple-moment normalization methods are also employed to describe the reduction of DSD variability. The results demonstrate that the new full DSD significantly reduces DSD variability and better provides stable generic function of DSDs."

 Dust aerosols contribute over half of the total atmospheric aerosol mass and play a critical role in climate and environmental processes. Using the observations of 13 AERONET sites and CALIPSO from 2006 to 2021, this study characterizes the optical and vertical properties of dust aerosols over eight main desert regions of the Sahara, Middle East, Thar, Taklamakan, Gobi, North American, Simpson, and Atacama deserts. AERONET observations reveal that the Sahara exhibits the highest annual AOD (0.47) and lowest AE (0.34), while the Atacama and Gobi show the lowest AOD (0.049) and highest AE (1.20), respectively. Most deserts exhibit a seasonal pattern of high AOD and low AE in spring and summer. Aerosols in these deserts are typically unimodal volume size distributions (VSDs) in both fine and coarse modes, while a bimodal distribution in fine mode in the Sahara. Although the peak radius varies little seasonally in most deserts, the concentration increases markedly in spring and summer. The fine mode aerosols have important impact on the aerosol effective radius and concentration in the Gobi and North America desert. CALIPSO identifies four high value centers of dust AOD (DAOD), with the summer maximum over the deserts of Sahara, Middle East, and Thar, and the spring maximum over the deserts of Taklamakan and Gobi. Dust extinction coefficients decay exponentially with the altitudes, showing the slowest vertical decrease in summer and the largest near-surface extinction in spring. Although the single-dust-layer structure dominates in most deserts, the double-dust-layer structure exceed 30 % in the deserts of Sahara, Middle East, Thar, and Taklamakan, with higher occurrence rate in summer and spring and the inter-layer spacing ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 km. Both the dust layer top and base are highest in summer and lowest in winter and the mean layer thickness ranges from 1 to 2.5 km. Significant declining trends are found in dust top heights over the Taklamakan and Gobi, and in layer thickness over the Taklamakan and North America."

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a critical role in regional and global climate and warms faster than the global average. Black carbon (BC), the strongest light-absorbing atmospheric aerosol, aging to enhances its light absorption capability (quantified by the absorption enhancement factor, Eabs), thereby amplifying its radiative effects. Quantifying BC Eabs is crucial for understanding the TP's warming but remains scarce due to a lack of in-situ data. This study quantified BC Eabs in situ measurements with a Thermodenuder-coupled Aethalometer at three TP sites: Tibet University (TU, 3650 m, urban-influenced) in Lhasa, Purog Kangri (PK, 4960 m, central remote glacier), Mount Everest (ME, 5260 m, South Asian transport corridor) during the post-monsoon period in 2024. Results show that Eabs is elevated at the remote sites (1.99 ± 0.48 at ME; 1.96 ± 0.56 at PK) compared to that at TU (1.14 ± 0.10). Meteorological analysis suggests that enhanced Eabs at remote sites is due to aged BC from long-range transport, while lower Eabs at TU reflects local emissions of less aged BC. Radiative transfer simulations show that coatings contributed up to 46.7 % of BC's direct radiative effect at PK. These findings provide a valuable dataset and improved understanding of BC radiative effects over the TP, offering an important observational basis for accurately evaluating aerosol radiative effects and their impacts on regional climate change."

 Vertical distributions of gaseous nitrous acid (HONO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are crucial for hydroxyl radical (OH) production and atmospheric oxidative capacity at different altitudes. This study utilized multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) to measure the vertical profiles of HONO, HCHO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and aerosols in Guangzhou, China, from July 2019 to June 2020. The average vertical profiles of HONO and NO2 displayed an exponential trend, while HCHO and aerosols exhibited a near-Gaussian distribution. Direct emissions accounted for 29 % of HONO sources, with heterogeneous processes being predominant. The conversion rate of NO2 to HONO (CHONO) at 1.0 km was 3.08 times greater than that at ground level. HONO formation via NO2 heterogeneous reactions was influenced by temperature, relative humidity (RH), and solar radiation intensity (SRI). The HONO/NO2 ratio initially decreased with rising temperature, reaching a minimum between 20 and 25 °C, and increased with RH below approximately 85 %, and SRI above 700 W/m2. Photolysis rates of HONO (JHONO) and HCHO (JHCHO) increased linearly with altitude, peaking between 12:00–13:00 LT, with JHONO significantly exceeding JHCHO at the surface. Near the surface, OH production from HONO (POH(HONO)) was greater than from HCHO (POH(HCHO)), while at altitudes of 0.2–2.2 km, HONO contributed less to OH formation compared to HCHO. This study highlights the significance of the vertical observations of HONO and HCHO for understanding their vertical differences in evolution, sources, and atmospheric oxidizing contributions."

About 52 (0.07 %) of completely isolated convections (CICs) and 216 (0.16 %) of ordinary isolated convections (OICs) can eventually undergo upscale growth, and 54.3 % of CICs still maintain individual state in their lifespan. The initiation (CI) and dissipation of ICs mainly occur over the mountains, hills, and Bohai coast. Both CI and UCG peak at 14–16 LST in diurnal cycle, while UCG lags behind by 77 min. 82.1 % of cells propagate around eastward after CI and rapidly grow within 50 km. The environmental conditions and topography jointly dominate UCG process. Terrain blocking and weak mid-level vertical wind shear (VWS) over mountains prolong the duration from CI to UCG and reduce the movement speed. Higher SBCAPE, PW, lower LCL and stronger 0–1 km VWS over the plains and hills favor the UCG process compared to these over high-elevation areas, whereas UCG over the latter depends more on 0–6 km VWS due to higher LCL. These findings first provide the long-term characteristics of ICs over North China and diagnostic references for UCG occurrence across various terrains."

 This study presents the assimilation impact of all-sky water vapour (WV) radiance observations from the recently launched Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT-3DS) into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. To evaluate the impact of INSAT-3DS data, three identical assimilation experiments were conducted in July 2024 over South Asia: a control run (WCNT) without INSAT-3DS Imager WV radiance assimilation, a clear-sky WV radiance assimilation run (WCLR), and an all-sky WV radiance assimilation run (WCLD). The assimilation impact was assessed by comparing the WRF analyses simulated brightness temperature (TB) against independent satellite observations from Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), High-Resolution Infrared Sounder/4 (HIRS/4), and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) sensors. Results demonstrate that all-sky assimilation significantly increases the number of assimilated observations (∼300 %) compared to clear-sky assimilation, leading to analyses that are more consistent with independent satellite measurements. Short-range forecast evaluations confirm the advantages of all-sky radiance (ASR) assimilation, with improved predictions of simulated WV TB, moisture, and temperature fields compared to clear-sky radiance (CSR) assimilation. When verified against INSAT-3DS WV channel observations, WCLD forecasts consistently exhibit reduced bias and root mean square deviation (RMSD) compared to WCLR and WCNT forecasts. These results highlight the potential of ASR assimilation to enhance the accuracy of the WRF model predictions, particularly in summer monsoon-affected regions where cloud-affected radiances contain crucial atmospheric information. Overall, this study underscores the importance of ASR assimilation in improving the representation of atmospheric moisture and advancing short-range weather forecasts."

 This study leverages the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, integrated with the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system, to conduct a high-resolution simulation of a thunderstorm gale event in Beijing. By assimilating observations from Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs), the impact of different observation errors is systematically assessed and explored. This study demonstrates that varying observation errors significantly influence the performance of the wind analysis and forecast. Mitigating observation errors in cases with significant observation-minus-background (OMB) discrepancies enhances the reliability of observations with large departures from the background, resulting in greater analysis increments and improved agreement with the assimilated observations. In contrast, the Desroziers method computes observation error covariances through statistical analysis of OMB and observation-minus-analysis (OMA) residuals. This approach systematically assigns higher error estimates, enabling the assimilation of more observations with reduced weights while enhancing spatial continuity in the analysis. Both experiments employing modified observation error parameters demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to the default configuration, enabling more precise identification of strong wind regions while mitigating overestimation tendencies. Statistical metrics (BIAS, RMSE) and FSS scores confirm their superior performance, particularly in extreme wind speed forecasting, with Exp_D05 outperforming all other experiments. These findings highlight the importance of optimized observation error estimates in AWSs data assimilation for improved wind analysis and forecasting."

 The critical role of light-absorbing aerosol black carbon (BC) in modifying the Earth's atmosphere and climate system warrants detailed characterization of its microphysical properties. The present study examines the BC microphysical properties (size distributions and mixing state) and their impact on the light-absorption characteristics over a semi-urban tropical coastal location in Southern Peninsular India. The measurements of refractory BC (rBC) properties, carried out using the single particle soot photometer during 2018–2021, covering four distinct air mass conditions (Marine, Continental, Mixed-1, and Mixed-2), were used for this purpose. These were supported by measurements of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1) mass loadings and the core-shell Mie theory model for BC-containing particles. The results suggested that the BC particles exhibited varying sizes (mass median diameters from 0.181 ± 0.079 μm to 0.202 ± 0.064 μm) and relative coating thicknesses (RCT) (1.3–1.6) under distinct air mass conditions. These characteristics reflected varying source/sink strengths, aging processes of BC, and potential condensable coating material. The aerosol system during the Marine air mass period has lower BC (∼ 0.67 ± 0.57 μg m−3) and NR-PM1 (12.06 ± 10.81 μg m−3) mass concentrations, and the lowest RCT on BC (∼ 1.34 ± 0.14). However, the other periods with continental influence depicted significant coatings on BC (mean RCT >1.5). The coatings on BC particles exhibited daytime enhancement, driven by photochemically produced condensable material, a contrasting diurnal pattern to that of other BC properties. Interestingly, the RCT on BC increased and/or remained invariant with increasing relative humidity (RH) until RH ≤82 %, and subsequently showed a decline. This is possibly due to deliquescence and subsequent detachment of the coating material (likely, inorganics) from the BC cores. Despite this, the BC particles retained coatings of ∼30–50 % of their core sizes even under high RH (>85 %), indicating the potential role of secondary organics as coatings. The changes in the BC mixing state resulted in a significant alteration to its light-absorption properties. The mean light-absorption enhancement of BC (compared to uncoated BC) ranged from 1.36 ± 0.14 for the Marine air mass periods to 1.58 ± 0.15 for the Continental air mass periods, whereas the overall mass absorption cross-sections of BC varied between 7.91 ± 0.91 to 9.03 ± 0.84 m2/g at 550 nm. The key implication of this study is that changes to the BC mixing state, caused by multiple underlying processes unique to tropical atmospheric conditions, can lead to a significant enhancement in its light-absorption characteristics, which can lead to a notable increase in the positive radiative forcing of BC."

 This study develops an advanced cloud microphysics scheme based on the LiuMa cloud microphysics scheme, which explicitly incorporates aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) parameterizations, allowing for a detailed investigation of the effects of aerosols on cloud microphysical and precipitation processes. The new scheme was employed into the CMA-MESO V5.0 regional model, and a simulation of severe convective precipitation case in the HuaBei region was carried out to assess the impact of aerosol concentration on hydrometeor mixing ratio, microphysical conversion rates, and precipitation formation within both warm and cold cloud processes. Aerosol sensitivity experiments (clean, control, polluted scenarios) reveal that higher aerosol concentrations (polluted) enhance light rain and extreme heavy rain but reduce moderate/heavy rain. The clean experiment shows greater spatiotemporal variability in heavy precipitation compared to control experiment, indicating the aerosol significantly modulate the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation. Microphysical budget analysis reveals that higher aerosol concentration enhances cloud droplet concentration while suppressing warm rain processes such as autoconversion and collision-coalescence. In ice-phase processes, aerosols reduce cloud water freezing and riming accretion efficiency, particularly affecting graupel development and subsequent melting, thereby weakening surface precipitation. Batch simulations of 57 precipitation events (June–August 2018) demonstrate that the aerosol-aware LiuMa scheme improves the threat scores (TS) and equitable threat scores (ETS) of forecast performance for extreme (>50 mm, ΔTS: +14.9 %, ΔETS: +15.6 %) precipitation in the CMA-MESO model. Notably, the TS (ETS) for extreme precipitation increases by 24.6 % (26.0 %) under polluted conditions (a total of 19 precipitation events). These results indicate the crucial role of ACI parameterization in enhancing the accuracy of heavy rainfall forecasts."

 With the contribution of Chinese sprite enthusiast, the observation of 165 Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) (almost over 98 % being sprites) over Central South China during the delayed pre-rainy season of South China on three consecutive nights of May 10th–12th, 2021 are reported. The convective cores exhibited the minimum Temperature of Black Body (TBB) of cloud top within the range of 180 to 190 K within 10 min of sprite occurrence, which extended up to or beyond the tropopause (∼ 17 km, 195 K) and was colder (more than 15 K) than that of regular TLEs-producing mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in the central USA. However, the sprite distribution was closely associated with regions of TBB averaging 216.5 K, about 10 K warmer than that of the central USA. This distinct behavior of TLEs-producing thunderstorms in South China can be attributed to a combination of intricate meteorological and topographic factors. Firstly, in addition to the influence of the Subtropical High Pressure Zone, the positioned farther west and north compared to previous years caused the convergence of warm water vapor from the South China Sea and cold air from the north, coupled with the Southwest Vortex (SWV) and multi-layer jets, fostering intense convection. Besides, the intricate plateau and mountain topography are likely also responsible for the distinct behavior of TLEs-producing thunderstorm. Thus, more attention should be paid on thunderstorms in South China during the pre-rainy season for the future study of massive sprite outbreak.Plain language summaryTLEs occur globally according to observation of the Imager for Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning. However, reports of large-scale TLE groups in Asia were rare. This study, conducted with the contribution of Chinese sprite enthusiast, presents the important observation of Transient Luminous Events generated by a long lasting mesoscale convective system complex over Central South China. By analyzing lightning activity, weather conditions, and geographical features, this article reveals the characteristics of massive TLEs-producing thunderstorm and analyzes the meteorological reasons for the formation of the parent thunderstorms. TBB indicated the higher cloud top of parent thunderstorm than that of typical TLEs-producing MCSs in central USA. However, TLEs were largely confined to regions of TBB lower than that of regular TLEs-producing MCSs over central USA. Such distinct behavior of the parent thunderstorm is found in the delayed pre-rainy season of South China and to be attributed to a combination of intricate meteorological and topographic factors. The Subtropical High Pressure Zone, positioned farther west and north compared to previous years, led to the convergence of warm water vapor from the South China Sea and cold air from the north. The presence of the Southwest Vortex, coupled with multi-layer jets, ultimately fostered the development of intense convection. Additionally, the intricate plateau and mountain topography are likely also responsible for the distinct behavior of TLEs-producing thunderstorm."

 The multi-scale structural characteristics of Vortex Rossby Wave (VRW) propagating in the inner and outer eyewalls as well as spiral rainbands are examined. This is done by applying the Multiscale Window Transform (MWT) and the MWT-based localized multiscale energy and vorticity analysis method (MS-EVA) to a successful high-resolution simulation of Super Typhoon Lekima (1909) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and then decomposing and reconstructing geopotential, temperature, three-dimensional wind fields, potential vorticity (PV), radar reflectivity and vertical relative vorticity into the following three spatial scales: mean vortex flow, low-wavenumber and high-wavenumber flows.

 The atmospheric electric field in fair-weather conditions, typically quantified by the Potential Gradient (PG, which is the inverse of the vertical component of the electric field), is a fundamental element of the global electric circuit. It is sensitive to multiple scales of influence, including global atmospheric dynamics, local meteorological conditions (e.g., dust, fog, clouds), and anthropogenic factors such as air pollution. In this study, we analyze PG measurements from a newly deployed electric field mill installed in the metropolitan area of Tel-Aviv area, the urban part of central Israel, which has been operational since August 2024. This instrument is part of a broader observational network that includes nearby meteorological and air quality monitoring stations, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the factors influencing PG variability.Focusing on fair-weather conditions, we investigate both diurnal, weekly, and seasonal patterns of PG and their relation to pollutant concentrations. Our findings reveal a distinct temporal correlation between the PG and NOₓ levels during the morning and evening rush hours, indicating rapid atmospheric responses to traffic-related emissions. In contrast, elevated PM2.5 concentrations are associated with a delayed PG response, likely due to their longer atmospheric residence time and different microphysical interactions. Furthermore, a pronounced ‘weekend effect’ is observed, with reduced pollution and correspondingly altered PG values on weekends compared with weekdays, highlighting the measurable impact of human activity on atmospheric electricity.These results enhance our understanding of the interplay between urban air pollution and the local electric field, and emphasize the importance of integrating air quality data into atmospheric electricity studies, particularly in densely populated regions where anthropogenic influences are pronounced, with implications for public health."

 Regional ozone pollution has emerged as a key challenge within China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, thus, comprehensively understanding its formation mechanism is essential for continuous improvement of air quality in China. Here, an overall increase of 5.1 % in near-surface ozone concentrations is observed during 2014–2023 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. The annual average number of regional pollution days in YRD stands at 32.7 over the recent ten years, and a significant rising trend of ozone levels on regional clean days is also noticed. This highlights the persistent nature of ozone pollution and the critical need for targeted control strategies in YRD. Our study reveals that the western Pacific Subtropical High shifts significantly southward (SWPSH) on regional pollution days compared to clean days, which results in intensified surface shortwave radiation, suppressed rainfall, weakened horizontal winds near the surface, and the development of an anomalous anticyclone with associated subsiding airflows over YRD. Such conditions are greatly beneficial to the accumulation of ozone by restraining air outflows after its enhanced photochemical formation in YRD. Subsequently, based on the GEOS-Chem simulation, we notice that local ozone, which is the dominant contributor to the surface ozone in YRD, has a positive concentration anomaly of 6.9 μg·m−3 (accounting for 44.7 % to the total ozone anomaly in YRD, the same as below) on regional pollution days. Furthermore, the North China Plain (NCP) and Twain-Hu Region (THR) ozone together exhibit high anomalies of 4.5 μg·m−3 (28.7 %) in YRD on these pollution days, which are driven by the abnormally northwestern and southwestern winds in source regions of NCP and THR, respectively. In addition to the substantial role of local ozone production, this study emphasizes the exceptional importance of regional ozone transport regulated by the SWPSH-driven anticyclone for ozone pollution in YRD, thereby providing a scientific basis for coordinated air quality management."

 Monitoring atmospheric stability is important for forecasting convection. To compensate for the insufficient temporal resolution of traditional techniques, precise precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) observations was employed to establish a model for retrieving the minute-level K-Index and Showalter Index for convective events. BDS-derived PWV (BDS-PWV) revealed the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.5 and 1.9 mm, respectively, with respect to the Fifth Generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA5). Compared with radiosonde data, the corresponding values were − 0.5 and 2.5 mm, respectively. This indicates the feasibility of using BDS-PWV for further modeling. Subsequently, two atmospheric stability indices were retrieved from the BDS-PWV using the traditional least-squares (LSQ), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) methods. The evaluation process adopted both the ERA5 reanalysis and satellite-based products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results indicated that the RF method performed best among the three methods. Taking ERA5 reanalysis as the reference, the average correlation coefficients, RMSEs, and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.98/0.97, 2.8/1.3 °C, and 3.8 %/5.0 % for the K-Index and Showalter Index, respectively. A similar performance was obtained when compared with MODIS products with average correlation coefficients, RMSEs, and MAPEs of 0.94/0.90, 4.8/1.9 °C, and 6.1 %/7.4 %, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the BDS-retrieved minute-level K-Index and Showalter Index for meteorological studies. Finally, the two modeled atmospheric stability indices were applied to three representative convective events that occurred in 2024 over Beijing and its surrounding areas. Temporal analysis of the two indices clearly revealed the onset and sustained processes of the convective events. Moreover, the forecasting results based on the two atmospheric stability indices demonstrated their potential for indicating convective rainfall. The proposed BDS-retrieved minute-level atmospheric stability indices can be useful indicators for monitoring and nowcasting atmospheric convection."

This paper investigates the characteristics and the multiscale meteorological drivers of these extreme events. The results show that the O3 peaks linked to higher near-surface temperatures, lower relative humidity in the near-surface layer, weaker near surface wind speeds, and stronger shortwave radiation in the NCP. While these meteorological conditions were primarily modulated by a Rossby wave train at 500 hPa over the upper and middle latitudes of Eurasia. The HadGEM3-GC31-LL model from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the sensitive experiment based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the linear baroclinic model effectively captured this wave train.

To address the problems of low spatiotemporal resolution and strong susceptibility to cloud interference in traditional sounding methods, this study proposes combining infrared hyperspectral data with ground-based GNSS observations and applying machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of water vapor profile retrievals. Using NOAA-20/CrIS infrared hyperspectral data combined with GNSS-derived Precipitable Water Vapor (GNSS-PWV) observations, water vapor vertical profiles over Europe were retrieved based on Transformer and Random Forest (RF) models. Radiosonde data from IGRA were used as the reference truth, and the results were compared with the official CrIS product (CrIS-EDR). The results show that, under clear-sky conditions, incorporating GNSS-PWV data reduced the average RMSE of the Transformer and RF models by approximately 23.7% and 44.9%, respectively, achieving overall accuracy comparable to the CrIS-EDR product. Under cloudy conditions, both models using CrIS data alone exhibited accuracy similar to CrIS-EDR; however, the inclusion of GNSS-PWV data led to reductions in RMSE of approximately 28.4% and 37.8% for the Transformer and RF models, respectively, relative to retrievals based solely on CrIS data, with the BIAS values further improved compared with the CrIS-EDR product. Overall, the joint retrieval using infrared hyperspectral and ground-based GNSS-PWV data significantly enhances the accuracy of specific humidity profile retrievals, showing clear advantages over the CrIS-EDR product, particularly under cloudy conditions."

 To address the issues of low accuracy and limited spatial resolution in traditional single data source precipitable water vapor (PWV) predictions, based on the strong spatiotemporal characteristics of PWV, we constructed a high-accuracy, high-spatial-resolution continuous real-time PWV prediction model based on multi-source PWV data fusion.

 sDrought is a complex extreme climate event that typically originates from anomalous atmospheric precipitation and progressively propagates through hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems, subsequently causing more severe impacts. Therefore, elucidating the propagation mechanisms among different types of droughts is crucial for enhancing drought early warning capabilities and achieving coordinated regulation across multiple systems. This study focuses on the Yellow River Basin (YRB) as the research area and, based on a multi-source dataset spanning 1982–2018, systematically investigates the propagation characteristics and spatiotemporal structure of meteorological drought to hydrological, agricultural, and ecological droughts from the perspective of drought events. This is achieved through the integrated application of run theory and an optimized drought migration model. The results indicate that in the YRB, the propagation time of droughts shows that hydrological drought occurs earlier than agricultural and ecological droughts. The drought propagation process in the YRB exhibits two typical patterns: a “high-frequency and fast-response” type and a “low-frequency and slow-response” type, corresponding respectively to regions with strong meteorological forcing and human activities. The three-dimensional spatiotemporal propagation pathways of typical years further reveal that meteorological droughts in the YRB occur frequently and expand rapidly. The hydrological droughts exhibit strong accumulation and persistence, with a response process markedly more pronounced than that of agricultural and ecological droughts, displaying significant regional disparities. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the propagation mechanisms among multiple drought types and provide a theoretical foundation and technical support for developing hierarchical early warning and coordinated response systems tailored to different sectors."

 Dicarboxylic acids (diacids) and related species act as critical molecular tracers for secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which significantly influence atmospheric chemical processes and climate forcing. Nevertheless, the origins and formation pathways of these compounds remain inadequately characterized, introducing considerable uncertainties in evaluating the climate effects of SOA. This study investigates the seasonal variability in molecular distribution and stable carbon isotopic compositions (δ13C) of diacid homologs in PM2.5 to elucidate their origins and formation mechanisms in an urban Liaocheng, China. Elevated concentrations of diacid homologs were observed in winter (1469 ± 1325 ng m−3) than in summer (884 ± 343 ng m−3), predominantly attributed to significant contributions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning for heating during cold months. In contrast, summertime aerosols exhibited stronger photochemical aging, evidenced by enriched δ13C values of oxalic acid (C2) and increased ratios of C2/succinic acid (C4), malonic acid (C3)/C4, and C2/diacids. Correlation analyses and positive matrix factorization identified gaseous photochemical oxidation (52.4 %) as the dominant formation pathway driven by O3 and solar radiation in summer, while aqueous oxidation (57.6 %) modulated by relative humidity, aerosol acidity, and liquid water content prevailed in winter. A consistent decrease in δ13C values with increasing carbon chain length aligns with kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) during oxidative processes. Inter-site comparisons reveal that urban sites exhibit the most depleted δ13C values in C2 due to dominant anthropogenic emissions, whereas less depleted values at rural and background sites reflect greater biogenic contributions and extensive photochemical aging. Strong correlations between δ13C values of C2 and the C2/diacids ratio (R2 ≥ 0.55) further support the use of δ13C as an effective proxy for organic aerosol aging. These findings underscore the necessity of adopting a balanced and coordinated approach to air pollution control, which must address both primary emissions and secondary formation processes, while considering the interplay with meteorological factors."

 On April 16th, 2024, Dubai experienced a record-breaking extreme rainfall event, with a total precipitation of 132.21 mm, accounting for 95.83 % of the month's total rainfall. The precipitation rate on April 16th was 128.86 mm/day, reflecting the abruptness of this event. This study defined the “Chimney effect” with this heavy rainfall. Using moisture budget analysis, the primary driver for this event was the anomalous vertical convection (7.46 mm/day), which was mainly contributed by the anomalous updrafts (exceeding 1.5 Pa/s). Conversely, the climatological zonal convection (−7.07 mm/day) had the largest inhibiting impact on rainfall. The anomalous signal of atmospheric circulation was 8 days earlier than this heavy rainfall, which was initially identified on April 8th with anomalous westerlies to the south of Dubai. This consistent phenomenon was accompanied by an anomalous northerlies on the 14th, resulting in a low pressure center over Dubai on the 16th, with a low-level convergence and upper-level divergence character. The increase of sea surface temperature in the northern Indian Ocean facilitated the transfer of moisture to Dubai. The presence of robust updrafts from 1000 to 200 hPa over Dubai on the 16th, shaped by an intense low pressure system, resulted in the lifting and cooling of warm and humid air from the Indian Ocean, culminating in heavy rainfall. While this event highlights the impact of climate change on arid regions, the study emphasizes the need to improve the resilience of infrastructure, particularly in light of the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events."

 Snow is an important water resource in high-altitude cold regions and snow drought (SD), characterized by a lack of on-ground snow, severely impacts agriculture, ecology, and socioeconomic wellbeing in such regions. However, systematic research on SD on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) remains lacking. In this study, we employed a high-dimensional vine copula-based method and combined this with various standardized indices to reveal the spatiotemporal variations of SD and the ways in which it propagates to soil-moisture drought (SMD) on the TP. We found that warm and dry snow drought (WDSD) accounted for the highest proportion (40.29 %) of SD, while warm snow drought (WSD) accounted for the lowest proportion (19.04 %). Annual precipitation and winter precipitation regulated the spatial distribution of SD characteristics. Under the known background of climate change on the TP, we discovered a significant decreasing trend in dry snow drought (DSD) along with increasing trends in WSD and WDSD; an overall rise in air temperature on the TP was responsible for these trends. The average propagation time (PT) from SD to SMD varied from 3.6 to 5.2 months depending on the type of SD, with relatively complex factors regulating the spatial distribution of PT. Climate change on the TP has intensified the DSD propagation process and weakened the WSD propagation process. Our findings have important implications for mitigating the impacts of drought under future global warming scenarios."

 To understand the spatiotemporal difference of atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) in the North China Plain (NCP), the chemical composition of PM2.5 and optical properties in Beijing during winter and summer of 2023 were investigated, along with parallel measurements at a mountainous site (Xinglong, ∼1000 m, a.s.l.). Although the light-absorption of BrC (Abs365) in Xinglong was comparable to that in Beijing, its light-absorptivity (MAE365) was much stronger; And both parameters exhibited higher values in winter than in summer at each site. Notably, the light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon aloft was 1.7-fold of that at the surface during the whole campaign, indicating an enhanced role of BrC in aerosol absorption in upper boundary layer. The source apportionment identified that biomass burning was the predominant source for the BrC at both sites (31 % ∼ 39 %), yet the fractional contribution of secondary formation aloft (34 %) was moderately enhanced by ∼4 % relative to that at the surface. As the important BrC chromophores, the nitrated aromatic compounds (NACs) in Xinglong were more abundant relative to these in Beijing, especially during wintertime. Among the detected NACs, 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitrocatechol were the most abundant species at the surface, while the mass fraction of 5-nitroguaiacol significantly enhanced aloft, even comparable to 4NP in summer. Additionally, aqueous chemistry could be an important pathway to NACs formation, even accounting for 80 % of the total NACs in a typical haze episode. Our findings provide more insight into the spatiotemporal variability in the physicochemical properties of BrC in NCP, which will facilitate the improvement of the model to accurately quantify its climatic impacts."

 As climate change accelerates, extreme precipitation is becoming more frequent and intense across East Asia, underscoring the need for improved understanding of evolving hydrological regimes. While most future projections have relied on CMIP6 models, the Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP) integrates terrestrial–oceanic carbon cycle feedback including nitrogen deposition and biogeochemical processes to enhance the reliability of climate projection. Despite these advancements, C4MIP has been underutilized in hydrological assessments for East Asia. In this study, we analyze multi-model ensembles from C4MIP to evaluate patterns of vertically integrated moisture flux convergence (VIMFC). Our results demonstrate that C4MIP offers improved skill in capturing both seasonal and annual VIMFC patterns, particularly during periods of pronounced convergence or divergence. Under the SSP5–8.5-bgc scenario, projections indicate intensified moisture convergence and an elevated risk of extreme precipitation over southeastern China and North Korea. These findings provide a diagnostic evaluation of C4MIP's hydrological performance and offer valuable insights for future regional climate projections and adaptation strategies."

 Water stress is a major environmental factor limiting vegetation productivity, however, large interactions between atmospheric and soil dryness still hinder a complete understanding of the main cause of the widespread drought-related decreased vegetation productivity. In this study, we investigated inter-annual changes in gross primary productivity during 1982 to 1998 and 1998 to 2018 using two independent remote sensing products. We also analyzed the impacts of temperature, soil moisture, and vapor pressure deficit on gross primary productivity trends during 1982 to 1998 and 1998 to 2018 to explore the causes of gross primary productivity declines during recent decades. Results show that gross primary productivity trend during 1998 to 2018 tends to stall after the year 1998 concurrent with a significant enhancement of a positive vapor pressure deficit trend during 1998 to 2018, particularly in forests, grasslands, and warmer regions. In the Northern Hemisphere, whilst increasing vapor pressure deficit plays a dominant role in weakening the gross primary productivity trend from 1998 to 2018, changing soil moisture and temperature also influences the trends as identified in different regional responses. In addition, results from 8 dynamic global vegetation models showed that the dynamic vegetation models fail to capture the inter-annual changes in gross primary productivity, likely due to an overestimation of gross primary productivity responses to soil water."

 To advance our knowledge of formation mechanisms in freezing rain and ice pellets, this study compares microphysical characteristics of two icing and freezing events over central China in February 2024 using co-located PARSIVEL disdrometer and Micro Rain Radar (MRR) at the Xianning national meteorological station. The two events are classified into three categories of rain, freezing rain, and ice pellets. Based on improved multiple bright-band detection method, the MRR can identify the bright band in mid-level warm layer for most samples, with high Probability of Detection (POD) of ∼80 %; whereas the low-level refreezing layer is detected only for ice pellets, with POD of ∼68 %. Rain and freezing rain are featured with a three-phase layer: (1) an ice-phase layer where snow particles transform partially into graupel particles (∼55 %); (2) a melting layer where most particles melt into drizzle/rain particles (∼90 %), with notable bright-band features; (3) a liquid-phase layer where radar reflectivity increase but Doppler velocity decrease, due to collision-coalescence processes. In contrast, ice pellets are characterized by a four-phase layer: (1) an ice-phase layer where most snow particles transform into graupel particles (∼85 %), due to riming processes; (2) a melting layer where graupel particles partially melt into rain/drizzle particles (∼55 %); (3) a multi-phase layer where graupel, mixed, drizzle and rain particles coexist, (4) a refreezing layer with decreased radar reflectivity (∼6 dB) and increased spectral width (∼0.1 m/s). Through an improved understanding of formation and transformation mechanisms of freezing rain and ice pellets, we hope to provide useful information to forecasters for predicting these potentially damaging events."
