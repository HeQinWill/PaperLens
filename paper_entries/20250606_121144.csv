We identified five major emission sources: coal combustion, oil burning, transportation, industrial manufacture, and waste handling. Emission outputs were calculated by integrating the emission factors and activity levels of vanadium-related processes. Our results identified the key emitters and highlighted the spatial and temporal patterns of vanadium release. 
 Anthropogenic activities are the major contributor to vanadium pollution in surficial environment, but quantitative assessment of anthropogenic vanadium emission across environmental receptors remains scarce. This study develops a nationwide vanadium emission inventory in China for 2015–2019, covering five major anthropogenic sources: coal combustion, stationary oil burning, transportation, industrial production, and waste handling. A cumulative flux model reveals emissions of 211 095, 3725, and 0.1 t of vanadium into the atmosphere, soil, and water during 2015–2019, respectively, highlighting the atmosphere as the primary vanadium receptor. Coal combustion (46.7 %) and stationary oil burning (40.1 %) are the largest vanadium contributors. The emission pattern is mainly shaped by regional activity levels, with Shandong, Liaoning, Hebei, and Guangdong contributing 35.8 % of national inventories. Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, designated as energy-producing bases, dominate coal-combustion-related emission. Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei achieves significant emission reductions due to coal restriction policies and adoption of cleaner energy and an advanced end-of-pipe system. In economically developed coastal regions, coal consumption has decreased, while oil consumption makes a greater contribution due to industrial modernization. Moreover, steelmaking operations account for 88.2 % emission in industrial production, and this continues to increase nationwide. Emissions induced by vanadium mining show remarkable spatial heterogeneity, with 66.1 % of output in southwestern China. Inventory uncertainties are driven by insufficiently resolved activity data, poorly characterized emission factors, and variability in vanadium content in raw materials, particularly in coal combustion, transportation, and waste disposal sectors. These findings underscore the atmosphere as the main vanadium receptor and identify the primary contributors, which is helpful to develop targeted mitigation strategies."

Arellano,Source contribution to ozone pollution during June 2021 fire events in Arizona: insights from WRF-Chem-tagged O3 and CO,"We assess the contributions of fire and anthropogenic emissions to O3 levels in Phoenix, Arizona, during a period of intense heat and drought conditions. We find that fire exacerbates O3 pollution and that interactions between weather, climate, and air chemistry are important to consider. This has implications for activities related to formulating emission reduction strategies in areas that are currently understudied yet becoming relevant due to reports of increasing global aridity. 
 This study quantifies wildfire contributions to O3 pollution in Arizona, relative to local and regional emissions. Using WRF-Chem with O3 and CO tags, we analyzed emissions during June 2021, a period of drought, extreme heat, and wildfires. Our results show that background O3 accounted for ∼50 % of total O3, while local anthropogenic emissions contributed 24 %–40 %, consistent with recent estimates for Phoenix. During peak smoke conditions, fire-related O3 ranged from 5 to 23 ppb (5 %–21 % of total O3), averaging 15 ppb (15 %). These estimates were compared with model sensitivity tests excluding fire emissions, which confirmed the spatiotemporal pattern of fire-driven O3, though the model underestimated the magnitude by a factor of 1.4. The results further demonstrate that wildfires exacerbate O3 exceedances over urban areas. Our analysis reveals key differences in O3 sources: Phoenix's O3 was mainly driven by local emissions, while Yuma's was heavily influenced by transboundary transport from California and Mexico. Wildfires not only boosted O3 formation but also altered winds and atmospheric chemistry in Phoenix and downwind areas. O3 increases along the smoke plume resulted from NOX and volatile organic compound (VOC) interactions, with fire-driven O3 forming in NOX-limited zones near the urban interface. Downwind, O3 chemistry shifted, shaped by higher NOX in central Phoenix and more VOCs in suburban and rural areas. Winds weakened and turned westerly near fire-affected areas. This study highlights the value of high-resolution modeling with tagging to disentangle wildfire and regional O3 sources, particularly in arid regions, where extreme heat intensifies O3 pollution, making accurate source attribution essential."

The CO2 lasers required are bulky and maintenance-intensive, limiting their use in the field. We have developed a compact solid-state IR laser that is easily aligned with the particle beam. Mass spectra and hit rates are similar to those of the CO2 laser. For combined characterization of organic and inorganic particle compositions, both lasers are superior to conventional single UV pulses. 
 Recent advancements in single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS) have enabled the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons at the individual particle level in conjunction with inorganic/refractory particle components. However, the laser desorption (LD) of organic material from particles prior to their ionization in a two-step process necessitates pulsed infrared lasers with adequate pulse energy that can be irregularly triggered on detected particles. Pulsed CO2 lasers with a 10.6 µm wavelength have been traditionally utilized, yet these lasers are bulky and costly and require regular maintenance, including gas exchange or a continuous laser gas supply. In this study, we present the application of a prototype solid-state laser based on an erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) crystal, emitting long pulses of 200 µs at 3 µm wavelength as a compact, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternative for LD. We directly compared the new laser with a commonly used CO2 laser and found similar performance in LD for both laboratory particles and ambient air experiments. With the exception of slightly increased fragmentation observed with the CO2 laser due to its beam profile, no qualitative differences were noted in the resulting mass spectra. Additionally, we compared a novel two-step ionization (LD-REMPI–LDI) with the conventional single-step LDI regarding the potential to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and inorganics in laboratory and field experiments. The combined methods demonstrated superior performance in the detection of PAHs, for both the CO2 and the new Er:YAG laser. In addition to its higher sensitivity and lower fragmentation for PAHs when compared to single-step LDI, it is less dependent on the particle matrix, sharing the benefits of traditional two-step methods but extending its capability to combine PAH measurements with the LDI-based detection of inorganic particle compounds."

We present a new 3-year dataset of NO2 vertical profiles in Toronto, Canada, and evaluate it using NO2 from satellite and surface monitoring networks and simulations by an air quality forecast model. We quantify and explain the differences among the datasets to provide information that can be used to understand NO2 variability. 
 The purpose of this work is to derive new nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical profiling data products from Pandora spectrometers and investigate the factors contributing to the bias of this dataset relative to established ground-based and spaceborne datasets. Possible applications of the NO2 vertical profile dataset include air quality monitoring and satellite validation studies. We explore the application of the optimal estimation method to Pandora multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements to retrieve vertical profile information for NO2. We use the Heidelberg Profile (HeiPro) retrieval algorithm to derive, for the first time, NO2 profiles and partial columns (0–4 km) from Pandora MAX-DOAS measurements from  2018–2020 from Downsview, a suburban neighbourhood in the northern end of Toronto, Canada, that is subject to local traffic emissions and urban influences. Validation of the new dataset was done via comparison with official Pandora direct-Sun measurements, in situ observations, satellite data, and an air quality forecasting model. We find that, for tropospheric partial column comparisons, the HeiPro dataset has a positive mean relative bias to Pandora direct-Sun (61 ± 9.7 %) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; 37 ± 51 %) observations, as well as the Global Environmental Multiscale–Modelling Air quality and Chemistry (GEM-MACH) model output (67 ± 7.1 %), with similar seasonal and diurnal cycles in the bias with Pandora direct-Sun and GEM-MACH data. Contributing factors to the large bias of HeiPro-to-Pandora direct-Sun measurements were investigated, and NO2 heterogeneity, combined with differences between direct-Sun and multi-axis viewing geometries, was found to contribute a maximum of 52 % of the total relative bias during morning measurement times. For surface NO2 comparisons, we find that HeiPro measurements capture the magnitude and diurnal variability in surface NO2 reasonably well (mean relative bias to in situ surface NO2 of −9.7 ± 7.5 %) but are biased low compared to GEM-MACH (mean relative bias of −37 ± 2.4 %). Compared to HeiPro, the GEM-MACH model profiles are biased high in the lower boundary layer and biased low in the free troposphere."

Utilizing a novel approach that combines machine learning with physical constraints, our model generates more accurate and physically reasonable estimates compared to existing datasets. This advancement enables improved understanding of ocean-atmosphere interactions, which are crucial for monitoring Earth's energy and water cycles and enhancing climate change projections. 
 Air-sea turbulent heat fluxes, including the sensible heat flux (SHF) and latent heat flux (LHF), along with the Bowen ratio (β, ratio of SHF to LHF), are crucial for understanding air-sea interaction and global energy and water budgets. However, the existing products, primarily developed using the semi-empirical bulk aerodynamic methods and data-driven machine learning approaches, are often weak in accuracy and physical rationality, due to the uncertainties in the environmental forcings and inappropriate parameterizations. In this study, we generated a global daily 0.25° product of air-sea turbulent heat fluxes using the Bowen ratio-constrained Neural Network (NN) model (referred to as the BrTHF model) that could coordinately estimate the SHF and LHF, along with the observations from 197 globally distributed buoys and multi-source remote sensing and reanalysis forcings. The spatial ten-fold cross-validation results showed that the BrTHF model, achieving root mean square errors of 6.05 W/m2, 23.67 W/m2 and 0.22 and correlation coefficients of 0.93, 0.91 and 0.25 for the SHF, LHF and β, respectively, outperformed the physics-agnostic NN model and seven widely used air-sea turbulent heat flux products (including JOFURO3, IFREMER, SeaFlux, ERA5, MERRA2, OAFlux, and OHF). Furthermore, the inter-comparison of the spatial distribution of multi-year means, as well as intra-annual and inter-annual change patterns showed that the BrTHF product reliably simulated global SHF, LHF and β, in contrast to the machine learning-based OHF product that failed to replicate these patterns. The main advantage of the BrTHF model lies in its improved rationality of β estimates, successfully eliminating the outliers observed in the physics-agnostic NN model and the seven typical products. The improved SHF, LHF, and β estimates can allow for more accurate quantification of the global air-sea energy and water budgets, enhance our understanding of air-sea interaction, and improve projections of climate change under global warming. The 0.25° daily global product from 1993 to 2017 can be freely accessed from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC) [https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.302578, Tang and Wang (2025)]."

Moist thermodynamics is formulated via thermodynamic potentials, avoiding inconsistencies that can be introduced with conventional approaches. Numerical methods typical of weather and climate models are used, with no explicit subgrid scheme. Results highlight some advantages (e.g. large time steps) and disadvantages (e.g. weak vertical fluxes near the surface) of this approach. 
 A new computational fluid dynamics code for large eddy simulation (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer and convection is presented and made available. A key novelty is that moist thermodynamics is formulated in terms of thermodynamic potentials, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Despite the apparent complexity of the thermodynamic potential approach, the model's performance demonstrates that it is feasible and effective at reasonable computational cost for three-dimensional simulations. Semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian numerical methods are used; such methods are unusual for simulating boundary layer and convective flows and are more typical of global atmospheric models. Moreover, the model includes no explicit scheme to represent subgrid-scale fluxes of scalars and momentum but relies instead on the mixing and dissipation resulting from the numerical methods used; in other words, it employs implicit LES (ILES). Sample results from several standard LES test cases show that the model's ability to capture the main aspects of the flows is comparable to other LES models. At the same time, the results highlight limitations of the ILES approach near the bottom boundary and suggest that ILES might need to be augmented in some way, for example, by distributing the convergence of surface fluxes over several model layers. Also, results for a marine stratocumulus case show a significant sensitivity to different options for the numerical methods and parameters used. Further development and application of the code would benefit from a deeper understanding of both the bottom boundary behaviour and the sensitivities to numerics."

The statistical model is first built with observations and then applied to the simulated environment to generate possibly observed fluxes. This novel method provides insight into differently evaluating the numerical formulation of turbulent heat fluxes with a long period of observational data. 
 This study proposes using a data-driven statistical model to freeze errors due to differences in environmental forcing when evaluating surface turbulent heat fluxes from weather and climate numerical models with observations. It takes advantage of continuous acquisition over approximately 10 years of near-surface sensible and latent heat fluxes (H and LE respectively) together with ancillary parameters at the Météopole flux station, a supersite of the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure in France (ACTRIS-FR), located in Toulouse. The statistical model consists of several multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with the same architecture. A total of 13 variables characterizing environmental forcing in the surface layer on an hourly timescale are used as input parameters to estimate the observed H and LE simultaneously. The MLPs are trained using 5-year observational data under a 5-fold cross-validation. The remaining data are used to test the estimates under unknown conditions. The performance of the statistical model ranges within the state-of-the-art surface parameterization schemes on hourly and seasonal timescales. It also has a good generalization ability, but it hardly estimates negative H and large LE. A case study is conducted with data from a regional climate simulation. The statistical model is used to evaluate the simulated fluxes in the simulated environment to better examine the flaws of their numerical formulation throughout the simulation. Comparison of simulated fluxes with observed and MLP-based fluxes shows different results. According to MLP-based fluxes in the simulated environment, the land surface scheme of this climate model tends to underestimate large sensible heat flux. Thus, it incorrectly partitions between surface heating and evaporation during the late summer. Our innovative method provides insight into different techniques for evaluating simulated near-surface turbulent heat fluxes when a long period of comprehensive observations is available. It can usefully support ongoing efforts to improve surface parameterization schemes."

Recent studies have shown that Mn-oxidizing bacteria can harbor multiple Mn oxidases, but environmental controls on the regulation of these enzymes are unknown. Here, we examine the activation of the genes encoding for MnxG and McoA, two Mn oxidases in Pseudomonas putida GB-1, in response to varying Mn(II) concentrations. Using reporter gene fusion strains, we found that mnxG and mcoA are activated only by a fraction of the cells in the population and at different threshold Mn concentrations, with an increasing proportion of cells expressing mnxG (<10 μM) and then mcoA (>10 to 500 μM). Kinetic modeling showed that coexpression of mnxG and mcoA not only alleviates substrate saturation and inhibition of MnxG at high Mn(II) concentrations but also results in an 8-fold increase in the initial rate of Mn oxidation in the wild type compared to strains lacking mnxG or mcoA. The population-level control of gene activation and, ultimately, Mn oxide precipitation, in response to the initial Mn(II) concentration, shows that P. putida fine-tunes the regulation of multiple Mn oxidases to operate under varying environmental conditions."

This study investigated the potential influences of DOM and POM on multiphase distribution process and migration of PFAAs. Results indicated that the origin and humification degree of DOM and POM were different, leading to distinct effects on the partitioning and migration of PFAAs. Overall, DOM inhibited adsorption of PFAAs to SPM, while POM promoted it, with protein-like components playing a more significant role than humus-like components. As the humification degree of DOM increases, its inhibiting effect decreases due to a reduced affinity of DOM components for PFAAs. In contrast, this effect is less pronounced in POM due to its higher humification degree. Furthermore, during the sedimentation of particulate PFAAs, wind can shift their pollution hotspots away from the emission source, probably increasing the spread of ecological risks. These findings indicate that DOM and POM may alter the fate of PFAAs by changing their partitioning, highlighting the need for strategies to prevent potential risks in practice."

When released into aquatic environments, commercial PFAS and associated byproducts may be transformed by hydrolysis to form more persistent products. For example, hydrolysis of perfluorinated carboxylic acid esters leads to perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). Quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) previously developed for predicting carboxylic acid ester hydrolysis rates are assessed for their predictive performance for perfluorinated molecules using compiled perfluorinated alkyl ester hydrolysis data. The assessment indicates that the model(s) are capable of estimating half-lives of various chain-lengths of perfluorinated alkyl esters; however, predictive performance could be improved through more accurate calculated chemical descriptor values for precursors of PFCAs. In particular, more accurate estimated pKa values are needed to improve hydrolysis rate predictions. The performance of several available cheminformatic applications (ChemAxon, SPARC, pkasolver, MolGpka and OPERA) is assessed for estimating pKa values for PFCAs and FTOHs, highlighting the need for improvements in predicting pKa values for longer-chain PFAS with perfluorinated α-carbons adjacent to the OC═O ester group."

Here, we investigated the toxicity of DMMTA to rice plants during both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Compared with arsenite (As[III]), arsenate (As[V]), and dimethylarsenate (DMA), DMMTA exhibited markedly higher toxicity to rice primary root growth, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 1 order of magnitude lower. Rice roots took up DMMTA approximately 10 times more efficiently than DMA. DMMTA was converted to DMA prior to xylem translocation to rice shoots. DMMTA exposure at the rice booting stage induced severe symptoms of straighthead disease, with a potency being >5 times of DMA exposure. Most of the arsenic accumulated in the husks of DMMTA-exposed plants was in the form of DMA. Application of silicon decreased the uptake of DMMTA and alleviated straighthead disease.

However, •OH can be useful in remediating recalcitrant organic contaminants in soils. Understanding the (system-specific) safe range of EPFRs produced by biochars requires knowing both the context of their use and their overall significance in the existing suite of environmental radicals, which has rarely been addressed. Here we place EPFRs in a broader environmental context, showing that biochar can have EPFR concentrations from 108-fold lower to 109-fold higher than EPFRs from other environmental sources, depending on feedstock, production conditions, and degree of environmental aging. We also demonstrate that •OH radical concentrations from biochar EPFRs can be from 104-fold lower to 1017-fold higher than other environmental sources, depending on EPFR type and concentration, reaction time, oxidant concentration, and extent of environmental EPFR persistence. For both EPFR and •OH concentrations, major uncertainties derive from the range of biochar properties and  the range of data reporting practices. Controlling feedstock lignin content and pyrolysis conditions are the most immediate options for managing EPFRs. Co-application of compost to provide organics may serve as a postpyrolysis method to quench and reduce biochar EPFRs."

This study employed multiaxis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technology with a coupled radiative transfer model-machine learning (RTM-ML) framework to retrieve high-resolution aerosol optical properties in Shanghai. Retrievals indicated vertically decreasing aerosols, peaking in the upper atmosphere in the summer and in the lower atmosphere in the winter. Aerosol hygroscopicity followed similar seasonal patterns but increased with the altitude. Multifactor driving ML models and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to investigate the drivers to aerosol variation. Results indicated that emissions, east–west transport, and atmospheric oxidation were the main drivers of aerosols below 0.5 km. Above 0.5 km, humidity and atmospheric oxidation became dominant, suggesting that hygroscopic growth and secondary aerosol formation were more prominent. North–south transport also significantly influenced aerosol distribution within 0.5 to 1.6 km. Meteorological normalization emphasized that emission reduction can effectively lower aerosols in the lower atmosphere, while enhanced atmospheric oxidation promoted secondary aerosol formation, particularly in the upper atmosphere. These findings advance the understanding of multiple factors in shaping the vertical aerosol distributions and highlight that emission reduction strategies for addressing compound pollution should be conceived with a multidimensional and multifactorial understanding."

Styrene-like compounds are special aromatics, as they can react with the ozone to generate phenyl-substituted sCIs (C6H5CHOO), yet no prior study has directly characterized such sCIs. This study took styrene and trans-β-methylstyrene as proxies for styrene-like compounds. Matrix isolation combined with infrared spectroscopy technology was applied to capture anti- and syn-C6H5CHOO at 972 and 930 cm–1, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations enabled the identification of intermediates and verified the reactivity of sCIs’ unimolecular decomposition and bimolecular reactions with water vapor. Besides the reported organic peroxy radical (RO2) + sCIs + hydroperoxy radical (HO2) reactions, oligomers formed via RO2 + sCIs + R′O2, HO2 + sCIs + HO2/R′O2, and highly oxygenated RO2 + sCIs + HO2/R′O2 reactions were also proposed based on chamber experiments. At higher relative humidity, C6H5CHOO-related oligomers emerged as the most prominent aerosol components. The insertion of C6H5CHOO units was found to dramatically reduce oligomer volatility and enhance oligomer toxicity. The lower susceptibility to removal by water vapor suggests more competitive particle generation and even nucleation involving C6H5CHOO, providing insights into urban air pollution mechanisms and the identification of toxic compounds in particles."

Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating the aspiration water volume, the aspiration frequency, and the alveolar deposition fraction, reveal that low L. pneumophila concentrations in water can yield an appreciable infection risk in populations prone to aspiration.

Zeng,Cohort Evidence Links Phthalate Exposure to Early Onset of Puberty in Chinese Girls,"Girls’ age of onset puberty has decreased globally in recent years. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to phthalate esters (PAEs) could play a role in this trend. However, the relationship between PAE exposure and pubertal development in Chinese girls remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to address this issue by investigating the link between levels of urinary phthalate ester metabolites (mPAEs) and the risk of early puberty among 546 Chinese girls (6–8 years old) over a two-year monitoring program. Poisson regression, restricted cubic spline models, weighted quantile sum regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression were used to assess both individual and combined effects of PAEs on pubertal development. Significant links were found between urinary concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, the total of low molecular weight mPAEs, the total of nine commonly detected mPAEs, and the total of all mPAEs with the risk of early breast development (all P-trend < 0.05). Furthermore, levels of MnBP, MiBP, low molecular weight mPAEs, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate were positively associated with early menarche. Mixture effect analysis revealed incidence rate ratios of 1.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–2.45) for early breast development and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.22–4.45) for early menarche. Short-chain mPAEs, particularly MiBP and MnBP, were identified as the major contributors to this combined effect. The present study demonstrated that exposure to PAEs, particularly short-chain PAEs, could lead to the early onset of puberty in Chinese girls."

Here, we aim to estimate the long-term association between exposure to PM2.5 and depressive symptoms in China utilizing longitudinal models for prolonged exposures as well as a quasi-experimental design utilizing data from 23151 participants over 4 longitudinal waves that occurred in 124 cities in China between 2011 to 2018. Mixed-effects models as well as distributed lag nonlinear mixed models were fitted to assess the relationship between PM2.5 and depressive symptoms. We also assessed the effect of the Clean Air Policy (CAP) based on a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DID) design. The overall average PM2.5 concentrations generally declined with time from 59.40 to 39.35 μg/m3. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.86% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 1.64%) in depression score based on the first three waves of data. However, the associations were sensitive to secular trends. Flexible exposure–lag–response analysis indicated a potentially influential window for lag-years 0–6.

In this study, we employed a longitudinal approach, capitalizing on multitime-point evaluations of exposure to OPEs  and two-stage assessments of children’s brain development. The study included 508 mother-child pairs. We measured seven OPEs in maternal serum throughout pregnancy and assessed children’s mental health and developmental milestones at the age of 2 and 5. The group-based trajectory model identified pregnancy exposure trajectories. Generalized estimated equations and quantile-based g-computation were employed to evaluate the effects of OPEs on children’s brain development. Four OPEs, including 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), were detected in over 50% of the maternal samples. Each ln-unit increment of EHDPP was associated with an increased peer problem scores (IRR: 1.104, 95% CI: 1.038–1.174) in mental health. Regarding development milestones, EHDPP was related to lower scores in communication, gross motor, personal-social, and total score of the ages and stages questionnaires (ASQ) (IRR: 0.963–0.976). Trajectory analysis confirmed these associations. Notably, boys were more affected in terms of mental health, while girls were more vulnerable in terms of developmental milestones.

Comparative analyses suggest higher BTH, 2-thiocyanomethylthio-benzothiazole (TCMTB), and xylyltriazole (XTR) in frequent commuters compared to infrequent ones (P < 0.05), implying their traffic-related origins. Seasonal variations pinpoint higher TNOC exposure burden generally during the winter, possibly due to the increased leaching from winter tires.

In this study, we raised mice from birth in pig manure-fertilized red (Ultisols) and black (Mollisols) soils or unfertilized controls, sampling their gut microbiomes at 8 weeks, to show that early life exposure to manure-fertilized soil profoundly shapes the gut antibiotic resistome in mice. Application of organic manure significantly enriched tetracycline-resistant ARGs in both red and black soils. Mice living in these environments harbored markedly higher abundances of ARGs, particularly the tet(Q) gene, compared to those in nonfertilized environments. Notably, Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae were identified as key hosts of tet(Q), with evidence suggesting a horizontal gene transfer between these families.

While nonlinear effects become more pronounced at higher resolutions, the nonlinearly developed perturbations from initial EnSVs by full models still demonstrate significant growth in the target region.

Ions are up to 10 times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become softer (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non‐thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection."

The Kronian magnetosphere is rotationally driven, thus dawn‐dusk asymmetry has been observed in the KHI structures. However, analyses based on the Cassini data have yielded a discrepancy, with some studies indicating more KHI features on the duskside and others on the dawnside. To investigate the physical origin of the dawn‐dusk asymmetry of the Kronian KHI, three‐dimensional high‐resolution global simulations of the Kronian magnetosphere have been developed. We found that KHI structures continuously develop in the prenoon sector and propagate toward both the dawn and dusk sides, exhibiting clear dawn‐dusk asymmetry during their growth and propagation. Our study reveals the dawn‐dusk asymmetric characteristics of KHI along Kronian magnetopause, including its growth and propagation, providing important insights into the interaction between rotation‐driven magnetosphere and solar wind."

Using California as an example, we investigate how seismic monitoring capability, particularly the completeness magnitude (Mc ${M}_{c}$), influences the inferred proportion of mainshocks with foreshocks (Pf ${P}_{f}$). We test four foreshock identification methods, namely the fixed‐window, nearest neighbor clustering, empirical statistical (ES) methods and the epidemic‐type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. The fixed‐window method shows Pf ${P}_{f}$ decreasing with higher Mc ${M}_{c}$ due to the misclassification of background events as foreshocks. In contrast, clustering and ES methods yield relatively stable Pf ${P}_{f}$ across different Mc ${M}_{c}$ values. The ETAS model suggests that many foreshocks in California are associated with aseismic driving processes, but the identification of the processes diminishes at high Mc ${M}_{c}$. These results show that improved seismic monitoring capability does not significantly increase Pf ${P}_{f}$ but is crucial for distinguishing processes driving foreshocks."

It paves the globe with hexagons and 12 pentagons of similar surface areas rather than with regular longitude‐latitude rectangles. It is available in a complete, nonlinear version and in a linearized configuration for use in variational atmospheric inversions. It runs on graphics processing units like the previous version. The previous advection approach and physical parameterizations have been kept while the code has been restructured for better numerical efficiency. The change of mesh was made necessary by the evolution of the parent LMDz model, but the technical and scientific evaluation of the new version with a roughly constant number of cells shows some interesting advantages. This evaluation is based on an 11‐year simulation of sulfur hexafluoride and on a 10‐year atmospheric inversion assimilating column‐averaged dry air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) retrieved from measurements of NASA's second Orbiting Carbon Observatory. As it is used in variational inversion and at 90‐km resolution with 79 layers in the vertical, we find that the new offline model is twice as fast. Further, it shows improved interhemispheric transport, some small improvements in terms of inferred (posterior) atmospheric concentrations and small differences in terms of inferred surface fluxes compared to the previous version.

However, their feedback processes remain poorly understood during boreal spring. In April–May 2024, South China experienced record‐breaking extreme rainfall in the decaying phase of the El Niño event. This extreme event is driven by significant crossing‐time scale interactions, which offers a unique opportunity to evaluate their subseasonal predictability in dynamic models. Our results reveal that the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) enhanced by El Niño decaying represents the response to slowly varying oceanic forcing. In contrast, quasi‐biweekly Rossby wave trains in the extratropics and the eastward‐propagating Tibetan Plateau vortex reflect the atmospheric initial conditions. These extratropical atmospheric disturbances reduce the anomalous WPSH via positive advection of anomalous vorticity, thus offsetting the influences of oceanic forcing. Although the anomalous WPSH and above‐normal rainfall pattern exhibit high predictability on the monthly timescale, the skillful forecasting of the three extreme rainfall events is less than 1 week. These findings suggest that the extratropical atmospheric disturbances, as initial conditions, can undermine the predictability stemming from tropical air‐sea interactions. The forecast skill of the extreme rainfall process in spring is limited by the memory of initial atmospheric states and the intrinsic constraints of weather predictions."

In such a future, naturally occurring VRE droughts need to be evaluated for their potential impact on grid reliability. This study is the first of its kind to examine the impacts of compound VRE energy droughts in the Western U.S. across a range of potential future climate and infrastructure scenarios. We find that compound VRE drought severity may increase significantly in the future, primarily due to the dramatic increase in wind and solar generation needed in some future infrastructure scenarios. We find that in our future climate scenario, the variability of energy drought severity increases, which has implications for sizing energy storage necessary for mitigating drought events. We also examine the spatial patterns of compound VRE drought events that effect multiple regions of the grid simultaneously. These co‐occurring events have distinct spatial patterns depending on the season. We observed overall fewer connected events in the future with the combined effect of potential climate and infrastructure changes, although in the fall we observe a climate‐induced shift toward events which impact more regions simultaneously."

However, projecting future MCS behavior remains challenging due to the limitations of regional models and the inadequate representation of MCSs in coarser climate models. In this study, we use GFDL's global storm‐resolving model (GSRM), X‐SHiELD, to explore the response of global MCSs to both increased sea surface temperatures (SST) and elevated CO2 levels using three sets of unique two‐year‐long warming simulations. We find that SST warming leads to an increase in MCS occurrence over ocean regions while reducing it over land, whereas elevated CO2 results in an overall increase over ocean and land. When SST and CO2 increases are combined, their impacts on MCS changes are generally additive. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, we identify the key environmental drivers of these changes across five MCS hotspots, highlighting the regional variability in MCS responses. Furthermore, MCS‐associated precipitation and its contribution to total rainfall are shaped by changes in both MCS frequency and the precipitation intensity within each event. By utilizing the explicit MCS‐resolving capabilities of GSRMs, this study provides critical insights into future changes in MCS characteristics and their implications for global precipitation patterns."

Natural phytoplankton communities were incubated for 5‐day under 4 scenarios (present and future conditions, and 2 intermediate scenarios). In the PFZ, +3°C and acidification stimulated the growth of phytoplankton, mainly cyanobacteria, while intensified dust inputs alone did not have notable impact. Conversely, in HNLC waters, the addition of Fe‐dust alone increased the total chlorophyll a of diatoms (mainly F. kerguelensis), whereas the negative effect of acidification and +3°C counteracted the positive impact of dust input on the diatoms. In these waters, future conditions benefited smaller species (haptophytes and cyanobacteria). The net particulate organic carbon production (POC) was also unaltered by future conditions, suggesting that primary production may not change in the future SO.

These are: river floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, tropical cyclone‐induced winds and crop failures. In line with the existing literature, we find sharp increases in the occurrence of many individual hazards and impacts, notably heatwaves and wildfires. Under a medium‐high emission scenario, many regions worldwide transition from chiefly experiencing a given category of hazard or impact in isolation to routinely experiencing compound hazard or impact occurrences. A similarly striking change is projected for the future recurrence of compound hazards or impacts, with many locations experiencing specific compound occurrences at least once a year for several years, or even decades, in a row. In the absence of effective global climate mitigation actions, we may thus witness a qualitative regime shift from a world dominated by individual climate‐related hazards and impacts to one where compound occurrences become the norm."

Land use in the U.S. will be affected directly by local and regional forces and indirectly through international trade. In order to investigate the effects of several potential forces on land use changes in the U.S., we advanced capabilities in representing the interactions between natural and human systems by linking a multisectoral and multiregional socio‐economic model of the world economy to a model that downscales land use to a 0.5°grid scale. This enables us to translate regional projections of future land use into higher‐resolution representations of time‐evolving land cover (effectively spatially explicit land use transitions). We applied the framework over the U.S., with a particular interest in the Mississippi River Basin and its four sub‐basins, to consider how a range of global drivers affect land use and cover in the target regions. Our results show that under scenarios of high pressure on the world food system a comparative advantage in livestock production amplifies the recent trend toward less cropland and more pastures in the U.S. Under low pressures on the world food system agricultural land is used less intensively. However, there can be key differences among the various land‐use transitions at the sub‐ basin scale. Overall, these results highlighted the need for high resolution details to explicitly understand the implications of land use change on environmental impacts such as carbon storage, soil erosion, chemical use, hydrology, and water quality."

 Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination1,2. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe2+-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc—which is required for iron incorporation—in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes.

 Supported metal catalysts that integrate atomically dispersed species with controlled structures lie at the forefront of catalytic materials design, offering exceptional control over reactivity and high metal utilization, approaching the precision of molecular systems1–3. However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure–activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications1,2. Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that 195Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures. Beyond SACs, this approach lays the foundation for studying more complex architectures, such as dual-atom or single-cluster catalysts, containing various NMR-active metals.

 Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons1. When quark–antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. Although these phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task2. Here we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays3–5. We show that a (2 + 1)-dimensional LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry6, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade7. Long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses and the string tension. We experimentally probe string breaking in equilibrium by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, distinguishing regions within the confined phase dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string-breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work provides opportunities for exploring phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.

 The development of life on Earth has been enabled by its volatile-rich surface. The volatile budget of Earth’s surface is controlled by the balance between ingassing (for example, via subduction) and outgassing (for example, through magmatic and tectonic processes). Although volatiles within Earth’s interior are relatively depleted compared to CI chondrites, the total amount of volatiles within Earth is still substantial due to its vast size. However, the relative extent of diffuse degassing from Earth’s interior, not directly related to volcanism, is not well constrained. Here we use dissolved helium and high-precision argon isotopes combined with radiocarbon of dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwater from the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer (Washington and Idaho, USA). We identify mantle and crustal volatile sources and quantify their fluxes to the surface. Excess helium and argon in the groundwater indicate a mixture of sub-continental lithospheric mantle and crustal sources, suggesting that passive degassing of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle may be an important, yet previously unrecognized, outgassing process. This finding that considerable outgassing may occur even in volcanically quiescent parts of the crust is essential for quantifying the long-term global volatile mass balance.

 Same-dip double subduction systems influence plate kinematics, geometry and mantle flow within the region bounded by the two subduction zones. However, whether these effects extend to nearby plate margin tectonics remains an open question. Furthermore, the range of geodynamic processes operating in these margins and driving non-collisional orogeny (that is, the formation of Andean-type mountain ranges) is not yet fully understood. Here we explore the potential geodynamic connection between the tectonic evolution of northeast Japan and the development of the Ryukyu/Izu–Bonin–Marianas same-dip double subduction using three-dimensional geodynamic models. We find that this same-dip double subduction drags the Pacific trench westwards, resulting in northward-propagating trench advance and compression affecting the northeastern Japan arc and back-arc. We thus propose that the dynamics of the Ryukyu/Izu–Bonin–Marianas same-dip double subduction over the past ~10–5 Myr drove the enigmatic plate kinematics responsible for non-collisional orogeny and back-arc subduction initiation in northeast Japan since ~6–3.5 Myr ago, which has made this region prone to catastrophic earthquakes. We also suggest that same-dip double subduction explains various ancient episodes of widespread non-collisional orogenesis and represents a mechanism through which subduction zones establish the plate kinematic conditions necessary for non-collisional orogenesis. The mountain ranges of northeast Japan were formed by the Ryukyu/Izu–Bonin–Marianas same-dip double subduction system in a process that may have driven other non-collisional orogens, according to geologically constrained three-dimensional geodynamic simulations."

 Frequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in vulnerable populations has raised concerns that this may contribute to T cell exhaustion, which could negatively affect the quality of immune protection. Herein, we examined the impact of repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on T cell phenotypic and functional exhaustion in frail older adults in long-term care (n = 23), individuals on immunosuppressive drugs (n = 10), and healthy adults (n = 43), in Canada. Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels did not decline in any cohort following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, nor did the expression of exhaustion markers on spike-specific or total T cells increase. T cell production of multiple cytokines (i.e. polyfunctionality) in response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not decline in any cohort following repeated vaccination. None of the cohorts displayed elevated levels of terminally differentiated T cells following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Thus, repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased T cell exhaustion in older frail adults, immunosuppressed individuals, or healthy adults.

Here, the authors demonstrate that a molten NaNO3 shell enables selective oxygen permeation, suppressing hydrocarbon over-oxidation in chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. 
 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has the potential to reduce significantly the energy demand of propylene production. However, low propylene selectivity and the need for expensive air separation hamper its commercial implementation. In the herein presented chemical looping-based scheme for propylene production, gaseous oxygen is supplied in situ by a perovskite oxygen carrier (Sr1−xCaxFeO3−δ) while propane is dehydrogenated over a physically separated catalyst (VOx/SiO2), thus allowing for high systematic flexibility, as each component can be optimized individually. To prevent over-oxidation of propane to COx at the gas-oxygen carrier interface, a NaNO3-based surface modification is developed, which melts under operating conditions and wets the surface of the oxygen carrier, forming a non-porous diffusion barrier for gaseous hydrocarbons, thereby completely inhibiting over-oxidation. We demonstrate stable operation over 250 redox cycles at 500 °C (14.5% propane conversion at 68% propylene selectivity), matching the performance of the benchmark VOx/SiO2 with co-fed oxygen.

 Metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a tumor type with frequent lung metastases, we conduct an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identify HLF as a potent suppressor of lung metastasis. HLF depletion enhances ccRCC cell migration and lung metastasis, whereas HLF overexpression abrogates these effects. In ccRCC patients, HLF expression is reduced at metastatic sites and associates with epigenetic silencing mediated by the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1. HLF levels negatively correlate with migration potential in collagen. Mechanistically, HLF regulates LPXN expression, modulating the integration of collagen’s mechanical cues with the actin cytoskeleton through Paxillin, thereby suppressing cancer cell migration and lung metastasis. Overexpression of HLF or pharmacological inhibition of BRG1 reduces cell invasion across multiple cancer types. Our findings suggest that targeting the BRG1-HLF axis offers a promising therapeutic strategy for combating metastatic cancers.

This weakens its contribution to the HONO source and atmospheric oxidation capacity. 
 Heterogeneous reactions of NO2 on particulate matter have been considered an important source of HONO (Nitrous acid) in the troposphere, whereas its contribution is controversial due to the lack of uptake coefficient of NO2 (γNO2) on the surfaces of ambient particulate matter (PM). Here we investigate the the γNO2 to form HONO and its evolution based on long-term comprehensive field observations (2019–2023) in Beijing and a random forest model with Shapley additive explanations. The γNO2 on ambient PM is on the order of 10−6, decreasing markedly from 3.07 ± 5.99 × 10−6 in 2019 to 1.43 ± 3.22 × 10−6 in 2023. This decrease is driven by the increase in aerosol pH, linked to increased ratio of NH4NO3 to (NH4)2SO4, resulting from an unbalanced desulfurization and denitrification. This study implies that the role of the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on aerosol surfaces in HONO production is declining in Beijing, providing valuable insights into the atmospheric chemistry in urban environments.

 The exploitation of the strong light-matter coupling regime and exciton-polariton condensates has emerged as a compelling approach to introduce strong interactions and nonlinearities into numerous photonic applications. The use of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots with strong three-dimensional confinement as the active material in optical microcavities would be highly advantageous due to their versatile structural and compositional tunability and wet-chemical processability, as well as potentially enhanced, confinement-induced polaritonic interactions. Yet, to date, exciton-polariton condensation in a microcavity has neither been achieved with epitaxial nor with colloidal quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature polariton condensation in a thin film of monodisperse, colloidal CsPbBr3 quantum dots, placed in a tunable optical resonator with a Gaussian-shaped deformation serving as wavelength-scale potential well for polaritons. The onset of polariton condensation under pulsed optical excitation is manifested in emission by its characteristic superlinear intensity dependence, reduced linewidth, blueshift, and extended temporal coherence.

 The European Union (EU) has established an ambitious policy framework for demand-side mitigation in buildings towards net-zero targets.

We advocate for the implementation of a carbon tax, paired with substantial heat-pump subsidies and targeted incentives for home insulation by country and building.

A significant increase in future HER intensity and frequency appears in July, with the frequency increases about two times for SSP1-2.6 and about 3.7 times for SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The month of maximum HER frequency is also projected to shift from August to July.

 Nighttime light (NTL) imagery remotely sensed from outer space has been suggested to be a suitable proxy to investigate socioeconomic dynamics. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many studies have used NTL imagery to estimate the impacts of the pandemic. However, finer-grained analytics are rarely achieved limited by the spatial resolution of major NTL data sources. In November, 2021, the Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) was launched and one of its payloads, Glimmer Imager for Urbanization (GIU) can provide 10m/40 m panchromatic and multispectral NTL images for public use. In this study, we estimate the fine-grained NTL dynamics before and after the COVID-19 surge in the city of Shanghai during the second quarter of 2022 using SDGSAT-1 GIU nighttime imagery. To distinguish the different behaviors among urban functional entities, categorized Point of Interest (POI) data are adopted. The estimation is conducted in three progressive levels: city-level, POI-class-level, and POI-object-level. To characterize each urban objects from multiple angles, two additional NTL indices, NTL and luminous area ratio composite index (NTL-CI) and NTL background relative activeness index (NTL-AI) are introduced and estimated. On the basis of raw NTL, NTL-CI further considers the change of luminous area and NTL-AI further considers the relative change to the average standard. Moreover, detailed visual observations at typical POI objects are conducted, for instance, the Shanghai Disney Resort, the Shanghai Tesla Gigafactory, and multiple cabin hospitals temporarily converted from large stadiums and exhibition centers. This study aims to present a comprehensive investigation of the socioeconomic influence of COVID-19 in Shanghai from the perspective of NTL changes in multiple granularities, and the utility of SDGSAT-1 GIU nighttime imagery in supporting SDG 3 (The Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health and Well-Being) is also demonstrated with this set of quantitative analytics."

 Plant water use strategies play a crucial role in regulating soil moisture, mediating plant-climate feedbacks, and influencing species competition and symbiotic relationships. However, the lack of long-term and large-scale studies on plant water sources has significantly limited comprehensive estimations of the spatiotemporal variations in plant water sources and their impacts on ecohydrological processes. To address this challenge, this study compiled literature data from 210 study regions across China and applied a multivariate random forest model to generate a 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution map of plant water source distributions in China from 2001 to 2022. The model estimated the proportions of water uptake by plants from different soil depths and groundwater, and analyzed the variations in water sources across different vegetation types, as well as the key factors influencing plant water sources. The model results aligned well with existing experimental studies, demonstrating their reliability in capturing the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of plant water sources. Nationally, plants derived on average 34.64 ± 6.45 % of their water from shallow soil (0–30 cm), 24.60 ± 3.42 % from middle soil (30–60 cm), 32.68 ± 6.74 % from deep soil (>60 cm), and 8.08 ± 4.7 % from groundwater. Significant differences in plant water sources were observed between southern and semi-arid northern regions of China, with plants in the southern regions predominantly relying on shallow and middle depth soil water, while those in the northwestern regions showed a greater dependence on deep soil water and groundwater. The correlation between soil water content and precipitation with variations in plant water sources was found to be more pronounced. Specifically, shallow soil moisture content and precipitation were positively correlated with the proportion of water absorbed by plants from shallow soil, but negatively correlated with the proportion of water absorbed from deep soil. From 2001 to 2022, there was a nationwide trend of an increased proportion of plant water uptake from shallow and deep soil layers, while the proportion from middle and groundwater decreased. This study fills a critical gap in the large-scale integrated study of plant water sources in China, providing valuable data and methodological references for related scientific research. The results of this study also contribute to the understanding of the ability to enhance vegetation adaptation to environmental changes, provide important driving data for ecohydrological model simulations and important data to support a more accurate assessment of ecosystem adaptation and water resource changes in the context of current extreme climate change."

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a pivotal role in representing ground energy balance and understanding climate change. LST over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) significantly influences regional climate and environmental dynamics. Accurate LST data in the TP is vital for ecological monitoring and climate studies. However, most retrieval algorithms assume a flat-surface thermal infrared radiation transfer equation (TIRTE), which introduces inevitable topographic induced in the TP’s complex terrain. Additionally, the limited and sparse ground stations hinder pixel-level error analysis. These limitations restrict accurate characterization of topographic effects on LST errors and impede the effective application of current LST datasets. This study proposed a method to quantify the LST retrieval errors at a pixel level and innovatively introduced the radiation-topographic bias correction term (RTBC). The effectiveness of RTBC in reducing LST retrieval errors with only one atmospheric parameter was demonstrated theoretically. Random forest (RF) models were employed to assess the contribution of topographic effects to these errors. The sky view factor (SVF) was employed as an indicator of surface ruggedness. The results demonstrated that LST retrieval errors were predominantly due to topographic effect when surface ruggedness was high (SVF ≤ 0.25), with an R2 value reaching up to 0.86. RTBC emerged as the primary factor influencing LST retrieval errors at SVF ≤ 0.25. In-situ LST analysis showed that when SVF decreased to 0.738, RTBC effectively reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) and by an average of 1.2 K and 1.1 K, respectively. In comparison experiments with conventional methods, RTBC achieved approximately a 50 % reduction in RMSE. These findings highlight the significant impact of topography on LST retrieval accuracy and demonstrate the effectiveness of RTBC in reducing terrain-induced errors."

 High ozone (O3) pollution has been found to rebound in China after 2020. Given its adverse impacts on human health, air quality, and climate, it is imperative to identify the underlying causes of this deteriorating O3 pollution. Here, a case study was conducted in Wuhu, an O3-polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta region, during 2020–2023. A marked increase in O3 concentration was observed, which could be partly due to insufficient reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO+NO2) emissions. Machine learning models revealed that meteorological condition contributed 27.3 % ± 4.2 % to high O3 concentration and that relative humidity (RH) and temperature exerted interactive effects on O3 formation. Elevated temperature could enhance the negative relationship between RH and O3, while high RH could weaken the positive effects of temperature on O3 formation. Utilizing an observation-based box model, we determined that O3 formation in Wuhu was mainly controlled by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Alkenes, aromatics and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were identified as the primary precursors driving high O3 events. Notably, the relative incremental reactivities of OVOCs significantly increased during O3 pollution periods and became the largest contributor to O3 formation, highlighting their importance in forming high O3 concentration. Furthermore, O3 formation sensitivity changed dynamically with the evolution of O3 pollution, necessitating a phased-precursor-control strategy during periods of elevated O3 formation. This study underscores the crucial role of meteorological condition in driving high O3 events and provides a specific precursor control scheme to mitigate urban high O3 pollution."

 Measurements of absorption optical properties (σap,λ, AAE) and PM10 concentrations were conducted near the rice fields of L'Albufera Natural Park (Eastern Spain) with the aim of assessing light absorption by secondary BrC generated from the burning of rice straw residues. Sampling was performed in autumn 2023. The measurement period was divided into three sub-periods (P1, P2 and P3) depending on the number of burning spots and the prevailing weather conditions. P2 was the period most affected by biomass burning (BB) events. During this period, hourly values of σap,λ and AAE were above 100 Mm−1 and 2.0 and BrC absorption was higher than BC absorption in the UV spectral range. Secondary BrC concentrations were estimated using the EC-tracer method, and the R-squared (MRS) and 25 % percentile (P25) approaches were applied to the determination of (σap,λ/BC880)pri. Secondary BrC concentrations calculated by the P25 method were significantly higher than those obtained by the MRS approach for P2, which lead to σBrC-SEC values four times higher when the P25 method was used. The differences in the results obtained by both procedures were attributed to the formation of secondary BrC generated from the rapid oxidation of semi-volatile organic aerosols emitted by BB. The contribution of this secondary BrC to light absorption by BrC at 370 nm was 47 % for P2."

 Although the coupled climate models experienced significant improvement over the past few decades, they continue to suffer from common biases in the representations of tropical intraseasonal to synoptic variabilities interacting with organized tropical convection. This study presents a quantitative assessment of convectively coupled Kelvin waves (CCKWs) over the tropical ocean, as simulated by 20 coupled climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6). The standard deviation of filtered daily precipitation anomalies as well as the spatial–temporal spectrum are used to evaluate the performance of the amplitude of eastward propagating CCKWs. By comparing the observations from the Global Precipitation Climate Program, CMIP6 models are classified into good and poor categories. Good models can well simulate the spectral coverage and the spatial characteristics of CCKWs, while poor models underestimate the CCKWs’ activity. Good models generally illustrate the seasonal evolution of CCKWs, with non-negligible deviations during boreal early spring. In contrast, poor models failed to reproduce the seasonal migration between the Southern and Northern hemispheres of CCKWs. Moreover, both good and poor models exhibit remarkable biases in CCKW activity over the Maritime Continent and equatorial South America. The simulation bias of CCKWs is correlated to the strength of the background precipitation rate in association with the North Pacific intertropical convergence zone. Further analysis suggests that the CCKWs simulation skill is positively correlated to the convective precipitation fraction which is related to convective parameterization schemes."

However, studying these complex networks has been hindered by the challenge of detecting multiple neurochemicals in vivo simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-protein chemigenetic DA sensor, HaloDA1.0, which combines a cpHaloTag–chemical dye approach with the G protein–coupled receptor activation–based (GRAB) strategy, providing high sensitivity for DA, subsecond response kinetics, and a far-red to near-infrared spectral range. When used together with existing green and red fluorescent neuromodulator sensors, calcium indicators, cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate sensors, and optogenetic tools, HaloDA1.0 showed high versatility for multiplex imaging in cultured neurons, brain slices, and behaving animals, facilitating in-depth studies of dynamic neurochemical networks."
10.1126/science.adu2987,False,Science,这篇研究论文主要关注的是使用碲纳米线网络（TeNWNs）制造的视网膜下纳米假体，用于恢复盲症模型中的视觉功能。该纳米假体可以将可见光和近红外光转换为电信号，从而恢复瞳孔反射，并使动物能够在可见光和近红外光下进行视觉引导学习。此外，该研究还在非人类灵长类动物中验证了TeNWNs的生物相容性和可行性。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Shuiyuan Wang;Chengyong Jiang;Yiye Yu;Zhenhan Zhang;Ruge Quhe;Ruyi Yang;Yufei Tian;Xindong Chen;Wenqiang Fan;Yinge Niu;Biao Yan;Chunhui Jiang;Yang Wang;Zhen Wang;Chunsen Liu;Weida Hu;Jiayi Zhang;Peng Zhou,Tellurium nanowire retinal nanoprosthesis improves vision in models of blindness,"Present vision restoration technologies have substantial constraints that limit their application in the clinical setting. In this work, we fabricated a subretinal nanoprosthesis using tellurium nanowire networks (TeNWNs) that converts light of both the visible and near-infrared–II spectra into electrical signals. The broad-spectrum coverage is made possible by a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries. Implanted into blind mice, the TeNWNs restored pupillary reflexes and enabled visually cued learning under visible and near-infrared 1550-nanometer light. In nonhuman primates, TeNWNs elicited robust retina-derived neural responses, confirming biocompatibility and feasibility. By restoring lost photosensitivity and extending vision to near-infrared, this nanoprosthesis offers a promising approach for restoring vision."

To effectively manage carbon and nitrogen in China, we developed a comprehensive model for quantifying their fluxes, investigating their interplay across 16 human and natural subsystems. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrogen losses in China increased 2.3-fold and carbon emissions surged 6.5-fold. Integrated carbon and nitrogen management holds the potential for a 74% reduction in nitrogen losses to air and water and a 91% decrease in carbon emissions to the atmosphere by 2060. Compared with separate control of carbon or nitrogen, integrated management delivers an additional reduction of 1.8 million tons of nitrogen and 26.5 million tons of carbon by 2060, bringing out a 37% decrease in unit abatement cost and a net societal benefit of 1384 billion USD."

In this study, we demonstrate that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell–derived gastruloids enable in vitro modeling of the earliest stages of vascularization. We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids. Our results suggest that a conserved developmental program generates the vasculature within different types of organs."

We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity."

In this work, we report structures of imitation switch (ISWI) bound to the nucleosome during active ATP hydrolysis and remodeling, revealing conformational transitions of the remodeling motor across the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling."
