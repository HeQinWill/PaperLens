These improvements provide clearer insights into how stream water quality changes over time and how human activities affect aquatic ecosystems. 
 The QUADICA version 2 dataset significantly expands upon the first version of QUADICA (water QUAlity, DIscharge and Catchment Attributes for large-sample studies in Germany), by incorporating more recent data, additional water quality and driver variables, and more stations with concurrent water quantity data. Specifically, QUADICA v2 extends the water quality time series of the first version up to 2020 and introduces new variables, including water temperature, oxygen, and chlorophyll a concentrations, as well as concentrations of ammonium, sulfate, and geogenic solutes like calcium. These additions enable a more comprehensive understanding of ecological impacts, including eutrophication effects, and water quality dynamics across catchments. Furthermore, the number of stations with both water quality and quantity data has effectively doubled – now covering 637 out of the total 1386 stations – by integrating QUADICA with the CAMELS-DE and Caravan-DE datasets. The inclusion of time series on point and diffuse sources of both nitrogen and phosphorus allows for more thorough investigations of driver-response relationships and nutrient export from catchments. To facilitate visualization and exploration of QUADICA, we provide a user-friendly, interactive R application alongside the online data repository, as well as a browser-based web app for inspecting the dataset. This makes QUADICA v2 a comprehensive dataset that spans from driver to impact variables, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. QUADICA v2 is available at https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.c2866cd416b94ca386deb5758834311f (Ebeling et al., 2025)."

Observing first-hand snow metamorphism is key to improving the modelling of these transformations. In this work, we monitor snow microstructure evolution during metamorphism by X-ray tomography. We provide a data set at high spatial and temporal resolution of 3D images of snow microstructure evolving through a wide range of experimental conditions, along with videos showing these transformations. 
 Refined observations of the temporal evolution of snow microstructure are crucial for improving the understanding and modeling of snow metamorphism. X-ray tomography has opened new possibilities for observing the microstructure of dry snow by enabling 3D imaging of the ice and air arrangement with micrometric resolution. The development of cells that control the thermal boundary conditions of a snow sample during scanning has made in-situ monitoring of microstructural changes during metamorphism possible. However, such data sets remain scarce and are often limited in terms of the snow evolution conditions explored. In this work, we use highly resolved X-ray tomography to characterize the temporal evolution of dry snow microstructure under a wide range of thermal boundary conditions. We designed a snow-metamorphism cell to continuously control the temperature at the boundaries of a centimeter-sized snow sample directly inside the tomograph. Using this setup, we conducted a total of 20 snow metamorphism experiments, covering mean snow temperatures from -3 to -17 °C, snow temperature gradients from 0 to 100 K m⁻¹, and five initial snow samples with varying snow types, densities, and specific surface areas. Each experiment lasted 7 days, during which tomographic measurements were performed every 4 hours at a spatial resolution of 8.5 µm. We provide a unique set of 4D data in .zarr format, consisting of time series of binary 3D images of snow undergoing the aforementioned experiments. These images are particularly well-suited for investigating local processes, such as the interface growth velocity, as well as for computing various physical properties of snow. In addition, videos showing the temporal evolution of the snow microstructure for the 20 experiments are provided."

The Safe and Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) framework, developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), offers a comprehensive approach with which to evaluate the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials across their lifecycle. While SSbD uses various modeling approaches to assess impacts on human health, the environment, and socioeconomic factors, these are often applied independently, hindering a holistic understanding of the complex interactions between these factors and thus the simultaneous optimization of function, cost, safety and sustainability. This review describes existing predictive models and available strategies for their integration to facilitate more comprehensive and holistic chemical and material impact assessments. Specifically, we examine three model integration strategies: consensus integration that combines model predictions for the same impact categories, weighted aggregation that combines different scores in a unified one, and pipeline integration that links models sequentially to create a more unified assessment. Furthermore, we address key concepts related to the uncertainty of model predictions and the applicability domain of models, highlighting how these evolve in integrated frameworks. Insights into the applications of these integration strategies and challenges will allow a more accurate, coherent, and sustainable approach to chemical and material safety and sustainability assessments."

This four-year microcosm study aimed to unravel the mechanisms of relatively long-term OM transformation and stabilization subject to microbial processing in the OM amended Fe-ore tailings. The method of isotopic tracing (13C-glucose and 13C/15N-labeled spring wheat biomass) and a high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) were employed to characterize molecular composition of OM and organo-microbial-mineral interactions in the resultant tailings technosol at the submicron scale. It was revealed that both soluble (i.e., glucose) and solid (plant biomass) OM used to amend tailings for soil formation generated a diverse range of molecules, including protein-, lipid-, and lignin-like compounds. These organics were predominantly stabilized by Fe- and Al-rich minerals heterogeneously. Meanwhile, microbial 14N2 fixation was observed in tailings primed with 13C-glucose, resulting in microbial OM enriched with 13C and 14N. A dynamic OM turnover in the tailings amended with 13C/15N-labeled spring wheat biomass was observed, which was characterized by the decrease of exogenous 13C/15N and the emergence of organic compounds containing atmospheric sources of 12C/14N. These microbial and mineral-mediated OM formation and stabilization processes indicate the emergence of developing soil ecological resilience, indicated by in situ microorganism-driven C/N biogeochemistry in the initially OM-amended tailings."

However, the extent to which this association persists in the elderly population, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved, remains insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate associations between PFASs exposure and glycometabolic markers in the healthy elderly using integrated multiomics approach, elucidating underlying biological mechanisms. A panel study was conducted among 76 healthy elderly aged 60–69 years living in Jinan City, China, with five consecutive monthly surveys. Blood concentrations of nine PFASs and five glycometabolic markers were measured. Associations between both individual and combined exposures to PFASs and glycometabolic markers were investigated through a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Integrated multiomics analysis delineated mechanisms by which PFASs exposure disrupts glycometabolism. We observed that a single exposure to perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) was significantly associated with increases in all five glycometabolic markers. Exposure to perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) was associated with increases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated serum protein (GSP), while PFHxS was additionally associated with the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG). Furthermore, the BKMR model further indicated a synergistic and positive association between PFAS mixtures and these markers. Multiomics analyses identified 48 canonical pathways potentially mediating these metabolic disruptions. These findings highlight the need to prioritize reduction of PFASs exposure as a public health strategy for preventing and managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), particularly in aging populations worldwide."

Feng,Life Cycle Perspective-Based Modeling Assessment of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement,"The removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is proposed and discussed to mitigate climate change. We modeled the life cycles of four types of OAE technologies (ocean liming, accelerated weathering of limestone, mineral carbonation–ocean liming, and coastal enhanced weathering) in an Earth system model and investigated their environmental impacts. When the OAE is simulated to operate from the year 2030 to 2099 in 12 different coastal areas, the carbon emissions generated from the OAE’s mining, processing, transportation, and dumping can significantly offset their carbon sequestration effects, causing specific OAE technologies unable to reduce atmospheric CO2. Among all four OAE technologies, coastal enhanced weathering exhibits the best overall carbon removal effectiveness, while the North Atlantic has the highest potential to store OAE-captured CO2. All OAE runs have an OAE-induced oceanic carbon leakage into the atmosphere, especially when clean energy is utilized to power the OAE activities, highlighting the necessity to consider the carbon removal additionality, permanency, and leakage performance for robust modeling assessment."

Although the marine environment contains multiple pollutants, OA can alter the environmental behavior of MPs, influencing their toxicity and environmental fate. Therefore, investigating the interactive effects of OA and MPs is essential. Fish can activate physiological compensatory mechanisms to adapt to OA; however, it remains unclear how MPs affect these mechanisms. In this study, marine medaka were exposed to acidified seawater (pH 7.70) containing environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs (0.1 mg/L) for 90 days to investigate the disruptive effects of MPs on responses to OA. The results showed that while OA triggered compensatory energy metabolism reprogramming to enhance ammonia production, MPs disrupted this process, reducing the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. This α-ketoglutarate deficiency limited the glutamate supply for ammonia production. Simultaneous inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase activity further limited glutamate availability. As a result, MPs reduced the level of ammonia production by 25.29%, compromising the ability to neutralize excess H+. Crucially, photoaging exacerbated this toxicity, leading to a 32.04% reduction in ammonia production. This study demonstrates that MPs interfere with fish responses to OA via α-ketoglutarate-mediated metabolic reprogramming, highlighting a vulnerability in marine organisms facing climate change scenarios."

Guest,Co-Location of Cellulosic Bioethanol and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) Production Facilities for Targeted Scale-Up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production,"Achieving aerospace industry net-zero emissions by 2050 requires rapid scaling of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Leveraging existing infrastructure, proven technologies like Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and low carbon intensity (CI) feedstocks (e.g., switchgrass and miscanthus) can support this transition and help achieve near-term emissions reduction targets. This study evaluates the implications of lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery siting and integration with petroleum refineries to produce SAF across 1000 sites randomly sampled from areas suitable for perennial grasses in the U.S. rainfed region. To better understand the logistics of material transport and handoffs, we integrated models of biomass harvest, transport, ethanol, and ATJ production in a stochastic framework based on Monte Carlo simulations to characterize SAF minimum selling price (MSP) and carbon intensity (CI), considering site-specific parameters (e.g., feedstock production, transportation, taxes, incentives). The results indicate trade-offs between MSP and CI across locations, with median MSP ranging from 7.9 to 12.8 USD·gal–1 and CI from −9.7 to 39.4 gCO2e·MJ–1. Despite high estimated decarbonization costs (580 USD·tonCO2e–1), our results indicate that site-specific deployment of ATJ with low-CI feedstocks can improve sustainability outcomes. The framework provides a systematic approach to assess cost and sustainability trade-offs across locations, considering the end-to-end supply chain and supporting an informed investment in SAF production."

Its metabolite, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP), plays a critical role in mediating TDCPP-induced toxicities and may exacerbate aging-related processes. In this study, we quantitatively compared the bioconcentration and toxicity of TDCPP and BDCPP in Caenorhabditis elegans. BDCPP exhibited higher environmental persistence and bioaccumulation potential than TDCPP. Exposure to 0.1–1000 μg/L TDCPP and BDCPP increased Oil red O staining (7.88%–55.44%, 6.42%–33.92%), lipofuscin levels (5.44%–35.98%, 3.54%–28.66%), and reduced the mean lifespan (3.09%–10.31%, 1.84%–8.74%). Overall, TDCPP caused greater triglyceride (TG) accumulation, lipofuscin formation, and lifespan reduction compared to BDCPP. TDCPP reduced brood size by 5.30%–18.95%, while BDCPP exposure increased brood size by up to 13.90%. Mechanism investigations revealed that TDCPP and BDCPP induce aging through distinct pathways. The adverse outcome pathways revealed that BDCPP disrupted germline stem cells (GSCs) apoptosis, transmitting reproductive signals through the kri-1-daf-16-lipl-4 signaling cascade, impairing TG hydrolysis and lifespan, while TDCPP acted through a GSC-independent route. These findings underscore the central role of GSCs in BDCPP-induced aging, enhance our understanding of BDCPP as a secondary pollutant, and provide critical data for assessing the ecological and health risks of chlorinated organophosphate esters."

However, the molecular action of HAT in the reaction of nitrate-to-ammonia conversion remains poorly understood, particularly given the complexity of 8-electron transfer process and the kinetics of different hydrogen species (e.g., adsorbed Hads and free •H radical). Herein, we develop a trace ruthenium anchored self-supported heterostructure (Ru-Ni2P/NF), in which Ni2P accelerates water dissociation to generate hydrogen intermediates and Ru optimizes Hads stabilization. Experimental results indicate 97.5% nitrate conversion with 86.4% NH3 selectivity within 4 h. Furthermore, H-species kinetic analysis and H/D isotopic labeling demonstrate a difference in Hads and •H functionalities; Hads dominates nitrite reduction with a 14.6-fold higher rate constant than •H-mediated pathways. DFT calculations identify Ru-induced symmetry breaking in nitrate (N–O bond elongation: 0.039 Å) as the critical activation step, and a complete deoxygenation–hydrogenation mechanism (*NO3– → *N → *NHx intermediates) is validated by in situ FTIR and Gibbs free energy profiles. Notably, the reduction of nitrite by Ru-Hads is thermodynamically favored without additional potential, which is consistent with the high rate of Hads reduction of nitrite to ammonia in the experiment. This study generates valuable insights into HAT-mediated nitrate conversion at a molecular level, providing a blueprint for catalytic systems in environmental remediation and green ammonia synthesis."

This study employed mitochondrial metabolomics integrated with phenotypic assays to investigate the subcellular mechanisms of SCCP-induced energy metabolism inhibition. Exposure to SCCPs (0–100 μg/L) caused profound downregulation of ATP. Seahorse respirometry analyses revealed the dose-dependent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and compensatory upregulation of glycolysis. Mitochondrial ultrastructural damage (swelling and cristae loss) and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential confirmed mitochondria as the primary targets of SCCPs. Mitochondrial metabolomics demonstrated that the suppression of the TCA cycle (depleted citrate, oxaloacetate) and OXPHOS (reduced NAD+, ATP/ADP; inhibited Complex V activity) is responsible for the downregulation of ATP. The conversion from phosphatidylcholines to lysophosphatidylcholines further verified mitochondrial membrane damage. Perturbations in nucleotide metabolism reflected impaired synthesis pathways for DNA/RNA. Critically, medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs), proposed as SCCP substitutes, induced qualitatively similar mitochondrial damage (respiration inhibition, cristae disruption, and ΔΨm loss), challenging the presumed safety of MCCPs as alternatives. This study revealed the key mechanisms of SCCP induced energy metabolism inhibition at the subcellular level, underscoring the need for careful reconsideration of MCCP usage."

ED is uniquely suited for ion separation and recovery from high-salinity waters, especially for ions of low concentrations, as ions, instead of water, are transported in an electrical field. However, the application of ED is limited by the lack of selectivity of the counterions in the existing IEMs. Here, we developed a thin-film composite cation exchange membrane (TFC-CEM) consisting of an ultrathin polyamide coating, a porous polysulfone support, and a dense cation exchange polymer layer, which provides excellent separation between divalent and monovalent cations, high mechanical strength, and effective separation between cations and anions. At a constant current of 0.24 mA cm–2, the TFC-CEM demonstrated monovalent over divalent cation selectivity of 49.32–136.79 in mixed cation solutions with a divalent to monovalent cation molar ratio of 25. The selectivity increased with increasing divalent to monovalent cation concentration ratios and correlated strongly with the difference in the hydrated size of the cations. Furthermore, the asymmetric structure of the TFC-CEM led to unique limiting current density behaviors, revealing that ion transport through the polyamide coating was rate-limiting. Finally, TFC-CEM demonstrated great potential for lithium extraction from hypersaline brines."

This study used a mouse model with gut dysbiosis induced by cefoperazone to explore As bioaccumulation, transformation, and excretion. By integrating absolute quantification methods, this study monitored the responses of gut microbiota, As biotransformation genes (ABGs), and gut metabolites in mice exposed to 1 and 10 mg/L As. Arsenic accumulation in the liver, spleen, heart, ileum, and blood was markedly decreased in gut dysbiosis mice exposed to 10 mg/L As. These mice also exhibited lower proportions of DMA(V) and As(V) in the liver compared with normal mice. A total of 17 ABGs were detected in the mouse gut, with a significant reduction in their absolute abundance in gut dysbiosis mice (e.g., arsC, arsH, and arsB genes). Consistently, gut dysbiosis mice had lower bacterial loads, particularly for Alloprevotella and Bacteroides, accompanied by the upregulation of “amino acids” and “fatty acid esters.” Association analysis predicted several specific bacteria carrying ABGs, exemplified by Bacteroides carrying the arsC gene.

However, their effects on wild, free-living organisms remain unexplored. Using red blood cells, we investigated how foraging habits, inferred from stable isotopes, and contaminant exposure were associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics in breeding Scopoli’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea), a top marine predator in the Mediterranean Sea. We found higher concentrations of Hg, but not of total PFAS, in older individuals and in males compared to females. Our results also indicate dietary pollutant exposure: Hg, but not total PFAS, was higher in birds with a higher trophic position and in those foraging closer to shores. Additionally, higher Hg concentration was linked to higher mitochondrial proton leakage (LEAK), reflecting reduced efficiency to couple oxygen consumption to energy production. In contrast, specific PFAS were negatively associated with LEAK, suggesting a potential impairment in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential through proton conductance, a key mechanism protecting cells from oxidative stress. Our study highlights how foraging ecology shapes pollutant exposure and its consequences for mitochondria bioenergetics in an apex predator of conservation interest."

Emerging evidence showed that nanoplastics can cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. However, the effects of nanoplastics on neuronal health and functions in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of nanoplastic exposure on neurotransmitter release by measuring FM 4-64 (a lipophilic styryl dye) release from synaptic vesicles during electrical stimulation after exposing rat hippocampal neurons to 1–10 μg/mL of fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics with an average diameter of 42 nm. We found that nanoplastics accumulated in the presynaptic terminal of hippocampal neurons and reduced stimulation-induced FM 4-64 release in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, nanoplastics decreased Ca2+ elevation in the presynaptic terminal of hippocampal neurons during electrical stimulation. Our results suggest that accumulated nanoplastics in the brain can impair neuronal functions by disrupting neurotransmitter release and Ca2+ dynamics in the presynaptic terminal of neurons, which could eventually lead to neurodegeneration."

However, the effects of GenX on male reproductive development remain incompletely understood. In this study, pregnant mice were administered GenX (2 mg/kg bw/d) via gavage and/or inulin (1% w/v) in the drinking water until lactation concluded. At the 16th week after birth, male littermates were necropsied. Early-life exposure to GenX in mice led to gut microbiota imbalance, colonic tissue alterations, reduced expression of goblet cells and tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin 5), and triggered an inflammatory response. Moreover, increased serum LPS levels, histopathological alterations in testicular tissue, reduced testosterone levels, and decreased expression of blood–testis barrier proteins (ZO-1, occludin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin) were resulted from early-life exposure to GenX. Additionally, there was an upregulation of inflammatory factors TNF-a and IL-1β, along with a higher incidence of sperm abnormalities. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an enrichment of necroptosis in the testes of the GenX group. Consistently, overexpression of RIPK1, RIPK3, TLR4, and p-ERK, and decreased expression of caspase-8 confirmed the participation of necroptosis in GenX-induced testicular injury. As a potent prebiotic, inulin balanced intestinal homeostasis and attenuated GenX-induced testicular injury by modulating LPS-TLR4-mediated necroptosis. This study offers new insights into the impact of early-life GenX exposure on male reproductive risk and evaluates the potential of inulin as a dietary modification strategy."

However, its impact on endometrial function during early pregnancy remains poorly understood. This study investigates the effects and mechanisms of MC-LR exposure during the peri-implantation period on endometrial receptivity. Pregnant mice were administered with MC-LR at a biologically relevant dose (1/2 NOAEL, 20 μg/kg/day) from gestational days 3.5 to 5.5. MC-LR exposure impaired uterine morphology, reduced serum progesterone, and suppressed expression of key receptivity markers, resulting in decreased implantation sites. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of the extracellular region, immune response, and hormone activity, with STAT3 signaling identified as a key regulator. MC-LR also disrupted uterine immune homeostasis, causing macrophage dysfunction and reduced IL-6 levels. The IL-6-dependent STAT3/HIF-1α signaling pathway was inhibited by MC-LR but reactivated by Garcinone D. Pharmacological activation of STAT3 prevented MC-LR-induced impairments, including cytokine dysregulation, extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis inhibition, reduced gland numbers, and decreased implantation capacity, though serum progesterone levels remained unaffected. These findings suggest that MC-LR disrupts endometrial receptivity via STAT3/HIF-1α signaling, independent of progesterone restoration, providing novel insights into microcystin-induced reproductive toxicity and a potential therapeutic target for implantation failure."

A previous study revealed that 20 μg/mL COE exposure for 120 days could induce malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The epigenetic regulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Changes in lncRNA expression during COE-induced malignant transformation were detected, highlighting the importance of gene–environment interactions in cancer. Here, we identified that SFTA1P was downregulated in COE-induced malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells. Interestingly, this reduction was found to have a gradient effect on different stages of cells of COE exposure. Moreover, we found that downregulation of SFTA1P expression in lung cancer was related to patients’ poor prognosis. Phenotypic studies have demonstrated that SFTA1P suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies revealed that SFTA1P directly interacts with ACSS2, an important enzyme responsible for synthesizing acetyl-CoA, leading to abnormal acetyl-CoA metabolism and affecting COE-induced lung carcinogenesis. COE-induced malignant transformed cells or cells with the knockdown of SFTA1P showed significantly increased fatty acid and cholesterol levels, while normal lung epithelial cells or cells with overexpression of SFTA1P showed substantially decreased fatty acid and cholesterol levels. Moreover, transfection of ACSS2 into cells with overexpressing SFTA1P could rescue the SFTA1P-induced cell phenotype. Our findings link SFTA1P-regulated acetyl-CoA metabolism with COE-induced malignant transformation and imply that SFTA1P could be an important biomarker for early intervention and diagnosis of lung cancer."

Nevertheless, the neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal low-level lead exposure remain inadequately characterized, with limited understanding of its mechanistic underpinnings and a lack of robust biomarkers for susceptibility. In this birth cohort study, we quantified the concentrations of 27 metals along with DNA methylation levels at 12 gene regions in cord blood. Neurodevelopment was assessed longitudinally in infancy using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). Associations between metal exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated via three complementary statistical approaches: mixed-effect models, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian kernel machine regression. Among all metals examined, only lead (mean concentration of 15.3 μg/L) exhibited consistent and statistically significant negative associations with neurodevelopmental performance. A linear dose–response relationship was observed between lead levels and deficits in problem-solving, fine motor, and gross motor skills. Furthermore, we identified four CpG sites within FAM50B and PTCHD3 that mediate the effects of lead exposure and demonstrated strong predictive capacity for neurodevelopmental outcomes using a random forest model. Our results provide novel evidence that even low-level prenatal lead exposure adversely affects early neurodevelopment and implicate FAM50B/PTCHD3 methylation as both a promising biomarker of lead-related neurodevelopmental risk and a potential target for therapeutic intervention."

However, the associations between specific chemical constituents of PM2.5 and the dynamic progression of hypertensive CVD remain unclear. Using multistate models and mediation analyses in a cohort of 316,087 individuals, we investigated the associations between PM2.5, PM2.5 chemical components (sulfate [SO42–], nitrate [NO3–], ammonium [NH4+], organic matter [OM], and black carbon [BC]), and the dynamic progression from different blood pressure states to incident CVD and mortality. Our findings revealed that PM2.5 and its constituents were positively associated with the dynamic HTN progression. For example, with each interquartile range (IQR) increase, PM2.5, SO42–, NO3–, NH4+, OM, and BC were significantly associated with the disease transition from prehypertension (pre-HTN) to HTN, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.116 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.104–1.128), 1.186 (95% CI: 1.171–1.202), 1.179 (95% CI: 1.166–1.193), 1.171 (95% CI: 1.159–1.184), 1.155 (95% CI: 1.141–1.169), and 1.147 (95% CI: 1.133–1.161), respectively. Mediation analysis demonstrated that pre-HTN and HTN significantly mediated the relationships between PM2.5, PM2.5 components, and the increased risk of CVD and cardiovascular mortality. This study provides evidence that ambient PM2.5 and its chemical constituents may be important determinants in the dynamic progression of HTN. Controlling exposure to PM2.5 and its components, particularly during the pre-HTN phase, could be an effective strategy to curb the development of hypertensive CVD and alleviate its public health impact."

However, there is limited evidence regarding how prenatal metal exposome influences newborn metabolic programming. This prospective cohort in 2022–2023 analyzed 432 mother–neonate pairs with complete biospecimens and birth records. We measured maternal urinary concentrations of 18 metals across first and third trimesters as well as neonatal metabolic biomarkers including 12 amino acids, 26 carnitines, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (OHP), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Multivariable regression, quantile g-computation, and machine learning methods were integrated to evaluate both individual and joint metal effects, with metabolic network and pathway enrichment analyses. Nine neonatal metabolites (tyrosine, glycine, leucine, free carnitine, C3, C5, C5:1, G6PD, and OHP) showed consistent trimester-specific associations with the metal mixtures. Arginine biosynthesis was the primary metal-responsive pathway. First-trimester exposure to zinc, selenium, tin, and chromium inversely correlated with gestational age at birth (β = −0.22 to −0.07; P < 0.05), while zinc and selenium inversely linked to birth weight (β = −83.48 to −51.67; P < 0.05). Mediation analysis revealed G6PD mediated 17.2% (95% CI, 0.11%; 168.00%) of Zn-gestational age association.

Serum concentrations of 19 PFAS were measured, and pubertal development was assessed using several pubertal markers, including ultrasound-assessed breast development, Tanner staging, pubertal hormone levels, and age at menarche. We applied quantile g-computation, elastic net, and Bayesian regression to evaluate both combined and individual effects of PFAS exposure, in addition to single-pollutant analyses. Higher PFAS concentrations were significantly associated with later thelarche, pubarche, lower serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estrone, and estradiol, and later menarche. Among the PFAS analyzed, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) emerged as the key predictors of later pubertal markers.

Given that renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a central pathological feature of progressive kidney diseases, we investigated AhR-induced profibrotic events at the molecular and cellular levels in human renal tubular epithelial cells (HKC). We found that the AhR activation by the potent agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) promoted epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory responses. This was evidenced by a 56.19% decrease in E-cadherin; 1.87-, 2.39-, and 8.27-fold increases in fibronectin, MMP9, and IL-6, respectively; and a 37.77% enhancement in cell migration. Transcriptome analysis and experimental validations confirmed the consistent dysregulation of these markers. Moreover, we found the profibrotic effects of the known nephrotoxic phytochemical aristolactam I (AL-I) also involving activation of AhR and consistent regulation of the above marker genes, primarily via the AhR. In addition, the transcriptome data further suggested that AhR activation may indirectly induce the profibrotic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway by upregulating AREG, EREG, and TGF-α, indicating crosstalk between AhR and EGFR. Given the wide variety of AhR-active chemicals, these AhR-EMT/inflammation-related markers could be used to screen nephrotoxicity of emerging dioxin-like pollutants and toxic phytochemicals."

Previous epidemiological studies have established associations between TCAA exposure and elevated risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet its impacts on pregnancy maintenance remain poorly understood.

Mechanistically, TCAA inhibited the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) interaction, which drove placental iron dyshomeostasis marked by an expanded labile iron pool (LIP) and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) overaccumulation. The iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) significantly alleviated TCAA-induced pregnancy loss by restoring iron metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing trophoblast invasion. Taken together, our findings provided critical insights into the reproductive toxicity of TCAA and underscored the potential of targeting iron homeostasis as a therapeutic strategy."

However, its increasing utilization has raised concerns about environmental contamination and potential health risks, underscoring the need for comprehensive toxicological assessments. In this study, we evaluated the tissue distribution and toxicological effects of NMC in adult male C57BL/6J mice following 28-day intratracheal instillation at doses of 32.5, 162.5, and 325 μg/kg/day. Our findings demonstrated that lithium primarily accumulated in the heart, while nickel also showed high accumulation ability in the heart, followed by the liver and epididymis. Cobalt accumulated predominantly in the spleen, kidneys, and epididymis, whereas manganese was mainly concentrated in the epididymis. Notably, exposure to high doses of NMC resulted in a reduction in body weight, elevated levels of systemic inflammation biomarkers, and significant histopathological changes. These histopathological alterations included alveolar fusion and structural damage in the lungs, loss of distinction between red and white pulp in the spleen, renal tubular dilation, and a decrease in spermatogenic cells in the testes and epididymis. Furthermore, NMC exposure disrupted the homeostasis of trace metals (copper, vanadium, molybdenum, strontium, selenium, and stannum) in mice, suggesting their potential roles in NMC-induced toxicity.

While the “One Health” framework emphasizes the need to monitor antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across diverse environments worldwide, the risks posed by ARGs in lakes affected by human activities, particularly in lake sediments that serve as natural reservoirs of ARGs, remain poorly understood. Metagenomics enables culture-independent analysis of microbial communities and resistance genes, providing essential insights into ARG dynamics. This study investigates microbial communities, ARGs, metal resistance genes (MRGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in sediments from Lake Donghu and Lake Weishan in China, two contrasting lake ecosystems subject to urbanization and agricultural activities for over four decades, using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing and assembly. ARGs and MRGs were more strongly influenced by deterministic environmental factors, particularly heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu), whereas microbial community structures were predominantly shaped by stochastic processes. Metagenomic binning yielded 293 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 125 of which were identified as potential ARG hosts, with Proteobacteria and Desulfobacterota being the most common. These hosts frequently cocarried MGEs, virulence factor genes (VFGs), and MRGs and exhibited metabolic pathways linked to carbon, nitrogen, and greenhouse gas (CO2 and N2O) cycling. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was determined as a key factor influencing microbial metabolism and promoting resistance gene dissemination.

Here, we established a dietary exposure mouse model using micro and nanoplastics (MNPs) and found that MNPs caused a decrease in thyroid function in adolescent mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to reconstruct the intestinal microbiota of mice to reveal the mechanisms of thyroid dysfunction. The abundance of Bacteroides in the intestinal tract significantly changed after FMT. PP-MPs and NPs affected the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, respectively, which competitively bound to thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) on the thyroid gland, thus affecting the thyroid function. PET-MNPs affected the level of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol sulfate, which regulated the activity of sympathetic nervous system by acting on the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor and TSHR in mice, thereby interfering with the regulatory function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis on the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones.

This 5-month longitudinal panel study, conducted among 76 healthy participants aged 60–69 in Jinan, China. Urinary concentrations of six PAHs were measured, and biological age was estimated using the Klemera and Doubal method. The associations between individual and combined PAH exposures and cognitive function were examined using linear mixed-effects model, and the mediating effect of biological aging was assessed by mediation model. Additionally, lipidomic profiling including lipidome clustering and individual lipids helped identify key biomolecular mediators. The results showed that exposure to four PAHs was significantly associated with cognitive decline, with combined exposure analysis further indicated the detrimental effects of PAH mixtures. And biological aging partially mediated the association between 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-NAP) and cognitive function. Key lipid levels, particularly phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs)-dominated clustering pattern, emerged as pivotal molecular mediator shaping this relationship. Additionally, more lipid species, notably phosphatidylcholines (PCs), mediated PAHs-induced cognitive decline in females. These findings elucidate lipid levels as a key mechanism linking biological aging and PAHs-induced cognitive decline, with specific lipid alterations partially explaining the increased vulnerability of females to cognitive decline."

However, there are no population-based cohort studies on the effects of parental antibiotic exposure on early IVF outcomes. A total of 33 antibiotics and 1 metabolite with detection rates over 10% in both female and male partners were included. Couples’ early IVF reproductive outcomes included the blastocyst numbers, best-quality embryo numbers, embryo numbers, best-quality embryo rates, two pronuclei (2PN) rates, and blastocyst rates. We applied the adaptive elastic net (AENET) with 10-fold cross-validation to identify antibiotics associated with early IVF outcomes in couples. According to the antibiotics identified by AENET, quantile-based g-computation (QGC) models, group-weighted quantile sum (GWQS) regression, and partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithms were used to evaluate the joint associations of parental antibiotic mixtures with early IVF reproductive outcomes. The independent associations between antibiotics identified by AENET, antibiotic classes, and early IVF reproductive outcomes in couples were evaluated using the multivariate generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with random intercepts. In this couple-based prospective cohort study, 739 couples with 947 fresh cycles were included between December 2020 and August 2023. The mean age (SD) was 34.08 (5.48) years for male partners and 33.09 (5.22) years for female partners. In couple-based analyses, sulfaclozine, roxithromycin, sulfamonomethoxine, erythromycin, and penicillin V were positively related to several early IVF reproductive outcomes, while sulfamethoxazole, penicillin G, chlorotetracycline, norfloxacin, florfenicol amine (FFA), sulfadiazine, cyadox, and sulfachloropyridazine were negatively related to early IVF outcomes. Among antibiotic classes, human antibiotics (HAs), β-lactams, chloramphenicols, and quinoxalines had positive effects on early IVF outcomes, while sulfonamides, preferred as veterinary antibiotics (PVAs), and lincosamides had inverse effects on early IVF outcomes. Similar results were also observed in male partners and female partners.

However, its toxicological effects, particularly regarding gastrointestinal disease progression, remain largely unexplored. In this study, animal experiments first demonstrated that TBC aggravates colonic inflammation in a mouse model of microplastic-induced colitis. Computational toxicology analysis further predicted TBC to possess potential carcinogenic properties, suggesting its role in promoting colitis-associated carcinogenesis. Using integrated bioinformatics approaches, we combined network toxicology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify the putative toxicological targets and molecular pathways involved in TBC-induced inflammation-to-cancer transition. A total of 299 TBC-related targets were identified from multilevel databases, and 13 core targets were highlighted through STRING and Cytoscape analyses, including AKT2, MAPK1, MAPK3, HSP90AA1, PIK3CD, BCL2, PIK3R1, PIK3CB, ESR1, CASP3, KRAS, and ERBB2. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that TBC may drive carcinogenic progression via pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations validated the stable interactions between TBC and key targets. To further confirm TBC’s role in colitis-associated tumorigenesis, we employed an AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer mouse model and found that TBC significantly exacerbated both intestinal inflammation and tumor formation. Transcriptomic analysis further validated the enrichment of ROS-mediated chemical carcinogenesis pathways and revealed that intestinal barrier disruption may also be a critical contributor to TBC-mediated cancer progression. Collectively, this study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which TBC aggravates inflammation-associated colorectal cancer, and offers a framework for risk assessment and regulatory strategies addressing plasticizer exposure in digestive health."

Increasing evidence suggests that Mn impairs endogenous neurogenesis and hinders neural repair. This study aims to investigate the effects of both acute and long-term Mn exposure on neurogenesis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. By establishing acute (7 and 14 days) and long-term (2 and 4 months) Mn exposure mouse models, we assessed neurogenesis under different exposure conditions. The mRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and metagenomics were employed to uncover the molecular pathways involved in Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment. The results revealed that early stage Mn exposure, including acute and 2 months exposure, transiently promoted neurogenesis. However, prolonged Mn accumulation in the brain led to suppressed neurogenesis, accompanied by neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which contributed to a vicious cycle of neural damage. Multiomics analyses identified dysregulation of the tryptophan metabolic pathway as a key mechanism, with a marked reduction in melatonin levels following Mn exposure. Notably, exogenous melatonin supplementation effectively rescued Mn-induced impairments in neurogenesis, neuronal integrity, and neuroinflammation. These findings provide new insights into Mn neurotoxicity and highlight melatonin as a potential therapeutic agent for Mn-related neural damage."

Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies suggests that GLY and its commercial formulations, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), disrupt normal endocrine function, adversely affecting reproduction. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on GLY/GBHs-induced female reproductive toxicity, elucidating mechanisms across molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and individual/population levels. Using the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework, we identify three key molecular initiating events (MIEs): (1) activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα), (2) inhibition of aromatase activity, and (3) disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes. These MIEs trigger key events (KEs) such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications, leading to cell death. At the tissue/organ level, these changes cause hormonal homeostasis imbalance, impaired oocyte maturation, ovulatory dysfunction, ovarian reserve depletion, and abnormal endometrial hyperplasia, culminating in clinical conditions such as premature ovarian insufficiency and endometrial cancer. By constructing an AOP network, this review establishes causal relationships across biological levels, providing a theoretical basis for health risk assessment and environmental management of GLY. The AOP framework enhances our understanding of GLY-induced female reproductive toxicity and identifies potential biomarkers and intervention targets, offering critical insights for regulatory decision-making and public health protection."

While growing evidence links changes in blood pressure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metal(loid) exposure, knowledge gaps persist in understanding the molecular mechanisms and developing operational screening tools. We aim to investigate the effects of VOC and metal(loid) coexposure on the blood pressure of children in EA, uncover metabolic mechanisms via urinary metabolomics, and develop a machine learning algorithm-driven predictive model for identifying children with potential hypertension risks. We measured systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, urinary VOC metabolites (mVOCs), metal(loid)s, and metabolomic profiles in EA children (n = 426). Results showed that the hypertension prevalence in our study population (12.7%) significantly exceeded the nationally representative estimate of 3.11%. Elevated levels of urinary 4 mVOCs and 5 metal(loid)s were associated with increased SBP or DBP (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis identified the positive association between mVOC-dominated mixture and SBP and DBP, where 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA) contributed most substantially (p < 0.05). Urinary metabolomics revealed N-phenylacetyl-l-glutamine (PAGln) and pyroglutamic acid as pivotal mediators linking VOC and metal(loid) exposure to childhood blood pressure elevation, suggesting gut microbiota metabolism and γ-glutamyl cycling may play important roles in pollutant-associated hypertension. Notably, our predictive model achieved 83% accuracy in differentiating children with a potential hypertension risk, with androstane glucuronide (steroid metabolism) and PAGln being top-ranked features. These results collectively indicated that VOC and metal(loid) exposure may contribute to elevated blood pressure in EA children via disturbing gut microbiota metabolism, γ-glutamyl cycling, and steroid metabolism. This study significantly advances our understanding of the potential mechanisms between VOC and metal(loid) exposure and childhood blood pressure elevation while providing practical tools for early risk detection and intervention."

Experimental evidence supports the notion that exposure to pesticides could perturb the gut microbiome, and the toxicant-induced dysbiosis may affect host homeostasis. However, the field of human studies, especially in early life, is still in its infancy. We aimed to evaluate the effects of landscape pesticide exposure on the maternal gut microbiome. Here, we assessed the blood levels of a broad array of pesticides in 405 pregnant women. Gut microbial compositions and functional profiles were assessed by using both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Microbial alpha diversity indices were regressed on host and environmental factors using linear models. Differences in overall microbial compositions were evaluated by using univariable permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) with Bray–Curtis dissimilarities. All pesticides, as well as other host and environmental factors, were correlated to the gut microbiome at the phylum, genus, species, and pathway levels employing the multivariable regression models adjusted for the potential covariates, respectively. The joint effects of the mixture of pesticide exposure on the gut microbiome were investigated using quantile g-computation. Microbial ecological networks were constructed via Spearman correlations to explore species co-occurrence patterns related to pesticide exposure. Significant associations were observed between exposure to various pesticides individually or as a mixture and maternal gut microbiome features. Specific taxa and pathways were enriched or depleted in response to varying pesticide concentrations, indicating the potential exposure-response relationships. Notably, mirex exposure showed a positive correlation with both the relative abundance of Blautia_wexlerae and the sucrose biosynthesis II pathway. Microbial co-occurrence network analyses revealed marked shifts in species interactions associated with increasing levels of pesticide exposure. Mediation analyses further identified a greater number of microbial taxa, particularly Blautia_wexlerae, as significant mediators linking pesticide exposure to alterations in microbial functional pathways. Our large-scale amplicon and metagenomic analyses unraveled the extensive impacts of landscape-level pesticides on the maternal gut microbiome. Further observational and experimental research is warranted to validate our findings as well as to elucidate whether and how these microbial changes affect maternal and offspring health."

Previous mapping works have relied on first‐principles methods like principal component analyses and k‐means clustering. In response, we adapt dimensionality reduction and multivariate clustering methods to analyze the spatial variability of nine key elements in martian geochemical maps. We identify seven individually contiguous chemical provinces, nearly exclusively in the highlands. We then conduct geochemical analysis coupled with first order petrological modeling to assess the histories for individually delineated provinces. We identified two new regions where one is consistent with minimal chemical weathering and represents a ∼3.7 Ga old crustal block preserving compositional evidence of fractional crystallization, suggestive of Mars's primary crust sequestering early as a magma ocean solidified."

Coarse‐grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large‐scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological prior distribution of a target region with a generative model, using its high‐resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high‐resolution climatological prior with coarse‐grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine‐grained, full‐variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting‐downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100‐member, 10‐day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes < ${< } $1 hr on a moderate‐end GPU, as contrast to O103 $\mathcal{O}\left(1{0}^{3}\right)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation.

Analyzing geodetic data from recently installed strainmeters and pore pressure transducers, we highlight the role of elastic strain and fluids in driving deformation during this sequence, suggesting the presence of a pressure source that strongly influences the deformation pattern.

In the subduction zone, the fast axis in the sub‐slab mantle below the forearc and offshore regions changes with depth from trench‐normal to trench‐parallel, in agreement with predictions of geodynamic model for retreating slabs. In the asthenosphere below the backarc region, fast axes are mainly oriented northeast–southwest, which is consistent with southwestward mantle flow and extrusion tectonics, and suggests strong lithosphere–asthenosphere coupling. Anisotropy weakens below ∼200 km, indicating an increased vertical olivine alignment due to slab steepening. A two‐layer anisotropic structure in the backarc region suggests the presence of lithosphere fabrics unrelated to recent dynamics."

However, the carbon footprint of its energy (72% coal‐based) requirement is also equally alarming. Under such scenarios, the Farm Power Subsidy (FPS) policy for groundwater irrigation, one of India's costliest public support systems, needs a relook, keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although aimed at bridging social disparities, it is observed that FPS encourages simplification and intensification of the food production system, leading to inter‐state and district scale inequality in income. States implementing FPS, even if experiencing physical water scarcity, are growing water guzzling crops for economic benefits. Conversely, without adequate access to energy, states reeling from economic water scarcity are witnessing low farm incomes. India consumes about a quarter of the world's groundwater for irrigation, and also leads the energy use. Notably, since the mid‐2000s large‐scale implementation of the FPS policy, the CO2 emission (equivalent) has been rising by 5.77 million tons annually, now surpassing 100 million tons. These outcomes bear testimony to the globally accepted view that those least responsible for causing greenhouse gas emissions are the hardest hit. We suggest repurposing of agricultural policies, without compromising farmers' income, for efficient management of energy and water."

 The implications of climate change for malaria eradication this century remain poorly resolved1,2. Many studies focus on parasite and vector ecology in isolation, neglecting the interactions between climate, malaria control and the socioeconomic environment, including disruption from extreme weather3,4. Here we integrate 25 years of African data on climate, malaria burden and control, socioeconomic factors, and extreme weather. Using a geotemporal model linked to an ensemble of climate projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP 2-4.5) scenario5, we estimate the future impact of climate change on malaria burden in Africa, including both ecological and disruptive effects. Our findings indicate that climate change could lead to 123 million (projection range 49.5 million to 203 million) additional malaria cases and 532,000 (195,000–912,000) additional deaths in Africa between 2024 and 2050 under current control levels. Contrary to the prevailing focus on ecological mechanisms, extreme weather events emerge as the primary driver of increased risk, accounting for 79% (50–94%) of additional cases and 93% (70–100%) of additional deaths. Most increases stem from intensification in existing endemic areas rather than range expansion, with significant regional variation in impact. These results highlight the urgent need for climate-resilient malaria control strategies and robust emergency response systems to safeguard progress towards malaria eradication.

 Ultralight axion particles are candidates for dark matter1, conjectured to form stable, macroscopic field configurations in three-dimensional space, resulting in the possible formation of topological defect dark matter2–4 (TDM). Exploring their possible existence through a realistic parameter space requires considering interactions that extend beyond the constraints imposed by astrophysical observations of stellar cooling processes5. Here we report the outcome of an experiment that monitors possible transient rotations of polarized spins, which could be induced by the interaction with topological defects, carried out by correlating five noble-gas laboratory set-ups located in two cities. Amplification and optimal noise filtering in hyperpolarized noble-gas spins greatly enhance the sensitivity to TDM-induced spin rotations, reaching approximately 10−6 rad. Through this, we set constraints on the axion–nucleon coupling across an axion mass range from 10 peV to 0.2 μeV, achieving 4.1 × 1010 GeV at 84 peV. These values exceed known constraints imposed by astrophysical observations, although these are obtained under different model assumptions. Our approach could further stimulate broad beyond-Standard Model physics searches, such as transient axion waves, axion stars, axion strings and Q-balls.

 Time-dependent drives hold promise for realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems1–3. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems4,5, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives6,7. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Here, using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by n-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is ‘doubly tunable’: one way by driving frequency, the other way by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent 2n + 1. Using quantum-state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a two-dimensional configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.

 Developing a unified algorithm that can learn from and generate across modalities such as text, images and video has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although next-token prediction has driven major advances in large language models1, its extension to multimodal domains has remained limited, and diffusion models for image and video synthesis2,3 and compositional frameworks that integrate vision encoders with language models4 still dominate. Here we introduce Emu3, a family of multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. Emu3 equals the performance of well-established task-specific models across both perception and generation, matching flagship systems while removing the need for diffusion or compositional architectures. It further demonstrates coherent, high-fidelity video generation, interleaved vision–language generation and vision–language–action modelling for robotic manipulation. By reducing multimodal learning to unified token prediction, Emu3 establishes a robust foundation for large-scale multimodal modelling and offers a promising route towards unified multimodal intelligence.

Yet the absence of periodicity fundamentally limits determination of their three-dimensional (3D) structure at atomic resolution. Despite major theoretical, experimental, and computational advances in characterizing short- and medium-range order9–24, quantitative determination of complete 3D atomic arrangements in amorphous materials remains experimentally demanding. Atomic electron tomography (AET) now provides a pathway to direct 3D atomic mapping in these materials25–27. Here we present a quantitative analysis of AET, showing how robust image preprocessing, denoising, projection alignment and normalization, advanced tomographic reconstruction, atom tracing, elemental classification and atomic position refinement collectively enable reliable determination of 3D atomic coordinates and elemental identities in amorphous materials. Using multislice-simulated datasets of amorphous Si, SiGeSn and CoPdPt nanoparticles under varying noise levels, our workflow outperforms an alternative approach28 in both positional precision and classification accuracy. For CoPdPt, we identify 95.1% of Co, 99.0% of Pd and 100% of Pt atoms, with corresponding 3D positional precisions of 29 pm, 12 pm and 6 pm, respectively, under realistic dose conditions. These results establish practical guidelines and quantitative benchmarks for achieving accurate AET of non-crystalline materials, and the underlying framework can be broadly applied to other tomographic imaging modalities for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.

 Emerging evidence suggests that Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have its origin in the enteric nervous system (ENS), from where α-synuclein (αS) pathology spreads to the brain1–4. Decades before the onset of motor symptoms, patients with PD suffer from constipation and present with circulating T cells responsive to αS, suggesting that peripheral immune responses initiated in the ENS may be involved in the early stages of PD1,5–7. However, cellular mechanisms that trigger αS pathology in the ENS and its spread along the gut–brain axis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that muscularis macrophages (ME-Macs), housekeepers of ENS integrity and intestinal homeostasis, modulate αS pathology and neurodegeneration in models of PD8,9. ME-Macs contain misfolded αS, adopt a signature reflecting endolysosomal dysfunction and modulate the expansion of T cells that travel from the ENS to the brain through the dura mater as αS pathology progresses. Directed ME-Mac depletion leads to reduced αS pathology in the ENS and central nervous system, prevents T cell expansion and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, suggesting a role for ME-Macs as early cellular initiators of αS pathology along the gut–brain axis. Understanding these mechanisms could pave the way for early-stage biomarkers in PD.

 Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it1. However, in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards2. From ants3 to humans4, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness5. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioural effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behaviour while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons6–11, with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation12–14, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behaviour through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons. In the nucleus accumbens, acetylcholine boosts dopamine release to promote effortful behaviour."

 Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is an interesting topic with broad scientific and technological impact1–4. Twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2) is a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI)5–10, exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall effect11–14. As the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization15,16, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the Chern insulator (CI)/FCI states. Here we demonstrate control of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states, by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe2. At low excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, that is, electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states under helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature17,18. Both optical training and direct switching are most effective near CI and FCI states, which we attribute to a gap-enhanced valley polarization of optically pumped holes. The magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of ferromagnetic, and thus CI (or FCI) domains. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractionally quantized anomalous Hall domains4,19.

 Allergic diseases are caused by overexuberant type II immune responses mounted against environmental antigens1. The allergic state is typified by the presence of allergen-reactive immunoglobulin E (IgE), which triggers mast cell degranulation upon allergen encounter, manifesting in pruritis, oedema and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. Over the past century, the prevalence of allergic diseases has increased markedly, suggesting that environmental rather than genetic factors are mediating this change2. Although many hypotheses connecting environment to allergy exist3–6, the biological mechanisms that underpin environmentally mediated protection from allergy are unknown. Here we show, using a mouse model of allergic disease, that exposure to immunostimulatory environments generated cross-reactive adaptive immune memory, which tracked with obstructed type II immune responses upon allergen exposure. We found that engagement of cross-reactive adaptive immunity protected against future allergic sensitization and suppressed established allergic responses. Cross-reactivity in a tolerogenic context also prevented allergy, with the effect extending across antigenically complex exposures even at low protein sequence similarity. Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic relationship between environment and allergy, with general implications for adaptive immune function in natural settings.

 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an endemic herpesvirus implicated in autoimmunity, cancer and neurological disorders. Although primary infection is often subclinical, persistent EBV infection can drive immune dysregulation and long-term complications. Despite the ubiquity of infection, the determinants of EBV persistence following primary exposure remain poorly understood, although human genetic variation partially contributes to this phenotypic spectrum1–3. Here we demonstrate that existing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of human populations can be used to quantify persistent EBV DNA. Using WGS and health record data from the UK Biobank (n = 490,560) and All of Us (n = 245,394), we uncover reproducible associations between blood-derived EBV DNA quantifications and respiratory, autoimmune, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. We evaluate genetic determinants of persistent EBV DNA via genome association studies, revealing heritability enrichment in immune-associated regulatory regions and protein-altering variants in 148 genes. Single-cell and pathway level analyses of these loci implicate variable antigen processing as a primary determinant of EBV DNA persistence. Further, relevant gene programs were enriched in B cells and antigen-presenting cells, consistent with their roles in viral reservoir and clearance. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping and predicted viral epitope presentation affinities implicate major histocompatibility complex class II variation as a key modulator of EBV persistence. Together, our analyses demonstrate how re-analysis of human population-scale WGS data can elucidate the genetic architecture of viral DNA persistence, a framework generalizable to the broader human virome4.

 Pesticides are widely distributed in soils1–3, yet their effects on soil biodiversity remain poorly understood4–7. Here we examined the effects of 63 pesticides on soil archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes, arthropods and key functional gene groups across 373 sites spanning woodlands, grasslands and croplands in 26 European countries. Pesticide residues were detected in 70% of sites and emerged as the second strongest driver of soil biodiversity patterns after soil properties. Our analysis further revealed organism- and function-specific patterns, emphasizing complex and widespread non-target effects on soil biodiversity. Pesticides altered microbial functions, including phosphorus and nitrogen cycling, and suppressed beneficial taxa, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterivore nematodes. Our findings highlight the need to integrate functional and taxonomic characteristics into future risk assessment methodology to safeguard soil biodiversity, a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning.

 The emergence of high-transition-temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains the main unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model—a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice—is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials1–5, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging6. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe2 (refs. 7,8), in which low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable9–11, presents a new platform for studying the high-Tc problem. Here we tune moiré WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell (ν = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at ν = 1, superconducting domes on electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states such as strange metals12–14. Twist-angle dependence studies further show that the highest Tc always occurs adjacent to the Mott transition3,15. Our results indicate strong correlation as the key to superconductivity in moiré WSe2 and establish a new material system for studying high-Tc superconductivity in a controllable manner.

 Human genetic variation influences all aspects of our biology, including the oral cavity1–3, through which nutrients and microbes enter the body. Yet it is largely unknown which human genetic variants shape a person’s oral microbiome and potentially promote its dysbiosis3–5. We characterized the oral microbiomes of 12,519 people by re-analysing whole-genome sequencing reads from previously sequenced saliva-derived DNA. Human genetic variation at 11 loci (10 new) associated with variation in oral microbiome composition. Several of these related to carbohydrate availability; the strongest association (P = 3.0 × 10−188) involved the common FUT2 W154X loss-of-function variant, which associated with the abundances of 58 bacterial species. Human host genetics also seemed to powerfully shape genetic variation in oral bacterial species: these 11 host genetic variants also associated with variation of gene dosages in 68 regions of bacterial genomes.

 Solid-state thorium-229 (229Th) nuclear clocks1–5 are set to provide new opportunities for precision metrology and fundamental physics6–8. Taking advantage of inherent low sensitivity of a nuclear transition to its environment9, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared with current optical lattice atomic clocks10. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control11 are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. Here we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and centre frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal12 properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock at 196(5) K, at which the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10−18 fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 220 Hz (fractionally 1.1 × 10−13) for two differently doped 229Th:CaF2 crystals over 7 months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of 229Th in solid-state hosts and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.

 Eukaryotic genome replication is surveyed by the S-phase checkpoint, which coordinates sequential origin activation to prevent the exhaustion of poorly defined, rate-limiting replisome components1–3. Here we show that excessive origin firing saturates chromatin-bound proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)—a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase processivity and Okazaki fragment processing4—thereby restricting further PCNA loading and lagging-strand synthesis when checkpoint control is lost. PCNA-associated factor 15 (PAF15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of this process5–9. During unperturbed S phase, the entire soluble PAF15 pool binds to chromatin, leaving no reserve to stabilize PCNA under conditions of excessive origin activation. PAF15 binds to PCNA specifically on the lagging strand through a high-affinity PIP motif and occupies the DNA-encircling channel, protecting the clamp and associated enzymes from premature unloading by the ATAD5–RFC complex. Conversely, overexpression of PAF15 or forced redistribution to the leading strand disrupts replisome progression and induces cell death. These detrimental effects are mitigated by Timeless–Claspin, which blocks PAF15–PCNA binding on the leading strand. E2F4-mediated repression fine-tunes PAF15 expression to ensure optimal dosage and strand specificity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized replisome constraint: when PAF15–PCNA assemblies are exhausted, the S-phase checkpoint globally restricts origin activation, linking a strand-specific rate-limiting mechanism to global replication dynamics. PCNA–PAF15 has a key role in determining replisome dynamics during genome replication and protecting against genome instability."

 Cambrian Burgess Shale-type (BST) fossil biotas document nearly complete snapshots of the oldest Phanerozoic marine ecosystems1–4. However, the rarity of deposits bearing high-diversity BST biotas5 has restricted our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the Cambrian explosion. Here we report the Huayuan biota—a lower Cambrian (Stage 4, approximately 512 million years ago) BST Lagerstätte from an outer shelf, deep-water setting of the Yangtze Block in Hunan, South China. The Huayuan biota yields remarkable taxonomic richness, comprising 153 animal species of 16 phylum-level clades dominated by arthropods, poriferans and cnidarians, among which 59% of species are new. The biota is comprised overwhelmingly of soft-bodied forms that include preserved cellular tissues. The complex ecosystem contained diverse radiodonts and pelagic tunicates, filling a gap of high-diversity BST biotas from the Cambrian Stage 4. Critically, multivariate ordination based on a global dataset of Cambrian BST biotas places the Huayuan biota within a main transition of marine animal ecosystems between Cambrian Age 3 and Age 4. Network analysis reveals close faunal connections between the Huayuan and Burgess Shale biotas, indicating transoceanic dispersal. Dated shortly after the Sinsk event6–8, the Huayuan biota illuminates differences in the impacts of this extinction in shallow- versus deep-water settings during the first Phanerozoic mass extinction and offers critical insights into the transformation of global ecosystems in the early Cambrian.

Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared with conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump. We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next-generation quantum and classical photonics.

 Most bacterial pathogens are polylysogens, harbouring multiple vertically transmitted prophages1–3. These prophages enhance bacterial pathogenicity and survival by encoding virulence factors and anti-phage defence systems while retaining the capacity for horizontal transfer. Thus, prophage-encoded anti-phage defences must block propagation of external phages without inhibiting the spread of the prophages that encode them. Here we identify HepS—an abortive infection system encoded on the Gifsy-1 prophage constituted of a single HEPN domain protein—which restricts phages of the Siphoviridae family. We demonstrate that in its native host context of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, HepS both senses phage infection and enacts abortive infection. Structures of HepS reveal a tetrameric nuclease complex that undergoes allosteric activation upon recognition of Siphoviridae tail tip proteins during production of new phage particles. Once activated, HepS cleaves specific transfer RNA anticodon loops and arrests phage replication. Gifsy-1, a Siphoviridae itself, evades self-targeting by expressing a tail tip variant that does not trigger HepS, as do co-resident Siphoviridae prophages Gifsy-2 and Gifsy-3. This evasion permits Gifsy-1 to spread despite encoding HepS. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a prophage defends the host while maintaining its propagation abilities.

 Early development across vertebrates and insects critically relies on robustly reorganizing the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs into individualized cells1,2. This intricate process is orchestrated by large microtubule structures that traverse the embryo, partitioning the cytoplasm into physically distinct and stable compartments3,4. Here, despite the robustness of embryonic development, we uncover an intrinsic instability in cytoplasmic partitioning driven by the microtubule cytoskeleton. By combining experiments in cytoplasmic extract and in vivo, we reveal that embryos circumvent this instability through two distinct mechanisms: either by matching the cell-cycle duration to the time needed for the instability to unfold or by limiting microtubule nucleation. These regulatory mechanisms give rise to two possible strategies to fill the cytoplasm, which we experimentally demonstrate in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos, respectively. In zebrafish embryos, unstable microtubule waves fill the geometry of the entire embryo from the first division. Conversely, in Drosophila embryos, stable microtubule asters resulting from reduced microtubule nucleation gradually fill the cytoplasm throughout multiple divisions. Our results indicate that the temporal control of microtubule dynamics could have driven the evolutionary emergence of species-specific mechanisms for effective cytoplasmic organization. Furthermore, our study unveils a fundamental synergy between physical instabilities and biological clocks, uncovering universal strategies for rapid, robust and efficient spatial ordering in biological systems. The cytoplasm can be partitioned into distinct compartments by microtubule structures, which can be stabilized by distinct mechanisms in different species."

 Deep learning models that predict functional genomic measurements from DNA sequences are powerful tools for deciphering the genetic regulatory code. Existing methods involve a trade-off between input sequence length and prediction resolution, thereby limiting their modality scope and performance1–5. We present AlphaGenome, a unified DNA sequence model, which takes as input 1 Mb of DNA sequence and predicts thousands of functional genomic tracks up to single-base-pair resolution across diverse modalities. The modalities include gene expression, transcription initiation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chromatin contact maps, splice site usage and splice junction coordinates and strength. Trained on human and mouse genomes, AlphaGenome matches or exceeds the strongest available external models in 25 of 26 evaluations of variant effect prediction. The ability of AlphaGenome to simultaneously score variant effects across all modalities accurately recapitulates the mechanisms of clinically relevant variants near the TAL1 oncogene6. To facilitate broader use, we provide tools for making genome track and variant effect predictions from sequence. AlphaGenome, a deep learning model that inputs 1-Mb DNA sequence to predict functional genomic tracks at single-base resolution across diverse modalities, outperforms existing models in variant effect prediction and enables comprehensive genomic analysis."

Schuster;Jonathan Simon,A cavity-array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing,"A cavity-array microscope is realized using intra-cavity lenses to create a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes, each coupled to a single atom in free-space. 
 Neutral-atom arrays and optical cavity quantum electrodynamics systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science1–3. Although each platform has shown exceptional capabilities—such as high-fidelity quantum logic4–7 in atom arrays and strong light–matter coupling in cavities8–10—their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement11, building large-scale quantum networks12–17 and engineering hybrid atom–photon Hamiltonians18–20. However, so far, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode21–26, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity-array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements26,27, and instead uses a free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses28,29 to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micrometre-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom-array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom–cavity coupling and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fibre array as a proof of principle for networking applications30. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10-fold improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity quantum electrodynamics and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays. A cavity-array microscope is realized using intra-cavity lenses to create a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes, each coupled to a single atom in free-space."

 Environmental differences in genetic effect sizes, namely, gene–environment interactions, may uncover the genetic encoding of phenotypic plasticity1–3. We provide a cross-population atlas of gene–environment interactions comprising 440,210 individuals from European and Japanese populations, with replication in 539,794 individuals from diverse populations. By decomposing the contributions from age, sex and lifestyles, we delineate the aetiology of these gene–environment interactions, including a reverse-causality from a disease-related dietary change. Genome-wide analyses uncovered missing heritability and trait–trait relationships connected by the synergistic effects of genome and environments, which systematically affected polygenic prediction accuracy and cross-population portability. Single-cell projection revealed aging shift of pathways and cell types responsible for genetic regulation. Omics-level gene–environment analyses identified multiple sex-discordant genetic effects in lipid metabolism, informing clinical trial failures for genetically supported drug development. Our comprehensive gene–environment study decodes the dynamics of genetic associations, offering insights into complex trait biology, personalized medicine and drug development.

 Psychedelics are undergoing a renaissance as potential therapy for psychiatric disorders, with more than 200 clinical trials being studied across several countries1–3. However, the precise mechanisms by which these drugs bring about benefits and the potential clinical risks are not yet fully understood. The serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) was reported to be a Gq-coupled receptor and the primary interoceptive target of psychedelics4,5. Here we compared psychedelics and their non-hallucinogenic analogues (nHAs) using in vitro and in vivo approaches, finding that 5-HT2AR-mediated non-canonical Gi signalling is essential for hallucinogenic effect. We further presented five cryo-electron microscopy structures of 5-HT2AR–Gi/Gq in complex with psychedelics or nHAs. Structural analysis and pharmacological investigation revealed that a special contact between nHAs with 5-HT2AR mediated the signalling bias. Building on this insight, we identified a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine derivative, DOI-NBOMe, which exhibits potent and selective Gq-biased activity, and demonstrates promising therapeutic effects in mouse models without hallucinogenic effect. Our finding uncovers the functional mechanisms underlying the Gi signalling mediated by 5-HT2AR and provides valuable insights for designing psychedelic-based drugs with minimized risk from hallucinogenic effects.

 Three-dimensional (3D) microfabrication/nanofabrication technologies have revolutionized various fields by enabling the precise construction of complex microstructures/nanostructures1–6. However, existing methods face challenges in fabricating intricate 3D architectures from a diverse range of materials beyond conventional polymers. Here we introduce a universal 3D microfabrication/nanofabrication strategy compatible with a broad range of materials by precisely manipulating optofluidic interactions within a confined 3D space, enabling the creation of volumetric, free-form 3D microstructures/nanostructures. A femtosecond-laser-induced heating spot generates a localized thermal gradient, providing precise spatiotemporal control over optofluidic interactions of the nanoparticle-laden dispersions. This enables the rapid and highly localized assembly of nanoparticles with diverse shapes and compositions—including metals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials and quantum dots—into complex 3D microstructures. To demonstrate its versatility, we fabricate multifunctional microdevices, such as 3D microfluidic valves with size-selective sieving functionality, achieving fast separation of microparticles/nanoparticles with distinct dimensions, as well as microrobots integrated with four distinct functional materials, achieving multimodal locomotion powered by different external stimuli. This optofluidic 3D microfabrication/nanofabrication method unlocks new opportunities for advanced material innovation and miniaturized device development, paving the way for broad applications in colloidal robotics7, microphotonics/nanophotonics, catalysis and microfluidics.

 The Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnet (AFM), an extension of the classical Stoner–Wohlfarth model originally describing the magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic nanoparticles1,2, refers to a single-domain AFM whose Néel vector can be coherently switched by the magnetic field. These AFMs not only retain the inherent advantages of antiferromagnetism but also feature controllable Néel vector and a perfect switching ratio, thus emerging as promising building blocks for ultradense magnetic memories and high-throughput computing systems3,4. However, bulk AFMs are not the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs owing to the hard-to-switch Néel vector and inevitable multidomain structure3,5–7. Here we report that CrPS4, a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) A-type AFM, exhibits ideal characteristics of the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs, because of the dominance of antiferromagnetic exchange over the magnetic anisotropy and high quality of vdW interfaces. The antiferromagnetic order undergoes a ferromagnet (FM)-like binary switching with the magnetic field rather than the layer-by-layer flipping observed in other 2D A-type AFMs. Moreover, we deduce the characteristic exchange length of several vdW A-type AFMs and propose a criterion for judging the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs. Our work therefore establishes a universal framework for understanding the magnetization reversal in layered AFMs and promotes the effective use of 2D AFMs in advanced spintronic devices. CrPS4, a 2D van der Waals A-type antiferromagnet, is shown to exhibit ideal characteristics of Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnets, such as ferromagnet-like binary switching rather than layer-by-layer flipping as in other 2D A-type antiferromagnets."

 The ocean is essential for humanity1–3. Yet, inequity in ocean-based activities is widespread and accelerating4–8. Addressing this requires governance approaches that can systematically measure equity and track progress9.

We apply the index, which scores twelve criteria, to case studies at local, national and global scales. We show that the OEI can generate structured data to support evidence-based decision-making across ocean sectors and scales.

 Flexible electronics, coupled with artificial intelligence, hold the potential to revolutionize robotics, wearable and healthcare devices1, human–machine interfaces2, and other emerging applications3,4. However, the development of flexible computing hardware that can efficiently execute neural-network-inference tasks using parallel computing remains a substantial challenge5. Here we present FLEXI, a thin, lightweight and robust flexible digital artificial intelligence integrated circuit to address this challenge. Our approach uses process-circuit-algorithm co-optimization and a digital dynamically reconfigurable compute-in-memory architecture. Key features include clock frequency operation of up to 12.5 MHz and power consumption as low as 2.52 mW, all while achieving subdollar-per-unit cost and an operational circuit yield of between approximately 70% and 92%. Our circuits can perform 1010 fixed and random multiplications without error, withstand over 40,000 bending cycles and maintain stable performance for a period exceeding 6 months. A one-shot on-chip neural network deployment eliminates the power consumption and latency associated with sequential weight writing, achieving up to 99.2% accuracy in temporal arrhythmia detection tasks on a single 1-kb chip. In addition, FLEXI demonstrates over 97.4% accuracy in human daily activity monitoring using multimodal physiological signals.

 Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology1,2 to superconductivity3. However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady state has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate optical switching of the spin–valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moiré lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals4–7. We show that the spin–valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the exciton–polaron8 transitions with circularly polarized light. These findings not only provide direct evidence for non-thermal optical switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over a topological order parameter, paving the way for optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits. Optical spin orientation of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers is demonstrated, enabling control of topological Chern numbers with circularly polarized light."

Roberts,Holistic motor control of zebra finch song syllable sequences,"A cortical premotor network in HVC, once initiated, can sustain and regulate the sequential production of zebra finch song syllables without major extrinsic inputs. 
 How brain circuits are organized to skillfully produce learned sequences of behaviours is still poorly understood. Here we functionally examined how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song1, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We found that HVC could generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC was needed for song initiation, but it was not required for transitions between syllables or for song completion. We showed that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably caused vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of the song, in a manner reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences could be induced at any moment of the song and relied on local circuits within HVC. We identified and computationally modelled a synaptic network, including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behaviour. A cortical premotor network in HVC, once initiated, can sustain and regulate the sequential production of zebra finch song syllables without major extrinsic inputs."

 Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding1, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we introduce Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at

Flynn,GlycoRNA complexed with heparan sulfate regulates VEGF-A signalling,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitate the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and cell surface RNA-binding proteins, which negatively modulate VEGF-A signalling and angiogenesis. 
 Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have been recognized as key plasma membrane-tethered co-receptors for a broad range of growth factors and cytokines containing cationic heparan-binding domains1,2. However, how HSPGs mechanistically mediate signalling at the cell surface—particularly in the context of cell surface RNA—remain poorly understood. During developmental and disease processes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), a heparan sulfate-binding factor, regulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis3. The regulatory paradigm for endothelial cell-mediated selectively of VEGF-A binding and activity has largely been focused on understanding the selective sulfation of the anionic heparan sulfate chains4–8. Here we examine the organizational rules of a new class of anionic cell surface conjugates, glycoRNAs9,10, and cell surface RNA-binding proteins (csRBPs11,12). Leveraging genome-scale knockout screens, we discovered that heparan sulfate biosynthesis and specifically the 6-O-sulfated forms of heparan sulfate chains are critical for the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and csRBPs (cell surface ribonucleoproteins (csRNPs)). Mechanistically, we show that these clusters antagonize heparan sulfate-mediated activation of ERK signalling downstream of VEGF-A. We demonstrate that the heparan sulfate-binding domain of VEGF-A165 is responsible for binding RNA, and that disrupting this interaction enhances ERK signalling and impairs vascular development both in vitro and in vivo and is conserved across species. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized regulatory axis by which csRNPs negatively modulate heparan sulfate-mediated signalling in the context of angiogenesis driven by VEGF-A. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitate the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and cell surface RNA-binding proteins, which negatively modulate VEGF-A signalling and angiogenesis."

Tanenbaum,Pre-assembly of biomolecular condensate seeds drives RSV replication,"Viral ribonucleoprotein–viral protein networks form pre-replication centres that nucleate viral factories and drive respiratory syncytial virus replication. 
 During infection, many RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), form specialized biomolecular condensates, viral factories (VFs), where viral transcription and replication occur1,2. Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation3, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require VFs for viral transcription and replication. Here, to uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish VFs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that VFs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. VF nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein–protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form ‘pre-replication centres’ (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their efficient recruitment and retention of viral proteins. The high affinity of PRCs also results in increased association of the viral polymerase and its co-factors, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of VFs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid VF formation. PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as an important origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection. Viral ribonucleoprotein–viral protein networks form pre-replication centres that nucleate viral factories and drive respiratory syncytial virus replication."

 Bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis are critical for human health, with disruptions linked to metabolic and endocrine disorders1,2. The organic solute transporter Ostα/β, essential for bile acid efflux in enterohepatic circulation3, has long defied mechanistic elucidation. Here we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Ostα/β in apo and substrate-bound states at 2.6–3.1 Å resolution, revealing a distinctive membrane protein architecture that defines a new transporter class. Ostα/β forms a symmetric tetramer of heterodimers, with each Ostα subunit showing a new seven-transmembrane fold, augmented by a single transmembrane helix of Ostβ. This architecture is stabilized by extensive lipid modifications, including a palmitoylated cysteine-rich motif that forms a lateral substrate-binding groove. The structures uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic helix-gated conduit. This design, conserved in the evolutionarily related TMEM184 family, suggests an ancient mechanism for substrate translocation. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport driven by electrochemical gradients, elucidating the efflux role of Ostα/β in vivo. Lipid interactions, notably palmitoylation-dependent trafficking, emerge as critical for stability and function. These findings clarify the molecular mechanism of Ostα/β, provide a structural basis for disease-associated mutations4,5 and establish a paradigm for lipid-modified membrane transport.

Li,Observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition of bilayer excitons,"Transition of superfluid to insulator is observed in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. 
 One of the most remarkable properties associated with Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity, in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide-ranging bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems1–4. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5–8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9–11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase. Transition of superfluid to insulator is observed in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons."

 Optical control offers a non-contact, high-precision and ultrafast route to manipulating quantum material properties1–5. Fractional Chern ferromagnetic states in moiré superlattices are a promising platform by which to pursue topological quantum computing6–10, but an effective optical control protocol has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate robust optical switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) bilayers using continuous-wave circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nW µm−2. Using this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient optical control scheme for moiré Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.

Liberles,Vagal blood volume receptors compensate for haemorrhage and posture change,"A vagal reflex to blood volume changes in the heart involves PIEZO2 and helps to stabilize blood pressure in an upright posture and after blood loss. 
 Cranial nerves densely innervate the heart and vasculature, with sensory neurons reporting on blood pressure, respiratory gases and tissue damage1. The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated2, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here we use genetic tools in mice to identify a small group of neurons that are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and initiate a reflex that compensates for decreased filling of the heart in an upright posture and haemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart, lower blood pressure in response to optogenetic stimulation and display blood-volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Knockout of Piezo2 and/or ablation of PIEZO2 neurons in vagal ganglia eliminates this heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, causes orthostatic hypotension and compromises cardiovascular stability during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that vagal mechanoreceptors monitor the cardiac cycle and initiate a blood-volume-dependent reflex that defends the constancy of circulation. A vagal reflex to blood volume changes in the heart involves PIEZO2 and helps to stabilize blood pressure in an upright posture and after blood loss."

 Bile acids (BAs) are crucial amphipathic surfactants that function as multifaceted regulators in various physiological processes, including nutrient absorption and distribution, lipid metabolism and inflammation1,2. The human organic solute transporter αβ (OSTα–OSTβ; hereafter referred to as OSTα/β) is a BA transporter that has a key role in the secretion and distribution of BAs3–6. Pathogenic mutations in OSTα/β have been associated with cholestasis7,8. Despite the functional importance of OSTα/β in BA homeostasis, the stoichiometry and assembly of the complex and the molecular mechanism that underlies BA transport by OSTα/β remain unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human OSTα/β in complex with cholesterols and an endogenous substrate, elucidating the structural basis for the function of OSTα/β. OSTα/β is assembled in a novel dimer-of-heterodimers manner: two OSTα units form the homodimeric core, with two OSTβ units bound to the periphery. OSTα adopts the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) fold and contains a unique cysteine-rich loop with seven palmitoylation sites; these cooperate with transmembrane helices 5 and 6, constituting a BA recognition site. A positive cavity in OSTα connects the BA site and facilitates the transmembrane translocation of BAs through OSTα/β. Together, this study reveals the architecture and transport mechanism of OSTα/β and provides insights into the structure–function relationships of this crucial transporter in BA homeostasis. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the bile acid transporter OSTα–OSTβ, which has a key role in bile acid homeostasis, provide insight into its distinct architecture and mechanism of substrate translocation."

Here, the authors uncover a Crinkler‑derived genomic parasite that ADP‑ribosylates EZH2 and TRAF6 to evade epigenetic silencing and immune detection, revealing an evolutionary role for toxin‑derived proteins. 
 Crinkler effectors are iconic toxins deployed by pathogens to suppress host immunity, a function long thought exclusive to pathogenic species. Here, we uncover a striking evolutionary twist: an ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein that has repurposed its toxin-derived activity to function as an epigenetic parasite in free-living eukaryotes, challenging the paradigm that Crinkler effectors are exclusively pathogen-restricted virulence factors. The ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein retains a functional mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase domain homologous to diphtheria toxin, yet exhibits degeneration of N-terminal host-targeting domain, severing ties to canonical pathogenic functions. This activity enables dual subversion of host mechanisms: the ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein mono-ADP-ribosylates the EZH2, reducing H3K27me3-mediated silencing and reactivating its own locus and adjacent transposons to drive replicative amplification; simultaneously, it modifies the immune adaptor TRAF6, suppressing NF-κB and IRF3 pathways to weaken innate immune surveillance and facilitate sustained propagation within the host genome. Notably, this parasitic strategy is countered by host detoxification: TRAF6 ubiquitinates ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Together, our findings reveal how a toxin-derived effector escaped pathogenic contexts to evolve as a selfish genomic element, leveraging toxin-like activity to subvert epigenetic and immune barriers and redefining the evolutionary potential of Crinkler toxins as drivers of genomic conflict beyond pathogenicity.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains refractory to most immunotherapies, with cancer vaccines failing due to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that β-glucan–induced trained immunity overcomes these barriers by reprogramming macrophages through H3K4me3-dependent epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring. In female mice vaccinated with peptide-coated adenovirus-based vaccine PeptiCrad, training enhances glycolysis with creatine metabolism sustaining CXCL9/10 production, enabling macrophages to recruit NK cells via CXCR3. In turn, NK cells produce CCL5, driving cDC1 infiltration and antigen presentation, which together amplify effector memory CD8⁺ T cell responses. Moreover, with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CRC patient-derived organoids, trained macrophages boost NK migration, antigen-specific T cell activation, and tumor killing. These findings highlight trained immunity as a powerful adjuvant to reinvigorate colorectal cancer vaccination.

 Lithography is pivotal in fabricating micro/nanoscale patterns and processing materials for electronic microdevices. However, conventional organic polymeric resists inevitably entail the use of various chemical solutions or solvents, which especially compromise fragile electronic materials featuring atomic-level surfaces. Here, we introduce inorganic selenium molecules as a lithographic mediator for sensitive electronic material processing without direct exposure to solutions or solvents. Specifically, the inorganic selenium molecular film functions as both a lithographic mediator for direct patterning due to its weak intermolecular van der Waals interactions and as a protective encapsulation layer for atomic electronic materials without compromising structural and electronic characteristics. Wafer-scale arrays of sensitive materials with high-quality, sharp edges are facilely achieved by a non-destructive mechanical peeling of the selenium layer. This approach provides a solvent-free lithographic route for microfabricating sensitive materials and high-performance electronic devices.

 Despite proven oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) efficacy, adherence barriers among men who have sex with men (MSM) persist. Economic viability of digital adherence tools in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires validation. We assessed the 6-month within-trial cost-effectiveness of a digital intervention for real-time enhancement of oral PrEP adherence (DIRECT-PrEP) in China, from health system, multipayer, and societal perspectives. Costs were derived from hospital records, and effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and PrEP-adherence days (PADs). Among 442 participants (247 intervention, 195 standard care), incremental costs per QALY gained for the smart pillbox intervention were $19,575.93 (health system), $19,656.66 (multipayer), and $19,844.42 (societal)—all below the cost-effectiveness threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product ($31,200). Costs per PAD gained were $30.46–$30.86, achieving >95% probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $47.50–$48.50 per PAD. Notably, the intervention demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness per QALY among participants stratified as more socially vulnerable ($16,259.77–$16,490.41) compared with those classified as less socially vulnerable ($23,514.83–$23,834.38). These results establish the smart-pillbox digital intervention as a cost-effective strategy for oral PrEP adherence within primary healthcare settings in LMICs, particularly when prioritizing more socially vulnerable populations, though long-term scalability requires further validation.

Here, authors provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of an optical coherent Ising machine, where spins are encoded in the polarization of light and can be accessed via intensity measurements, thereby lifting the limitations related to phase stabilization. 
 Time-multiplexed networks of degenerate optical parametric oscillators have demonstrated remarkable success in simulating coupled Ising spins, thus providing a promising route to solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. In these systems, referred to as coherent Ising machines, spins are encoded in the oscillator phases, and measured at the system output using phase-sensitive techniques, making intricate phase stabilization necessary. Here, we introduce an optical Ising machine based on spontaneous polarization symmetry breaking in a coherently driven fiber Kerr nonlinear resonator. In our architecture, the spins are encoded in the polarization state, allowing robust, all-intensity readout with off-the-shelf telecom components. By operating in a newly-discovered regime where nonlinearity and topology lock the system’s symmetry, we eliminate drift and bias, enabling uninterrupted Ising trials at optical speeds for over an hour, without manual intervention. This all-fiber platform not only simplifies the hardware but also opens a path to more stable, high-throughput coherent optical optimization devices for applications from finance to drug design and beyond.

 Ancient basement faults within plate interiors may be reactivated by external forces, generating intraplate seismicity. However, the driving mechanisms remain unclear. The 2017 Changdao earthquake swarm in the Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China, provides an opportunity to investigate such processes. A high-resolution earthquake catalog, constructed using matched filter detection and waveform-based relocation, reveals that the swarm occurred at 7-13 km depth along an X-shaped fault network, with migration following sqrt(t) diffusion (D = 0.08 – 1.2 m² s-1). High b-values and external forcing rate, and substantial isotropic components (13-38%) in the moment tensors indicate fluid involvement. Combined with low VP/VS ratios and proximity to CO2-rich hydrocarbon fields, we propose a fault-valve model where highly compressible fluids episodically breach fault intersections, triggering transient crack opening and swarm migration. This study reveals how deep fluids reactivate ancient basement faults in intraplate regions, and provides new insights for seismic hazard assessment in hydrocarbon-bearing basins. A distinctive migration pattern consistent with fluid pressure diffusion is identified within a high-resolution earthquake catalogue of the 2017 Changdao swarm and suggests a fault-valve mechanism driven by overpressure CO2-rich fluids was responsible."

 The 2025 Myanmar earthquake caused heavy casualties and economic losses in Myanmar and surrounding regions. The mechanism of the unexpectedly long rupture and the effect of sediments on its rupture dynamics remain unclear. Here we integrate seismic and geodetic observations with kinematic inversions and dynamic rupture simulations, revealing that the rupture extended ~450 km with a maximum slip of 6.9 m concentrated within the top 10 km of the upper crust. The rupture propagated ~70 km northward (subshear to supershear) and ~380 km southward (subshear to supershear and back to subshear). The long southward-propagating supershear rupture created a highly energetic front that resulted in an unexpectedly long surface rupture. Moreover, we find the coexistence of shallow subshear and deep supershear around station NPW due to the influence of sediments. Our results highlight the importance of combining data-driven inversions and physics-based modeling to decipher the rupture dynamics of large earthquakes. Integrating geodetic and seismic data with kinematic and dynamic modeling suggests that the 2025 Mw 7.7 Myanmar rupture transitioned between subshear and supershear speeds in both directions and was strongly influenced by thick sediments."

 Accurate tree volume and structure are crucial for forest biomass estimation and ecosystem investigations. While terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers non-destructive pathways for the detailed three-dimensional tree reconstruction, current methods overestimate small branch volumes and often require tree segmentation and leaf–wood separation as a priori. This study introduces and validates RayExtract, a novel method for reconstructing woody volume from TLS data, utilising tools from the RayCloudTools library, to automate the extraction of tree structural metrics from point clouds. Our method incorporates two key morphological rules — Self-Similarity and Leonardo’s Rule — to aid branch radius and taper calculations. Likewise, it enables rapid and automated plot-scale reconstruction by integrating tree segmentation and woody structure modelling without requiring leaf point classification. In this study, RayExtract demonstrated high accuracy across four high-quality destructive harvest reference sets with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) values ranging from 0.82 to 0.97 (n=124). To explore algorithm behaviours under different leaf conditions and point densities, we implement a framework using TLS simulation of highly realistic synthetic trees. Results from the simulation framework show consistent high accuracy of total woody volume, with CCC ranging from 0.97 to 0.98 (n=18) across four distinct scanning configurations. Fine-scale volumetric analysis revealed that incorporating simple morphological rules can effectively inform branch taper and reduce woody volume overestimation, particularly in smaller components. Furthermore, it identifies a limitation in volumetric accuracy in trees exhibiting significant taper in the lower stem. Analysis of RayExtract’s computational efficiency demonstrates that runtime and memory usage scale predictably with input data size, primarily driven by point count and the associated structural complexity within the point cloud, positioning the algorithm as well suited for large-scale applications.

 In the era of embodied intelligence, wearable datasets for pedestrian navigation are essential. However, publicly available multisensory datasets tailored to such scenarios remain scarce. Traditional sensors such as RGB cameras and LiDAR often struggle to capture the fast and irregular dynamics of human motion. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale pedestrian-wearable dataset primarily recorded using event cameras. The dataset includes event camera, RGB cameras, LiDAR sensors, a tactical-grade IMU, and GNSS, covering a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments with diverse motion types and illumination conditions. High-precision ground truth is obtained using motion capture systems indoors and GNSS/IMU integration with bidirectional smoothing outdoors. The dataset is structured into 23 subsets categorized by motion dynamics and lighting, supporting the development and evaluation of robust localization and SLAM algorithms. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art frameworks reveals notable performance degradation under highly dynamic or low-light conditions, highlighting the dataset’s value for advancing pedestrian navigation and event-based perception.

 Climate conditions such as the dynamics of temperature and precipitation significantly influence agricultural production. Therefore, the climate-induced agricultural economic consequences cannot be neglected. This study employs machine learning models with time series climate data, a panel of state-by-year total factor productivity estimates (1960–2004) for 48 contiguous states of the United States (U.S.), and the yield data for corn and soybean (1960–2020) in the main producing states to quantify the potential climatic effects on U.S. agricultural productivity under different climate scenarios. The results show that the climate change impacts are spatially heterogeneous under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2050. However, the effects on future agricultural productivity are consistently negative regardless of the region. The negative climatic effects on productivity growth will offset the advancements of U.S. agricultural productivity after 5–25 years under various climate change scenarios assuming the same advancement rates as the past. The predictions of the impacts could advance our understanding of future productivity growth in U.S. agriculture under climate change. The analysis results could also shed light on policy planning to mitigate various effects and threats to food security due to the changing climate."

 For routine road maintenance, accurate and efficient crack detection holds significant research value and practical importance. With advances in computer vision, image processing-based crack detection has achieved promising results. However, in complex environments, factors such as illumination and weather introduce noise interference, especially in high-resolution crack images where fine fracture features show heightened complexity and diversity. This often leads to degraded detection accuracy in such challenging scenarios. To address this, we propose FE-SegNeXt, a convolutional neural network segmentation framework tailored for high-resolution crack detection in complex environments. The algorithm leverages distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in crack images: average pooling separates these features, while a dedicated Frequency Collaborative Enhancement Module (FCEM) independently enhances high- and low-frequency components before fusing multi-band information. This design significantly improves the model’s ability to extract subtle cracks from high-resolution images under noisy conditions. Additionally, we introduce a Locally Enhanced Feed-Forward Network (LE-FFN) to amplify perception of weak crack signals in local regions, further refining fine-grained feature extraction. Experimental results on the public datasets Sun520, Rain365, and BJN260 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves F1-scores of 61.55%, 62.57%, and 60.31%, respectively, outperforming existing crack detection algorithms."

 Urban streets form the backbone of cities, and variations in street-junction spatial configuration provide valuable insights into urban form and function, both of which exhibit fractal and scaling characteristics in their structural and statistical properties. However, these patterns emerge from the interaction of multiple spatial processes operating at different scales, making it difficult to capture and compare their form-function relationships using single-scale analyses. To address this challenge, this study proposes a new α–β framework for multi-scale urban form comparison, grounded in fractal theory. Using a progressive clustering method, we construct scaling profiles for multiple cities, deriving the α (form) and β (function) parameters to systematically compare urban structures with differing morphologies and to identify urban clusters at their characteristic scales. This approach transforms the subjective perception of morphology into an actionable analytical tool, enabling integrated form-function assessment and overcoming the challenges of comparative studies from different urban systems. Overall, the proposed α–β framework effectively deconstructs urban complexity, as evidenced by its application to a comparative analysis of nine global metropolises."

 Global digital elevation models (DEMs) play a crucial role in modern scientific research and human activities. However, acquiring comprehensive elevation data at global scale remains challenging, particularly for oceanic regions, with the current open-access global open DEM resolution limited to 15 arc-seconds (approximately 450 m). In order to further improve the global DEM resolution, we propose an innovative Relay Residual Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RRDPM) for DEM super-resolution tasks based on diffusion model principles. Our model achieves distribution transformation between high- and low-resolution DEMs through tens of steps. Moreover, RRDPM introduces two types of inherently indivisible sampling equations, and we prove that each of them has different advantageous positions, and integrate these advantageous positions using a “relay race” approach. In addition, we discard the conventional downsampling-super-resolution paradigm, by utilizing paired datasets of global 15 arc-second and local 3 arc-second DEMs, so that our method can be trained and tested in real-world situations. The experimental results show that the RRDPM reduces the RMSE by 20.73 % and 22.77 % for land and seabed regions, respectively, and improves the PSNR by 2.23 dB and 2.34 dB, respectively, for the same areas, representing significant advancements in the current global DEM detail recovery.

Among these,BIN1andRIN3have emerged as susceptibility genes, yet their functional relationship in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated how BIN1 and RIN3 interaction regulates RAB5 activity and endosomal pathology. RIN3 has been shown to bind BIN1, and we previously reported that this interaction modulates amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) trafficking and Aβ generation in vitro. To extend these findings, we usedRin3constitutive knockout (Rin3-CKO) mice and CRISPR-Cas9–edited human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons carrying eitherBIN1knockout or rare familial ADRIN3missense mutations within the BIN1-binding domain. We found that disruption of BIN1-RIN3 binding, through either genetic deletion or pathogenic RIN3 variants, resulted in RIN3-mediated RAB5 hyperactivation and enlargement of neuronal endosomes, a hallmark of early AD pathology. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed dysregulated expression of AD-related genes. Together, these findings establish BIN1 as a critical regulator of RIN3-driven RAB5 activation and neuronal endosomal homeostasis."

In contrast, we report that αSyn is the major modulator of substantia nigra somatodendritic dopamine release, a little-understood form of neurotransmission that is central to sensorimotor and basal ganglia circuitry. This regulation is due to a previously unknown role for αSyn in controlling the activity of the L-type calcium ion channels (LTCC), which are also implicated in Parkinson’s pathogenesis. αSyn-deficient neurons further display decreased spike frequency adaptation, hippocampal LTCC-dependent long-term potentiation, and immediate early gene induction, functions that are essential for synaptic adaptation and neuronal plasticity."

The origin of these large ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs), referred to as mega-ULVZs, remains uncertain partly because of lack of constraints on the relative reduction in shear versus compressional wave speeds (RS/P). This ratio can give clues into the compositional makeup of the mega-ULVZs. Through joint seismic analysis of core-diffractedPandSwaves beneath Hawai’i, we constrain theRS/Pof its mega-ULVZ to 1 to 1.3. Mineralogical modeling reveals that iron enrichment via solid iron-rich magnesiowüstite [(Mg,Fe)O] matches this seismic constraint, independent of modeled ULVZ thickness. Enrichment of metallic iron-rich magnesiowüstite likely enhances the thermal conductivity of mega-ULVZs and provides a mechanism to drive localized plume upwelling. Higher reportedRS/Pvalues for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape."

A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier and clustering analysis revealed functionally heterogeneous subpopulations in each population, with dMSNs preferentially activated at movement onset and offset, and iMSNs during execution. Cortical and thalamic inputs were preferentially activated during onset/offset and execution, respectively, though dMSN- and iMSN-projecting neurons in each region showed similar patterns. Locomotion phase-specific rhythmic activity was found in a subset of thalamic dMSN-projecting neurons and dMSNs. Cortex or thalamus inactivation reduced MSN activity.

Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored the activity of major efflux systems inEscherichia coliandPseudomonas aeruginosawith Hoechst 33342 (HCT), a DNA binding inhibitor. We found that inactivation of efflux (ΔtolCinE. coliand Δ6 inP. aeruginosa) increased the apparent HCT-DNA affinity, mediated by a decreased apparent unbinding rate, whereas the intrinsic rate remained unchanged. Statistical physics modeling and experimental testing show that, unlike under dilute in vitro conditions, drug molecules that unbind from their targets in intracellular environments undergo successive rebinding, prolonging the total lifetime of the drug bound to the target. However, efflux pumps counteract this effect by suppressing rebinding, thereby kinetically destabilizing drug-target interactions.

The molecules of good solvents screen off interchain interactions for hyperelasticity. The long dangling chains disentangle and adsorb to substrate for strong adhesion. We synthesized such gels by controlling the polymerization kinetics. When a monomer solution is partially cured, some monomers form a network and others form the solvent. The resulting gel, termed homogel, consists of a polymer network with enormous dangling chains and solvent of identical chemistries. An interval exists where the dangling chains are long and disentangled substantially, and the homogel exhibits both hyperelasticity and omniadhesion.

Here, we found that Set2-mediated H3K36me3 deposition occurs on the nucleosome reassembling behind the EC. The histone chaperone FACT suppresses H3K36me3 deposition on the downstream nucleosome, thereby ensuring that Set2 targets specifically on the reassembling upstream nucleosome. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing EC complexed with Set2 revealed that Set2 is anchored by the Spt6 subunit of the EC to capture both of the H3 N-terminal tails in a stepwise manner during the nucleosome reassembly process.

Using ab initio and deep learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in δ-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of both hydrogen and aluminum ions within the oxygen sublattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute external entropy to the system, stabilizing the structure at 140 GPa and 3800 K. Our free-energy calculations reveal that water tends to freeze under deep lower mantle conditions, so dehydration becomes energetically and kinetically unfavorable even under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. This implies that superionic water may accumulate in the deep lower mantle over geologic time, forming a long-term reservoir at the base of the mantle."

However, designing and fabricating microfluidic chips typically requires substantial expertise and numerous design iterations, posing considerable barriers to entry for nonexperts. We introduce μFluidicGenius (μFG), an open-access, machine learning (ML)–augmented design tool that enables nonexpert users to rapidly create functional microfluidic circuits. Users simply define the spatial placement of reservoirs, specify the channel connections between them, and assign desired flow rates through this layout. Leveraging a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates ML models with mathematical modeling, μFG automatically generates spatially coded maze structures that implement the precise fluidic resistances needed to meet the target flow distribution. These resistive elements are optimized to fit within the available geometry and can reproduce complex flow profiles, such as physiologically relevant flow rates in multi-organ-on-chip platforms. The resulting microfluidic designs are directly exportable for three-dimensional printing. Experimental validation demonstrates that μFG-generated circuits reproduce target flow distributions with 90% accuracy. By streamlining and automating microfluidic circuit creation, μFG not only lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts but also showcases a principled and efficient application of ML to fluidic system design, enabling rapid and customizable development of complex microfluidic architectures."

While gigantic icebergs have garnered worldwide attention, small ice bodies have been overlooked, and we still lack their mechanistic models. Aided by a real-time tracking, we unravel the transient processes of freely floating ice in calm waters—including the kinematics, phase transition, and surrounding fluid dynamics—that govern melting. Combining the heat transfer model and our experimental results, we develop and validate a theoretical model for the melt rate, identifying ice geometry and convective regime as key controls. Furthermore, the ice-driven convective volume flux is found to exceed the meltwater flux by orders of magnitude, underscoring the ecological relevance of floating ice; it not only supplies freshwater but also acts as a destabilizing buoyancy source that redistributes mass macroscopically. Our study provides a foundation for developing mechanistic parameterizations of icebergs and ice floes melting in climate models."

However, their susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion limits their long-term use, creating a need for advanced alloys capable of resisting environmentally assisted damage and mechanical failure. Here, we design a cost-effective austenitic stainless steel. The key innovation involves the atomic-scale passivation of grain boundaries through nitrogen decoration. This enhances resistance to failure, achieving about 3.8-fold increase in corrosion resistance and a 1.35-fold increase in hydrogen embrittlement resistance compared to commercial 316L. The steel exhibits very low hydrogen diffusivity (~7.8 × 10−17square meters per second), mitigating hydrogen embrittlement at ambient temperature, an advantage over conventional steels. In addition, formation of a dense passive film improves corrosion resistance in environments such as dilute hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. The outstanding resistance of the stainless steel against such harsh coupled environmental conditions qualifies it as a promising candidate for sustainable and secure infrastructure in the emerging hydrogen economy."

Ultrasound (US) imaging is the principal modality for placental imaging, providing structural assessment with B-mode and blood flow evaluation with Doppler mode. Furthermore, advanced techniques such as 3D power Doppler, quantitative US, and shear-wave elastography expand the capabilities of placental US imaging. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging enables observation of the optical properties of endogenous chromophores (e.g., hemoglobin) with high spatial resolution and measures blood oxygenation, a key factor in placental dysfunction, offering substantial value for placental imaging.

We reviewed the recent work and concluded three limitations: few open-source datasets, coarse building function categories, and poor model interpretability with inadequate multimodal feature fusion. Thus, we created BuildingSense with fine-grained categories and multimodal data, and proved that the large model can be used for improving the interpretability of results, with three directions for enhancing their performance. 
 Building function is a description of building usage. The accessibility of its information is essential for urban research, including urban morphology, urban environment, and human activity patterns. Existing building function classification methodologies face two major bottlenecks: (1) poor model interpretability and (2) inadequate multimodal feature fusion. Although large models with strong interpretability and efficient multimodal data fusion capabilities offer promising potential for addressing the bottlenecks, they remain limited in processing multimodal spatial datasets. Their performance in building function classification is therefore also unknown. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of multimodal building function classification datasets, which results in the challenge of effectively performing their performance evaluation. Meanwhile, prevailing building function categorization schemes remain coarse, which hinders their ability to support finer-grained urban research in the future. To bridge the gap, we constructed a novel multimodal and fine-grained dataset—BuildingSense—for building function classification. Based on BuildingSense, we evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art large models from the perspective of classification outcomes and reasoning processes. The results demonstrate that large models can effectively comprehend multimodal spatial data, challenging the conventional concept. Based on that, three directions for future research can be key: (1) build a categorized inference example database, (2) develop cost-effective classification models, and (3) quantify the confidence of model outputs. Our findings not only provide insights into the development of subsequent large model-based classification methods but also contribute to the advancement of multimodal fusion-based classification methods.

Walters,Understanding Drivers and Trends of Habitability in Kiribati from a Systems Perspective,"Pacific atolls face heightened climate risk due to low elevations and limited resources. The question of (unin)habitability in these locations is often simplified to characteristics of hazard exposure, reinforcing assumptions of inevitable mass migration. Here we use a multidimensional conceptualization of habitability, built from local knowledge, to simulate habitability trends in the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati over the coming century. Our use of system dynamics modeling offers a new approach to operationalizing habitability, allowing for the incorporation of a range of interdependent factors such as natural resource availability, livelihood opportunity, and population dynamics, among others. We find that water insecurity will be a driving factor in habitability loss, intensifying under extreme climate scenarios, while population pressures will further constrain resources. We show that regional disparities will lead to high internal migration rates, with movement to national urban centers preferred over movement abroad. Our work answers calls for a holistic and locally grounded understanding of habitability through a systems lens. By identifying how drivers of habitability change over time, we offer insights into targeted and timely climate adaptation."

Perfluoroalkane sulfonamide derivatives are a class of PFASs that have received attention due to their widespread use and environmental persistence. The goals of this research were to integrate studies of PFAS biotransformation pathways and biotransformation kinetics to discover dominant biotransformation pathways, enable quantitative estimates on the formation of rate-limiting intermediates, and simulate the net formation of key biotransformation products. We selected eight perfluoroalkane sulfonamide derivatives and performed aerobic batch experiments in bioreactors seeded with wastewater microbial communities. We identified 71 biotransformation products among the parent compounds, of which 42 represent unique chemical structures. We found that the biotransformation products could be assembled into convergent biotransformation pathways that generalize our understanding of the way perfluoroalkane sulfonamide derivatives are biotransformed. Our kinetics analyses reveal the dominant branches in the biotransformation pathways and allowed us to quantitatively estimate the extent of formation and biotransformation rate constant of key rate-limiting intermediates in the absence of authentic standards.

In this study, subthreshold azoxystrobin exposure (1, 10, 100 μg/L, 4 days) caused no observable abnormalities in F0 embryos, whereas unexposed F1 and F2 generations exhibited developmental abnormalities, with effects independent of parental gender, demonstrating azoxystrobin exhibited transgenerational developmental toxicity at subthreshold exposure. Moreover, reduced protein levels of DNA methyltransferases and altered genomic DNA methylation patterns were detected in F1 and F2 embryos. Further research found that the ryr1b gene exhibited concurrent suppression of gene expression and DNA hypermethylation in F1 and F2 generations, with identical DNA methylation modification sites located in intron regions, indicating that the DNA hypermethylation of ryr1b was stably inherited transgenerationally and mediated epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Through constructing the interaction networks of differentially expressed genes with consistent expression trends across two generations, it was found ryr1b occupied the central position in the gene interaction network, and triggered cascade reactions through calcium signaling pathways. These pathways modulated excitation-contraction coupling (ECC)-associated gene expression in cardiomyocytes, ultimately driving cardiac functional deficits and developmental abnormalities in offspring embryos.

Key,Biotransformation Processes Relevant to Geologic Carbon Sequestration: Potential Implications for Environmental Fate,"The nature and extent of microbial reactions in formations targeted for geologic carbon sequestration (GCS), as well as in nontarget formations that may be impacted by potential CO2 migration, are key to understanding the fate of injected CO2. The dissolution of CO2 into formation waters drives predictable geochemical changes, including pH reduction, shifts in redox conditions, and increased mineral solubility. These changes can alter microbial community composition (e.g., favoring acid-tolerant taxa) and stimulate microbes capable of using CO2 as a carbon source. Resulting biotransformation processes can transfer CO2 into the mineral phase (e.g., microbially facilitated carbonate precipitation), gas phase (e.g., methanogenesis), or organic phase (e.g., biomass formation). However, the extent, rate, and significance of these processes in both target and nontarget environments are not well understood. This paper reviews current knowledge of CO2 biotransformation relevant to GCS, including reactions occurring in deep storage formations and those arising from potential CO2 migration into shallow groundwater aquifers, the vadose zone, and marine environments. Additionally, factors that influence these transformations are summarized, methods for monitoring microbial processes are discussed, and key research gaps that could facilitate improved prediction of the long-term fate of CO2 under varying environmental conditions are identified."

In a colloidal dispersed state, clays can increase the mean transport velocity of adsorbed pollutants by several orders of magnitude. Hence, delineated groundwater protection zones and riverbank filtration systems based on pollutant mobility may fail if carrier-facilitated transport is neglected. Yet, leveraging carrier-assisted transport for the controlled release of pollutants from soil may open new remediation opportunities. However, the determination and parametrization of competitive adsorption on mobile and immobile sorbents, crucial for carrier-facilitated transport, are often obscured by the interplay among numerous interaction processes in natural porous media. We present experiments in which montmorillonite minerals facilitated the transport of polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in a 10-fold increase in mean transport velocity in limestone media. PEG’s high affinity for montmorillonite enabled the mobilization of PEG already adsorbed at immobile interfaces. Additionally, model simulations suggested that high flow rates, for example, due to ponding infiltration, were favorable for carrier-facilitated transport, even for weak adsorption to mobile sorbents. We developed a sequential experimental protocol that permits identification of crucial factors controlling competitive sorption during carrier-facilitated transport."

Mesocosm-scale vegetated columns operated for 1 year were sampled over 8 months under Non-RTC and three RTC configurations, with embedded sensors continuously monitoring moisture and the ORP in the unsubmerged and submerged zones. RTC-induced system operations significantly altered moisture and ORP conditions within the biofilters (p-value <0.001). RTC extended aerobic–anoxic conditions compared with predominantly anaerobic Non-RTC systems, significantly improving removal of TrOCs favoring aerobic biodegradation (p-value <0.001), with mean improvements of 37.2–45.5%. RTC accommodated ADWP-driven variability in system dynamics and treatment, except during 17-day ADWP when sustained anaerobic conditions in Non-RTC increased sulfamethoxazole and atrazine removal by up to 20.1%. Microbial profiling revealed modest increases in the diversity and abundance of TrOC-degrading genera under RTC (up to 4-fold).

Transcriptomics and metabolomics demonstrated the concurrent significant enrichment of autophagy pathways and disruption of lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, 6:2 Cl-PFAES suppressed expressions of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), ras-related GTP binding protein 7 (RAB7), and deacetylation of forkhead box class O1 (FOXO1), thereby impairing lipophagy flux and promoting lipid droplets accumulation. Molecular docking indicated comparable binding affinity of 6:2 Cl-PFAES and PFOS to SIRT1 (−10.4 kcal/mol), and further research demonstrated that 6:2 Cl-PFAES reduced the deacetylation activity of SIRT1. Crucially, Sirt1 overexpression in transgenic mice (Sirt1TG) or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 (SRT1720) and RAB7 (ML-098) rescued testosterone synthesis and restored lipophagy flux.

Algal cells exposed to chronic Cu stress exhibited distinct labile Cu(I) bioaccumulation patterns, forming two subpopulations: “LCu(I) cells” and “HCu(I) cells,” differentiated by intracellular labile Cu(I) content. These results provide direct evidence of heterogeneous Cu(I) distribution at the single-cell level in microalgae. Higher Cu stress induced a shift from LCu(I) cells to HCu(I) cells, suggesting differential cellular sensitivity to Cu stress and varying labile Cu(I) accumulation. At the molecular level, multiomics analyses identified Ctr3p as a potential key regulator of labile Cu(I) homeostasis in algal cells. Confocal imaging revealed abnormal aggregation of glutathione (GSH) in granules within HCu(I) cells. Complementary GSEA results indicated an aberrant GSH compartmentalization in HCu(I) cells that might contribute to Cu(I) hyperaccumulation.

Geschwind,Developmental convergence and divergence in human stem cell models of autism,"Risk associated with genetically defined forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment. 
 Two decades of genetic studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified more than 100 genes harbouring rare risk mutations1–13. Despite this substantial heterogeneity, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have identified convergent patterns of dysregulation across the ASD postmortem brain14,15–17. To identify shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD-linked mutations, we assembled a large patient collection of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, consisting of 70 hiPS cell lines after stringent quality control representing 8 ASD-associated mutations, idiopathic ASD, and 20 lines from non-affected control individuals. Here we used these hiPS cell lines to generate human cortical organoids, profiling by RNA sequencing at four distinct time points up to 100 days after in vitro differentiation. Early time points harboured the largest mutation-specific changes, but different mutations converged on shared transcriptional changes as development progressed. We identified a shared RNA and protein interaction network, which was enriched in ASD risk genes and predicted to drive the observed downstream changes in gene expression. CRISPR–Cas9 screening of these candidate transcriptional regulators in induced human neural progenitors validated their downstream convergent molecular effects. These data illustrate how risk associated with genetically defined forms of ASD can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing new insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment.

 The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) plays a central role in regulating the global ocean circulation, climate and Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics. Yet the spatiotemporal variability of the ACC during the Pleistocene remains poorly constrained. Here we reconstruct ACC flow-speed variation using a meridional transect of sediment cores from the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Our results reveal zonally asymmetric changes in ACC strength across the Southern Ocean on orbital timescales over the past one million years; the ACC intensified in the South Indian Ocean but weakened in the South Pacific during glacial and low-obliquity periods, with the opposite pattern during interglacial and high-obliquity periods. These anti-phased changes probably reflect an integrated response to bathymetric constraints, shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, sea-ice extent, buoyancy forcing and current confluence. Such zonally asymmetric and anti-phased ACC dynamics persisted during warmer-than-present intervals of the Pleistocene, offering a potential analogue for future anthropogenic warming—albeit under fundamentally different boundary conditions.

 Metallocene research has influenced the development of organometallic chemistry, and the metal–nonmetal inverted half-sandwich structure (inverse metallocene) was very recently discovered. However, additional instances are required to propose the concept inverse metallocene and it remains uncertain whether metal five-membered ring structures analogous to the cyclopentadienyl anion structure exist. Herein we report the synthesis of a series of palladium analogs Pd8(PPh)2(PPh3)2(Ph2P=O)(S-Adm)5 (Pd8–P), Pd6(PPh)(PPh3)(S-Adm)6 (Pd6), Pd5(PPh)(S-Adm)4[(Ph2P)2O] (Pd5–O), and Pd5(PPh)(S-Adm)4[(Ph2P)2CH2] (Pd5–C), identify their fundamental metal building block named five-membered Pd aromatic ring, and reveal their conjugation‒photothermy correlation. In particular, we report an average NIR-II photothermal conversion efficiency per metal atom of 14.7% and the stability of the five-membered Pd aromatic ring, as illustrated by the fact that Pd5–C maintained photothermy performance for >10 heating–cooling cycles even after the ligands were removed. We further demonstrate the great potential of inverse palladocenes in areas such as laser shielding, high-temperature degradation, ignition, and temperature/light control.

 The molecular underpinnings contributing to the onset of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) remain elusive. By studying familial clusters of the disease, here we identify a significant association between genetic variants in the V-set and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 10 Like (VSIG10L) gene and BE predisposition. Using mammalian tissues and patient-derived organoids, we show VSIG10L is selectively expressed in the suprabasal squamous cells of the esophageal mucosa and is essential for epithelial maturation and homeostasis. Mice carrying human-orthologous germline mutations in Vsig10l exhibit loss of desmosomes, concomitant with disrupted epithelial differentiation programs, in the squamous mucosa. Upon long-term exposure to a bile acid (deoxycholate) supplemented diet, Vsig10l-mutant mice develop overt BE-like lesions in the forestomach. Furthermore, loss of esophageal VSIG10L expression is observed frequently in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, a known risk factor for BE. Collectively, our study uncovers a fundamental link between VSIG10L, esophageal homeostasis, and BE predisposition.

 Prior knowledge accelerates subsequent learning of similarly structured problems – a phenomenon termed learning to learn – by forming generalizable neural representations called neural correlates of schema (NCS). However, how the brain exploits stable NCS while remaining flexible towards changes (the stability-plasticity dilemma) remains unclear. Here, we show that the primate brain addresses this dilemma by representing the stable NCS and task-unique changes in a near-orthogonal manner. We analyzed neural activities in the dorsolateral premotor cortex of three male macaques trained to perform a series of visuomotor mapping tasks. By delineating decision and stimulus-related subspaces, we identified NCS within the decision subspace, whose reuse facilitated subsequent learning. In addition, the decision subspace exhibited a near-orthogonal relationship with the stimulus-related subspace, minimizing cross-domain interference. Our results reveal that restricting NCS to specific functional domains can preserve useful knowledge while maintaining near-orthogonality with other subspaces, enabling flexible adaptation to new environments, thereby resolving the stability-plasticity dilemma. This study reveals that during a series of learning tasks, the macaque brain represents the shared (e.g. the decision strategy) and task-unique information (e.g., sensory inputs) in a near-orthogonal manner, thereby supporting reuse of the shared component to facilitate learning, while remain flexible to changes in specifics."

 Photocatalytic hydrogen production faces barriers to industrialization, including inadequate light absorption and limited mass/momentum transfer at scale. Integrating external hydrocyclones into photoreactors is a promising solution, yet the multiscale complexity of hydrocyclone-driven hydrogen generation impedes mechanistic understanding and rational system design. Herein, we build a scalable hydrocyclone-based photoreactor that achieves 270 mL/h hydrogen yield and 5.26% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency under simulated sunlight, as 4.5 times higher than static conditions. We develop a hierarchical multiscale model combining computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and density functional theory, which connects macro-scale hydrocyclone flow strain to atomic-level photocatalytic processes. Here, we show that shear stress-induced nanoscale lattice restructuring of the catalyst modulates photoexcitation pathways, triggers a threshold-activated catalytic amplification effect, and identifies an optimal flow rate of 20-30 L/min. These findings reveal a multiscale force–chemical coupling mechanism linking reactor-scale hydrocyclone flow fields to lattice-scale strain-driven catalytic enhancement, guiding large-scale photocatalytic hydrogen production.

 Titanium carbide MXene (Ti₃C₂Tₓ) is an emerging metallic material with promise for (opto)electronics and thermal management. Yet how photoexcitation—particularly via photogenerated thermal energy—modifies its charge carrier dynamics remains poorly understood. By combining time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy and transient reflectance measurements, we reveal a long-lived, photo-induced suppression of conductivity, which we attribute to efficient lattice heating and slow heat dissipation in Ti₃C₂Tx. A systematic variation of pump photon energy reveals that this ‘negative’ photoconductivity can equivalently be induced by lattice temperature increases, indicating a thermal origin. Repetition-rate-dependent transient reflectance measurements further show residual heat persisting over 100 ns, substantially longer than in conventional metals. Our work presents a unified understanding of photothermal effects in Ti₃C₂Tₓ and their influence on non-equilibrium charge transport, underscoring its potential for photothermal electronics and light-to-thermal energy storage applications.

 As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely adopted, understanding how they learn from, and memorize, training data becomes crucial. Memorization in LLMs is widely assumed to only occur as a result of sequences being repeated in the training data. Instead, we show that LLMs memorize by assembling information from similar sequences, a phenomenon we call mosaic memory. We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models displaying significant reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques. In this work, we show memorization to be a complex, mosaic process, with real-world implications for privacy, confidentiality, model utility and evaluation. Large language models learn from, and often memorize, training data. Here, authors show they memorize far more than previously thought, by stitching together pieces of text like a mosaic.

 Efficient carbon dioxide mineralization in silicate-rich formations depends on reaction rates within fracture networks, yet the role of fracture microstructure remains poorly constrained. We investigated how fracture aperture and surface roughness influence mineralization by reacting synthetic forsteritic olivine fractures with controlled apertures (0.5–1.6 millimeters) and roughness (6–16 micrometers) with supercritical carbon dioxide at 13.7 megapascals and 185 degrees Celsius. Optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that rougher fracture surfaces promoted iron oxide precipitation, which passivated olivine surfaces, limiting magnesium availability for carbonate formation while removing iron as a reactant. These effects were more pronounced in smaller-aperture fractures. A geochemical model incorporating surface topography and passivation reproduced the observed trends, confirming that increased roughness can reduce reactivity despite greater surface area. Our results demonstrate that fracture microstructure strongly influences iron oxide passivation and carbon dioxide mineralization, with important implications for predicting long-term performance of engineered carbon dioxide storage systems.  Rougher surfaces in smaller apertures olivine fractures increase reactive surface area but hinder efficient carbon dioxide mineralization by promoting passivating iron oxide precipitates, according to an integrated experimental and modeling study."

 Outcrops and cores are primary sources of information about the Earth’s past. Quantitative analyses rely on geochronologies that take into account highly variable sedimentation and erosion rates as well as gaps from missing strata. Using 23 geochronologies from the Holocene, Quaternary, Phanerozoic and Precambrian, we apply Haar fluctuation analysis to statistically characterize the number of measurements per unit time - the measurement densities. The analysis determines the densities’ (multifractal) scaling regimes and exponents; collectively, the analyses span over nine orders of magnitude in time scale. The measurement density is a new paleoindicator that we show is typically correlated with the primary paleoindicator, biasing and complicating its statistical interpretation. We also analyze the distribution of gaps linking the latter’s (probability) scaling with series incompleteness and the length Sadler effect.

 Detecting, locating, and characterising the dynamics of destabilised volcanic material is critical for assessing the extreme hazards posed by volcanic mass flows, such as pyroclastic density currents. Geophysical measurements of these events may offer information otherwise hardly observable at close range. Here we investigate pyroclastic density current dynamics using a multiparameter approach that combines seismic, distributed acoustic sensing, and infrasound data with thermal and visible imagery, supported by numerical simulations. We focus on two events at Stromboli volcano, Italy, that occurred in October and December 2022. By comparing visible imagery with seismic energy and applying array processing techniques, we identify different flow volumes ( ~23.5 ± 9.5 × 103 m3 and  ~80 ± 9 × 103 m3, respectively) and velocities (33-42 m/s and 54-59 m/s, respectively). Simulations reveal that reproducing these velocities requires volume-dependent empirical friction angles ( ~27° and 21°), consistent with dry granular flow behaviour and friction weakening. These findings offer new insights into the use of distributed acoustic sensing for volcanic monitoring and underscore the value of integrating multiparameter data with modeling to better understand complex volcanic processes.

 The ‘Strangelove ocean’ (a state of ocean, almost devoid of living organisms) documented in the early Cambrian strata in South China, has been thought to be driven by an extraterrestrial impact, but this viewpoint has been doubted for emerging geochemical evidence. Volcanism may be a trigger for the oceanic crisis. However, such a linkage has not yet been established. Here, we conduct an investigation into the timing and origin of the early Cambrian K-bentonites (a type of clay rock formed from volcanic ash) of the Yangtze and Baoshan blocks. The results suggest that the K-bentonites may represent early Cambrian explosive super-eruptions occurred in the north-western margin of Gondwana. The eruptions might trigger the anoxia of the contemporaneous ocean and coincided temporally with a bio-crisis preceding the summit of the Cambrian explosion.

 The dual-scale agricultural management, namely farmland-scale management and service-scale management, offers a solution for achieving a balance between ensuring food security and reducing carbon emissions. Based on panel data of 30 Chinese provinces between 2005 and 2021, we use two-way fixed effects model and mediating effect model to explore the impact of dual-scale agricultural managements on agricultural carbon emission intensity. It was found that: Dual-scale agricultural managements have a significant negative correlation with agricultural carbon emission intensity; They have a synergistic effect on reducing carbon emission intensity through industrial agglomeration effect, technological progress effect, and machinery service effect; Farmland-scale management correlate more significantly with reduced agricultural carbon emission intensity in regions with balanced food production and sales, regions with high degree of agricultural mechanization, and the eastern regions, while service-scale management correlate more significantly in the main food sales regions, high degree of agricultural mechanization regions and the central regions.

Statistical analyses and climate simulations indicate that these compound extremes are projected to intensify under future climate scenarios. 
 Extreme climate events (ECEs) pose substantial threats to global food security, particularly impacting winter wheat yields in Northern China. Here, we examine historical and projected effects of ECEs on wheat production across three sub-regions. Using statistical models and cropping system simulations, we quantify yield losses driven by individual and compound stressors under historical and future climate scenarios. Historically, post-anthesis compound hot-dry events and spring heat stress caused the greatest yield reductions in the north and middle sub-regions, whereas compound freeze-dry events dominated in the south. By 2080-2100, rising post-anthesis compound hot-dry events are projected to further reduce yields. Heat stress is expected to offset the benefits of reduced freeze stress, particularly in the cooler north sub-region, where its effects are more pronounced than in the warmer south. These findings highlight the urgent need for region-specific adaptation strategies to sustain wheat production under climate change. Compound freeze-dry events have been the primary drivers of historical yield loss in the south of Northern China, whereas compound hot-dry events  have dominated in other regions. Statistical analyses and climate simulations indicate that these compound extremes are projected to intensify under future climate scenarios."

We present a high-resolution geodetic velocity field of the Tibetan Plateau, which shows that a few major strike-slip fault systems separate regions of more uniformly distributed deformation. We suggest that focused strain on major fault systems is enabled by relatively low-viscosity ductile shear zones extending through the lithosphere beneath the seismically active fault planes. Simple model calculations show that high slip rates on the Kunlun Fault enable east-west extension to be distributed broadly across the relatively weak southern and central Tibetan Plateau. Activation of the Kunlun fault in the Miocene at the same time as the onset of rifting in the north-south grabens suggests a causal relationship."

In skeletal muscle, this decline is largely driven by impaired function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to efficiently contribute to muscle regeneration. We uncovered a cause of this aging-associated dysfunction: a cellular survivorship bias that prioritizes stem cell persistence at the expense of functionality. With age, MuSCs increased expression of a tumor suppressor, N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which, by suppressing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, increased their long-term survival potential but at the cost of their ability to promptly activate and contribute to muscle regeneration. This delayed muscle regeneration with age may result from a trade-off that favors long-term stem cell survival over immediate regenerative capacity."

Although dynamic changes to DNA methylation are a hallmark of aging in mammals, it is unclear whether similar molecular signatures reflect rates of aging and organism life span in plants. In this work, we show that the short-lived model plantArabidopsis thalianaexhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, which causes DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing life span and that shoot apical meristems are protected from these epigenetic changes. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging and that mutants of this program display a complete absence of epigenetic decay while physical aging remains unaffected."

The peculiar excitation spectrum of the stripe phase, a definite footprint of its supersolidity, has been difficult to measure experimentally. In this work, we performed in situ imaging of the stripes and directly observed both superfluid and crystal excitations. We investigated superfluid hydrodynamics and revealed a stripe compression mode, thus demonstrating that the system possesses a compressible crystalline structure. Through the frequency softening of this mode, we located the supersolid transition point. Our results establish spin-orbit–coupled supersolids as ideal systems to investigate supersolidity and its rich dynamics."

We identified core regulators of cell identity and developed sequence-based models that revealed conserved regulatory codes. By predicting chromatin accessibility across 240 mammalian species, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of human cis-regulatory elements, identifying sets associated with positive selection and gene expression changes, including the recent gain ofTHRBexpression in cerebellar progenitor cells.

Vascular tension varies with transpiration and soil drying and is regulated by stomata, pressure-activated valves on the leaf surface. We hypothesize that soil physical constraints drive convergence in the operational range of leaf vascular tension. Based on a meta analysis of 19 diverse species, we find that stomatal regulation of transpiration is activated when leaf vascular tension reaches a narrow target of 1.3 ± 0.6 megapascals. This value matches the range (1.4 ± 0.6 megapascals) predicted from an optimal soil water extraction model. Optimality in plant vascular tension appears to have evolved by selection for a narrow range of osmotic pressure in the leaves of diverse species growing across variable environments."

We identified a role for the metalloprotease SPRTN in preventing DPC-driven immunity and its pathological consequences. Loss of SPRTN activity during replication and mitosis lead to unresolved DNA damage, chromosome segregation errors, micronuclei formation, and cytosolic DNA release that activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. In aSprtnknock-in mouse model of Ruijs-Aalfs progeria syndrome, chronic cGas-Sting signaling caused embryonic lethality through inflammation and innate immune responses.

Drill cores and geophysical logs from International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 405 demonstrate that the megathrust preferentially develops at the top or base of the pelagic clay in the sedimentary layers present on the incoming Pacific Plate, where pronounced contrasts in physical properties occur. This preference results in a narrow, weak fault located at a major mechanical contact between frontal prism mud and subducted sediments, which enhances the tendency for shallow seismic slip, suggesting that the Japan Trench may be more susceptible to ruptures with large shallow slip than are margins without weak clays."

We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition."

We use mathematical modeling and analyses of twin cohorts raised together and apart to correct for this factor, revealing that heritability of human life span due to intrinsic mortality is above 50%. Such high heritability is similar to that of most other complex human traits and to life-span heritability in other species."

Here, we unveil the fundamental kinetic limitations and overcome them by introducing oxygen-assisted MOCVD (oxy-MOCVD) technology. By tuning reactions with oxygen, MO precursors are converted into high-purity transition-metal oxides and chalcogens, producing aligned molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) domains with a size and growth rate that are orders of magnitude larger than conventional MOCVD.

We geolocate each power project and obtain forecasted physical climate risk exposures at these locations using data from Moody’s ESG Solutions. We measure transition climate risks using the project specific committed CO₂ emissions and find a positive correlation between physical and transition climate risks across these projects—which are driven primarily by fossil fuel investments. Coal power plants exhibit the highest level of both physical and transition climate risks. Although hydropower projects tend to have lower carbon emissions, they face the highest flood risk among all fuel types. We find no evidence that the positive relationship between physical and transition climate risks varies by financier country or financing type. These results highlight the need for integrated climate risk assessments in international energy finance and underscore the potential for climate-related liabilities to compound across multiple risk channels."

Exploring British Columbia’s energy transition trade-offs using integrated energy systems modelling,"Decarbonizing industrialized economies through electrification requires electricity systems to simultaneously achieve dramatic capacity expansion, sustained reliability, and emissions reductions. We present a novel soft-linkage methodology between the CIMS energy-economy model and the COPPER electricity system planning model to quantify how economy-wide policies translate into specific electricity system requirements and greenhouse gas outcomes for the Canadian province of British Columbia. Our analysis examines two scenarios: one reflecting implemented policies, and another adding proposed climate policies alongside electrified industrial projects, including liquefied natural gas facilities and large-scale mining operations. Results reveal dramatically different infrastructure requirements between scenarios, with the latter requiring substantially higher electricity capacity expansion, dominated by variable renewable energy and higher peak demand growth. Emissions outcomes diverge: while implemented policies deliver meaningful emissions reductions, net-zero aligned proposed policies achieve smaller overall reductions when accounting for prospective emissions from fossil fuel projects, which offset decarbonization elsewhere in the economy. Proactive energy system planning and accelerated infrastructure permitting and construction will be required to meet decarbonization and economic development goals. British Columbia’s experience may offer insights for other jurisdictions pursuing both natural resource development and climate goals. Our approach can be adapted by other jurisdictions using similar models to assess their own energy transition pathways."

A climatology is derived separately for each station and each month of the year. Along with the dataset, SEEPS4ALL also resembles a set of verification tools. In a nutshell, SEEPS4ALL helps promote the benchmark of daily precipitation forecasts against in-situ observations over Europe. 
 Forecast verification is an essential task when developing a forecasting model.  How well does a model perform? How does the forecast performance compare with previous versions or other models? Which aspects of the forecast could be improved?  In weather forecasting, these questions apply in particular to precipitation, a key weather parameter with vital societal applications.  Scores specifically designed to assess the performance of precipitation forecasts have been developed over the years. One example is the Stable and Equitable Error in Probability Space (SEEPS, Rodwell et al., 2010). The computation of this score is however not straightforward because it requires information about the precipitation climatology at the verification locations. More generally, climate statistics are key to assessing forecasts for extreme precipitation and high-impact events. Here, we introduce SEEPS4ALL, a set of data and tools that democratize the use of climate statistics for verification purposes. In particular, verification results for daily precipitation are showcased with both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts.  The data is available through Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18197534 (Ben Bouallègue, 2026) and the verification scripts  at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18392042 (Ben Bouallegue and Prieto Nemesio, 2026)."

We compiled and mapped over 650 peat samples from Western Siberia, summarizing decades of research. Our database organizes information about existing studies, showing which periods, regions, and methods have been investigated, and guiding researchers toward gaps where future work can expand our understanding of these ecosystems. 
 Peatlands are natural archives that preserve information not only about their own development but also about past environmental conditions in surrounding landscapes. This study presents a comprehensive review of palaeoecological research based on peat cores from the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL). We compiled and georeferenced 654 peat cores and documented the application of 26 palaeoecological proxies, including chronological, physical, chemical, and biological indicators, resulting in the creation of the Western Siberian Peat Core Database (WSPC). The database synthesizes information from 156 publications spanning 1953–2025 and captures both the temporal and methodological evolution of peatland studies in the region, highlighting a clear shift from early single-proxy, low resolution investigations to modern multi-proxy high-resolution studies. Spatial analysis reveals high peat core density along major rivers and in the Great Vasyugan Mire, while remote northern continuous permafrost regions remain underrepresented. Temporal coverage indicates that most cores capture Holocene peatland dynamics, with the longest records in non-permafrost and isolated permafrost zones, extending into the Late Glacial (~15,600 cal. yr BP). The database underscores the dominant role of fundamental physical and chemical proxies, while highlighting the selective application of biological proxies and the limited use of specialized chemical analyses. In addition, the study identifies key research challenges in Western Siberia, including narrow seasonal windows for fieldwork, permafrost, limited transport infrastructure, permit requirements, and geopolitical barriers, which collectively constrain peatland sampling. The WSPC database represents the most extensive compilation of peat-core-based palaeoecological data for this region, offering critical guidance for targeted sampling and future research to address spatial, temporal, and proxy-specific gaps in the study of Western Siberian peatlands."

We developed an automated method converting rock descriptions into stratigraphic interpretations by testing plausible sequences using regional maps. The approach quantifies uncertainty and correlates multiple drillholes. Testing on fifty-two South Australian drillholes successfully predicted correct sequences, unlocking legacy data value for geological surveys. 
 Australian commonwealth, state and territory geological surveys possess information on over 3 million drillhole logs. In addition to mineral exploration drilling, extensive drillhole datasets exist from oil and gas exploration and hydrogeological studies. Other countries no doubt have similar data holdings. Together these legacy drillhole datasets have the potential to significantly enhance constraints on regional 3D geological models and improve our understanding of subsurface architecture, but have limited use in their current form as many if not most drill logs lack stratigraphic information, containing only lithological descriptions.This study develops open-source codes and methodologies for stratigraphy recovery (determining the ordered sequence of stratigraphic units) from drillhole lithological data by introducing a search algorithm that systematically explores all  geologically plausible stratigraphic orderings for individual drillholes, combined with a solution correlation algorithm that compares the topological relationships of stratigraphic units across multiple drillholes to identify geologically consistent solutions and reduce uncertainty. The algorithms combine constraints from lithological descriptions with stratigraphic relationships automatically derived from regional maps. In addition, the method quantifies uncertainty by generating multiple plausible stratigraphic interpretations, providing critical insights for resource estimation, scenario analysis, and data acquisition strategies.The application of our method to a dataset of 52 drillholes from South Australia demonstrated its ability to make useful predictions of stratigraphic solutions and quantifying associated uncertainties. These results not only validate our approach but also highlight opportunities to refine current stratigraphic descriptions and provide a valuable new source for regional 3D geological modelling."

Jones,Coastal-Cosmo-Model (CCMv1): a cosmogenic  nuclide model for rocky coastlines,"This paper presents a new modelling framework that reconstructs the history of rocky shores using cosmogenic nuclide data. The model can be applied to both eroding and stable coasts, and allows users to test how factors like cliff retreat, down-wearing and sea-level change have shaped coastal landscapes. It provides a flexible tool for exploring long-term coastal evolution across diverse environments. 
 Understanding the long-term evolution of rocky coasts requires models that can account for complex interactions between exposure, erosion and sea level, constrained by empirical observations. This paper introduces Coastal-Cosmo-Model version 1 (CCMv1), a modular forward modelling framework designed to reconstruct coastal histories from in situ cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. CCMv1 integrates community-standard production rate calculations and allows flexible inversion of platform histories using discrete erosion and exposure parameters. The model includes four sub-models – inheritance, zero erosion, down-wearing only, and cliff retreat with down-wearing – enabling users to test hypotheses of increasing complexity. Crucially, CCMv1 can be applied to both eroding and non-eroding coastlines, offering a means to investigate the dominant controls on rocky shore histories for different settings. A demonstration using a published dataset from shore platform shows that CCMv1 effectively reproduces measured nuclide concentrations and supports a history of Holocene cliff retreat. CCMv1 provides an adaptable and hypothesis-driven framework for exploring rocky shore histories, with potential for future development to incorporate probabilistic optimisation and additional nuclide systems, and implementation for testing complex (multi-stage) erosion histories or relative sea-level histories."

We developed an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network-based framework to interpret concentration-dependent transcriptomics in zebrafish embryos in relation to behavioral outcomes. An annotation of key events (KEs) to zebrafish molecular pathways was curated to enable mapping of zebrafish transcriptomics to the AOP network. Concentration-dependent transcriptomics of 24 environmental chemicals identified concentration-responsive KEs (CRKEs) that differentiated neurotoxic from non-neurotoxic compounds. Transcriptomic points of departure (tPOD) were significantly correlated with behavioral apical POD (aPOD) (R2 = 0.539, P < 0.01), indicating the potential for predicting tPOD from transcriptomics. Time- and concentration-dependent transcriptomics of five model chemicals identified 12 time-responsive KEs (TRKEs) across four developmental stages. Partial least-squares regression integrating neurotoxicity-relevant CRKEs and TRKEs showed the best performance to estimate aPOD (slope = 0.70, R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.9, P = 1.30 × 10–5). External validation using published fish transcriptomics data showed that estimated aPOD values from 8 of 14 chemicals were within 1 order of magnitude of measured aPOD. The findings support AOP network-guided omics analysis as a promising approach for quantitative neurotoxicity assessment, contributing to the use of omics into new approach methodologies (NAMs)."

Siade;Henning Prommer;Haohao Luo;Jing Sun;Chengshuai Liu,Model-Based Multi-Objective Optimization of Heavy Metal Remediation Solutions,"Remediating polluted sites involves complex trade-offs between competing objectives, such as balancing performance with resource expense. Yet, remediation strategies are designed often subjectively, without the guidance of formal optimization methods. Here, we propose a nonsubjective, pragmatic framework that integrates a reactive transport model (RTM) with a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to address this issue. An antimony (Sb)-polluted site was chosen as an illustrative example, and physicochemical treatment and bioremediation techniques were considered. The RTM simulation simulated the fate of Sb, which was validated against site observations. Then, RTM and MOPSO were combined for optimization of four interrelated objectives, including minimizing (1) [Sb]aq within the site, (2) off-site migration, (3) treatment cost, and (4) time. [Sb]aq mitigation was shown to require strategic coordination between efficient but capital-intensive physicochemical intervention on high-risk hotspots and economical but slow bioremediation on low-risk zones, whereas outflux could be curbed by targeting hotspots without overusing resources. Compared with a traditional scalarization approach, our true multiobjective optimization prevented crowded solution distributions and produced a more diverse Pareto front that could best achieve all or selective objectives. This RTM-MOPSO framework is broadly applicable to identifying solutions for heavy metal pollution and navigating the interplay between technical and practical factors."

To address this gap, we developed a mechanistically informed hierarchical framework that quantitatively predicts estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroid (EAT)-disruption activities. The framework consists of three key components: data refinement, fragment-based mechanistic clustering, and cluster-specific quantitative modeling. First, we eliminated 20.12% of false positives and 41.54% of false negatives through a five-step curation, resulting in a high-confidence data set for model development. Next, the predictive model couples a classifier that assigns EAT activity modes with an ensemble regressor for potency estimation. Compared to conventional models, Modeling based on high-confidence data sets and mechanism classification demonstrates improved performance (R2 = 0.72–0.78, RMSE = 0.22–0.48 log10(μM)). Mechanistic insights from molecular simulations across EAT receptors revealed that potent agonists feature aromatic cores with polar substituents, stabilizing hydrogen-bond networks and promoting helix 12 (H12) activation. In contrast, potent antagonists exhibit flexible chains or rigid polycyclic scaffolds that disrupt H12 orientation. Altogether, we offer a next-generation strategy for interpretable and accurate endocrine potency prediction."

In this study, we developed a rapid, in situ, and noninvasive membrane imaging platform based on the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique to probe the evolution of fouling in the reverse osmosis (RO) process. This technique can be used to monitor the formation of the concentration polarization (CP) and the fouling layer without labeling. Our data demonstrate that CP reaches equilibrium within minutes of filtration initiation, whereas fouling is the primary cause of the continuous flux decline during filtration. We further show that the salt concentration is a critical factor influencing the extent of CP and scaling processes, while the presence of organic matter accelerates membrane fouling. This study also clarifies the correlation between the membrane surface impedance variation and flux decline during filtration. Leveraging impedance time-series data, a machine learning-based random forest model was developed for flux change prediction."

While HCO is often proposed as a promising approach for treating real wastewaters, our results reveal that its benefits over ozonation are very case-specific. Wastewaters rich in fulvic/humic-like, surface-active organic compounds, such as membrane concentrate, respond favorably to HCO, showing improved ozone utilization compared to the pure ozonation process. In contrast, coking wastewater shows minimal improvement with HCO compared to pure ozonation, indicating a limited catalytic benefit in such matrices. Similarly, alkaline electroplating wastewaters rich in ozone reactive compounds showed no improvement in organic removal by HCO compared to that of pure ozonation. In contrast, acidic Fenton-treated chemical wastewaters showed significant improvement in organic removal by HCO compared to pure ozonation due to limited hydroxyl radical (HO•) generation via ozone self-decay under these conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that the inherent reactivity of ozone and sustained HO• generation on ozone decay, particularly under alkaline conditions that are typical of many wastewaters, diminish the added value of the catalyst."

However, existing research has paid limited attention to the toxic effects of DXM and its metabolite, DXO, on fish. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to DXM and DXO at concentrations ranging from 100 to 10,000 ng/L for 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to evaluate their impacts on cardiac function and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms using network toxicology and molecular dynamics approaches. Bradycardia was observed at 48 hpf. By 72 hpf, key cardiac morphometric and functional indices, as well as blood flow, exhibited concentration-dependent suppression after exposure to DXM and DXO. Network toxicology analysis revealed that the beta2-adrenergic receptor (adrb2a) was the key common target in cardiomyocyte adrenergic signaling for both compounds. Further observations included significant downregulation of adrb2a, decreased levels of beta2-adrenergic receptor and protein kinase A proteins, and phenotypic rescue after coexposure to adrenaline. The binding energies of DXM and DXO to the beta2-adrenergic receptor were −23.45 and −25.76 kcal/mol, respectively. These findings confirmed that DXM and DXO impaired cardiomyocyte function via suppression of beta2-adrenergic receptor expression, leading to bradycardia. It is worth noting that DXO exhibited stronger cardiac toxicity than its parent compound DXM, and its ecological toxicity warrants special attention and further evaluation."

However, mechanisms governing the dynamic MP–biofilm interactions remain underexplored. A 60-day in situ sediment incubation, coupled with continuous monitoring of MP physicochemical properties and microbial community characteristics, was conducted to elucidate the interactions between biofilms and MPs with different polymer types (poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polypropylene (PP), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)) and preaging experiences. In the early stage, biofilm development was promoted by oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) of MPs, whereas the additive release from PVC suppressed microbial enrichment. Eventually, both the biofilm biomass and extracellular polymeric substances depended strongly on polymer types. Over time, biofilms progressively modified MP surface chemistry, increasing the O/C ratios of PVC, PET, and PP by 0.41, 0.26, and 0.11, respectively, by producing extracellular proteins, especially plastic-degrading enzymes. Therefore, a temporal feedback loop formed in which MP-derived OFGs acted as nutrient sources, reshaping the microbial community structure and selectively enriching plastic-degrading taxa and enzymes, which in turn accelerated MP degradation. This study provides novel insights into the dynamic reciprocal interactions between MP surface chemistry and biofilm communities and advances our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the ecotoxicity and fate of MPs in river sediments."

Using measurements from the third decade of a long-term Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) experiment at Harvard Forest (MA, USA), extending previously published work from 20 years, we examined how litter inputs shape soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry. Elemental analysis, targeted compound analysis, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and microbial biomass and community composition measurements were used. Despite doubled litter inputs over 30 years, no net soil C accumulation occurred, and the SOM decomposition stage was similar to the control, suggesting continuous microbial processing of added inputs. The exclusion of litter, roots, or both led to lower soil C and more advanced SOM decomposition in mineral soils. Shifts in microbial community composition, particularly an increase in Gram (+) to Gram (−) bacteria under exclusion treatments, point to microbial reorganization in response to altered substrate availability. This long-term study underscores the limited potential for long-term soil C sequestration due to sustained microbial decomposition and the role of continuous plant inputs in shaping SOM chemisty  under changing detrital regimes in a temperate forest."

Multiple mixture models revealed significant inverse and nonlinear associations between OP mixtures and OSBs, particularly 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine and o,o′-dityrosine, suggesting a potential low-dose hormetic response and adaptive oxidative stress mechanisms. DMDTP and DEP emerged as key drivers across the models. Collectively, these findings provide integrative evidence linking specific dietary OP sources to systemic oxidative stress in nonoccupational populations, highlighting complex exposure–response dynamics and the need for targeted dietary risk management and biomonitoring."

To fill this gap, we compiled 2769 records of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) spanning two decades and conducted a meta-analysis. The analysis systematically evaluated BAF–BCF disparities and their patterns, identified key drivers, and explored integrating them into species sensitivity distribution (SSD) models to refine WQC. Results showed that BCF were consistently lower than BAF for most PFAS, with disparities increasing with carbon chain length and octanol–water partition coefficient. Further analysis indicated that exposure concentration and trophic level were primary drivers, with concentration effects dominated by endowment effects and trophic effects by coefficient effects. Endowment effects were fixed within a mixed-effects model, and a trophic level–specific BAF/BCF ratio driven by coefficient effects was constructed. This ratio was then incorporated into the SSD framework to refine WQC, resulting in 2.5-fold and 3.2–4.4-fold reductions for PFOA and PFOS, respectively. This study provides the first systematic assessment of PFAS BAF–BCF disparities and integrates them into SSD-based WQC derivation, offering a practical pathway toward more accurate and ecologically relevant WQC for bioaccumulative contaminants."

An Assessment of Dynamic Climate Change Impacts,"Chinese waste incinerators have substantial excess capacity, and it has been suggested that waste from landfills be excavated to increase the energy recovery by using vacant incineration capacity. By means of life cycle assessment (LCA), we assess this suggestion in terms of its climate change impacts. Given the temporal properties of the issue, we used a dynamic LCA approach by specifying emissions and energy recovery for each year over a 100-year period. We then quantified climate change in terms of radiative forcing (W/m2) for each year, in contrast to a traditional LCA approach summarizing emissions and energy recovery over a 100-year period in terms of kg CO2-equivalents. We considered several waste compositions and a range of ages of  landfilled waste. The results of dynamic LCA revealed that for a time horizon of 10–50 years, excavation and incineration of landfilled waste is beneficial only  for reducing the cumulative radiative forcing if the waste is only 2–3 years old. Waste older than 4 years old should, in all cases, remain in the landfill from a climate change point of view. The traditional LCA approach revealed its shortcomings compared with the dynamic LCA approach. Considering technologies with time-distributed emissions and energy recoveries, we warn against indiscriminate use of the traditional approach when decisions are supposed to contribute to reducing climate change impacts to meet political targets set for the next few decades."

This study examines the availability of land, electricity generation, and geologic CO2 storage within the United States, estimating a technical potential for low-temperature, adsorbent-based DACS to remove approximately 9 gigatonnes of CO2 annually. By 2050, a substantial portion of this removal could be achieved at net-removed costs below $300/tonneCO2, though costs are highly variable depending on factors such as facility scale, construction expenses, climate-dependent productivity and heating efficiency, and geologic storage conditions. In the short term, DACS deployment will help identify key research priorities for advancing technology and reducing removal costs. Concurrently, there is an urgent need for scientifically robust and standardized frameworks for monitoring, reporting, and verifying DACS performance across both established and emerging technologies and energy sources."

Although groundwater flow has been shown to influence bacterial chemotaxis, its quantitative influence on intrinsic motility parameters governing chemotactic strategies remains unresolved. Using a T-shaped microfluidic device, mimicking a NAPL droplet trapped within a pore throat, we show that chemotactic bacteria exhibited greater retention near the NAPL interface at low fluid velocities (0.5 m/d and 1 m/d; corresponding wall shear rates of 0.58 and 1.16 s–1, respectively), while both population density and accumulating area declined at higher velocities. Continuum-level simulations of bacterial transport indicated a reduction in the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χo by an order of magnitude at flow velocities above 5 m/d (5.78 s–1). Trajectory analysis of bacteria from videomicroscopy revealed increasing alignment of bacterial motion with the flow direction as the fluid velocity increased. We conducted agent-based model simulations to further demonstrate that flow-induced suppression of reversal frequency reduced chemotactic efficiency in Pseudomonas putida. This work demonstrated a framework that integrates experimental and modeling approaches at both population and individual scales to investigate mechanisms underlying bacterial transport phenomena."

Cardiotoxicity caused by DLCs has been well-characterized within the framework of an adverse outcome pathway, demonstrating consistent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation as the molecular initiating event. However, the downstream key events (KEs) contributing to PHCZ-induced cardiotoxicity have been less characterized. Herein, PHCZ-induced cardiotoxicity was evaluated by in vivo (Sprague–Dawley rats) and in vitro (rat cardiomyocytes) models, and the underlying mechanisms were confirmed using rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells). As a model PHCZ, 2,7-dibromocarbazole (2,7-DBCZ) induced significant rat cardiac tissue apoptosis following exposure to 100 μg/kg/d via intragastric infusion. In addition, 2,7-DBCZ also induced apoptosis and suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential in H9c2 cells (at 10–5 M). CD40LG promotes apoptosis and inhibits cell growth through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, and ANXA5 plays a vital role in apoptosis by possessing Ca2+ channel activity. Apoptosis-focused PCR array and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis further indicated CD40LG and ANXA5 as upstream regulators for 2,7-DBCZ-induced apoptosis. 2,7-DBCZ increased Akt phosphorylation and intercellular Ca2+ levels, which were reversed by pretreatment with an Akt agonist and a Ca2+ inhibitor. Silencing of Ppp2ca further confirmed Ca2+ as a key intercellular messenger in regulating induced apoptosis. Finally, rat cardiac tissue and H9c2 cell gene profiles and AhR antagonist cotreatment demonstrated that CD40LG and ANXA5 are potential downstream KEs in regulating 2,7-DBCZ-induced cardiotoxicity, as they exhibited the same transcription patterns with the AhR activation indicators CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. These findings offer crucial new insight into the mechanisms underlying PHCZ-induced cardiotoxicity, providing valuable mode of action data that can be used in the Weight of Evidence components of risk assessments and regulation decisions regarding these emerging contaminants."

This study presents an integrated, reproducible framework that aligns literature-derived signals with molecular structure and regulatory hazard dimensions within a persistence, bioaccumulation, mobility, and toxicity (PBMT) lens. A task-tuned large language model extracted 21,277 mentions from 9,557 publications; harmonization across CompTox, PubChem, and Wikipedia yielded 1,081 unique candidates with 94.6% name consistency against 17 inventories. The landscape shows abundant toxicity information but limited mobility data. Structure profiling identified a recurring motif─an aromatic core with branched alkyl substituents and oxygenated groups─and directional associations with composite hazard (positive for halogenation and negative for several oxygenated groups). To extend pathway inference to list-naïve chemicals, AutoGluon models trained on Tox21/ToxCast were applied to 49 additional candidates. This produced end-point-level predictions concentrated at the protein-function level (receptors, enzymes, transcription factors), which is operationally useful for prioritization. Combining model scores with PBMT evidence density yielded an auditable prioritization, highlighting where mobility measurements and focused assays would most increase confidence. The framework links textual, structural, regulatory, and predictive streams to enable rapid screening, targeted data acquisition, safer substitution, and adaptive regulatory updating."

Thermoelastic modeling of our results and literature data along a representative areotherm showed that Vp and Vs of FeO‐bearing ringwoodite are approximately 7.5% and 11.0% higher than that of the majorite. Our results reveal that velocity profiles of these Martian deep‐mantle minerals are more sensitive to variations in the ringwoodite/majorite (Mg/Si) ratio than to thermal and FeO chemical perturbations. Our best‐fit velocity model to a recent seismic model by Samuel et al.

Three hundred eighty‐two teleseismic direct‐P phases are analyzed using a time‐domain waveform matching method and a 2‐D relative attenuation map is inverted by applying a Hierarchical Bayesian method. Strong attenuation is observed beneath Jingpohu volcano. The estimated asthenospheric Qp is abnormally low (Qp < 70), indicating a high‐temperature (∼1500°C) asthenosphere containing plausible partial melting (>4%) underneath Jingpohu volcano, presumably induced by hot mantle upwelling. Meanwhile, the hot asthenosphere could induce the melting of the bottom of the lithospheric mantle, and we infer that this lithospheric melting combined with the ascending asthenospheric melt may feed the Jingpohu volcanism, explaining the mixed‐source geochemical signature."

Here, we examine the scaling between averaged stress drops and increasing normal stress for simulated earthquake sequences in continuum rate‐and‐state fault models. The models produce a weaker dependence of stress drop on normal stress than the linearity of simple friction, which can be well‐fit by a sublinear power‐law. This result is more prominent when the fault dimension is much larger than nucleation scales. In such cases, the averaged behavior of ruptures is dominated by rupture propagation conditions, reflecting more heterogeneous shear stress conditions. As natural faults can be considerably larger than the smallest earthquakes they host, such a weaker scaling between averaged rupture conditions and normal stress may partially explain the lack of an inferred depth‐dependence of earthquake stress drops."

However, previous studies assumed a flat aquifer base, and it is unclear how a sloping aquifer base would affect the subsurface flow and salinity distributions. In reality, the bases of many coastal aquifers are inclined toward either the sea or the inland. This study presents numerical simulations that examine the subsurface hydrodynamics in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers. The results show that, when the aquifer base is seaward sloping, the salt‐freshwater mixing zone is wider and the seawater intrusion distance is longer. Also, a seaward base slope reduces/increases the percentagewise contribution of tide‐/density‐driven recirculation to the total submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), extends the transport pathway and transit times of particles. While a landward aquifer base reverses these trends. These findings may assist more accurate estimation of total SGD and strategies for mitigating marine contamination."

Using a 1D mass‐transport model, we resolve a SPR of 2.4 ± 0.4 m/Ma, which is consistent with independent estimates by U‐series and 10Be dating. Set by inherent α‐recoil processes, uranium comminution ages do not rely on environmental conditions (e.g., lithology and soil thickness) that present challenges to conventional tools such as 10Be.

Terrestrial time‐lapse gravimetry (TLG) is a geophysical and geodetic technique whose measured variable (g $g$) varies directly with groundwater storage changes (GWSC). TLG is thus well suited to applications in alpine environments, which often lack subsurface monitoring infrastructure. Here, we use TLG to measure GWSC in an alpine headwater catchment over snow‐free and snow accumulation/melt periods. We compare absolute‐referenced Δg ${\Delta }g$ measurements with locally referenced (relative) ones and investigate the advantages of mobile surveys using the most recent generation of relative gravimeters.

We aimed to produce a skillful, nationwide WNND forecast built upon regionally varying relationships between climate factors and WNND. After examining the relationships between climate conditions and annual WNND caseload for 11 regions in the U.S., we incorporated the most salient climate factors—most commonly drought and temperature—into a regionally determined nationwide WNND statistical forecast model using a Bayesian regression framework. We retrospectively generated forecasts from 2005 to 2022 and compared forecast skill against various benchmarks, including a simple, historical case‐driven model. Our regional, climate‐informed WNND retrospective forecasts outperformed a benchmark model only informed by historical WNND case data across all regions, as well as in a nationally aggregated score (univariable: 18.8% [4.7%–27.7%], bivariable: 21.8% [7.0%–30.7%] improvement). The regional forecasts also outperformed an ensemble model generated from a recent WNV forecasting competition and a parallel, county‐level, regional climate‐informed forecast outperformed forecasts from the same competition. Importantly, our approach to WNND forecast development aggregated county‐level data to broader regions to boost statistical signal and capture the regionally varying influences of climate conditions on annual WNND caseload.

Using automated whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we demonstrate that gating in TWIK-2 is voltage-dependent and insensitive to changes in the extracellular pH. We identify key residues that influence TWIK-2 activity by employing site-directed mutagenesis and provide insights into the possible lipid-mediated mechanism of TWIK-2 regulation. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of high-throughput automated whole-cell patch clamp platforms to screen small molecule modulators of TWIK-2. Our work serves as a foundation for designing high-throughput small molecule screening campaigns to identify specific high-affinity TWIK-2 modulators, including promising- anti-inflammatory therapeutics. TWIK-2 is an endolysosomal potassium channel implicated in inflammatory responses. Here, authors present a cryo-EM structure of human TWIK-2 and establish a high-throughput automated patch-clamp electrophysiology assay to investigate modulation of TWIK-2."

Ectopic cambia arise from cortical cells and repurpose conserved cambium regulators, including KNOX genes. 
 Secondary vascular growth is a conserved mechanism that gives rise to vascular tissues produced via a single vascular cambium. Molecular mechanisms underlying this process are characterized mainly in model species with typical vascular architectures, while the genetics underlying ecologically-important atypical vascular architectures remain unexplored. We use developmental anatomy, comparative transcriptomics, molecular evolutionary analyses, and heterologous gene expression to address this knowledge gap, investigating how multiple ectopic cambia (EC) form in the woody vine Japanese wisteria. Anatomical studies show EC in Japanese wisteria arise from cortical parenchyma, and cambium-specific transcriptome comparisons reveal that genes acting as regulators of typical cambium development in model species are likewise associated with EC development. Gene trees of KNOX genes suggest that duplication events may contribute to EC formation, including a Fabaceae-specific duplication of KNAT2/6, which is detected as being under positive selection. We also demonstrate that KNOX genes from Japanese wisteria show canonical KNOX-like activity in heterologous functional assays, although no vascular aberrations were observed. Overall, these findings provide the first insights into the genetics of EC formation in “natural variants”, advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating vascular variants in seed plants.

Here, the authors report a chemical vapour deposition method to grow cm-scale rhombohedral-stacked WS2/MoS2 crystals with ferroelectric properties. 
 Vertical van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), formed through layer-by-layer stacking of two-dimensional materials, offer appealing opportunities for exploring novel physics and potential applications. However, the conventional approach of mechanical exfoliation followed by manual stacking faces significant challenges in achieving atomically clean interfaces and large size, severely limiting practical applications. Here, we proposed a comprehensive mechanism governing nucleation, orientation and stack control of vertical vdWHs during chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and demonstrated the layer-by-layer epitaxial growth of 1 cm × 1 cm sized single-crystal, rhombohedral-stacked WS2/MoS2 films. First-principles calculations reveal that sulphur (S) vacancies in the underlying MoS2 layer preferentially form at step edges. These S vacancies serve as nucleation sites for the upper WS2 layer and enhance symmetry breaking between rhombohedral- and hexagonal-stacked WS2/MoS2. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieved unidirectionally aligned WS2 islands on MoS2 substrate that seamlessly coalesce into continuous single-crystal WS2/MoS2 films. Systematic characterizations confirmed the single-crystal nature and rhombohedral-stacked configuration, while revealing the ferroelectric properties and self-driven photoelectric response in the resulting heterostructures. Our work establishes a fundamental mechanism for controlled growth of single-crystal vertical heterostructures, providing a robust foundation for scalable manufacturing and future industrial applications.

Here, the authors introduce a supercharging-enhanced nDIA-MS workflow to map drug-induced solubility changes across the proteome, enabling high-throughput analysis of protein state transitions. 
 Mass spectrometry (MS) is indispensable for high-throughput quantitation of protein expression. But protein function is regulated by factors beyond abundance alone. Here, we evaluate two supercharging reagents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (mNBA), in narrow-window data-independent acquisition (nDIA)-MS. DMSO markedly enhances MS signal and protein identification, whereas mNBA primarily increases peptide identifications. Optimizating nDIA-MS with 3% DMSO boosts signal intensity by up to 56%, enabling identification of ~9,600 proteins from 1 µg HeLa digest in 15 min. Using this methodology, we quantify solubility and abundance changes in 8,694 proteins across three cell lines following short-term treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the SUMO-activating enzyme inhibitor ML-792. MG132 affects the solubility of 1,723 proteins and the abundance of 374, and ML-792 affects 1,294 and 288, respectively. The drugs elicit distinct and sometimes opposing solubility shifts; for instance, MG132 insolubilizes HSF1, ML-792 solubilizes SP100 and insolubilizes PLOR3G, and SMAD2 shows opposite responses to those two treatments. These results reveal widespread, drug-induced remodeling of the protein solubility landscape and establish solubility profiling by nDIA-MS as a broadly applicable platform for uncovering protein state transitions and cellular responses to perturbation.

 OSCA/TMEM63 mechanosensitive ion channels play critical physiological roles in plants and animals. These channels bear structural homology to the dual functional TMEM16 family, and OSCA1.2 was recently shown to form a lipid-lined ion conduction pathway in the open state. This raised the question of whether members of the OSCA/TMEM63 family may also function as mechanically activated lipid scramblases. Using a combination of in vitro and cellular assays with computational techniques, we show that phospholipids can be translocated through the open pores of OSCA1.1/1.2/2.2 and TMEM63A/B proteins, suggesting a dual ion channel and lipid scramblase function for members of this protein family. We characterize the effects of mutating key groove lining residues demonstrating that different residues form bottlenecks for lipids and ions respectively and show that cholesterol inhibits lipid scrambling by stabilizing the closed state and slowing translocation through the open pore. We show that lipid scrambling in TMEM63 proteins can be activated by mechanical forces in the membrane, making these mechanically activated lipid scramblases. Finally, we demonstrate that this activity is important for the mechanically induced morphological remodeling of biological membranes and the resilience of cells to high mechanical forces.

Multimodel analysis reveals conflicts between biodiversity and CDR that are distributed unevenly, and shows that synergies are crucial to meet climate and conservation goals. 
 Pathways consistent with global climate objectives typically deploy billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from land-intensive methods such as forestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Such large-scale deployment of land-intensive CDR may have negative consequences for biodiversity. Here we assess scenarios across five integrated assessment models and show that scenarios consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 °C allocate up to 13% of global areas of high biodiversity importance for land-intensive CDR. These overlaps are distributed unevenly, with higher shares in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the potential conflicts between climate action and biodiversity conservation is crucial. An illustrative analysis shows that if current biodiversity hotspots were protected from land-use change, over half the land allocated for forestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage in the assessed scenarios would be unavailable unless synergies between climate and conservation goals are leveraged. Our analysis also indicates CDR-related biodiversity benefits due to avoided warming.

 Earth system models, or simulators, are foundational for projecting climate change impacts, but their computational expense limits the number and diversity of simulations available. Machine learning-based emulators, statistical surrogates trained on simulator outputs, can replicate components of climate models at orders-of-magnitude lower cost, enabling ensembles and interpolation across scenarios. We argue that the next phase of climate modeling hinges on closer collaboration between simulator and emulator communities. We outline three priorities: (1) co-design of simulators and emulators so that experimental design, diagnostics, and data products support training, evaluation, and targeted simulation; (2) shared, machine learning-ready benchmarks with data partitions and metrics that emphasize physical fidelity; and (3) treating emulators as reliable software components with interfaces, documentation, and deployment pathways for sensitivity analyses, scenario exploration, and uncertainty decomposition.

Using a sensitized background in which the cohesin unloader WAPL is partially degraded, we screened the druggable genome for effects on cohesin clustering. Through multiple rounds of screening and experimentation, we identified 7 enhancers and 10 suppressors of cohesin clustering. Several factors control genome folding at multiple loci and cohesin loading.

This includes fruit flies and larvae, usually not known as “social insects.” Using aDrosophilalarva assay with reduced stimulation, we found that groups show enhanced dispersal and distance from each other in the absence of food. This social context–dependent modulation overrides responses to many external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available inDrosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for social context modulation. Our results show that even less social animals such as fly larvae are affected by conspecifics and recognize each other through multimodal sensory cues.

While benign, these tumors can cause substantial morbidity, and effective pharmacological treatments remain limited. Here, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak/Ptk2) impairs tumor formation and preserves hearing in a murine model of NF2.

Pharmacological inhibition of FAK with single agent VS-4718 did not significantly reduce macroscopic tumor volume; however, its use in combination with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib resulted in both a significant reduction in tumor volume and the preservation of dorsal root ganglion architecture.

Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key regulator, although its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA signaling and behavior remains unclear. Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drug-induced reinforcement. These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more integrated model in which vagus-mediated interoceptive signals intrinsically shape motivation and reinforcement.

Here, using a pharmacological activator and targeted deletion of PKM2 in T cells, we delineated distinct functions of PKM1 and PKM2 in regulating CD4 T cell survival during homeostasis and expansion. Expanding PKM2-deficient CD4 T cells increased PKM1 expression with associated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–mediated cell death. Examination of T cell compartments revealed that PKM2-deficient CD4 T cells were unaltered in the thymus but were significantly reduced in peripheral tissues as mice aged. The inability of PKM1 to protect CD4 T cells in the absence of PKM2 led to less severe T cell–mediated colitis as PKM2-deficient pathogenic cells were significantly reduced compared with control cells. This study shows that PKM2 is critical for CD4 T cell survival during expansion and homeostasis."

These oligosaccharides maintain a consistent composition of 75% mannose and 25% galactose, mirroring the key structural features of natural galactomannan. Notably, the library includes five tetrasaccharides and four octasaccharides, exhibiting all possible frameshift patterns ofA. cinnamomeagalactomannan, offering valuable materials for structure-activity relationship studies to explore the role of linking modes and domain effect. The synthesis of this library was achieved through a highly effective stereoselective α-galactosylation approach. Immunological evaluations revealed that octasaccharide4and its two subunit tetrasaccharides7and10exhibited potent immunoregulatory activities, demonstrating a notable domain effect. Preliminary mechanistic studies unveiled that these oligosaccharides exert their effects by suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In addition, octasaccharide4uniquely attenuated nuclear factor κB pathway, highlighting its compound-specific mechanism and demonstrating a 1 + 1 > 2 effect."

However, the mechanisms underlying this synchronized relationship remain unclear. Here, we present a high-resolution reconstruction of Miocene benthic foraminiferal boron-to-calcium ratios, revealing that eccentricity-paced fluctuations in deep-sea carbonate ion saturation covaried with oxygen and carbon isotopes, as well as with pelagic carbonate deposition. Integrating model results, we propose that orbital configurations and elevated temperatures during eccentricity maxima intensified monsoon rainfall and chemical weathering, enhancing the transport of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity from land to sea. These processes further redistributed massive carbonate burial from deep-ocean basins to continental shelves, lowering carbonate ion concentration and the carbon isotopic composition of seawater. Our findings underscore the crucial role of the low-latitude hydrological cycle in regulating carbon-cycle dynamics under warm climatic conditions."

The intracranial location limits serial biopsies and only provides an intermittent view of the tumor molecular profile from the initial resection. Liquid biopsy techniques, specifically small extracellular vesicle (sEV) analysis, have the potential to overcome these limitations by providing a window into the brain using peripheral blood. To address the need for monitoring tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance, we developed a GBM biomarker panel (ATPase subunit beta-2, excitatory amino acid transporter 2, CD24, CD44, CD133, and epidermal growth factor receptor) for multiplexed profiling of sEVs using an advanced GBM Extracellular Vesicle Monitoring Phenotypic Analyzer Chip.

This makes them far more vulnerable to noise than classical signals, limiting their out-of-lab deployment. We demonstrate quantum coherent energy redistribution, which not only recovers entangled states buried in noise but also improves their properties, moving toward noise-robust architectures with better deployability. Using standard telecommunications infrastructure, we show an order of magnitude increase in the coincidence-to-accidental ratio for time-bin entangled photon pairs.

We investigate whether the translocator protein standardized uptake value ratio (TSPO SUVr), a quantifiable marker of neuroinflammation using positron emission tomography (PET), is elevated in the brains of patients with post–COVID-19 active TLE. In addition, we examine correlations between TSPO SUVr and inflammatory factors to identify potential peripheral blood inflammatory predictors of post–COVID-19 active epilepsy. Our study highlights the presence of widespread neuroinflammation in the brain and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of individuals with post–COVID-19 active TLE. Furthermore, strong correlations between plasma levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-10, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and neuroimmune activation suggest the potential for integrating plasma inflammatory factors with TSPO PET as a dependable approach for clinical diagnosis, dynamic monitoring, and assessment of immune-based therapeutic efficacy in TLE-associated neuroinflammation."

Silver (Ag), a core yet nonrenewable material in silicon solar panels, faces increasing scarcity with the surge in solar panel production and end-of-life (EoL) volume. We report a synergistic oxidative-coordination strategy for efficient silver recovery from EoL panels. This approach eliminates the use of toxic mineral acids and minimizes secondary pollution by harnessing the strong oxidative potential of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in combination with the coordination ability of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Notably, the in situ formation of Ag–Ag2O heterostructures during oxidation promotes enhanced ·OH generation, thereby accelerating silver dissolution. Using this method, complete silver leaching is achieved within 60 min, while closed-loop regeneration of EDTA2– is enabled through chloride-induced precipitation. Life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis revealed significant reductions in energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption compared with conventional methods, alongside nearly 126% greater process profitability. This work establishes a sustainable and industrially viable Ag recovery pathway, addressing critical bottlenecks in EoL silicon solar panel waste management."

Here, we employed the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem, a dynamic host-free in vitro model, to investigate how intestinally retained poly(ethylene terephthalate) MPs influence gut microbial communities. We show that MP retention is associated with two separable processes: surface-mediated spatial redistribution of microbes and additive-associated perturbations. Compared with additive-eluted MPs and inert SiO2 particles, MPs exhibited greater surface roughness and hydrophobicity, promoting selective colonization by hydrophobic, potentially pathogenic, and organic-degrading taxa. This surface-associated colonization coincided with the displacement of luminal keystone taxa and pronounced restructuring of microbial co-occurrence networks, reflected by reduced negative cohesion and altered community stability. In parallel, leachable MP-associated additives independently shifted microbial composition and predicted functional potential, including enrichment of pathways related to xenobiotic degradation. This work provides mechanistic insight into how retained MPs may condition gut microbial ecosystems and underscores the importance of considering MP-associated microbial perturbations in gut-relevant exposure assessments."

Here, virgin polystyrene (PS-0) and 45-day photoaged polystyrene (PS-45) were evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations (0–100 μg/L) to assess aging-related effects and molecular pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans. Photoaging markedly altered PS physicochemical properties, including surface morphology, crystallinity, and functional groups. Exposure to 100 μg/L PS-0 or PS-45 significantly shortened lifespan, impaired physiological behaviors, and increased lipofuscin accumulation, whereas PS-45 at 10–100 μg/L elicited substantially stronger pro-aging effects. These enhanced toxicities were driven by particle-associated processes, particularly elevated environmentally persistent free radical generation and increased particle accumulation in nematodes. Mechanistically, PS-45 inhibited DAF-16 nuclear translocation and dysregulated insulin/IGF-1 signaling genes (daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, and daf-16). Concurrently, PS-45 induced ferroptosis, as evidenced by increased Fe2+ and malondialdehyde levels, glutathione depletion, and suppression of ftn-1; these effects were alleviated by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. Mutations in daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, daf-16, and ftn-1 significantly altered PS-45-induced aging phenotypes and ferroptotic stress, identifying the DAF-2–AGE-1–PDK-1–AKT–DAF-16–FTN-1 axis as a central regulatory pathway.  Collectively, this study reveals a mechanistic link between insulin signaling and ferroptosis in MPs-induced aging and highlights the elevated environmental health risks posed by photoaged MPs."

In this study, we introduce and demonstrate a new surface-milling approach to improve the FIB-SEM imaging of RO membranes. We develop a bilayer conductive Pt coating topped with a protective carbon deposit; this approach avoids the need to cryo-fracture the membranes, which overcomes drawbacks associated with TEM and conventional FIB-SEM cross-sectional milling (e.g., curtaining and polymer melting). Applied to a commercial RO membrane, the method enabled robust quantification of key structural features and clear visualization of void spaces within the ridge-and-valley structure of the selective layer and pores in the uppermost portion of the support layer. The bilayer platinum coating enhances the delineation of the upper boundary of the selective layer, enabling rapid and accurate identification. With a field of view more than 20 times larger than TEM, FIB-SEM imaging captures a substantially greater cross-sectional area, yielding more representative measurements."

However, previous biogeochemical reconstructions focused mostly on primary productivity, overlooking changes in community structure (e.g., ratio of primary producers to consumers). In this study, we investigate the late Quaternary history of planktonic trophic structure in the western equatorial Pacific by generating sedimentary amino acid δ15N record of Site MD10‐3340. Our results demonstrate well‐preserved amino acid δ15N signatures. Using the δ15N gradients between trophic and source amino acids, we calculate the average sedimentary trophic position and design an idealized ecosystem model to quasi‐quantitively estimate changes in grazing proportion (the proportion of primary production consumed by zooplanktons). Notably, lower trophic position and smaller grazing proportion point to a decline of zooplankton grazing during precession maxima, which is primarily attributed to enhanced nutrient availability in the western equatorial Pacific during El Niño‐like mean‐states. Moreover, average grazing proportion is slightly lower during Interglacial warmth than the last glacial period, implying a secondary control of sea level change. Furthermore, our ocean‐biogeochemical simulations show that a halved grazing proportion could cause pronounced decrease in Pacific carbon storage and a remarkable increase in atmospheric pCO2, due to a shallower remineralization depth. We thus highlight the necessity to incorporate varying marine grazing proportions into future proxy reconstructions and model simulations to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the BCP."

We address this knowledge gap via two reduced‐scale physical delta experiments: one with constant discharge and the other with variable discharge. Floods with a peak discharge equal to three times the baseflow reduce the mean total delta‐top area by a factor of two and a half and increase slopes by a factor of two. Enhanced channel mobility increases delta top slopes and limits large‐scale shoreline movement, which reduce wetland planform. There is a 108% difference in the volume of preserved organic material in the subsurface between the variable and constant discharge conditions. Morphometric differences between systems constructed under constant versus variable discharge highlight the potential impact on ecologically sensitive and economically important coastal wetlands, with implications for the ability to sequester carbon."

The most likely cause of this truncation is that although the shallow faults in this area are many km in length, they are structurally constrained and have limited down‐dip widths, typically no more than approximately 1 km. Ruptures on faults of such limited width are not expected to attain high aspect ratios. As such, the ruptures on such faults would be limited to dimensions of roughly 1 km2, which corresponds to magnitudes which closely match the observed MMAX truncation. The MMAX truncation for induced earthquakes in the southern Delaware Basin has significant implications since it implies that down‐dip fault widths may play an important role in constraining the maximum magnitudes of induced events."

This approach avoids the need to condition future Earth System Model projections on storyline‐based climate scenarios and provides information that can be probabilistically interpreted directly for arbitrary climate metrics including regional climate impact drivers.

 Understanding how the human brain encodes visual objects involves deciphering the neural computations and circuits in the temporal lobe. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from the human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL), as well as single-neuron activity in the MTL, to investigate the computational mechanisms of neural object coding. The VTC exhibited axis-based feature coding, and a neural feature space could be constructed using VTC neural axes, within which visual objects clustered according to high-level categorical relationships. Importantly, MTL neurons encoded receptive fields within this VTC neural feature space, exhibiting selective responses to objects that shared perceptual and conceptual similarities. This computational framework, therefore, explains how dense, feature-based representations in the VTC are transformed into sparse, high-level representations in the MTL. We further validated our findings using an additional dataset with different stimuli. Notably, we uncovered the physiological basis of this computational framework by demonstrating VTC-MTL interactions at multiple levels. Together, our neural computational framework provides a mechanistic understanding of the neural processes underlying object recognition. How the human brain transforms visual input into meaningful object representations remains unclear.

 Heterotopic ossification (HO), the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues, is a debilitating complication that occurs after severe burns, trauma, and joint replacement surgery. Current diagnostic methods detect HO only after substantial progression, limiting opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we show that circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells (cMPCs), isolated using a microfluidic iChip from patients undergoing hip replacement and a mouse model of traumatic HO, exhibit HO-associated gene expression as early as 6 hours post-injury—41 days before radiographic detection. RNA sequencing of cMPCs enabled development of a liquid biopsy-based HO risk prediction model, achieving up to 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity in human subjects. Furthermore, the model detected significant reductions in HO risk following prophylactic treatment, correlating with decreased HO volume. These findings establish a noninvasive platform for early detection and monitoring of HO and suggest broader utility for diseases involving aberrant mesenchymal cell fate. This approach enables high-throughput screening of at-risk patients and real-time assessment of therapeutic efficacy.

The authors show that anionic electrons act as lattice sites to create this rare electronic structure. 
 Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at EF in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]2+: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The near-EF electronic structure observed in ARPES, which consists of the flat bands and other dispersive band features, find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations and is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems. Using ARPES, this work identifies dice-lattice flat bands in the electride material YCl. The authors show that anionic electrons act as lattice sites to create this rare electronic structure."

Here, the authors report a multicomponent synergistic approach integrating in-situ and dynamic exchange methods to construct hierarchical biopharmaceutical formulations. 
 Hierarchical immobilization of multicomponent biomacromolecules has been demonstrated to be a favorable protocol for constructing advanced biopharmaceuticals, but still with formidable challenges. Herein, we innovate a multicomponent synergistic immobilization approach combining an in-situ method with a structural-transformation-promoted dynamic exchange method in a flexible zeolitic pyrimidine framework (ZPF) platform to construct multicomponent biopharmaceuticals. In-depth mechanism investigation reveals that special functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, sulfhydryl, imidazolyl) on protein surface can significantly promote the dynamic structural transformation of ZPF and allow for the efficient immobilization of proteins on the surface of ZPF crystals via dynamic exchange approach. By combining with the in-situ method, which can immobilize biomacromolecules in the inner part of ZPF crystals, multicomponent biomacromolecules can be regionally localized within ZPF crystals. This controlled spatial preparation provides substantial advantages over conventional core-shell architectures for cascading enzyme immobilization and enables the development of advanced anticancer agents demonstrating enhanced therapeutic efficacy for female Balb/c nu mice. Moreover, this platform can also generate highly efficient hierarchical antibacterial formulations to significantly enhance the wound-healing process of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This study provides a revolution to immobilize multicomponent biomacromolecules and represents an innovative and effective platform of biopharmaceuticals with immense potential for anticancer and antibacterial formulations.

Here, we demonstrate room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in mechanically exfoliated crystals of the quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper iodide perovskite (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 in an open optical microcavity. We observe a polariton condensation threshold of 0.41 µJ cm−2 per pulse and detect a strong non-linear response. Interferometric measurements confirm the spontaneous emergence of spatial coherence across the condensate with an associated first-order autocorrelation reaching 0.6 with 1 ps coherence time and an effective de Broglie wavelength of 13 µm. Our results lay the foundation for a new class of room-temperature polariton lasers based on quasi-2D halide perovskites with great potential for hetero-integration with other van-der-Waals materials and combination with photonic crystals or waveguides. The authors report the experimental observation of room-temperature condensation of exciton polaritons in quasi-2D layered crystals of halide perovskite, integrated into an open optical microcavity. These materials combine van-der-Waals properties with dominant exciton physics at room temperature."

 Cells regulate processes through protein interaction networks. Most chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems respond to exogenous molecules, limiting integration with endogenous signaling. Here, we repurpose nuclear receptor (NR) ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and coactivators to develop hormone- or clinically approved drug-responsive CIDs. Using the LBDs of TRβ, VDR, RARγ, ERβ, and GR2 with a TIF2 coactivator peptide, we constructed CIDs responsive to triiodothyronine, vitamin D, retinoic acid, estrogen, cortisol, and their antagonists. These CIDs enable two-input transcriptional switches for gene regulation. Furthermore, we design hormone-responsive liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) condensates that strongly amplify transcription when exceeding a critical interaction threshold. These functional LLPS condensates provide a tunable platform for transcriptional control with up to several hundred-fold activation. Our findings offer an approach for integrating synthetic biology with physiological signaling, advancing applications in gene circuits, biosensing, and therapeutics through ligand-controlled LLPS formation.

Beyond substitution, demand reduction and circularity are key to mitigating both impacts. 
 Plastics are a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, with packaging accounting for around 40% of European plastic production. Bio-based plastics are often promoted as a climate-friendly alternative, yet their broader environmental implications remain unclear. Here, we conduct a harmonized life cycle assessment of fossil- and bio-based plastic packaging, integrating end-of-life fate and plastic leakage. We find that while bio-based plastics reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they increase ecosystem damage, primarily driven by land use. At the product level, outcomes are sensitive to feedstock origin and waste management. When mismanaged, environmentally persistent bio-based plastics contribute substantially to ecosystem damage. Scaling scenarios for Europe show that even complete substitution with bio-based plastics cannot offset the environmental burden of continued demand growth. Only strong demand-side measures, particularly demand reduction and improved circularity, can mitigate trade-offs across climate change and biodiversity, calling for a shift from material substitution to systemic interventions in production and consumption.

 Stable isotopes are widely used to investigate plant-water interactions, yet many studies report differences in deuterium (δ2H) ratios between plants and source waters (termed δ2H offsets). These δ2H offsets challenge the assumption that water uptake and transport in plants do not alter the isotopic composition of water. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes three soil water pools and two plant water pools based on water potential. We synthesize data from 110 published studies across 212 field sites worldwide and reanalyze 6333 δ2H offset measurements using possible source water lines. We find that δ2H offsets are absent when using appropriate water pools (e.g., use sap flow water rather than bulk xylem tissue water to represent plant water), with mean offsets not statistically different from zero. We argue that accurately separating correct water pools from bulk water pools in soils and plants is key to reconciling the observed δ2H offsets.

 Ecological systems often exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics like oscillations, chaos, and regime shifts. Universal dynamic equations have shown promise in modeling complex dynamics by combining known functional forms with neural networks that represent unknown relationships. However, these methods do not yet accommodate the forms of uncertainty common to ecological datasets. To address this limitation, we developed state-space universal dynamic equations by combining universal difference and differential equations with a state-space modeling framework, accounting for uncertainty. We tested this framework on three simulated and two empirical case studies and found that this method can recover nonlinear biological interactions that produce complex behaviors including chaos and regime shifts. Their forecasting performance is context-dependent, with the best performance on chaotic and oscillating time series. This innovative approach leveraging both ecological theory and data-driven machine learning offers a promising new way to make accurate and useful predictions of ecosystem change.

 Balancing ecosystem service provision with long-term ecosystem stability remains a critical challenge for sustainable land management. Here, we develop a spatial planning framework that integrates ecological resilience—the capacity of an ecosystem to recover from perturbations—with ecosystem services to identify priority areas for ecological restoration. Applying this framework to the Loess Plateau of China, we evaluate three management strategies—Service Priority, Balanced Priority, and Resilience Priority—to delineate restoration priorities. Our results indicate that ecosystem services have generally improved from 2000 to 2020, while resilience exhibits a turning point, shifting from an increasing to a declining trend. Spatial overlay analyses further show that areas with enhanced ecosystem service supply coincide with declining resilience, indicating a spatial mismatch between service gains and resilience loss. The three prioritization scenarios produce distinct spatial patterns, highlighting the importance of balanced strategies that reconcile short-term service gains with long-term ecosystem resilience to inform sustainable restoration and land management. Areas with increasing ecosystem service supply from 2000 to 2020 spatially overlap with declining resilience in the Loess Plateau, revealing mismatches between service gains and resilience losses, based on a multi-scenario spatial prioritization framework."

 Terrace construction is a crucial human intervention for improving slope productivity and preventing soil erosion, especially in low-latitude hilly regions with heavy and concentrated rainfall. However, existing terrace mapping methods perform poorly in such areas. In this study, we generated the first high-resolution (0.9 m) terrace distribution map for low-latitude hilly regions by integrating deep learning with slope-area threshold denoising. Using Guangdong Province as a case study, we combined Google Earth imagery, SRTM DEM, and Global 10-m land-cover data. The results showed that the optimal 0.9 m resolution achieved 93.34 % overall accuracy (OA), 79.18 % F1-score, and 65.53 % intersection over union (IoU) on our Guangdong terrace dataset, processing 400 km2 in 89 min, showing an excellent accuracy–speed trade-off.

In this study, an ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]), was introduced to regulate the interfacial polymerization between hydrazine (Hz) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC). This approach successfully fabricated an Hz-based polyamide RO membrane with superior structural characteristics and a significant antifouling performance. Compared to conventional polyamide membranes prepared with m-phenylenediamine, the Hz monomer, featuring a linear molecular structure and higher reactivity, generated a smoother and more hydrophilic membrane surface. Meanwhile, the IL effectively retarded the diffusion of Hz through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, achieving a more controllable polymerization process and, thereby, the formation of an ultrathin selective layer with low surface roughness and narrow pore size distribution. The resulting membrane exhibited significantly enhanced water permeability while maintaining an excellent salt rejection. Due to both favorable surface properties and uniform microstructure, the membrane exhibited universal resistance to various types of organic foulants, such as surfactants with opposite charges, demonstrated by minimal flux decline during fouling and high permeability recovery after simple cleaning. This membrane design strategy and the revealed antifouling mechanisms provide new avenues for developing high-performance RO membranes adequate for complex wastewater systems."

The two phases of exposure ages inferred from OSL‐DPs of the bedrock fault surface above ground (0.4 ± 0.3 and 1.1 ± 0.4 ka) are consistent with burial ages of slices from the fault surface covered by the colluvial wedge.

Small, bummock‐sized features are more likely to be cusp‐shaped, while larger ridge keels are more likely trapezoids. This is consistent across decades, regions, and between first‐ and multi‐year ice. Though comparatively rare, the deepest keels (≥ ${\ge} $8 m) are more likely to be triangular or cusped with increasing maximum keel depth.

Currently, risk analysis is hindered by poor prediction of run‐up heights that are mainly derived from confined 2D experiments, and/or numerical models, and are restricted to a specific configuration whereby the flow strikes topographic barriers orthogonally. Here, a new analytical model is presented, informed by and validated against physical experiments, which predicts run‐up heights for flows encountering three‐dimensional slopes as a function of any slope angle, and incidence angle, of the impinging turbidity current. This has important implications for reducing geohazards by informing routing and positioning of seafloor infrastructure, and for more accurately interpreting submarine landscapes and their deposits."

 Accurately predicting disease progression remains a major challenge in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we show that a biomarker-integrated prognostic staging system can stratify progression risk across the disease course by jointly incorporating cognitive status, established risk factors, plasma biomarkers, and neuroimaging measures. In the K-ROAD cohort (N = 1,263), the dominant prognostic contributors varied by clinical context—GFAP in cognitively unimpaired individuals, hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment, and age in dementia—while plasma phosphorylated tau-217 provided consistent secondary prognostic information across stages. Outcome-specific staging captured clinically meaningful gradients of progression risk and informed construction of a unified six-stage framework (Stage 0–IVB) with distinct inflection points of accelerated decline. External validation in the ADNI cohort (N = 290) demonstrated consistent patterns of worsening prognosis, particularly in early and intermediate stages. This system provides a clinically interpretable approach to risk stratification and may serve as an exploratory framework for biomarker-integrated prognostic stratification in AD.

 Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component of the global carbon cycle and a vital indicator of ecosystem health, playing key roles in agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation. To trace the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC in China, a high-resolution (1 km) Soil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD) dataset for the 0–20 and 0–100 cm depths spanning the period from 1985 to 2020 is produced in this study. By integrating Landsat archives, topographic and meteorological data, and 11 743 soil profile measurements, we produced the SOCD dataset from 1985–2020 in China using the Random Forest ensemble learning approach. Specially, a climate zoning strategy was developed to account for the significant environmental heterogeneity across China. The validation of our SOCD estimated results with 0–20 cm depth with independent testing samples showed strong agreement with R2=0.63 and RMSE=2.03 (kg C m−2) for 0–20 cm SOCD estimation and R2=0.62 and RMSE=6.16 (kg C m−2) for 0–100 cm.

We introduce a hybrid physics–AI approach that seamlessly integrates neural networks into a distributed hydrological model to refine water flow dynamics within an implicit numerical scheme. The hybrid models demonstrate strong performance and interpretable results, leading to reliable streamflow simulations for flood modeling. 
 Conceptual hydrological models, traditionally relying on simplified representations of physical processes governed by conservation laws remain widely used in operational hydrology due to their explainability and practical applicability. However, these process-based models inherently face structural uncertainties and a lack of scale-relevant theories – challenges that emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may help address. In parallel, high-resolution models are crucial for predicting extreme events characterized by strong variability and short duration, making spatially distributed hybrid modeling critical in the current context. We introduce a hybrid physics–AI framework that embeds neural networks (NNs) seamlessly into a spatialized, regionalizable, and fully differentiable process-based model via universal differential equations (UDEs). The model integrates a state-dependent NN to refine internal water fluxes and an implicit resolution of the UDE system, followed by kinematic wave routing on a flow direction grid. Spatially distributed parameters are inferred through regionalization mappings including convolutional NNs, and adjoint-based gradients enable end-to-end training of the hybrid system. We implement this framework into the latest release of the smash platform, significantly extending its capabilities to comprehensively evaluate hybrid models at kilometric spatial and hourly temporal resolutions. The results show that hybrid approaches demonstrate consistently strong and stable performance in calibration and various validation scenarios. Additionally, the UDE structure exhibits a hybridization effect that modifies state dynamics and runoff flow, achieving more accurate streamflow simulations for flood modeling."

This study aimed to characterize and compare the dissolution, transformations, and potential bioavailability of P in RNP with conventional P fertilizers (monoammonium phosphate; MAP, triple superphosphate; TSP) in selected soils over time by using short-term laboratory incubation studies in Petri dishes. Soil samples sectioned from the point of application were assessed for pH, total P, resin-extractable P, and selected samples by using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. The RNP treatment showed that over 90%, 70%, and 80% of added P remained in the center section in calcareous, neutral, and acid soils, respectively, where the potential plant-available P was greater than the control in all soils and similar to the MAP treatment only in acid soil after 5 weeks of incubation. The hydroxyapatite-like species dominated P speciation in both RNP and RNP-added soils, leading to less solubility. These results underscore the potential of Ca-based RNP as a P source for tested soils, and process modifications could yield a series of viable secondary P sources for agriculture."

Magnetic particle (MP)-based approaches have the potential for automating enrichment processing and are considered a convenient alternative. However, automated applications for large-volume samples are hindered by the lack of MPs with satisfactory properties. In this study, we presented a novel large-volume viral enrichment system composed of elaborately prepared MPs and an automated platform. Due to the high magnetic responsiveness, excellent dispersibility, and selective absorption performance of MPs, the system enabled the automatic processing of up to 180 mL of large-volume samples without requiring centrifugation or ultrafiltration. A 0.2 copies/mL experimental sensitivity was achieved in spiked samples, which is 25-fold more sensitive than previous automated studies. The practical applicability has been validated through testing real wastewater samples, demonstrating a 4.5-fold detection accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 monitoring compared with the traditional protocol.

Through integrated anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment system experiments combined with physicochemical characterization, metagenomic sequencing, and molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we elucidated MP-ARG interaction mechanisms from the interfacial to the cellular scale. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) MPPIs underwent significant aging during 60 days of exposure, resulting in elemental enrichment (C/O/P), the formation of C═C/C–H/C–O/C–OH functional groups, and elevated oxidation. These transformations enhanced extracellular polymeric substance production (184.81 mg/g MLSS) and selectively enriched antibiotic-resistant bacteria, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), promoting horizontal gene transfer. XDLVO theory revealed spontaneous microbial adhesion (ΔGadh = −23.63 mJ/m2) driven by Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) and acid–base interactions. MD demonstrated direct MP penetration into the membrane via dominant LW forces (−1200 kJ/mol) and increased permeability. Concurrently, compared with sewage water (SW), MPPIs induced a 2.06-fold overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which upregulated genes encoding efflux pumps (acrF, 3.2-fold), outer membrane porins (OmpF, 4.1-fold), and conjugative transfer genes (traF, 3.8-fold). Material-specific (PET > PE > PP) and oxygen-driven redox mechanisms governed ARG dissemination: aerobic conditions favored radical-driven oxidation and MGE entrapment, whereas anaerobic systems enhanced hydrophobic adhesion."

This study investigated the effects of NH2-MIL-101(Fe) on As(V) bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, biotransformation, and mitochondrial genotoxicity across generations using a Daphnia magna–Danio rerio (zebrafish) food chain exposure model consisting of a 14 day exposure and a 26 day depuration phase. NH2-MIL-101(Fe) increased total arsenic bioaccumulation in D. magna (15.2-fold) and zebrafish tissues (2.0–18.6-fold at day 14 and 2.6–33.8-fold at day 40), while reducing the biomagnification factor from 0.045 to 0.026. It promoted arsenic uptake, likely via oxidative-stress-mediated upregulation of aqp7 and formation of As(V)-MOF complexes, and enhanced As(V) secondary methylation, associated with as3mt upregulation. Co-exposure increased zebrafish mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage through inducing excessive reactive oxygen species and inhibiting antioxidant enzymes, accompanied by adenosine triphosphate depletion and locomotor decline. The mtDNA damage was transmitted to offspring, demonstrating multigenerational mitochondrial toxicity. These findings reveal that NH2-MIL-101(Fe)–As(V) coexposure increased arsenic burden across trophic levels, particularly in lower trophic levels, and amplifies heritable mitochondrial genotoxicity in aquatic food chains."

While the acute developmental effects of such DBPs are increasingly documented, their long-term impacts remain understudied. In this study, we investigated the developmental effects of saline primary sewage effluent on the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii (located at the bottom of the marine food chain) during a 25-day sub-chronic exposure. Although both non-chlorinated and chlorinated saline sewage effluents exhibited dose-dependent embryotoxic and teratogenic effects across effluent percentages (0%–33%), the chlorinated effluent induced such malformation effects at lower concentrations (1.3%–3.7%) than the non-chlorinated counterparts (4.8%–9.9%), which could be attributed to the presence of halogenated DBPs in the chlorinated sewage effluent. We then focused on 2,6-dihalo-4-nitrophenols, a group of aromatic DBPs that have been reported to exhibit acute developmental toxicity and persist in receiving seawater. Significant reductions in survival (p < 0.10) were observed for the sub-chronic and chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (3.4–340 nmol/L; equivalent to 1–100 μg/L as 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol (DBNP)). Especially, the one-year chronic exposure to DBNP revealed significant concentration-dependent responses. Both survival rate and average body length of the polychaete were significantly decreased, and the overall maturation was delayed. Compared to seawater control with a natural balance gender, female-biased sex ratios (1.4–2.2) were observed in the worms exposed to 3.4–340 nmol/L of DBNP. This bias might result from the higher surface-area-to-volume ratio of male polychaete and the stronger binding affinity of DBNP toward the androgen receptor. This study is the first of its type that systematically recorded the long-term adverse effects of chlorinated saline sewage effluents and halogenated aromatic DBPs─at environmentally relevant concentrations─on the marine polychaete."

Simulated MPWP OHC is globally higher than the pre‐industrial except for the Arabian Sea, which is attributed to weakened Northeast monsoon wind strength. The equatorial Pacific thermocline warms by ∼ ${\sim} $2°C from pre‐industrial to the MPWP without deepening. Globally, MPWP OHC exceeds the highest SSP5‐8.5 future scenario for the late 21st century (2081–2100), suggesting the ocean can absorb substantial amounts of heat, though the dynamics of heat uptake remain important given potential nonlinearities."

Previous work estimated its surface age to be between 200 and 1000 Myr. This estimate, however, is based on crater scaling laws for water and sand, which are not representative of the composition of Titan's icy surface. Titan's surface is likely composed of water ice, methane clathrates, or a combination of both. Here, we perform impact simulations for impactors of various sizes that strike an icy target with a 0–15 km thick methane clathrate cap layer. We derive new crater scaling laws based on our numerical results, and find that Titan's surface age is 300–340 Myr, assuming heliocentric impactors and surface clathrates. This age, which represents the crater retention age, indicates a relatively youthful surface, suggesting that active endogenic and/or exogenic processes have recently reshaped Titan's surface."

The extreme flooding in Western North Carolina caused by Tropical Storm Helene in September of 2024 is a recent and devastating example of this trend. Communities of color and low‐income populations are more likely to reside in flood‐prone areas due to structural factors, including residential racial segregation and economic inequality. As such, the adverse health and financial consequences of flood exposure overburden historically marginalized communities, which may have a more limited adaptive capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from flood events. Exposure to severe flooding further exacerbates chronic health conditions by impeding access to vital healthcare infrastructure and services. This study examines the spatial patterning of coastal and inland flood risk, neighborhood‐level structural determinants (i.e., racial and economic inequality), and flood‐sensitive health conditions in North Carolina using bivariate local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) statistics. High‐high clusters capture areas where neighborhoods with high racial or economic inequality surround elevated flood risks. These clusters are distinguished by select sociodemographic characteristics and concentrated in the eastern coastal and western mountainous regions of North Carolina. Cluster locations are priority areas for targeted resource allocation and interventions that strengthen the adaptive capacity of these communities in the context of climate change."

 Gammaherpesvirus is a subfamily of herpesvirus, distinct phylogenetically from alpha- and betaherpesvirus and featured by its oncogenic subtypes, including Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus1. It broadly infects humans and other vertebrate animals and causes various diseases and malignancies2,3. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for each type or the whole family. gB is the common fusion protein vital for herpesvirus infection and an ideal target for broad vaccine development, while the lack of basis for gB as a universal antigen hinders such effort4. Here, we report the molecular basis for broad gB binding and cross-genus virus neutralization by an antibody Fab5 for the first time. This antibody confers effective protection against authentic virus challenges in immune-competent mice, non-human primates, and humanized mice with murine, rhesus, and human gammaherpesvirus. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Fab5 targeted a conservative and vulnerable epitope of gammaherpesvirus gB and antigenically exposed across pre- or post-fusion status. This finding not only demonstrates Fab5 as cross-genus antibody broadly reactive against gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis progression, but offers insights into potential common mechanisms for herpesvirus infection and facilitates the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against the gammaherpesvirus."

 Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing1. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks2–5. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters6, incorporating entanglement swapping4,7,8 and entanglement purification9–11 with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts12–25, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. Here, we demonstrate memory-memory entanglement between two nodes connected by 10 km of spooled fibre surviving beyond the average entanglement establishment time. This is enabled by the development of long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol26,27. As an application, we report a proof-of-principle device-independent quantum key distributio (DI-QKD) demonstration with finite-size analysis over 10 km and a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, with both distances exceeding previous work by more than two orders of magnitude28–30.

 Earth system feedbacks can amplify greenhouse gas forcing but are difficult to quantify, particularly on land where long palaeoclimate records are scarce. Here we reconstructed warm-season temperatures and vegetation at Lake Baikal, Russia, over the past 8.6 million years. We document gradual late Neogene cooling that was punctuated by an abrupt transition approximately 2.7 million years ago to severe cold temperatures during glacial periods. Forests were replaced by open steppe–tundra ecosystems and permafrost probably extended into South Siberia during these Early Pleistocene cold intervals. Compiled palaeobotanical data suggest this ecosystem turnover occurred throughout the Arctic and subarctic, although the timescale of these changes is less understood. Reconstructed Early Pleistocene glacial temperatures and vegetation resemble Late Pleistocene glacial periods at Lake Baikal, despite much warmer mean global temperatures in the Early Pleistocene. These geologic observations support the view that regional climate can respond nonlinearly to global forcing. We hypothesize that both vegetation albedo and permafrost carbon storage may have played a key role in amplifying glacial–interglacial climate cycles through the last 2.7 million years alongside ocean and ice sheet feedbacks. Proxy records from Lake Baikal show that rapid cooling coincided with Northern Hemisphere ice sheet expansion 2.7 million years ago, a change accompanied by a transition to open steppe ecosystems."

Here, the authors report that PTX, but not Nab-PTX, induces the expansion of tumor-promoting TREM2+ macrophages as a mechanism underlying the inferior antitumor efficacy of PTX compared with Nab-PTX in patients with breast cancer. 
 Paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel differ in therapeutic efficacy and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, yet the molecular basis remains poorly defined. Here, based on a meta-analysis, we first show that treatment with nab-paclitaxel results in a higher overall response rate and pathological complete response compared to paclitaxel in female patients with breast cancer. Notably, TREM2 expression in macrophages is elevated in primary tumors of paclitaxel- but not nab-paclitaxel-treated female patients. In metastatic breast cancer, TREM2+ macrophage infiltration is increased in primary tumors. In breast cancer models in female mice, paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, promotes lung metastasis by recruiting TREM2+ macrophages to primary tumors. Mechanistically, paclitaxel enhances the ATF3-FGF2 axis in breast cancer cells; secreted FGF2 activates the EGR1-TREM2-EMT cytokine axis in macrophages. Genetic ablation of Trem2 or pharmacologic targeting with antisense oligonucleotides suppress paclitaxel-induced breast cancer lung metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, stimulates TREM2 expression and expands TREM2+ macrophages, suggesting that TREM2 targeting could enhance paclitaxel efficacy while limiting metastasis.

This single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ASC-depleting anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in patients with SLE (NCT04810754). The primary endpoint is the reduction in serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels at week 12. Key secondary end points include safety, clinical efficacy, and immunologic changes. Ten female patients with active disease and inadequate responses to at least two immunosuppressive drugs have received eight subcutaneous injections of 1800 mg daratumumab weekly, with dexamethasone as premedication (20 mg for first two injections, then 10 mg). By week 12, anti-dsDNA antibody levels have been reduced by a median of 109.6 IU/ml (95% CI 38.1 – 274.5). The treatment resulted in rapid and sustained clinical improvements across all patients and organ domains, reflected by a 100% SRI-4 (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4) response rate at week 12. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 5/10 patients, requiring immunoglobulin substitution. Daratumumab treatment has depleted circulating ASCs, reduced type I interferon activity, and profoundly modulated the T-cell responses. These findings highlight the pivotal role of ASCs in SLE pathogenesis and support daratumumab as therapeutic option for SLE. CD38 is highly expressed by antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and depleting antibodies targeting CD38 have the potential to treat autoimmune diseases with ASC involvement. Here authors treat systemic lupus erythematosus patients with the ASC-depleting anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in addition to dexamethasone in the frame of a single arm, open-label phase 2 clinical trial to show marked improvements in their clinical and immunological status."

 Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (skin NTDs) are a critical, underestimated source of chronic pathology, severely impacting vulnerable, rural populations with poor healthcare access. These diseases heighten the risk of systemic infection, amputation, and premature mortality. Their visibility and co-endemic nature present a pivotal opportunity for integrated diagnostics and management at the primary care level. Aligned with the WHO roadmap, this review advocates for a robust One Health framework, examining the complex interplay of human, animal, and environmental transmission factors. We contrast diseases with understood transmission against those requiring research. Leveraging the skin as a common pathway, we argue for strategic, integrated public health action to substantially improve patient outcomes globally.

 Genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics offer complementary insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Leveraging UK Biobank data, we introduce the CardiOmicScore, a multitask deep learning framework, to learn disease-specific proteomic (ProScore) and metabolomic (MetScore) risk scores for the six most common CVDs by profiling 2920 proteins and 168 metabolites. Experiments demonstrate that ProScore and MetScore are strong sole CVD risk predictors (C-index range: 0.69–0.82 for ProScore and 0.64–0.74 for MetScore), and can significantly enhance risk prediction across CVDs up to 15 years prior to disease onset when combined with clinical data, increasing the C-index by 0.005–0.102. These findings suggest that incorporating multiomics profiling into clinical practice can improve personalized risk assessments at early stages. CardiOmicScore also identifies important CVD-related proteins and metabolites, which represent promising data-driven pathways, calling for further external validation, to develop novel biomarkers and targeted therapies, facilitating precision medicine for primary prevention of CVDs.

 Hydrothermal vents release substantial amounts of ancient carbon into the ocean, primarily as carbon dioxide, yet the extent to which this carbon is integrated into marine food webs remains poorly constrained. Here, we present a combination of bulk radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope measurements of particulate organic carbon from water column filters with compound-specific hydrogen and radiocarbon isotope analyses of fatty acids from surface sediments to trace carbon assimilation across benthic and pelagic realms in a low pH, shallow-water hydrothermal system off Taiwan. Isotope correlations indicate that vent-derived carbon dioxide constitutes a substantial fraction of the local microbial and faunal biomass through chemoautotrophic pathways (up to ~30%). Farther from the vents, hydrothermal carbon remains detectable and is incorporated into photoautotrophic biomass in the overlying water column. Notably, ancient carbon content in the standing stock of particulate organic carbon was higher at the lower temperature (“White”) vent, even though fluid and sulfide emissions – and thus potential energy availability – were substantially greater at the higher temperature (“Yellow”) vent. These findings show that physicochemical conditions, including pH and temperature, rather than fluid chemistry alone, control carbon assimilation patterns and ultimately limit the retention of vent-derived carbon in this shallow-water system.

 Microbialites preserve crucial records of early life and geobiological processes, yet interpreting their formation mechanisms remains challenging. Here we analyze Oligocene oncolites from the Junggar Basin that retain exceptional lipid biomarkers due to limited diagenetic alteration. These spheroidal structures exhibit alternating calcite-rich laminae with Fe-Mn coatings, revealed through petrographic and elemental mapping. Lipid analysis identifies prokaryote-dominated communities, particularly phototrophs and heterotrophs, with carbonate-associated biomarkers indicating continuous microbial activity during growth. The release of saturated fatty acid derivatives through acid treatment further confirms exceptional organic preservation. We demonstrate that oncoid formation involved complex microbial consortia mediating calcification. These deposits correlate with accelerated Tianshan Mountain uplift, which triggered lake shallowing and turbulent conditions that enhanced benthic microbial productivity prior to Central Asian aridification. Our findings establish microbialites as sensitive indicators of coupled tectonic and environmental changes during the Oligocene-Miocene transition.

 Chromium (Cr) and its isotopic composition (δ53Cr) are emerging as valuable proxies in both environmental and paleoenvironmental studies, yet their redox behaviour is complicated by the presence of organic ligands. This study performed laboratory-controlled batch dissolution and flow-through column experiments on soils/sediments to examine the effects of low-molecular-weight organic acids on Cr mobility and isotopic fractionation. Our results reveal that citric and oxalic acids can enhance the dissolution of Cr(III) under strongly reducing conditions where relatively high levels of ferrous iron are present, highlighting an overlooked pathway of Cr mobilisation. The Cr isotope variability (δ53Cr = −1.39‰ to +0.11‰) in batch leachates and column effluents is not directly driven by redox changes; the very light δ53Cr signatures likely reflect effects of incongruent dissolution and kinetic isotope fractionation. Ligand-bound Cr(III) can potentially be transported across environmental interfaces with distinct isotopic signature, complementing conventional views of Cr and Cr isotope biogeochemical cycling.

Literature synthesised from 2020–2025 documents widespread contamination in drinking, surface, and wastewater, with concentrations in LMIDC hotspots 5–20 times higher than in the Global North. In South Africa’s Vaal River, PFAS exceeded 400 ng l−1, pharmaceuticals approached 1000 ng l−1, and MPs averaged approximately 31 particles m−3 in drinking water. Policy analysis reveals fragmented monitoring and limited treatment coverage in LMIDCs, in contrast to integrated, mixture-aware frameworks in the Global North. The proposed three-phase roadmap entails: (1) establishing CEC standards and baseline monitoring, (2) piloting targeted treatment supported by extended producer responsibility schemes, and (3) embedding adaptive, mixture-aware regulation within water safety plans. Feasibility analysis identifies enforceable standards, predictable financing, laboratory capacity, and public engagement as key success factors. Full implementation could reduce PFAS and pharmaceutical loads by 50%–80%, cut MPs by over 90%, and prevent multi-billion-dollar (USD) annual PFAS-related healthcare costs.

To support these targets, projects of common and mutual interest (PCI-PMI)—large infrastructure projects for electricity, hydrogen and CO2 transport, and storage—have been identified by the European Commission. This study focuses on PCI-PMI projects related to hydrogen and carbon value chains, assessing their long-term system value and the impact of pipeline delays and shifting policy targets using the sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur. Our study shows that PCI-PMI projects enable a more cost-effective transition to a net-zero energy system compared to scenarios without any pipeline expansion. Hydrogen pipelines help distribute affordable green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions in the north and southwest to high-demand areas in central Europe, while CO2 pipelines link major industrial emitters with offshore storage sites. Although these projects are not essential in 2030, they begin to significantly reduce annual system costs by more than €26 billion from 2040 onward. Delaying implementation beyond 2040 could increase system costs by up to €24.2 billion per year, depending on the extent of additional infrastructure development. Moreover, our results show that PCI-PMI projects reduce the need for excess wind and solar capacity and lower reliance on individual CO2 removal technologies, such as direct air capture, by 13–136 Mt annually, depending on the build-out scenario."

 Long-term land-use changes have a profound impact on terrestrial ecosystems and the associated carbon balance. Current estimates of China's historical carbon emissions induced by land-use change vary widely. Here, current mainland China was taken as the study area, and the 32 provincial units (excluding Macao and Hong Kong) were merged into 25 regions. We utilized a bookkeeping method to quantify China's annual carbon budget resulting from land-use change between 1000 and 2019, driven by a millennial dataset of land-use change in China at provincial level, assisted by comprehensive soil and vegetation carbon density datasets. This approach, which was supported by high-confidence land-use change data, a comprehensive carbon density database compiled from over 10 000 existing field samples, and the latest published disturbance-response curves, enhanced the accuracy of carbon budget estimates. The results revealed that cumulative carbon emissions from land-use change in China reached 19.61 Pg C over the past millennium. Moreover, critical turning points occurred in the early 18th century and early 1980s, with emissions accelerating in the 18th century and transitioning from carbon source to carbon sink in the early 1980s. Our findings revealed that the values were 68 %–328 % higher than the previous 300-year estimates, suggesting that historical carbon emissions from land-use change in China may have been significantly underestimated.

In recent years, substantial initiatives have generated major open-access datasets of species' functional traits. However, these resources typically concentrate on a handful of well-studied biological groups—such as plants, birds, and fishes—and less on specific biogeographic regions limiting their applicability in regional biodiversity assessments and conservation planning.

Using an uncalibrated process-based model across 149 German sites, we identified key drivers of tree mortality in European beech and Norway spruce forests. Our model captured both the timing and extent of mortality. A new bark beetle module improved predictions for spruce. High soil water capacity and heterogeneous soils reduced drought impacts. These findings offer new insights to anticipate forest responses in a warming, drying climate. 
 Drought is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of forest dynamics, altering tree species' growth, dominance and survival.  To better understand these dynamics, we used a process-based modeling approach to investigate drought-related mortality of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) in German forests. The predisposing-inciting (PI) framework for drought-induced tree mortality incorporated in ForClim v4.1 was combined with a bark beetle module for Norway spruce to account for a key contributing factor, leading to ForClim v4.2.Our study addressed three hypotheses: (1) the PI framework, initially developed for Swiss beech forests, is effective across the broad ecological and climatic gradients found in Germany; (2) Soil properties, i.e. soil water holding capacity (AWC) and its spatial heterogeneity, have a strong influence on drought-related mortality by amplifying mortality risk through limited microsite variability, or dampening it by providing moist refugia, thus complementing climatic drivers; (3) incorporating bark beetle damage ameliorates model performance for simulating drought-related mortality of Norway spruce. Our modelling approach deliberately forgoes calibration to better investigate the underlying mechanisms and drivers of drought-induced tree mortality.We conducted simulations across 149 plots of the ICP Forest Level I network in Germany, covering a wide gradient of climate and soil conditions. ForClim reproduced the general patterns of drought-related mortality, highlighting the ability of the PI framework to capture emergent mortality patterns across a range of environmental conditions. However, mismatches in magnitude and trends highlight areas for improvement. Discrepancies were attributed to sparse mortality data, the drought sensitivity of the bark beetle submodule, and the absence of regional calibration. Our results revealed the critical role of AWC and local soil heterogeneity in modulating drought responses. Sites with low AWC experienced significantly higher mortality rates, while high AWC provided a buffering effect, bringing simulated outcomes closer to observed data. Furthermore, soil heterogeneity played a mitigating role, with sites exhibiting uniform soils showing higher mortality risk, thus emphasizing the importance of the spatial variability of soil properties for dampening drought impacts. Lastly, the new bark beetle submodel, even though highly simplified, considerably improved the simulation of drought-related mortality patterns in Norway spruce-dominated sites.This study underscores the value of process-based models like ForClim for disentangling the mechanisms underlying forest vulnerability and drought-induced mortality. However, improvements such as finer-resolution mortality and crown condition data, as well as regional model calibration, would be useful to enhance its predictive accuracy. Our findings contribute to the better understanding, forecasting and managing of forest resistance under current and future climatic conditions."

Roche;Didier Paillard;Pradeebane Vaittinada Ayar,GeoDS (v.1.0): a simple Geographical DownScaling model for long-term precipitation data over complex terrains,"Due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of observations, global models are essential tools to study climate. However, long-term climate data at fine spatial scale are difficult to obtain because of elevated computational costs such algorithms involve. This paper presents a simple model based on the description of climate/topography interactions to generate local precipitation fields at low cost. The objective is to provide a flexible and easy to use method for paleoclimate studies. 
 Global climate models offer the most comprehensive description of the climate system and its internal processes to date but current computational capabilities typically restrict their spatial resolution to the order of hundreds of kilometers when long-term (millennial or longer) simulations are needed. Over the years, various downscaling techniques have been developed to generate fine scale data from climate models outputs but they often exhibit important limitations when applied over long periods of time. Building on previous efforts, we present a simple topography-based model (GeoDS) to downscale precipitation fields in complex areas, adapted to paleoclimate studies involving multi-millennia simulations. With a limited amount of inputs from a climate model and high resolved geographical information, the model computes, for each time step and every grid point, a topographic exposure index used to distribute precipitation into a high-resolution spatial grid. This dimensionless quantity represents the exposure of surfaces to dominant windward incoming airflows, assumed to bring most of the humidity, and only depends on large scale winds and terrain configuration. The model is first tested under current climate conditions over part of the European Alpine region due to the availability of field data for comparison; the complexity of both regional topography and climate conditions making it a good test of the proposed methodology. The relative effects of the model's parameters are assessed as well as the capacity of GeoDS to reproduce the spatial precipitation distribution of a well-resolved gridded target dataset. Despite uncertainties regarding the correct wind fields to choose as input, and the dependency of the model to the temporal resolution of the large-scale data to downscale, we show that the procedure is able to capture most of the patterns occurring at fine spatial scale while being computationally inexpensive.

Brabson;Loren F. Doyle;R. Paul Acosta;Alexey V. Fedorov;Pincelli M. Hull;Natalie J. Burls,A revised temperature-dependent remineralization scheme for the Community Earth System Model (v1.2.2),"Earth System Models are an essential tool for climate studies, yet temperature-sensitive parameters are often absent, resulting in a gap in model predictive capabilities. Organic carbon breakdown, also known as remineralization, is one such process. Here, we add this parameter to the Community Earth System Model and find improved regional patterns of carbon export. The new code will serve as a useful tool to improve the examination of marine carbon cycle feedbacks to changing climate conditions. 
 Export of carbon from the euphotic zone to intermediate and deep water plays a critical role in the ocean's feedback response to a warming climate. However, as water temperature increases so does the rate of bacterial respiration at the base of the biological pump, resulting in more efficient recycling of carbon in the upper ocean, less efficient export of carbon to depth, and a diminished net negative feedback on climate. Therefore, to better predict climate response associated with changes in ocean carbon storage in warming scenarios, it is imperative to incorporate temperature-sensitive mechanisms, such as bacterial respiration (remineralization), into Earth system models. Here, we employ a new temperature-dependent parameterization for remineralization (Tdep) in the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) applied to gravitationally sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) in a preindustrial control simulation. We find that the inclusion of Tdep in both low and high-resolution model configurations more accurately captures regional heterogeneity in POC transfer efficiency while preserving the overall trends in nutrient distribution and attenuation of sinking particulate matter when compared with modern empirical data. Inclusion of this parametrization will allow for improved predictions of temperature-sensitive mechanisms impacting carbon storage in the warming ocean."

Wambaugh,Characterizing Accuracy of Model Predictions for Chemical Concentration in High Throughput Screening Assays,"The aim of in vitro - in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of dose is to predict potential whole animal effects from perturbations observed in vitro. Reliance on nominal (administered) concentration (assumed dose) does not account for chemical distribution to cellular and noncellular elements of an in vitro assay system. Chemical distribution can reduce the free concentration available to cause effects and can result in an inaccurate estimate of the intracellular concentration causing any observed perturbations. There are mathematical, chemical property-based partitioning models for predicting cellular concentrations when not measured experimentally. This work evaluated two of these in vitro disposition models, Armitage et al., 2021 and Kramer et al., 2010, using a total of 153 experimental intracellular concentration measurements of 43 chemicals, along with parameters describing measurement conditions, from 12 peer reviewed studies in addition to data generated for this study. Intracellular concentrations were more accurately predicted by both the Armitage model (root mean squared log10 error (RMSLE) = 1.12) and the Kramer model (RMSLE = 1.30) than by the nominal concentration (RMSLE = 1.45). Although limited by the amount of available measurement data, these results indicate that mathematical modeling of in vitro distribution can improve the accuracy of IVIVE for toxicology."

This study presents a set of laboratory experiments examining the role of bottom substrates and hyporheic exchange on eDNA fate and transport. A conceptual model is proposed wherein eDNA transport is governed by competition between adsorption/desorption processes and hydrodynamic forces which remobilize eDNA across the water column and sediment storage zones. Retention experiments were conducted for plane and gravel beds, while breakthrough experiments were performed across both bed types and two hydraulic regimes. To quantify eDNA settling rates and validate the conceptual model, an independent experiment under quiescent conditions was performed. Breakthrough curves were analyzed using a continuous time random walk (CTRW) model. Enhanced exchange and retention rates were observed for eDNA in the gravel bed, showing that surface–subsurface interactions and turbulence influenced downstream transport distances. Effective velocities were significantly lower for eDNA than for a conservative tracer across both bed types at low flows. These results underscore that parafluvial processes, including hyporheic exchange and storage in sediments, play a crucial role in eDNA transport dynamics within slow-moving lotic environments."

Comamonas testosteroni JL40 oxidizes Sb(III) to Sb(V) under oxic conditions via an uncharacterized mechanism. A redox-related enzyme identified via differential proteomics was designated AntO. The antO transcription was significantly upregulated upon addition of Sb(III). AntO is predicted to be a catalase-like heme-binding peroxidase, similar to the uncharacterized SrpA. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AntO represents a novel Sb(III) oxidase or catalase. In E. coli AW3110(Δars), AntO confers Sb(III) resistance and oxidation activity and is induced by Sb(III) and H2O2. Further analysis confirms that antO mediates Sb(III) oxidation and H2O2 decomposition in JL40. Purified AntO catalyzes Sb(III) oxidation (with NADP+ as an electron acceptor) and H2O2 decomposition in vitro. Molecular docking shows that these reactions occur in distinct AntO structural domains. In summary, AntO has dual roles: Sb(III) oxidation for detoxification and H2O2 decomposition. This study identifies AntO as a novel environmental Sb(III) oxidase that facilitates Sb(III) detoxification, alleviates Sb(III)-induced oxidative stress, and advances understanding of microbial contributions to antimony biogeochemical cycling."

We assess the role of THS in the context of the classic multistage model of tumorigenesis to address whether THS acts primarily as a tumor initiator, or as a promoter, or both. We also discuss methodological challenges in isolating the effects of THS on human health and the importance of animal models and outline emerging strategies for risk assessment, biomarker discovery, and precision prevention. This Perspective is the first to integrate chemical, toxicological, and mechanistic evidence to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of THS within the framework of the multistage model of tumorigenesis, offering a new conceptual foundation for understanding the role of THS in human cancer etiology, which is crucial for informing public health policies aimed at mitigating its impact."

Developmental arsenic (As) exposure is linked to metabolic disorders, but its effects on MAFLD-related phenotypes remain unclear. This study aims to assess the impact of prenatal As exposure on MAFLD-like phenotypes in adulthood offspring. Pregnant mice were given deionized water containing NaAsO2 at concentrations of 0, 1.5, and 15 mg/L throughout their pregnancy. Doses were selected based on environmentally relevant exposure (1.5 mg/L, L-As) and prior evidence of metabolic effects in rodents (15 mg/L, H–As). Gestational H–As exposure increased hepatic triglyceride content and enlarged hepatic lipid droplets in middle-aged offspring. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test analyses revealed that prenatal L-As and H–As exposure impaired glucose and insulin tolerance in middle-aged offspring. White fat mass and adipocyte size were elevated in H–As exposed middle-aged offspring. Several metabolism-related hormones, including adiponectin, leptin, and insulin, were elevated, whereas glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone secreted by the intestines, was reduced in H–As exposed female middle-aged offspring. These results demonstrate that prenatal As-alone promotes MAFLD-like phenotypes in middle-aged offspring, highlighting its role as an early life environmental trigger for metabolic disease."

 Thetis cells (TCs) are a recently identified lineage of RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells comprising four subsets including a tolerogenic subset, TC IV, that instructs tolerance to gut microbiota and food antigens1–6. A developmental wave of TCs during early life creates a critical window of opportunity for establishing intestinal tolerance1,5. Yet the ontogeny of TCs and the cues shaping their abundance and heterogeneity remain unknown, limiting efforts to harness their therapeutic potential. Here we identify a population of RORγt+ progenitors, termed Thetis-Lymphoid Tissue inducer progenitors (TLP), that give rise to the immediate TC progenitor (TCP) and the Lymphoid Tissue inducer progenitor (LTiP), and identify PU.1 as the transcription factor governing TC fate. Despite transcriptional similarity to myeloid-derived conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), we show that TCs descend from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). Deletion of the plasmacytoid DC (pDC) lineage-determining transcription factor TCF4 expands TLPs and TCs, suggesting a shared developmental branch with pDCs. TLPs are enriched in fetal liver; however, unlike LTi cells, TCs emerge postnatally, pointing to developmentally-timed environmental cues that promote TCP differentiation. We identify one such cue–RANKL provision by lymphoid tissue organizer cells–which is essential for TC I differentiation. Together, these findings define the ontogeny of TCs and the transcription factors that promote TC differentiation and heterogeneity, facilitating future investigations of these enigmatic cells and their therapeutic potential for tolerance induction in food allergy and autoimmunity."

 Heat flowing from the core to the mantle drives the geodynamo that produces Earth’s global magnetic field. Palaeomagnetic measurements record the behaviour of this field through time and have the potential to inform us about deep Earth structures and dynamics on either side of the core–mantle boundary. In practise, insights have proved difficult to obtain because of the limited spatiotemporal resolution of palaeomagnetic records and uncertainties in how to interpret them. Here we use palaeomagnetic datasets and models alongside numerical simulations of the geodynamo to show that certain observed characteristics of ancient magnetic field behaviour are uniquely or preferentially reproduced in the presence of strong lateral variability in core–mantle heat flux. Our findings suggest that strong contrasts in the spatial pattern of the temperature gradients and/or thermal conductivity of the lowermost mantle that are linked, today, to seismologically observed structures, have influenced the geodynamo for at least the last few hundred million years. The identified palaeomagnetic signatures provide a new means to constrain the properties and time evolution of the core–mantle boundary. Furthermore, our insights into how thermal heterogeneity at the base of the mantle can break the axial symmetry of the time-averaged magnetic field may help resolve longstanding palaeogeographic controversies.

 Rising atmospheric CO2 reduces soil phosphorus (P) availability in paddy soils by promoting soil organic P accumulation and crop harvest removal. Atmospheric CO2 and temperatures are increasing simultaneously, yet their interaction with the soil P cycle remains unresolved. Here we report a decade-long free-air CO2 enrichment experiment integrated with in situ warming (+2 °C) in a typical paddy–upland rotation system. We find that both elevated CO2 and warming exacerbate P constraints, and that warming alone and in combination with elevated CO2 has a greater impact than elevated CO2 alone. All climate change treatments significantly depleted soil available P (32–54%) and increased the soil C:P ratios (4–30%). Moreover, warming initially accelerated P mineralization but reduced P availability by enhancing Fe–organic carbon complexes and microbial immobilization. These processes, together with increased crop P demand driven by accelerated growth under elevated CO2, exacerbate P depletion. We identify Fe–organic carbon interactions as a previously overlooked mechanism that significantly reduces P bioavailability. Our findings offer a mechanistic framework linking aboveground–belowground C–P coupling with microbially driven Fe–organic matter dynamics, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive nutrient management strategies to sustain rice production under future climate change.

Here, the authors apply click chemistry to derive copper complexes that induce DNA strand breaks in recalcitrant cancer cells, validating an innovative route for metallodrug design. 
 Recently, copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry has emerged as a promising approach for designing new artificial metallo-nucleases (AMNs) with DNA-damaging properties. By functionalising a central organic azide with three alkyne donors, Tri-Click (TC) ligands capable of chelating three copper ions through the donor group and triazole linker can be generated. However, the versatility of this approach along with the influence of specific donors on metal binding, DNA recognition, and cellular DNA damage in an anticancer context remains poorly understood. Here, we prepare a series of Tri-Click ligands incorporating systematic cyclic and acyclic N-, O-, and S-donors and evaluate their AMN activities. Screening experiments pinpoint planar N-donor ligands as high value agents. Among these, the copper complex of Tri-Click-Pyridine (Cu3-TC-Py) displays significant potential. We characterise its activity using single-molecule imaging, microscale thermophoresis, FRET-based binding assays, molecular dynamics, and intracellular DNA interaction studies in human and functional bacterial cells. We report the emergence of Cu3-TC-Py as a lead AMN with high reactivity for DNA damage applications central to anticancer therapy.

 The low quantitative accuracy of conventional small noncoding RNA sequencing (sncRNA-seq) methods due to extensive ligation bias commonly limits functional investigation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Here, we develop 4NBoost, a single-tube sncRNA-seq protocol designed to minimize bias in the estimated absolute quantification of miRNA and piRNA transcripts through the incorporation of quantitative exogenous RNA spike-ins. With 4NBoost, we profile sncRNA expression across 20 murine tissues, 18 macaque tissues, and 24 widely used cell lines, as well as 4 Arabidopsis tissues, to establish a comprehensive quantitative reference atlas. Compared with existing small RNA databases, our data reveal substantial biases in miRNA abundance, strand selection, and tissue-specific expression at both individual and family levels. To further extend its utility, we employ machine learning to model and correct biases in conventional datasets, effectively recovering ground truth transcript abundances. All 4NBoost data and the accompanying bias-correction model are freely available via SmRNAQuant (http://wulg-lab.sibcb.ac.cn/SmRNAQuant/), a web-based repository for exploring sncRNA expression. Together, the 4NBoost, bias-correction model, and SmRNAQuant provide powerful resources to advance sncRNA research.

Here the authors suggest practical steps that bring fully water-based peptide synthesis closer to reality. 
 Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is a primary source of peptides for structure–function studies in development of potential clinical, agricultural, veterinary or cosmetic applications. Despite its efficiency and scalability, SPPS produces unsustainable volumes of toxic waste and non-degradable solid supports. With regulatory changes now in effect to reduce solvent use, there is a pressing need for sustainable, water-based synthesis methods. Due to the aqueous insolubility of the commonly employed Nα-Fmoc-amino acids—the primary building blocks in SPPS—establishing water-based peptide synthesis protocols is extremely challenging. Here we show that amine salts of, for example, N-methylmorpholine or N,N,N-triethanolamine and Nα-Fmoc protected amino acids are water soluble at high concentrations. Activation with a pre-formed water-soluble activating agent enables high quality SPPS on a hydrophilic and biodegradable poly-ε-lysine-based solid support in aqueous solution without characteristic side reactions. The presented methodology provides a simple avenue to sustainable, scalable water-based chemical synthesis of peptides. The growing market demand for peptides is drawing more attention to their industrial synthetic procedures, which rely on large amounts of toxic solvents.

 Land clearing in the Brazilian Amazon is strongly influenced by the economics of farming at the forest frontier. Here we examine how rising profits from second-season corn, grown after soybeans, may increase pressure on forests in the state of Mato Grosso. We assemble detailed annual data on crop prices, yields, production costs, land values, and forest loss, and construct measures of both per-hectare and regional-level profits from soybean and safrinha corn farming. Using statistical models designed to separate the effects of expected returns from the effects of profit-driven expansion, we show that increases in farm profits raise land prices and are followed by higher levels of forest clearing. These effects persist for several years after a shift in profits. Our results suggest that expanding corn production in frontier regions, by making farming more profitable, fuels land speculation and encourages the clearing of new land. In Mato Grosso, Brazil, an increase in profits from safrinha corn indirectly increases land values and forest loss, and these effects persist for several years after a shift in profits, according to an analysis that combines crop, cost, and yield data with a statistical model."

 The last deglaciation provides an opportunity to assess the response of El Niño–Southern Oscillation to rapid warming and disruptions of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, both projected in the near future. We present a reconstruction of deglacial El Niño–Southern Oscillation activity using finely laminated sediments from the El Niño–Southern Oscillation-sensitive Peruvian margin. An interannual record of titanium fluxes, a proxy for riverine discharge, shows that the frequency of extreme Eastern Pacific El Niño events and the amplitude of El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability were higher during the deglaciation and peaked during episodes of massive iceberg discharge into the North Atlantic. Maximum El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability occurred in the early phase of Heinrich event 1, at ~17.3–16.7 kyr BP, associated with at least five extreme floods per century in southern Peru. This proxy evidence linking El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic suggests a possible increase in El Niño-related extreme climatic events under future Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakening.

 Ultradeep drilling beyond nine to ten kilometers has progressed from an engineering challenge to a powerful approach for investigating deep Earth processes and subsurface resources. Early continental drilling showed that the deep crust is not cold or impermeable, but contains fluids, active heat flow, and ongoing chemical reactions. This review presents an integrated synthesis of scientific results from drilling that exceeds ten kilometers, with emphasis on recent Chinese programs. These wells document methane-rich fluids, high pressures, and high temperatures in sedimentary and crystalline rocks, indicating that hydrocarbon systems, deep fluids, and permeability persist far deeper than traditionally assumed. Integrating observations from cores, formation fluids, stress measurements, and geochemical analyses, we show that revised geothermal gradients, fault-controlled fluid pathways, and fluid–rock reactions such as serpentinization, carbonation, and hydrocarbon cracking sustain permeability at extreme depths. Ultradeep drilling thus provides insights into Earth system dynamics, deep energy resources, carbon storage, and mineral systems.

 Soil bulk density (BD) is a key indicator of soil health and quality, influencing air and water fluxes in the soil, soil biology, plant growth, nutrient availability, and water retention. While BD is typically measured through field and lab methods, these are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, researchers use pedotransfer functions and machine learning algorithms for BD prediction. Although several BD maps exist for Europe, Switzerland is often excluded due to its non-European Union member status, creating a data gap known as a “blank spot”. Additionally, existing Swiss BD maps have coarse spatial resolution (∼250 m). To address this, we used the national Swiss Soil Information System NABODAT dataset to produce high-resolution (30 m) BD maps at multiple depths (0, 30, 60, 100 cm) using a Quantile Random Forest algorithm. Using five-fold cross-validation, we obtained a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.57 and an R2 of 0.42, while external validation resulted in a CCC of 0.39 and an R2 of 0.36. The maps revealed that croplands had the highest BD, followed by grasslands and forests. Regionally, the Central Plateau and Jura exhibited higher BD compared to the Alps. BD increased with depth, and key predictors were depth, elevation, and temperature. Although we initially expected surface reflectance to be a relevant predictor due to its link with organic carbon, it showed low importance in our model. These maps provide valuable insights for national-scale applications such as soil carbon stock estimation and compaction assessment."

However, existing global data largely focus on secondary effluents, providing little actionable evidence for reuse-oriented systems. Here, we present the first integrated framework combining targeted antibiotic residue analysis with shotgun metagenomics of the resistome, mobilome, and microbiome across full-scale reuse-oriented wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Southern Europe to identify sentinel antibiotic resistance families for monitoring. Reclaimed effluents exhibited lower AMR exposure levels than those typically reported for secondary effluents (<0.5 ARGs/cell), while mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances were comparable to secondary effluents (1–2 MGEs/cell). Effluent communities differed by WWTP configuration: membrane bioreactor combined with ultrafiltration favored nutrient-removal/oxidative-stress taxa and reduced transferable MGEs, whereas plants relying on physical separation (sand filtration or reverse osmosis) retained fecal-associated taxa and MGEs. Specific clinically relevant ARGs persisted after treatments, including aadA and aph(3′’)-Ibs (resistance to aminoglycosides), ermB and mphA (resistance to macrolides), and blaOXA-129 (resistance to beta-lactams), which we identify as sentinel markers for monitoring reclaimed water and sludge.

This study presents a wet ball milling-surface engineering strategy for synthesizing low-molecular-weight organic acid (LMWOA)-modified ZVI, which enables a novel dual redox activation mechanism for Fe(II)─a functionality that cannot be achieved by conventional wet ball milling or external LMWOA addition. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that α-hydroxy carboxylic acids (e.g., citric, tartaric, and malic acids) form five-membered chelate rings via hydrogen bonding, thereby significantly enhancing electron transfer kinetics from Fe(0) to Fe(II). Meanwhile, non-α-hydroxy carboxylic acids (e.g., succinic/acetic/formic acids) promote Fe(III) adsorption–reduction cycles, thus sustaining Fe(II) regeneration. Notably, ZVI modified with oxalic acid or ascorbic acid exhibited a synergistic effect of both pathways, resulting in the highest Cr(VI) removal capacities, with 19.7- and 22.6-fold increases in Cr(VI) removal and Fe(III) recovery rates of 81.7% and 108.9% relative to unmodified ZVI, respectively. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the improved dissolution of Fe(II) and the elevated levels of structurally bound Fe(II), which collectively promote sustained electron generation and effective transfer to Cr(VI). These findings indicate that LMWOA-modified ZVI establishes a tunable Fe(II) activation system, thereby positioning LMWOA as a promising strategic platform for groundwater remediation."

To address critical knowledge gaps regarding the temporal dynamics of FPW composition and toxicity, we conducted one-year intermittent sampling at an active shale gas site. By integrating whole-effluent toxicity testing with zebrafish embryos, toxicity identification evaluation, and compositional analysis, we identified temporal-specific toxicity transitions driven by temporal chemical variation. During flowback, embryo toxicity (96h-LC50: 3–45% dilution) showed a nonmonotonic decline, characterized by distinct toxicological stages: organic pollutants dominated the early-stage toxicity (>70% contribution), while joint effects of metals and oxidants governed midflowback toxicity. Principal component analysis resolved divergent chemical trajectories, demonstrating progressive organic contaminant decline alongside cumulative inorganic accumulation. Leveraging these insights, we developed a rapid risk classification system using an optimized LightGBM model with SHAP interpretability. This framework employs three routine monitoring parameters (TDS, TOC, pH) to stratify FPW risk levels with 81.3% accuracy, enabling field-deployable risk management strategies. By elucidating mechanistic shifts in FPW toxicity during continuous flowback, our work established stage-specific treatment priorities while bridging dynamic toxicity mechanisms with practical monitoring parameters to advance sustainable practices for shale gas operations."

Here, we combine field investigations in the Taipu River with laboratory experiments to elucidate the distribution and biogeochemical transformation of Sb at the SWI. Pore waters exhibit Sb concentrations substantially higher than those in overlying waters, while sediment cores show maximum Sb accumulation at depths of 5–10 cm and lower concentrations in surface sediments. Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGTs) reveal decreasing labile Sb with depth, indicating upward diffusion of reduced Sb from anoxic zones; however, flux calculations demonstrate a dominant net downward transport driven by oxidative scavenging in oxic sediments. Laboratory simulations show complete oxidation of dissolved Sb(III) to Sb(V) within 42 days. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that Fe/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides mediate this oxidation and immobilize Sb(V) through strong surface binding. Sediment incubations further reveal a transient increase in Sb bioavailability during Fe/Mn oxide dissolution, followed by long-term stabilization in residual phases. These results highlight the dual role of Fe/Mn minerals in regulating Sb redox cycling and sequestration, providing mechanistic insights into Sb mobility, ecological risk, and remediation strategies in riverine environments."

Effective environmental risk assessment requires an understanding of degradation product identity and environmental behavior, yet polymer metabolomics libraries are not well-populated. In this work, mass remainder analysis was used to systematically characterize oligomeric degradation products of polyamide-6 (PA6), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polylactic acid (PLA) using nontarget liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Distinct homologous series were identified, revealing oligomers of up to seven repeating units for PA6, four for PCL, and 12 for PLA. Among the features detected, up to 70% formed remainder-based clusters (i.e., related by Kendrick mass defects of whole integers and a constant remainder) indicative of plastic-derived oligomerization patterns. To overcome limitations in molecular formula annotations for larger oligomers generated by SIRIUS, this work leveraged retention time variations, MS2 fragmentation, and spectral matching for reliable characterization and structural elucidation. Retention time changes across varying mobile-phase pHs (2.7, 5.0, and 9.0) revealed substantial shifts for oligomers with ionizable functional groups, allowing quantitative insights into their acid–base properties (pKa). These experimentally determined hydrophobicity values (i.e., log Kow) deviated from computational estimations from a suite of available tools across polymer chemistries, highlighting inadequacies in existing estimation models and the opportunity for the rapid measurement of these important physicochemical properties using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry workflows.

Here, we followed up by testing submixtures of four PMs (PM#3, PM#4, PC1-OC-Mix, and PC2-PFAS-Mix), separated by the chemical classes perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Submixtures of PFAS and OCPs induced significant effects on testosterone synthesis at low (1×) and medium (10×) concentrations, consistent with effects observed in the corresponding whole PMs, and were therefore likely the primary drivers of the whole-mixture effects on testosterone. Notably, some submixtures altered estradiol and testosterone levels in ways not observed in full PMs, suggesting antagonistic interactions across chemical classes when combined. Potential antagonistic interaction in more complex mixtures, independent of concentration, was also observed within OCP submixtures, as only the less complex OCP mixtures lacking DDE or DDT induced testosterone synthesis. For additional mechanistic insight, we expanded the H295R assay to include oxidative stress analyses, which revealed no effects from the PMs. RT-qPCR analysis showed downregulation of CYP11A1 after exposure to PM#3 and PM#4 at high concentrations (100×), suggesting a feedback mechanism contributing to suppressed testosterone synthesis."

This work describes the occurrence of micropollutants in Goreangab Reservoir water and assesses the removal of a target steroid hormone micropollutant, 17β-estradiol (E2), with various emerging membrane processes. Results show that a variety of micropollutants exist in water, and many of them exceed the European guideline concentration values for surface water. While nanofiltration provides only moderate E2 removal (50 ± 9% for loose and 81 ± 4% for dense NF) from an initial concentration of 100 ng L–1, reactive photocatalytic membranes and a combination of ultrafiltration (UF) and adsorption by polymer-based spherical activated carbon (PBSAC) can remove 85–98% of E2, bringing the water quality closer to the target guideline (0.4 ng L–1). Water components such as organic matter, ions, and other micropollutants interfered with E2 removal to varying degrees, highlighting the requirement for pretreatment and process validation with real water. UF-PBSAC achieves good E2 removal at a comparatively low pressure, resulting in low energy consumption. The amount of energy required to apply light irradiation and voltage in photo- and electrocatalytic membrane systems is significant based on theoretical estimation."

Here, we address both limitations by developing a 3D-engineered e-biosensor with a synergistically optimized material composition and geometric architecture. A novel electroactive living material was fabricated by incorporating Ca2+-doped PEDOT:PSS to enhance microbial extracellular electron transport. The living material was then engineered into a grid-structure e-biosensor by extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, significantly improving analyte mass transport to the sensing cells. This dual optimization resulted in the 3D-engineered e-biosensor exhibiting a 6.3-fold increase in baseline current, a 1.9-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and an extended operational stability (>140 h) relative to conventional biofilm-based counterparts. Moreover, the 3D-engineered e-biosensors demonstrated a rapid response (<20 min) to various toxic pollutants, including Cr(VI) and nitrobenzene.

Due to their growing global demand and limited primary sources, there is an urgent need to explore alternative sources for REEs recovery. Oil sand tailings, a major byproduct of bitumen extraction processes, represent an underexplored source of REEs and other valuable metals. In this study, we investigated the mineralogical and biogeochemical characteristics of three distinct oil sands tailing streams to assess their potential as a secondary source of REEs and to better understand their speciation and distribution mechanisms. Chemical analyses of these tailings indicated elevated concentrations of several metals, such as aluminum (≈94,490 mg/kg), titanium (≈10,210 mg/kg), magnesium (≈5891 mg/kg), and manganese (≈1060 mg/kg). REEs concentrations ranged from 442.72 to 797.79 mg/kg, highlighting the tailings’ potential for resource recovery. The extraction of REEs from such waste streams aligns with the “waste-to-resource” concept, offering an environmentally sustainable route to strategic material supply diversification. This study provides critical insights into the complex interplay among mineralogy, geochemistry, and microbiology of REEs and other valuable elements in oil sands tailings. By assessing the mechanisms of metal association and mobilization, our findings aim to contribute to the development of targeted extraction strategies and support the broader goal of sustainable resource recovery from industrial waste streams."

Masteller,Tectonics as a Regulator of Shoreline Retreat and Rocky Coast Evolution Across Timescales,"Rocky coast morphology is shaped by interactions between wave action, sea level, and tectonics over millennial time scales. However, a clear and quantifiable signature of tectonic uplift on decadal to centennial shoreline retreat rates is outstanding. We isolate the contribution of tectonic uplift to setting shoreline retreat and shore platform morphology from other marine and geologic drivers across the West Coast of the USA. Specifically, we find that decadal‐scale tectonic uplift, derived from tide gauge records, exerts a significant and measurable control on shoreline retreat rates. Additional influences from wave action, shore platform morphology, and tidal range further contribute to the regional patterns in coastal erosion, and together these factors enable accurate prediction of retreat rates using a multivariate model. Our analysis also reveals robust, time‐scale dependent relationships between uplift rate, shore platform morphology, and shoreline retreat. On decadal time scales, rapid tectonic uplift acts as a buffer, shielding the shore from wave action, slowing retreat, and corresponding with narrow shore platforms. On millennial time scales, higher uplift rates relate to wider shore platforms, reflecting greater cumulative shoreline retreat. These observations likely reflect the effects of episodic, seismically driven subsidence, which shifts wave action landward, enhancing wave‐driven erosion. Through repeated cycles of uplift and subsidence, the seismic cycle amplifies both shore platform development and long‐term retreat. Together, these findings highlight the critical role of tectonics in shaping shoreline retreat and driving landscape evolution timescales on active margins."

Wolff,Structural Accommodation as a Coastal Adaptation Response to Sea‐Level Rise: Lessons From Europe,"Global sea‐level rise is intensifying pressures on coastal regions, increasing the need for adaptation strategies (e.g., protect, retreat, accommodate). At the same time, decision makers require a better understanding of the available responses to address the widening adaptation implementation gap. Structural measures aimed at reducing the impacts of coastal hazards as part of the accommodation strategy have received limited attention in the coastal adaptation literature with few studies looking at how it is currently considered to address sea‐level rise. We first advance a conceptual framework that separates structural from non‐structural accommodation, recognizing that this distinction is essential to accurately define the adaptation “solution space.” Building on this framework, we synthesize scientific and gray literature, conduct a multilevel review of policy and technical documents, and draw on expert input to not only evaluate the current state of structural accommodation in Europe but also to highlight generic lessons for its potential implementation. This includes consideration of its advantages and disadvantages. Uptake remains fragmented and highly localized, embedded mainly in municipal spatial planning rather than national adaptation agendas, and is hampered by financial, institutional, and technical constraints. We argue that stronger policy integration and dedicated financial incentives could overcome these barriers and harness accommodation's value as a flexible option capable of reducing risk and avoiding long‐term lock‐in. This study improves our understanding of how this strategy can contribute to coastal resilience in Europe and beyond."

 Deep mantle melting marks the onset of Earth differentiation1, yet a unifying framework for how buoyancy-driven mantle upwellings initiate melting and how such incipient melts evolve within the asthenosphere has remained elusive. Here we show that the first melts generated in any solid-state mantle upwelling are kimberlitic CO2-rich silicate melts that form at about 250 km depth through oxidation of elemental carbon to CO2 (refs. 2,3). Our experiments force a range of surface melts, derived from mantle plumes4 or broad upwellings5 (kimberlites, ocean island basalts and mid-ocean ridge basalts), into equilibrium with fertile mantle at adiabatic and super-adiabatic conditions at 7 GPa. The results define a framework in which redox melting at depth universally yields kimberlitic melts, which, while ascending through the asthenosphere by reactive porous flow6,7, evolve to higher degrees of melting, lesser volatiles and incompatible elements, but higher SiO2. Channelized flow7 in the lithosphere may then enable direct extraction of these melts, leading to kimberlites, where the lithosphere commences just above the C → CO2 redox front, to alkaline Si-undersaturated intraplate magmas where lithospheric thicknesses are 150–100 km, and to tholeiitic basalts below mid-ocean ridges where voluminous ‘dry’ melting becomes overwhelming. This framework is consistent with the widespread seismic low-velocity zone at about 250 km beneath mid-ocean ridges8,9 and aligns with ocean island and mid-ocean ridge basalts sampling the various geochemical mantle components at different degrees of melting in different proportions10,11.

 CD8+ T cells differentiate into diverse states that shape immune outcomes in cancer and chronic infection1–4. To define systematically the transcription factors (TFs) driving these states, we built a comprehensive atlas integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data across nine CD8+ T cell states and inferred TF activity profiles. Our analysis catalogued TF activity fingerprints, uncovering regulatory mechanisms governing selective cell state differentiation. Leveraging this platform, we focused on two transcriptionally similar but functionally opposing states that are critical in tumour and viral contexts: terminally exhausted T (TEXterm) cells, which are dysfunctional5–8, and tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, which are protective9–13. Global TF community analysis revealed distinct biological pathways and TF-driven networks underlying protective versus dysfunctional states. Through in vivo CRISPR screening integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (in vivo Perturb-seq) we delineated several TFs that selectively govern TEXterm cell differentiation. We also identified HIC1 and GFI1 as shared regulators of TEXterm and TRM cell differentiation and KLF6 as a unique regulator of TRM cells. We discovered new TEXterm-selective TFs, including ZSCAN20 and JDP2, with no previous known function in T cells. Targeted deletion of these TFs enhanced tumour control and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade but did not interfere with TRM cell formation. Consistently, their depletion in human T cells reduces the expression of inhibitory receptors and improves effector function. By decoupling exhaustion TEX-selective from protective TRM cell programmes, our platform enables more precise engineering of T cell states, accelerating the rational design of more effective cellular immunotherapies.

 Promoters are the core regulatory elements of all genes. Their activity ensures the correct transcription level of each individual gene, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and responses to a wide range of signals. One of the major challenges in genomics is to build computational models that accurately predict genome-wide gene expression from the sequences of regulatory elements1. Here we present promoter activity regulatory model (PARM), a cell-type-specific deep-learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that query human promoter sequences. PARM is experimentally and computationally lightweight so that cell-type-specific and condition-specific models can be generated that reliably predict autonomous promoter activity across the genome from the DNA sequence alone. PARM can also design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors that probably contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter and to detect the rewiring of these regulatory interactions after various stimuli to the cells. We also uncovered and experimentally confirmed substantial positional preferences of transcription factors that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions and a complex grammar of motif–motif interactions. Our approach provides a highly economic strategy towards a deeper understanding of the dynamic regulation of human promoters by transcription factors. PARM is a deep-learning model trained on data from massively parallel reporter assays to help predict promoter activity in different human cell types, design synthetic promoters and identify key features of regulatory promoter grammar."

 Exposure to cytosolic DNA triggers innate immune responses through cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)1,2,3. After binding to DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP as a second messenger that binds to stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a signalling adaptor protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)3–5. STING then traffics from the ER through the Golgi to perinuclear vesicle clusters, which leads to activation of the kinases TBK1 and IKK and subsequent induction of interferons and other cytokines6–9. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2; also known as PI(3,5)P2) is an endogenous ligand of STING that functions together with cGAMP to induce STING activation. Proteomic analyses identified a constitutive interaction between STING and PIKFYVE, an enzyme that produces PtdIns(3,5)P2 in mammalian cells. Deletion of PIKFYVE blocked STING trafficking from the ER and TBK1 activation. In vitro reconstitution uncovered a strong and selective effect of PtdIns(3,5)P2 on STING activation by cGAMP. PtdIns(3,5)P2 bound directly to STING in fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. Consistently, cryo-electron microscopy revealed that PtdIns(3,5)P2 promotes cGAMP-induced STING oligomerization10, functioning as a molecular glue. Similar to PIKFYVE depletion, mutation of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding residues in STING largely blocked its trafficking and downstream signalling. These findings reveal that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is a lipid ligand of STING with essential roles in innate immunity.

 In pursuit of a practical quantum advantage1, analogue quantum systems provide an invaluable way to simulate the physics of quantum materials2–4, quantum systems out of equilibrium5,6 or interaction-induced localization7. Notable recent progress to realize such systems has been achieved in ultracold atoms8–12, superconducting circuits13–15 and twisted van der Waals materials16–19. However, so far, these platforms have struggled to simulate large-scale strongly interacting fermionic systems at low temperatures, at which electronic correlations dominate materials properties and numerical simulations remain restricted in accuracy and scope20,21. Here we demonstrate the realization of a new platform consisting of large-scale 2D arrays of sub-nanometre precision-engineered atom-based quantum dots (15,000 sites) to simulate strongly interacting, low-temperature physics. By observing a metal–insulator (MI) transition on a 2D square lattice of atom-based quantum dots, we demonstrate independent and precise control of the on-site interaction U and tunnelling t. Magneto-transport measurements further indicate the formation of an insulating state driven by Mott–Hubbard/Anderson physics and promising signatures of correlated electron physics. These precision-engineered analogue quantum simulators provide a unique platform to simulate quantum materials on arbitrary 2D lattices and to explore many unanswered questions in the formation of quantum magnetism, interacting topological quantum matter and unconventional superconductivity.

Despite being a smaller open model, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 6.1% and PaperQA2 by 5.5% in correctness on a challenging multi-paper synthesis task from the new ScholarQABench. Although GPT-4o hallucinates citations 78–90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts.

 Fast and reliable validation of new designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery development remains bottlenecked by the high time and energy costs required to evaluate the lifetime of new designs1,2. Notably, existing lifetime forecasting approaches require datasets containing battery lifetime labels for target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions before prototyping, thus limiting rapid feedback3,4. Here we introduce Discovery Learning, a scientific machine learning approach that integrates active learning5, physics-guided learning6 and zero-shot learning7 into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from educational psychology. Discovery Learning can learn from historical battery designs and reduce the need for prototyping, thereby predicting the lifetime of new designs from minimal experiments. To test Discovery Learning, we present industrial-grade battery data comprising 123 large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, including diverse material–design combinations and cycling protocols. Trained on public datasets of cell designs different from ours, Discovery Learning achieves 7.2% test error in predicting cycle life using physical features from the first 50 cycles of 51% of cell prototypes. Under conservative assumptions, this results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared with conventional practices.

 Bacteria use diverse mechanisms to protect themselves against phages1–6. Many antiphage systems form large oligomeric complexes, but how oligomerization is regulated during phage infection remains mostly unknown7–12. Here we demonstrate that the bacterial immunity protein ring-activated zinc-finger RNase (RAZR) assembles into an active, 24-meric ring around the circumference of large ring structures formed by two unrelated phage proteins: a putative recombinase and a portal protein. Each multi-layered, megadalton-scale complex enables RAZR to cleave RNA nonspecifically to inhibit translation and restrict phage propagation. The recognition of unrelated phage proteins that form rings with similar diameters indicates that these proteins not only bind to RAZR but also enforce a geometry crucial to activation. The lack of large ring structures in the host probably prevents auto-immunity and RAZR activation before infection. The infection-triggered oligomerization of RAZR mirrors pathogen-induced oligomerization in eukaryotic innate immune complexes13, underscoring a common principle of immunity across biology. An antiphage defence system has an activation mechanism that relies on the sensing of phage-encoded proteins that enforce geometry crucial to activation and are not typically present in non-infected cells."

 Fractionalization of the electron charge e is one of the most striking phenomena arising from strong electron–electron interactions. A celebrated example is the emergence of anyons with fractional charges in fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states1–13. Recently, zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCIs)14–19, lattice analogues of the FQHE states that form without Landau levels, have been realized20,21. FCIs provide a unique platform to investigate anyons, yet their detection remains a challenge. Here we report the observation of anyon–trions, a new type of excitonic complex formed by binding a trion with a fractional charge in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Photoluminescence spectroscopy of quantum-confined excitons reveals emergent peaks that appear only within slightly doped FCI states. The new spectral features are red-shifted relative to the trions in undoped FCIs, but share the same electric field, temperature and magnetic field dependence. These observations suggest their origin as trions binding with elementary quasi-particles, that is, anyon–trions. Crucially, the ratio of binding energies between the anyon–trions in the −2/3 and −3/5 FCI states matches the expected fractional charge ratio of e/3 to e/5. This provides strong evidence for fractional charges in FCI—an essential property of anyons. Our results address a fundamental question in FCI physics and establish trion spectroscopy as a powerful probe of fractionally charged excitations, complementary to transport- and tunnelling-based approaches. Fractionally charged excitations at zero magnetic field in twisted MoTe2 bilayers, a recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous Hall system, are observed via anyon-trions, excitonic complexes formed by binding a trion to a fractional charge."

 Bacteria have evolved a wide array of defence systems to combat phage infection, many of which rely on complex signalling systems and large protein complexes to function1. Here we describe a 164-residue prophage-encoded protein that defends bacteria by sensing conserved oligomeric components of phage assembly. This protein, called ring interacting pore 1 (Rip1), is activated by the portal or small terminase proteins of infecting phages—oligomeric ring-shaped complexes that are essential for virion maturation. Rip1 uses these phage protein ring complexes as a template to assemble into membrane-disrupting pores that inhibit phage virion assembly and cause premature death of the host cell. Rip1 homologues are widely distributed across bacteria and provide robust defence against diverse phages. This study reveals a strategy by which a small defence protein integrates both sensing and effector activity by exploiting a conserved feature of viral assembly. The mechanism mirrors eukaryotic pore-forming immunity but is executed by a single protein, offering an evolutionarily streamlined solution to viral detection and defence. Bacteria use diverse defence systems against phages, including a 164-residue prophage-encoded protein, Rip1, which senses conserved phage assembly rings to form membrane pores that block virion maturation and trigger premature host cell death."

In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, in which the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional (2D) copper–oxygen (CuO2) planes4,5, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at subgap millielectronvolt (meV) energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers6–9. However, within the CuO2 planes, the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation2,6,9,10. Here we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, 2D superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply subdiffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance—absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase—and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum-dependent and frequency-dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions.

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable neurological disorder that often begins insidiously with sleep disturbances and somatic symptoms, progressing to whole-body motor and cognitive symptoms1–5. Dysfunction of the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN)—which is thought to control action execution6,7 by coordinating arousal, organ physiology and whole-body motor plans with behavioural motivation—is a potential contributor to the diverse clinical manifestations of PD. To investigate the role of the SCAN in PD pathophysiology and treatments (medications, deep-brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and MRI-guided focused ultrasound stimulation (MRgFUS)), we built a large (n = 863), multimodal, multi-intervention clinical imaging dataset. Resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the substantia nigra and all PD DBS targets (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral intermediate thalamus) are selectively connected to the SCAN rather than to effector-specific motor regions. Importantly, PD was characterized by specific hyperconnectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex. We therefore followed six PD cohorts undergoing DBS, TMS, MRgFUS and levodopa therapy using precision resting-state functional connectivity and electrocorticography recording. Efficacious treatments reduced SCAN-to-subcortex hyperconnectivity. Targeting the SCAN instead of effector regions doubled the efficacy of TMS treatments. Focused ultrasound treatment benefits increased when the target was closer to the thalamic SCAN sweet spot. Thus, SCAN hyperconnectivity is central to PD pathophysiology and its alleviation is a hallmark of successful neuromodulation. Targeting functionally defined subcortical SCAN nodes may improve existing therapies (DBS, MRgFUS), whereas cortical SCAN targets offer effective non-invasive or minimally invasive neuromodulation for PD. The substantia nigra and all Parkinson’s disease deep-brain stimulation targets are selectively connected to the somato-cognitive action network rather than to effector-specific motor regions."

 Copy number variants (CNVs) are key drivers of human diversity and disease risk1. Here we evaluate the role of CNVs across a broad range of human phenotypes and diseases by analysing CNVs from 470,727 UK Biobank whole-genome sequences and conducting a variant- and gene-level phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 2,941 plasma protein abundance measurements, 13,336 binary clinical phenotypes and 1,911 quantitative traits. Proteomic analyses validated functional associations of CNVs with nearby genes (cis-protein quantitative trait loci; cis-pQTLs)—with deletions and duplications typically associated with reduced and increased protein levels, respectively—and uncovered previously unknown protein–protein interactions (trans-pQTLs). Our PheWAS recapitulated known associations and uncovered associations in both coding and non-coding regions. Notably, we identified a rare deletion in ZNF451 associated with increased leukocyte telomere length and a non-coding deletion of a SLC2A9 enhancer associated with reduced gout risk. In addition, by combining CNVs with protein-coding single nucleotide variants and indels, we enhanced the power of our study to detect gene–disease associations. Finally, we leveraged this multiomics dataset to identify several pQTLs that constitute candidate biomarkers, including TMPRSS5 for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A. This multiancestry whole-genome-sequence CNV PheWAS offers insights into the roles of CNVs in human health outcomes and could serve as a valuable resource for therapeutic development.

 Body–brain communication has emerged as a key regulator of tissue homeostasis1–5. Solid tumours are innervated by different branches of the peripheral nervous system and increased tumour innervation is associated with poor cancer outcomes6–8. However, it remains unclear how the brain senses and responds to tumours in peripheral organs, and how tumour–brain communication influences cancer immunity. Here we identify a tumour–brain axis that promotes oncogenesis by establishing an immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Combining genetically engineered mouse models with neural tracing, tissue imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that lung adenocarcinoma induces innervation and functional engagement of vagal sensory neurons, a major interoceptive system connecting visceral organs to the brain. Mechanistically, Npy2r-expressing vagal sensory nerves transmit signals from lung tumours to brainstem nuclei, driving elevated sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment. This, in turn, suppresses anti-tumour immunity via β2 adrenergic signalling in alveolar macrophages. Disruption of this sensory-to-sympathetic pathway through genetic, pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches significantly inhibited lung tumour growth by enhancing immune responses against cancer. Collectively, these results reveal a bidirectional tumour–brain communication involving vagal sensory input and sympathetic output that cooperatively regulate anti-cancer immunity; targeting this tumour–brain circuit may provide new treatments for visceral organ cancers. Mouse models demonstrate that vagal sensory neurons transmit signals from lung adenocarcinoma to the brain, increasing sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment and thereby creating a immunologically permissive environment for tumour growth."

 The first billion years of Earth history witnessed the emergence of continental magmatism, oceans and life. Yet, the details of how continents formed remain unknown because of the absence of preserved rocks1–8. Two conflicting Hadean models predominate: early onset of subduction and plate tectonics2–4, compared with early stagnant-lid and plume processes with delayed (post-Hadean) plate tectonics5–7. Here we report trace-element ratios (including Nb–Sc–U–Yb) correlated with age and hafnium and oxygen isotope ratios for Hadean detrital zircons from the Jack Hills (JH), Western Australia, which record unprecedented insights into the timing and setting of early magmatism. More than 70% of Hadean JH detrital zircons have Sc/Yb > 0.1, and 47% have U/Nb > 20, fingerprints for continental-arc and subduction settings. The remainder are ocean-island-like with little evidence for ocean-ridge settings. Hadean JH zircons probably originated from distinct terranes with separate tectonic histories. Subduction-related magmatism in the Hadean, as documented by JH zircons, alternated with periods of magmatic quiescence. This contrasts with dominantly stagnant-lid-like signatures for most Barberton Hadean zircons. The diverse settings for Jack Hills and Barberton detrital zircons imply contemporaneous operation of different tectonic styles during the Hadean, as well as a broader diversity of early crustal origins than previously known.

Ulrich Hartl,Single-molecule dynamics of the TRiC chaperonin system in vivo,"Single-particle tracking experiments in intact cells reveal dynamic co- and post-translational interactions of the TRiC–PFD chaperonin complex with client proteins during in vivo protein folding. 
 The essential chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC) (also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT)) mediates protein folding in cooperation with the co-chaperone prefoldin (PFD)1–5. In vitro experiments have shown that the cylindrical TRiC complex facilitates folding through ATP-regulated client protein encapsulation6–9. However, the functional dynamics of the chaperonin system in vivo remain unexplored. Here we developed single-particle tracking in human cells to monitor the interactions of TRiC–PFD with newly synthesized proteins. Both chaperones engaged nascent polypeptides repeatedly in brief probing events typically lasting around one second, with PFD recruiting TRiC. As shown with the chaperonin client actin8, the co-translational interactions of PFD and TRiC increased in frequency and lifetime during chain elongation. Close to translation termination, PFD bound for several seconds, facilitating TRiC recruitment for post-translational folding involving multiple reaction cycles of around 2.5 s. Notably, the lifetimes of TRiC interactions with a folding-defective actin mutant were markedly prolonged, indicating that client conformational properties modulate TRiC function. Mutant actin continued cycling on TRiC until it was targeted for degradation. TRiC often remained confined near its client protein between successive binding cycles, suggesting that the chaperonin machinery operates within a localized ‘protective zone’ in which free diffusion is restricted. Together, these findings offer detailed insight into the single-molecule dynamics and supramolecular organization of the chaperonin system in the cellular environment. Single-particle tracking experiments in intact cells reveal dynamic co- and post-translational interactions of the TRiC–PFD chaperonin complex with client proteins during in vivo protein folding."

 ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas are malignant brain tumours defined by fusions formed between the putative chromatin remodeller ZFTA and the NF-κB mediator RELA1. Here we show that ZFTA–RELA+ cells produce itaconate, a key macrophage-associated immunomodulatory metabolite2. Itaconate is generated by cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1; also known as IRG1). However, the production of itaconate by tumour cells and its tumour-intrinsic role are not well established. ACOD1 is upregulated in a ZFTA–RELA-dependent manner. Functionally, itaconate enables a feed-forward system that is crucial for the maintenance of pathogenic ZFTA–RELA levels. Itaconate epigenetically activates ZFTA–RELA transcription by enriching for activating H3K4me3 via inhibition of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5. ZFTA–RELA+ tumours enhance glutamine metabolism to supply carbons for itaconate synthesis. Antagonism of ACOD1 or glutamine metabolism reduces pathogenic ZFTA–RELA levels and is potently therapeutic in multiple in vivo models. Mechanistically, ZFTA–RELA epigenetically suppresses PTEN expression to upregulate PI3K–mTOR signalling, a known driver of glutaminolysis. Finally, suppression of ACOD1 or a combination of glutamine antagonism with PI3K–mTOR inhibition abrogates spinal metastasis. Our data demonstrate that ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas subvert a macrophage-like itaconate metabolic pathway to maintain expression of the ZFTA–RELA driver, which implicates itaconate as a candidate oncometabolite. Taken together, our results position itaconate upregulation as a previously unappreciated driver of ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas. Our work has implications for future drug development to reduce pathogenic ZFTA–RELA expression for this brain tumour, and will advance our understanding of oncometabolites as a new class of therapeutic dependencies in cancers. The ZFTA–RELA fusion, an oncogene for ependymomas, promotes the production of itaconate, and its dependence on this metabolite represents a new therapeutic target for this cancer."

 Spin-wave (SW) filters using single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is an attractive technology for integration in frequency-adjustable or frequency-tunable communication systems1. However, existing SW devices do not have sufficient bandwidth for future 5G and 6G communication systems2,3, are too large or have strong spurious passbands, creating unintentional cross-channel interference.

The filters developed in this work demonstrate loss as low as 2.54 dB, bandwidths up to 663 MHz, centre-frequency tuning over several octaves from 7.08 to 21.6 GHz and high linearity with an input-referred third-order intercept point of more than 11 dBm in the passband. The operation of the filter is also experimentally demonstrated in a frequency-tunable radio system.

 Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moiré lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometre scales, leading to numerous ground-breaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. Here we introduce the atomic single electron transistor (SET), a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect in a van der Waals material as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential sensor. Built on the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform1, this probe leverages the capability of the QTM to form a pristine, scannable two-dimensional interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in a canonical moiré interface: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride2–10. The measured potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, minimal dependence on carrier density and a substantial amplitude of approximately 60 mV, even in the absence of carriers. Theory indicates that this symmetry arises from a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. The measured amplitude significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With 1 nm spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the atomic SET enables ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties across a wide range of quantum phenomena, including symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges and fractionalized quasiparticles.

 Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an essential adaptor in the cytosolic DNA-sensing innate immune pathway1. STING is activated by cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) produced by the DNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS)2–5. cGAMP-induced high-order oligomerization and translocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles are critical for STING activation6–11. Other studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) and cholesterol also have important roles in STING activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear12–17. Here we demonstrate that cGAMP-induced high-order oligomerization of STING is enhanced strongly by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and by PtdIns4P to a lesser extent. Our cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal that PtdInsPs together with cholesterol bind at the interface between STING dimers, directly promoting the high-order oligomerization. The structures also provide an explanation for the preference of the STING oligomer to different PtdInsPs. Mutational and biochemical analyses confirm the binding modes of PtdInsPs and cholesterol and their roles in STING activation. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of STING mediated by specific lipids, which may underlie the role of intracellular trafficking in dictating STING signalling.

 Animals use 18–33-nucleotide PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to silence transposons in germ cells1–3. In addition to transposon-silencing piRNAs, placental mammals make pachytene piRNAs4,5, an abundant class of testis-specific small RNAs derived from long noncoding RNA precursors. Although the sites of pachytene piRNA precursor transcription are often conserved among placental mammals, the sequences of the piRNAs themselves are rapidly diverging, even in the human population6. Consequently, the biological function and mechanism of action of pachytene piRNAs remain debated. Here we report that most mouse pachytene piRNAs have no biological function but instead ‘selfishly’ promote their own production. Our data suggest that pachytene piRNAs direct endonucleolytic cleavage of partially complementary targets and neither activate nor repress mRNA translation. Although many pachytene piRNAs guide cleavage of specific mRNAs, few alter the steady-state abundance of their targets. The minority of pachytene piRNAs that reduce target mRNA abundance enhance sperm fitness, thereby ensuring production of the entire pachytene piRNA repertoire. Together, our findings explain the lack of conservation of most pachytene piRNA sequences and suggest that these ‘selfish’ small RNAs persist in mammalian evolution because target cleavage by a tiny minority of piRNAs supports male fertility. Most pachytene PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have no biological function; however, a small population enhances sperm fitness, which has led to their persistence in mammalian evolution."

 Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moiré materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity1–4. However, understanding the relationships between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated parent states remains a challenge. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. Although the outer gap, previously associated with the pseudogap phase5,6, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile, in line with previous transport experiments1,2,4. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behaviour of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations. By comparing our results with recent topological heavy fermion (THF) models that include dynamical correlations7,8, we find that the outer gap probably arises from a splitting of the Abrikosov–Suhl–Kondo resonance9,10 owing to the breaking of the valley symmetry. Our results indicate an intricate yet tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene. This study of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene moiré superconductors using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy identifies two energy gaps that develop from many-body resonance in this highly tunable class of materials."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality and there are limited therapies1. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are implicated in HCC, the involvement of the UPR transducer ATF6α remains unclear2. Here we demonstrate the function of ATF6α as an ER-stress-inducing tumour driver and metabolic master regulator restricting cancer immunosurveillance for HCC, in contrast to its well-characterized role as an adaptive response to ER stress3. ATF6α activation in human HCC is significantly correlated with an aggressive tumour phenotype, characterized by reduced patient survival, enhanced tumour progression and local immunosuppression. Hepatocyte-specific ATF6α activation in mice induced progressive hepatitis with ER stress, immunosuppression and hepatocyte proliferation. Concomitantly, activated ATF6α increased glycolysis and directly repressed the gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 by binding to gene regulatory elements. Restoring FBP1 expression limited ATF6α-activation-related pathologies. Prolonged ATF6α activation in hepatocytes triggered hepatocarcinogenesis, intratumoural T cell infiltration and nutrient-deprived immune exhaustion. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)4 restored immunosurveillance and reduced HCC. Consistently, patients with HCC who achieved a complete response to immunotherapy displayed significantly increased ATF6α activation compared with those with a weaker response. Targeting Atf6 through germline ablation, hepatocyte-specific ablation or therapeutic hepatocyte delivery of antisense oligonucleotides dampened HCC in preclinical liver cancer models. Thus, prolonged ATF6α activation drives ER stress, leading to glycolysis-dependent immunosuppression in liver cancer and sensitizing to ICB. Our findings suggest that persistently activated ATF6α is a tumour driver, a potential stratification marker for ICB response and a therapeutic target for HCC. ATF6α activation in human and preclinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma is significantly associated with an aggressive tumour phenotype characterized by reduced survival, glycolytic reprogramming and local immunosuppression."

Driskell,Rete ridges form via evolutionarily distinct mechanisms in mammalian skin,"A spatial and single-cell transcriptomics study across multiple mammalian species identifies epidermal BMP signalling as a functional requirement for rete ridge formation, providing insight into mechanisms underlying hair density loss and wound healing. 
 The loss of fur during human evolution has long mystified scientists and the public1–5. Reduced hair density coincides with acquisition of epidermal rete ridges, the developmental timing and molecular mechanisms of which are poorly understood despite their prominence in humans1,6–9. Examination of human and pig skin development has shown that rete ridges form through a mechanism independent from those of hair follicles10,11 and sweat glands3,4,12–15 by establishing interconnected epidermal invaginations. Here we document the occurrence of rete ridges across Mammalia, including in grizzly bears and dolphins, and show that neonatal pig wounds can regenerate them de novo. Multispecies spatiotemporal transcriptomics identifies significant signalling interactions between epidermal and dermal cells during rete ridge morphogenesis, particularly through bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). We also demonstrate that mouse fingerpad skin forms rete ridges and functionally requires epidermal BMP signalling. We propose that evolution of rete ridges in mammalian skin involved replacement of the molecular program for formation of discrete microscopic appendages, including hair follicles and sweat glands, with a distinct program for the interconnected appendage network. Broad epidermal activation of BMP is required for the development of rete ridge networks organized around underlying dermal pockets. Understanding rete ridge mechanisms may enable development of therapeutic approaches to regenerate epidermal appendages lost during wounding or disease in humans. A spatial and single-cell transcriptomics study across multiple mammalian species identifies epidermal BMP signalling as a functional requirement for rete ridge formation, providing insight into mechanisms underlying hair density loss and wound healing."

 Multiple mosquito species serve as competent vectors to carry and transmit numerous flaviviruses1,2. Several long-standing scientific questions remain to be answered, including identification of the fundamental factors that facilitate flavivirus infectivity in mosquitoes and the genetic basis that contributes to the naturally occurring interspecies specificity of mosquitoes to flaviviruses3–8, such as Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to dengue virus (DENV). Here we report that circulating mature virions are inactivated by the acidity of mosquito haemolymph; thus, extracellular vesicles carrying replication-competent viral nucleocapsids serve as the predominant means of intercellular viral dissemination. Mechanistically, mosquito valosin-containing protein (VCP) binds to the viral capsid, thereby allowing the incorporation of nucleocapsids into extracellular vesicles. The capsid of a flavivirus (such as DENV) selectively binds to the VCP of its natural vector (Ae. aegypti), but not to that of an incompetent vector (for example, Culex quinquefasciatus). Replacing the DENV capsid with that of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) renders DENV infectious in the haemolymph of the natural JEV vector, Cx. quinquefasciatus. Furthermore, two amino residues in Aedes (D723/N728) and Culex (E723/E728) VCP determine its binding specificity for viral capsid, thus contributing to interspecies specificity of mosquitoes to flaviviruses. In vivo ectopic expression of the Cx. quinquefasciatus VCP mutant E723D/E728N renders Cx. quinquefasciatus susceptible to DENV2 via intrathoracic microinjection. Our study provides a major molecular mechanism contributing to the selectivity and compatibility between mosquito vectors and flavivirus species, enabling systemic virus dissemination after the virus reaches the haemocoel. Upstream mechanisms that determine specificity at the midgut level remain to be determined. Systemic flavivirus dissemination in mosquitoes following initial infection requires protein–protein interactions within extracellular vesicles, which enable infectious particles to be transported through haemolymph and confer species specificity."

 Photoreceptor proteins regulate fundamental biological processes such as vision, photosynthesis and circadian rhythms1. A large photoreceptor subfamily uses vitamin B12 derivatives for light sensing2, contrasting with the well-established mode of action of these organometallic derivatives in thermally activated enzymatic reactions3. The exact molecular mechanism of B12 photoreception and how this differs from the thermal pathways remains unknown. Here we provide a detailed description of photoactivation in the prototypical B12 photoreceptor CarH4,5 from nanoseconds to seconds, combining time-resolved and temperature-resolved structural and spectroscopic methods with quantum chemical calculations. Building on the crystal structures of the initial tetrameric dark and final monomeric light-activated states5, our structural snapshots of key intermediates in the truncated B12-binding domain illustrate how photocleavage of a cobalt–carbon (Co–C) bond within the B12 chromophore adenosylcobalamin triggers a series of structural changes that propagate throughout CarH. Breakage of the photolabile Co–C5′ bond leads to the formation of a previously unknown adduct that links the C4′ position of the adenosyl moiety to the Co ion and can subsequently be cleaved thermally over longer timescales to allow release of the adenosyl group, ultimately causing tetramer dissociation4,5. This adduct, which differentiates CarH from thermally activated B12 enzymes, steers the photoactivation pathway and acts as the molecular bridge between photochemical and photobiological timescales. The biological relevance of our study is corroborated by kinetic data on full-length CarH in the presence of DNA. Our results offer a spatiotemporal understanding of CarH photoactivation and pave the way for designing B12-dependent photoreceptors for optogenetic applications. Spatiotemporal insight into photoactivation of the prototypical B12 photoreceptor CarH is revealed across nine orders of magnitude in time, identifying a transient adduct that distinguishes it from thermally activated B12 enzymes."

 Telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly is the ultimate goal for de novo genome assembly. Existing algorithms1,2 capable of near-T2T assembly all require Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) ultra-long reads, which are costly and experimentally challenging to obtain and are thus often unavailable for samples without established cell lines3. Here we introduce hifiasm (ONT), an algorithm that can produce near-T2T assemblies from standard ONT simplex reads, eliminating the need for ultra-long sequencing. Compared with existing methods, hifiasm (ONT) reduces computational demands by an order of magnitude and reconstructs more chromosomes from telomere to telomere on the same datasets. This advance substantially broadens the feasibility of T2T assembly for applications previously limited by the high cost and experimental requirement of ultra-long reads.

 The vacuum is now understood to have a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields1 and a condensate of virtual quark–antiquark pairs. The spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry2, signalled by the nonvanishing quark condensate

The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement4 remains a profound open question in quantum chromodynamics (QCD)—the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High-energy proton–proton collisions could liberate virtual quark–antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate.

Measurements by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal a relative polarization signal of (18 ± 4)% that links the virtual spin-correlated quark pairs from the QCD vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental model for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.

 Chemically reactive microbial natural products have enabled therapeutic development1 via their well-established anticancer, antibiotic and antioxidant activities. However, discovery of reactive metabolites is particularly challenging because they may not tolerate traditional bioactivity-guided isolation workflows2. Diazo-containing natural products are a subset of highly reactive microbial metabolites that display potent bioactivity3 and enable powerful biosynthetic transformations4,5; however, instability of the diazo group to light6, heat7, mild acid8 and mechanical shock9 has precluded their efficient discovery and application. Here we develop a reactivity-based screening approach to capture diazo-containing metabolites and facilitate their discovery by mass spectrometry. This workflow revealed two novel diazo-containing natural products, 4-diazo-3-oxobutanoic acid (1) and diazoacetone (2), from the human lung pathogen Nocardia ninae. Biosynthetic investigations revealed a distinct enzymatic logic for diazo formation involving hydrazone oxidation catalysed by the metalloenzyme Dob3, and its biochemical characterization suggests promising future applications in biocatalysis. Overall, our work highlights the power of reactivity-guided strategies for identifying reactive metabolites and facilitating the discovery of unique enzymatic transformations.

Here, authors use electrophysiological, optical and computational methods to investigate the structural changes that drive Kv7.4-channel opening, and how these are impaired by a deafness-causing mutation 
 KCNQ4-encoded KV7.4 voltage-gated potassium channels are expressed in hair-cells of the inner ear. Loss-of-function variants in KCNQ4 cause non-syndromic progressive hearing loss (DFNA2). KV7.4 pore opening requires voltage-dependent conformational changes (activation) of the voltage-sensor domains (VSDs); however, how fast charge displacement during VSD activation is coupled to slow channel opening is currently unclear. Here, we optically tracked KV7.4 VSD activation with voltage-clamp fluorometry, leveraging two fluorophores and pulsed excitation, and found that VSD activation comprises several voltage-dependent transitions, some with kinetics and voltage-dependence matching those of channel opening and closing. The DFNA2-causing R216H mutation impairs VSD movement and channel opening by destabilizing the active VSD configuration, a result confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. We propose that the KV7.4 VSD activates in two steps: a fast movement representing a first transition to an intermediate activation state, followed by slower component(s) that fully activate the VSD and drive channel opening.

This study shows that residual sex in apomictic hickories causes recombination-driven loss of heterozygosity that exposes harmful mutations to selection and helps maintain clonality. 
 Apomixis, a form of clonal asexual reproduction in plants, is often accompanied by residual sex, yet its genomic consequences remain poorly understood. Here, we assembled a haplotype-resolved genome of Carya hunanensis and analyzed whole-genome resequencing data from 195 adults and 180 mature embryos across four hickory species, representing a hybrid apomictic complex with both sexual and asexual lineages. We find apomictic species exhibited genomic signatures of clonality, notably loss of heterozygosity (LOH), suggesting recombination induced by rare sexual events. Despite harboring more heterozygous deleterious variants, apomictic adults showed lower realized mutation loads, particularly in hybrid C. hunanensis, whose apomictic haplotype disproportionately carried deleterious alleles. Remarkably, rare embryos from apomicts underwent recombination-mediated LOH, exposing deleterious mutations to selection. These findings reveal the genetic cost of residual sex, while also indicating its role in generating novel genotypes, supported by close relatedness among adult apomicts. Our study provides a unique genomic snapshot of how residual sex and recombination mitigate mutation accumulation and potentially facilitate clonal maintenance in natural asexual systems.

 Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are crucial for cancer immunosurveillance. While mouse type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) control acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by targeting leukemia stem cells (LSCs), the role of human ILC1s in AML remains largely undefined. Here, we find that ILC1s in AML patients are impaired, with reduced total ILC1 numbers and diminished function. In contrast, healthy donor (HD) ILC1s-derived TNFα inhibits the leukemic transition from CD34+CD38+ to CD34−CD38+ cells and blocks the differentiation of LSCs (CD34+CD38−) into immunosuppressive, macrophage-like leukemia-supporting cells. HD ILC1-derived IFNγ partially suppresses the differentiation of CD34−CD38+ to CD34−CD38− cells. These combined effects limit human leukemogenesis in vivo. We also identify a human ILC1 subset as Lin−CD127+CD161−CRTH2−CD117− (CD161− ILC1s) that can be generated from umbilical cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. This method could provide a reliable source of ILC1s for potential adoptive transfer therapies in AML, offering a therapeutic approach to prolong disease-free survival in AML.

 The practical implementation of lithium metal batteries is hindered by unstable electrode-electrolyte interfaces and sluggish ion transport kinetics. Here, we report a molecular design strategy that remodels electrolyte solvation structures via the formation of hydrogen-bonded domains, thereby enhancing both the thermodynamics and interfacial dynamics of Li+ transport. Specifically, we introduce 2-cyano-N-methylacetamide, an electrochemically stable hydrogen bond donor, as a cosolvent to construct stable nanoscale hydrogen-bonded domains ( < 3.5 Å). 2-Cyano-N-methylacetamide generates both classical (H-bond, Hδ⁺–Oδ⁻) and nonclassical (Z-bond, Nδ⁻–Hδ⁺) hydrogen bonding, which disrupts loosely bound solvated clusters and induces tightly coordinated Li+ solvation structures. The hydrogen-bonded domains facilitate the formation of oriented fast Li+ transport channels. Accordingly, in Li | |LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells cycled under demanding conditions of 4.7 V with a high areal capacity of ~3.0 mAh cm−2, the electrolyte enables a capacity retention of 78.8% after 400 cycles. In addition, a stable 4.7 V lithium metal pouch cell is demonstrated with a specific energy (based on the mass of all components) of 418.2 Wh kg−1.

 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity by providing gene expression data at single-cell resolution, uncovering insights into rare cell populations, cell-cell interactions, and gene regulation. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets have shown great promise in analyzing such data, but existing approaches are often limited to modeling a small subset of highly expressed genes and lack the integration of external gene-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we present scLong, a billion-parameter foundation model pretrained on 48 million cells. scLong performs self-attention across the entire set of 28,000 genes in the human genome. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies between all genes, including lowly expressed ones (containing unexpressed genes with zero expressions), which often play critical roles in cellular processes but are typically excluded by existing foundation models. Additionally, scLong integrates gene knowledge from the Gene Ontology using a graph convolutional network, enriching its contextual understanding of gene functions and relationships. In extensive evaluations, scLong surpasses both state-of-the-art scRNA-seq foundation models and task-specific models across diverse tasks, including predicting transcriptional responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, forecasting cancer drug responses, and inferring gene regulatory networks.

 Invasive species affect freshwater ecosystems and economies worldwide, with their dispersal facilitated by human activities such as shipping and large water transfer projects. Here, we use the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) as a model species and develop an integrated framework that combines a dispersal model for introduction risk with a species distribution model for establishment risk, using global shipping routes and water diversion projects as the main pathways. Our simulations reveal an expansion of high-risk basins over time, particularly after the 1990s, with coastal basins acting as invasion bridgeheads from which populations can spread inland. Several basins in North America, Europe, Australia, the Indochina Peninsula and the Amazon basin, although not yet invaded, emerge as environmentally suitable and increasingly connected, indicating elevated future invasion risk. Our study highlights the importance of implementing management strategies for invasive species, such as ballast water treatment and installing prevention measures in water diversion/transfer schemes.

 African savannas are experiencing a rapid decline in burned area, often entailing a simplification of landscape pyrodiversity. We used virtual landscapes generated from data collected in a multi-decadal fire experiment to test how pyrodiversity (measured as spatial variation in fire frequency) shapes multiple dimensions of three savannas spanning a rainfall gradient in South Africa. Results provide empirical evidence that pyrodiversity begets diversity across structural, functional, and taxonomic dimensions, especially at precipitation ≥650 mm yr⁻1. The positive effects of pyrodiversity arise because patches with different fire frequencies form a diverse landscape mosaic. Critically, the highest woody encroachment, carbon storage, soil nitrogen and woody species diversity was found in low fire frequency patches. On the contrary, the most diverse ground vegetation communities were detected in frequently burned patches. Our findings emphasize the importance of pyrodiversity-based management for maintaining ecosystem diversity and associated services in the face of ongoing environmental changes.

 Rapid urbanization exacerbates conflicts between land expansion and ecosystem preservation, particularly in urban agglomerations, posing challenges to sustainable urban development. Nevertheless, existing research often overlooks the three-dimensional urbanization process. Here we established a framework for coupling coordination degree analysis based on meta-coupling theory to explore relationships between three-dimensional urbanization (both horizontal and vertical dimensions) and multiple ecosystem services, using 19 major urban agglomerations in China from 2005 to 2020 as case studies. The results reveal that, although the coupling coordination degree has generally improved, some urban agglomerations (e.g., Chengdu-Chongqing and Qianzhong) have experienced degradation, and several western and inland regions show persistent or worsening imbalances. Differences between regions are the main contributors to overall variation, yet cross-regional coupling coordination is strengthening. These findings underscore the importance of strengthening inter-regional cooperation by leveraging the spillover influence of advanced cities to support resource sharing—such as ecological data, technology, and restoration funding—and policy alignment in land-use planning and ecological compensation, thereby supporting more balanced and sustainable development.

 Seasonal climate forecasts are inherently uncertain due to the chaotic nature of the climate system and the limitations of predictive models. Quantifying and decomposing this uncertainty are essential for reliable forecasts. In this study, we investigate machine learning-based seasonal forecasting (MLSF) using a Bayesian adaptation of TelNet, a neural network model for precipitation prediction. We reformulate TelNet as a Bayesian Neural Network trained via variational inference, with alternative implementations based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Both continuous (ensemble-based) and categorical (tercile-based) prediction strategies are assessed. Training is conducted with ERA5 reanalysis and historical simulations from 18 CMIP6 models, followed by validation and testing with ERA5 data over South America. We decompose predictive uncertainty into ML-aleatoric (data-related) and ML-epistemic (model-related) components. Results show that ML-aleatoric uncertainty dominates, being on average two orders of magnitude larger than ML-epistemic uncertainty. ERA5-trained models exhibit lower aleatoric uncertainty but are often overconfident and not well-calibrated, whereas CMIP6-trained models show higher aleatoric uncertainty but improved calibration. Models trained with continuous targets achieve lower uncertainty than categorical models, which lose information through discretization. Probabilistic accuracy, evaluated via Ranked Probability Score (RPS), indicates that CMIP6-based models trained with continuous targets and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) loss perform best overall. Seasonal analysis reveals better calibration in austral summer (DJF) compared to winter (JJA), consistent with stronger teleconnection signals during summer. Finally, case studies of El Niño, La Niña, and neutral years demonstrate that forecast confidence and uncertainty strongly depend on the training dataset and target representation."

Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast light-induced spin-flip within 300 fs in Fe3GeTe2, a prototypical two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnet. Notably, by varying the laser fluence, we identify three distinct regimes that emerge assisted by a photoinduced single linear phonon mode, namely demagnetization, spin-flip, and spin-melting. We resolve the dominant role of displacively excited A1gphonons, while nonequilibrium electron occupation is essential to break the degeneracy of the spin up and down states and lower the spin-flip energy barrier. Accompanying the spin-flip, we also observe a sign change of the Berry curvature, implying involvement of nontrivial band topology. Our results provide a general guidance for optical manipulation of spin orders, holding promises for advancing future spintronics and information technology."

This was however associated with blunted responses to pharmacological GLP-1RAs in vivo. Further investigations in β cell models demonstrated that humanGLP1RA316T exhibits characteristics of constitutive activation but dampened GLP-1RA responses. Results are further supported by cryo-EM analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of GLP-1R A316T structure, collectively demonstrating that the A316T variant governs basal GLP-1R activity and pharmacological responses to GLP-1R–targeting therapies."

This hierarchical design synergizes plasmonic enhancement, efficient charge transfer, and enhanced ionization efficiency, achieving sensitivity improvement over conventional matrices. The plasmonic platform affords universal compatibility with currently available biosample preparation protocols including imprinting, stamping, and cryo-sectioning for multitissue MSI. The first whole-plant imprinting MSI ofVigna unguiculatareveals tissue-specific distributions of three pollutants with distinct translocation rate and endogenous metabolites. In addition, 10-micrometer resolution lipid mapping was achieved in stamped fingerprints and cryo-sectioned murine brains. Moreover, we successfully visualized ischemic stroke biomarkers in rat brains for interrogating the pathogenesis of focal ischemia.

The cell biological basis underlying hybrid incompatibility remains largely unknown, especially in mammals. Here, we found that female hybrids betweenMus musculus domesticusandMus spicilegusmice are sterile due to the failure of homologous-chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis, producing aneuploid eggs. This nondisjunction phenotype was driven by the mislocalization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin overprotection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mistargeting. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus,Peromyscus, wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in mammalian speciation."

This study combines school zone shapefiles with census and Civil Rights Database data to explore whether neighborhood racial change in Black populations predicts changes in Black-white school suspension disparities from 2010 to 2018. We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas.

However, all the previous samples were from the lunar nearside and the radiometric ages of those samples that can be associated with particular surfaces are <4.0 billion years. On 25 June 2024, Chang’e-6 successfully returned 1.935-kilogram samples from the lunar farside. The samples included local basalts with an age of 2807 ± 3 million years and the norites with an age of 4247 ± 5 million years likely corresponding to the age of the South Pole–Aitken basin. With these radiometric ages, we refined the lunar chronology function (CF) and verified that it is still consistent with a combination of an exponential decrease and a linear rate. We further derived the impacting rate and found it supports a smooth decay instead of abrupt changes of the impactor flux at early times. The refined lunar CF can be used to obtain more reliable ages for unsampled lunar areas and provide critical constraint for the lunar early impact history."

Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets."

We present a multifunctional optoacoustically augmented magnetic guidewire (OptoMaG) that integrates optoacoustic imaging with magnetic navigation to enable radiation-free, image-guided interventions. The ~250-micrometer flexible guidewire incorporates a 460-nanometer luminescent core with an enhanced optoacoustic signature and a FePt magnetic tip for precise, steerable control. Proof-of-concept studies show that OptoMaG can be actively navigated with external magnetic fields to traverse a 3D human-scale cerebrovascular phantom and accurately reach target brain sites. Beyond navigation, the FePt tip enables localized thermal ablation under remote radiofrequency stimulation, highlighting its theranostic potential for tumor treatment. In addition, OptoMaG functions as a light source for photodynamic therapy, selectively activating photosensitizers to destroy tumor cells while preserving healthy tissue. Collectively, OptoMaG provides a safe, radiation-free platform merging real-time navigation with targeted therapeutic capabilities."

However, whether and howC. albicanscauses remodeling of oral epithelial cell (OEC) metabolism is unclear. Here, we use in vitro experiments and patient biopsies to demonstrate that OECs undergo metabolic reprogramming when infected byC. albicansindependently of candidalysin secretion, increasing glycolysis and decreasing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Glycolysis and glucose transport inhibition show that these pathways support OEC cytokine release, highlighting the partial control of antifungal epithelial immunity by cellular metabolism. However, glucose supplementation disrupts OEC responses both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the fungus benefits from these metabolic shifts and that increased aerobic glycolysis in OECs is detrimental. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicted a shutdown of the TCA cycle and a previously unidentified role for glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) in response toC. albicans, which was subsequently shown to be important for OEC survival during infection. This study reveals a fundamental role for hexose metabolism and identifies a GOT1-mediated TCA cycle shunt in regulating OEC survival and immune responses during mucosal fungal infections."

Here, we leverage 2519 modern human genomes and four high-coverage archaic hominin genomes to systematically characterize nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs). We uncover 483 polymorphic NUMTs across globally diverse human populations and 10 in archaic genomes. By combining overlap with Neanderthal-derived and Denisovan-derived haplotypes, phylogenetic analyses, insertion time estimates, and haplotype colocalization, we identify five NUMTs introduced into modern humans via archaic hominin introgression. Functional analyses reveal that introgressed NUMTs can modulate gene expression, including allele-specific up-regulation of the immune-related geneRASGRP3, and reshape three-dimensional chromatin structure at loci such asSCD5andHNRNPD. These findings highlight an underappreciated mechanism by which archaic mitochondrial fragments shape nuclear genome function and evolution.

Leveraging a microtask design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students (N= 184, time points = 9248), we show that within-person upswings in domain-general cognitive processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal setting and achievement across both academic and nonacademic domains, even controlling for other factors. A one-standard-deviation change in cognitive precision had an effect statistically equivalent to ~40 min of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness.

However, indefinite passaging of HuNoVs in HIEs remained a challenge, necessitating the use of patient stool samples as viral inocula. Using RNA-seq, we identified CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5 as up-regulated chemokines, suggesting their potential as host restriction factors. TAK-779, a CXCR3/CCR5/CCR2 antagonist, enhanced GII.3 HuNoV replication and viral spread in a dose- and time-dependent manner, enabling successful passaging of GII.3 HuNoV in two different HIE lines and generation of viral stocks. Sequencing passaged virus revealed one consensus change in the major capsid protein and several dynamic adaptations, suggesting emergence of variants. TAK-779 also enhanced replication of GI.1 and GII.17 strains, but not GII.4, suggesting strain-specific host interactions.

However, the immunological consequences of ultrasmall bioparticle–induced nanocollision remain largely an unexplored realm despite its ubiquitous and incessant occurrence within the in vivo milieu. Herein, we disclose that nanocollisions caused by endogenous bioparticles, such as extracellular vesicles, can induce localized membrane deformations. This spatially confined mechanical input activates Piezo1 at collision sites and promotes myosin IIA phosphorylation–mediated F-actin stabilization, enhancing DC intrinsic motility. Subsequent diffusion of Ca2+up-regulates chemotaxis machinery, improving their capacity of tumor microenvironment patrolling and lymph node homing for antitumor immunity. This finding reveals a previously unidentified mechanoimmunological mechanism of immune surveillance. To accelerate the translation of this mechanism into clinical therapeutics, we developed an ultrasound-responsive nanocollision generator using gas-liquid-solid triphase conversion.

Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin’s interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading.

Fast-sinking marine snow particles, such as diatom aggregates, encounter a rapid increase in hydrostatic pressure during their descent. Using incubations in rotating pressure tanks, we found that pressure levels corresponding to 2- to 6-kilometer water depth induce leakage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from diatom aggregates equivalent to ~50% of their initial carbon contents. The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind. Pressure-induced DOM leakage likely weakens the gravitational “biological carbon pump” and supplies labile DOM to the pelagic microbiome of the deep ocean."

To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying SCRE2 virulence function, we identify that SCRE2 interacts withOryza sativaS-like ribonuclease family member OsRNS4. As a catalytically inactive RNase, OsRNS4 positively regulates rice immunity, depending on its RNA binding ability. OsRNS4 is unconventionally secreted through tetraspanin-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs). OsRNS4 binds to certain groups of rice miRNAs, whereas SCRE2 prevents the binding of OsRNS4 to miRNAs. Especially, OsRNS4-bound miR528-5p in rice is detected in false smut balls and silences the geneUvSfk1essential forU. virensvirulence. Thus, OsRNS4 might act as a carrier to transport miRNAs from rice into fungi, which target the virulence genes inU. virensand thereby contributes to rice resistance against fungal pathogens.

While basally dividing progenitors are implicated in neocortical growth, their developmental origins and relevance beyond the cortex remain unclear. We show here that double inactivation of spindle orientation regulators GPSM2 and SAPCD2 in mice completely reorients progenitor divisions in both the neocortex and retina. This shift increases basal progenitors over sixfold in the neocortex and induces their ectopic emergence in the retina, resulting in extra cell layers and ~30% tissue enlargement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the induced basal progenitors in the cortex resemble human outer radial glia, and both cortical and retinal progenitors show altered Hippo signaling. Last, macaque and human retinas display twice as many reoriented divisions as the mouse and naturally contain basal progenitors. These findings show that division orientation is critical for regulating neural progenitor output and scaling tissue growth."

Detachment has long been described as smooth drainage governed by a Reynolds-type pressure gradient. Combining spatiotemporal pressure mapping with confocal imaging of the fluid layer between a suction cup-substrate interface, we reveal a two-stage, nonequilibrium pathway for pressure equalization that challenges this conventional view. Suction-induced elastic deformation dynamically remodels the interfacial fluid, producing a self-coupled pressure channel system. Stage I is governed by an outward-moving invasion-percolation suction front with diffusion-like scaling. When internal suction falls below a critical value, the network opens globally, and stage II follows classical Poiseuille drainage. This mechanism defines a self-modifying percolation in which the flow remodels its own pathways, which advances our understanding of biological suction and viscous adhesion and suggests design principles for long-lived wet adhesives and hydrogel microfluidics."

However, severe optical scattering and high-frequency acoustic attenuation within the brain degrade the performance of photoacoustic brain imaging. To address such limitation, we propose a line scanning–based photoacoustic computed mesoscopic (PACMes) approach for noninvasive, high-resolution, and longitudinal visualization of cerebral vasculature inside the intact mouse brain. This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (>5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers. The results demonstrate the potential of PACMes for investigating brain function and disease."

However, the relatively low output voltage of aqueous systems continues to limit their achievable energy density. The aqueous electrolyte occupies a central role in addressing this limitation because it mediates ion transport and interfacial reactions at both the cathode and anode; accordingly, advances in electrolyte design are indispensable to meet future performance demands. In this review, we elucidate the core bottlenecks in aqueous electrolyte design, distill molecular-level design principles, and outline feasible pathways for future practical implementation. We aim to guide the development of next-generation aqueous electrolytes that harmonize outstanding electrochemical performance, thereby accelerating the transition from laboratory concepts to transformative energy solutions."

Testing both traditional and more recent convolutional neural networks (deep learning), we find that relatively small deep networks performed best, particularly for uncommon classes, because they extract richer features. Our results indicate that such compact models are sufficient for classifying small grayscale plankton images. 
 Plankton imaging devices produce vast datasets, the processing of which can be largely accelerated through machine learning. This is a challenging task due to the diversity of plankton, the prevalence of non-biological classes, and the rarity of many classes. Most existing studies rely on small, unpublished datasets that often lack realism in size, class diversity and proportions. We therefore also lack a systematic, realistic benchmark of plankton image classification approaches. To address this gap, we leverage both existing and newly published, large, and realistic plankton imaging datasets from widely used instruments (see Data Availability section for the complete list of dataset DOIs). We evaluate different classification approaches: a classical Random Forest classifier applied to handcrafted features, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of both. This work aims to provide reference datasets, baseline results, and insights to guide future endeavors in plankton image classification. Overall, CNN outperformed the classical approach but only significantly for uncommon classes. Larger CNN, which should provide richer features, did not perform better than small ones; and features of small ones could even be further compressed without affecting classification performance. Finally, we highlight that the nature of the classifier is of little importance compared to the content of the features. Our findings suggest that compact CNN (i.e. modest number of convolutional layers and consequently relatively few total parameters) are sufficient to extract relevant information to classify small grayscale plankton images. This has consequences for operational classification models, which can afford to be small and quick. On the other hand, this opens the possibility for further development of the imaging systems to provide larger and richer images."

The water–energy–food–ecosystem (WEFE) Nexus offers a holistic lens, yet most applications remain conceptual, short-term, or treat ecosystems as external constraints. This study operationalizes the WEFE Nexus by embedding ecosystems as a coequal, quantified pillar through a hydrologic-regime-based method, since streamflow is a master variable shaping riverine ecosystem health. Long-term foresight is incorporated via dynamically downscaled climate projections and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways within a coupled water and energy systems (WEAP–LEAP) model. Applied to the semiarid Sakarya Basin in Türkiye, the framework evaluates three future periods (2020–2030, 2055–2065, and 2090–2100) across seven subbasins. Results show systemic trade-offs: municipal water security remains high (>90%), but ecosystem integrity and renewable energy goals are consistently compromised. Overall, WEFE Nexus Index values (0.53–0.86) show significant spatial disparities, with arid upstream regions consistently underperforming. Strikingly, SSP2 (business-as-usual) and SSP5 (fossil-fueled growth) yield nearly identical outcomes, underscoring the systemic unsustainability of current trajectories. This framework advances nexus assessment from theory to practice by integrating reproducible metrics, scenario planning, and spatial modeling, creating a practical tool for developing adaptive and resilient sustainability strategies."

Assessing the toxicity of such mixtures is essential, yet experimental data are often unavailable. This study evaluates the feasibility of applying publicly available in silico tools, including TTC, QSAR models, and read-across, to estimate oral points of departure (PODs) for acute, subchronic, and chronic exposures to JP-5. Applicability domain assessments indicated broad QSAR model coverage, with OPERA and ToxTree fully inclusive and VEGA models showing mostly moderate-to-high confidence, aside from a few additives. Dosimetric adjustments and uncertainty factors were applied to extrapolate rat PODs to in silico-derived health guidance values (HGV). Mixture toxicity was estimated by using the concentration addition model and compared with existing HGV-based values to derive screening levels. In silico-derived HGVs generally aligned with available guidance values, and the TTC estimates were consistently conservative. Potential health effects were also curated based on available animal and mechanistic studies. Overall, this case study demonstrates that in silico models can help fill toxicological data gaps and provide screening-level insights into evaluating chemical mixture exposure when empirical data are limited."

These MPs enter the soil environment through land application, posing a threat to ecosystems. This study proposes an effective control strategy using alkali pretreatment (pH 10, 5 days) followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C (AHT), achieving a degradation rate of 81.83% for polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) in sludge. AHT promotes the formation and solubilization of key active components in sludge, such as alkalinity, which drives nucleophilic attack, metal ions, which catalyze reactions, and organic matter, which acts as radical donors. These components synergistically disintegrate PET-MPs through hydrolysis and radical oxidation pathways during hydrothermal treatment. Meanwhile, hydrothermal treatment induces polymer chain motion and physical structural disruption, accelerating the penetration and reaction of active components, thereby achieving efficient degradation of PET-MPs. Spectral and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses reveal that sludge AHT facilitates the transformation of MP-derived dissolved organic matter (MP-DOM) into molecules characterized by low-aromaticity, low-molecular-weight, high-saturation, and high-bioavailability. Concurrently, MP-DOM exhibits low acute toxicity toward aquatic organisms and the immortalized human liver cell line (THLE-2 cells). Therefore, sludge AHT effectively degrades and converts polyester MPs into MP-DOM with low-toxicity, thereby mitigating the risks of sludge-based MPs to ecosystems."

Zwitterionic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and negatively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) liposomes were utilized as lipid membrane models for assessing fluorescence leakage caused by two positively charged, two negatively charged, and one neutral WSPs. Positively charged WSPs induced substantial leakage in DOPG liposomes with increasing polymer concentrations, whereas the negatively charged WSP caused only minor leakage in DOPC liposomes at high concentrations, and nonionic WSPs did not cause significant disruption. Quantification of in vitro cytotoxicity on one human (MCF7) and one fish (RTgill-W1 from Oncorhynchus mykiss) cell line confirmed the WSP’s ability to disrupt membrane integrity. Cationic WSPs also caused cytotoxicity in both cell lines at similar concentrations, distinguishing them from negatively charged and neutral WSPs. These findings highlight the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions between charge characteristics of WSPs and phospholipid headgroups of biological membranes.

However, its practical implementation has been hindered by inherent challenges, such as sluggish reaction kinetics and limited mass transfer, especially under low-salinity conditions. To address these issues, this study proposes an induced-charge Faradaic CDI (IC-Faradaic CDI) system. The key innovation lies in the strategic integration of Faradaic CDI with an electric double-layer mechanism through a wireless induced-charge IC unit. This design modulates the electric field and ion transport, optimizes the concentration distribution, and establishes a universal pathway to reconcile the trade-off between kinetics and capacity. As a result, the IC-Faradaic CDI system delivers a desalination capacity of 0.269 mg cm–2 and an outstanding average desalination rate of 0.027 mg cm–2 min–1, surpassing most existing Faradaic CDI systems. Furthermore, to validate its real-world applicability, a larger-scale system (324 cm2) was constructed, achieving 77% salt removal from simulated brackish water and the effective desalination of real brackish water from the Yangtze River estuary. This work provides a novel and universal strategy to alleviate the kinetic limitations of Faradaic CDI and offers a low-cost, membrane-free, and energy-efficient solution for high-performance water treatment."

Using monthly observations over a decade in Xiamen Bay and integrating flow cytometry, high-throughput sequencing, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and NanoSIMS carbon tracing, we explored how microbially driven carbon cycling responds to these dual forces. Our findings reveal that under present-day conditions, a +4 °C warming would increase the abundances of Synechococcus (∼19%) and microeukaryotic algae (∼5%), suggesting an enhanced potential for labile dissolved organic matter (LDOM) production. NanoSIMS experiments showed a 5-fold increase in heterotrophic bacterial assimilation of phytoplankton-derived carbon at elevated temperatures (30 °C versus 22 °C). Concurrently, intensified riverine discharge delivered terrestrial recalcitrant DOM (RDOM), altering DOM molecular composition and decreasing overall bioavailability. These combined stressors restructured microbial communities, accelerating heterotrophic carbon processing and reducing the ratio of ecologically persistent DOM to recalcitrant dissolved black carbon. We propose a Dual-DOM Forcing framework that formalizes how thermal (autochthonous LDOM) and hydrological (allochthonous RDOM) drivers jointly regulate microbial carbon processing, DOM persistence, and coastal carbon sequestration potential. This framework provides a transferable basis for assessing the vulnerability of coastal blue carbon sinks to concurrent warming and altered river discharge."

However, precise coordination of Zn SACs is highly required to selectively trigger the ETP pathway. Herein, under the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) predictions, we constructed asymmetric Zn–N3Cl sites on N-doped carbon (NC) to unlock the electron-transfer reactivity of redox-inert Zn while maintaining structural robustness. Compared with the symmetric Zn–N4 system, the Zn–N3Cl system achieved a higher sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal rate and PMS utilization efficiency by 4.4 and 2.3 times, respectively. Mechanism studies revealed that Cl doping significantly altered the electronic structure of Zn sites, thereby promoting their electron transfer capacity. The strongly polarized Zn–N3Cl sites exhibited a notably enhanced interaction with PMS, facilitating the formation of Zn–N3Cl/PMS* with high redox potential and lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) for ETP. The Zn–N3Cl system demonstrated outstanding catalytic reactivity toward various environmental interferences over a wide pH range. Notably, this system remained effective for the continuous flow-through treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, coupling high catalytic reactivity and structural robustness.

This study systematically investigated the cellular and virological effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) using three medically relevant viruses─human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71)─across multiple human cell lines under identical experimental conditions. PS-MP exposure induced dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity, G2/M cell-cycle arrest, and early apoptosis, including effects observed at subcytotoxic concentrations. Coexposure assays revealed increased detectable infection levels and enhanced cold-temperature persistence of enveloped viruses (HCoV-OC43 and RSV), whereas no comparable effect was observed for the nonenveloped EV-A71, suggesting preferential effects on viral stability rather than intrinsic infectivity. Under coexposure conditions, PS-MPs reduced type I interferon (IFN-α/β) expression, indicating impaired innate antiviral signaling, while modulation of IFITM3 expression varied depending on viral species and host cell context. Gene-expression analyses demonstrated virus-specific antiviral modulation with attenuated interferon-mediated antiviral priming during HCoV-OC43 infection and reduced IFITM3 expression in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that PS-MPs act as environmental and biological cofactors that induce cellular stress, suppress antiviral immune responses, and promote viral stability under low-temperature conditions, with implications for viral persistence in contaminated ecosystems."

Here, the authors reveal the structure and dynamics of the Wza–Wzc complex, uncovering how a trans-envelope channel assembles to guide capsular polysaccharide synthesis and export. 
 Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are key virulence determinants, constituting the protective capsule that surrounds bacterial pathogens. Here, we present the complete cryo-EM structure of Gram-negative bacterial CPS secretion machinery formed by the E. coli K12 Wza-Wzc complex. The structure reveals an elongated, continuous channel spanning the entire envelope that facilitates CPS secretion. Multiple structural snapshots of the ADP-bound Wza-Wzc complex capture intermediate conformations of the double membrane assembly, highlighting its remarkable intrinsic dynamics. In-depth analysis of the isolated Wza translocon and Wzc co-polymerase, reveals mechanistic details of both complex formation and CPS transport. We further uncover the jellyroll domain of Wzc as a CPS-binding module, likely guiding CPS repeat units into a proposed Wzc-Wzy polymerization platform. Collectively, this work provides structural and functional insights into CPS synthesis and transport, advancing our understanding of bacterial capsule formation and virulence mechanisms.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a relatively low incidence but a high mortality rate, primarily due to difficulties in early detection. Current state-of-the-art methods for diagnosing early-stage PDAC tend to be invasive, time-consuming, and unreliable, primarily due to the difficulties associated with the early detection of pancreatic cancers. Here we show a quick and sensitive method for the early diagnosis of PDAC using a signal-enhanced lateral flow immunoassay called SELFI. We develop SELFI, which generates a strong colorimetric signal through multiple hotspots formed by plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on a silica nanoparticle. Our SELFI assay achieves a 10,123-fold increase in the limit of detection compared to conventional lateral flow immunoassays using 20 nm AuNPs, providing results within 15 min. We demonstrate that SELFI enables early diagnosis of PDAC, as indicated by a receiver operating characteristic curve and a larger area under the curve compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SELFI’s effective diagnostic features can enhance the timely identification of PDAC and may also serve in the early diagnosis of a range of other diseases.

 Policy acceptance is one of the biggest hurdles to climate action and is heavily driven by people’s perceptions of fairness. Here we investigate which distributive justice principles people prefer and whether these distributive preferences are linked to policy preferences along three policy characteristics: stringency, redistribution, and instrument type. Using an online survey experiment (N = 2, 230), we assess agreement with four justice principles relevant to the decarbonisation context - equal outcomes, sufficientarianism, limitarianism, and utilitarianism - and identify groups with distinct justice orientations. Using data from two choice experiments, we show that climate justice orientation is associated with distinct policy preferences, with most individuals supporting a combination of principles and being sensitive to redistribution in policy design. This study provides further evidence on the widely noted observation that justice is a key aspect in the public’s policy assessment. We suggest this justice orientation should be considered in both policymaking and policy-driven research. Most individuals tend to support a mix of justice principles and show sensitivity to how climate policy packages distribute resources, according to an analysis that uses a survey experiment with 2,230 participants."

 Sustainable agri-food system transformation in Africa is critical for addressing the persistent challenges of hunger and malnutrition while promoting sustainability. Here, we investigate how green growth initiatives intersect with the agri-food system transformation in the African Continental Free Trade Area context. We combine World Development Indicators, International Financial Statistics, and OECD data, and we use the Prais-Winsten regression model to analyze the relationship between green growth initiatives and Sustainable Development Goal 2- Zero Hunger indicators across 46 African countries. We show that green growth initiatives positively impact agricultural productivity and cereal yield but negatively affect total fisheries production. Low-income countries, including Malawi, Uganda, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone experience mixed effects, while upper-middle-income countries such as South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Mauritius face more challenges. Economic growth, renewable energy, and financial development significantly influence agri-food system sustainability, but challenges like carbon dioxide emissions and deforestation hinder progress. Policymakers should prioritize pro-poor green technology investments, enhance finance accessibility, and implement environmental mitigation measures while fostering trade openness and regional cooperation.

 Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes’ rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.

Toxicity is thought to result from the accumulation of either repeat RNAs and/or dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) translated from repeat-containing transcripts through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. To disentangle RNA from DPR toxicity, we mutated a CUG codon predominantly used to initiate DPR translation from all three reading frames. This mutation disrupted DPR synthesis while preserving the expression of repeat-containing RNAs. Despite the accumulation of RNA foci, behavioral deficits and pathological abnormalities, including p-TDP-43 inclusions, STING activation, motor neuron loss, neuroinflammation, and increased plasma neurofilament concentration, were alleviated inC9ORF72mice. Base editing of the CUG codon also improved molecular phenotypes and survival in patient induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, which highlights the potential of therapeutically targeting DPR production rather than repeat RNAs."

We developed a multiscale graph–based pangenome representation, which integrates nine genome assemblies into a unified reference, representing modern cultivars and founding species. Each homo(eo)logous (encompasses both homologous and homeologous relationships) chromosome set retains 47 to 57 haplotypes and ~74,000 to 271,000 gene alleles. This framework enables multiomics exploration, encompassing homo(eo)log systems and epigenomic signatures. The pangenome facilitates population genomics analyses of 417 mixed-ploidySaccharumaccessions, revealing convergent selection and identifying the AndropogoneaeTB1homolog linked to tillering as a promising gene-editing target to boost cane yield. Additionally, the pangenome supports dosage-informed genome-wide association study, improving heritability estimates and identification of sugar or leaf-angle–associated loci, includingSaIRX10andSaBAK5.

Multivalent immunogen display on protein nanoparticle scaffolds can promote such responses, but it also generates scaffold-specific B cells that could theoretically limit bnAb precursor expansion in GCs. We rationally designed DNA origami–based virus-like particles (DNA-VLPs) displaying a germline-targeting HIV envelope protein immunogen, which elicited no scaffold-specific antibody responses. Compared with a state-of-the-art clinical protein nanoparticle, these DNA-VLPs increased the expansion of epitope-specific GC B cells relative to off-target B cells and enhanced expansion of bnAb-lineage B cells in a humanized mouse model of CD4 binding site priming. Thus, minimizing off-target responses enhances bnAb priming and indicates that DNA-VLPs are a promising vaccine platform."

We identified 6992 unknown genes, 110 complete (peri)centromeres, and five new satellites associated withBrmorphotypes and subspecies andBrassicaspecies evolution. The pangenome, built on 11 gapless and 20 published genomes, reveals structural variations and gene diversities amongBrsubspecies. Pangenome-wide association studies uncovered that the geneBrLH1controls leaf-head formation. We show that structural changes have occurred in satellites, (peri)centromeres, and genes, contributing to fast subspeciation and morphotypification during the short history ofBrcultivation, providing invaluable resources forBrassicabreeding."

We present experimental evidence that a nonhuman primate can represent pretend objects. Kanzi, a lexigram-trained bonobo, correctly identified the location of pretend objects (e.g., “juice” poured between empty containers), in response to verbal prompts in scaffolded pretense interactions. Across three experiments, we conceptually replicated this finding and excluded key alternative explanations. Our findings suggest that the capacity to form secondary representations of pretend objects is within the cognitive potential of, at least, an enculturated ape and likely dates back 6 to 9 million years, to our common evolutionary ancestors."

By screening a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drug library, we identified finerenone, a kidney disease medication, as a promising drug for restoring fertility in POI. Finerenone stimulated follicle development in aged mice and restored antral follicle development in patients with POI following oral administration, resulting in mature oocytes and embryos. Mechanistically, finerenone reduced fibrotic deposition in the ovarian stroma, alleviating collagen-mediated suppression of follicular development. Building on this insight, we identified additional FDA-approved oral antifibrotic drugs as potential treatments for POI-related infertility. Our findings highlight the ovarian stroma—rather than the follicles themselves—as the key therapeutic target and offer potential therapeutic leads for POI-related infertility."

We designed coiled-coil bundlemer peptide nanoparticles that form ordered, hierarchical materials across an unusually broad pH range (1, 7, and 14) dependent on patchy surface charge display. Nematic liquid crystal formation was observed at low concentration (~0.5 to 4 weight %) at pH 1 and pH 14, whereas higher concentration at pH 1 yielded hexagonal columnar phases. At neutral pH, the same patchy nanoparticles assembled into ordered lattices through electrostatic complexation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed end-to-end particle stacking underlying all phases. Coiled coils with identical amino acid composition but lacking designed charge patches displayed no ordered assembly, demonstrating the importance of programmable electrostatic interactions with protein-like specificity of spatial display."

Potassium acyltrifluoroboronates (KATs) offer a promising alternative through fast and chemoselective amide bond formation, but their application to protein synthesis has been precluded by the lack of a masking strategy. We report chiral, zwitterionic organoboron complexes that mask amino acid–derived KATs. These molecules exhibit unexpected nitrogen-carbon-boron connectivity and are fully compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis and stereoretentive deprotection. We synthesized C-terminal KAT peptides and demonstrated KAT ligation at micromolar concentrations for the convergent synthesis of the aggregation-prone programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) immunoglobulin V domain. This work establishes organoboron chemistry as an enabling strategy for chemical protein synthesis at low concentrations far more suitable for handling large, aggregation-prone biomolecules."

To improve the entangling rate, single-photon interference is leveraged for entanglement heralding, and quantum frequency conversion is used to reduce fiber loss. A tailored Rydberg-based emission scheme suppresses the photon recoil effect on the atom without introducing noise. We achieved high-fidelity atom-atom entanglement and positive asymptotic key rates for fiber lengths up to 100 km. At 11 km, 1.2 million heralded Bell pairs were prepared over 624 hours, yielding an estimated extractable finite-size secure key rate of 0.112 bits per event against general attacks.

In particular, silicon compounds in which π-electrons are delocalized over five or more silicon atoms have been elusive. We report the synthesis of pentasilicon analogs of cyclopentadienides (pentasilacyclopentadienides). These compounds contain nonplanar five-membered silicon rings with some pyramidalized silicon atoms and uneven silicon-silicon distances. The highly shielded7Li nuclear magnetic resonance signal of a lithium pentasilacyclopentadienide corroborates the presence of a diamagnetic ring current in the five-membered ring, which is indicative of at least some degree of aromaticity. Furthermore, a computational study revealed that bulky substituents and the delocalization of π-electrons stabilize the pentasilacyclopentadienide structure."

We found that the TAT of most species groups has increased; that only 20 ± 14 pesticides per group define >90% of the TAT nationally; that fruits, vegetables, maize, soybean, rice, and other cereals contribute 76 to 83% of the global TAT; and that China, Brazil, the United States, and India contribute 53 to 68% of the global TAT.

In this study, we engineered pluripotent stem cells in which cohesin loop extrusion can be inducibly disrupted without confounding cell cycle defects. Transcriptional dysregulation is cell type specific, and not all loci with distal enhancers depend equally on cohesin extrusion. Using comparative genome editing, we demonstrated that enhancer-promoter communication over just 20 kb can require cohesin. However, promoter-proximal elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action—even across strong CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulators. Lastly, transcriptional dynamics and the emergence of embryonic cell types remain largely robust despite disrupted extrusion. Beyond establishing strategies to study cohesin in enhancer biology, our work provides mechanistic insight into cell type specificity and genomic context specificity."

The goal is now to advance from the idea of GO2DAT to its implementation, building a sustainable, interoperable, and inclusive digital ecosystem for all stakeholders who may use ocean oxygen data. Successful implementation will require (I) the provision of guidance on data acquisition/ocean oxygen measurements, (II) recommended practices for ocean oxygen data management, including metadata requirements, uncertainty and data quality control attribution, (III) development of the ocean oxygen data platform including data flow and application of the recommended practices introduced in I and II, as well as its deep integration with cross-domain data federations such as the Ocean Data and Information System. This document provides an outline of GO2DAT’s objective and progress since 2021 and contributes to addressing these three requirements, synthesizing a series of global consultations on recommended practices for marine dissolved oxygen measurements, a working definition of ocean oxygen metadata, proposed data quality control levels and flags, a described novel mechanism for uncertainty attribution to allow the determination of data suitability for different scientific applications, and it concludes with an illustration of the data flow for implementation."

While hard engineering structures (e.g. levees, seawalls) remain widely used, they can be costly, ecologically disruptive, and may exacerbate hazard complexity. Nature-based solutions (NbS), including mangroves, salt marshes, and other coastal ecosystems, offer sustainable and often cost-effective alternatives or complementarities that can mitigate hazards while delivering ecological and societal co-benefits. However, their effectiveness is difficult to assess due to diverse methodological approaches, site-specific coastal dynamics, and inconsistent reporting indicators. This study synthesises the scientific evidence base on the effectiveness of NbS in reducing hydrometeorological hazards in coastal and deltaic environments and evaluates the robustness of methods used to assess their performance. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 383 peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 2008 and 2024 was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols and the PICO framework. Using an evaluation approach adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, each study was assessed for evidence robustness, level of agreement, and overall confidence. The meta-analysis provides quantitative estimates of NbS effectiveness and highlights substantial uncertainties arising from ecological variability, methodological inconsistencies, and heterogeneity in hazard indicators (e.g. wave height, flow velocity, water level, temperature) and measurement units. Findings show that NbS effectiveness is highly context dependent and influenced by site characteristics, ecological dimensions, system configuration, and hazard intensity. The study emphasises the need for standardised, hazard-specific indicators and greater use of integrated methodological approaches to strengthen the reliability and comparability of future assessments. It also identifies opportunities for advancing hybrid or nature-positive engineering solutions that combine NbS with conventional infrastructure to enhance coastal resilience."

The conventional recharge/discharge theory effectively explains MLa Niñas preceded by strong El Niño events (SE-MLa Niñas), but fails to account for MLa Niñas occurring without preceding strong El Niño influences (NSE-MLa Niñas). Here we show, through integrated observational analyses and climate model simulations, that the Pacific meridional mode (PMM) acts as a key driver for the initiation and maintenance of NSE-MLa Niñas. Unlike SE-MLa Niñas, which rely on El Niño-induced oceanic memory, NSE-MLa Niñas are sustained by the PMM-related subtropical air–sea coupling processes, notably through an intensified wind–evaporation–sea surface temperature feedback mechanism as quantitatively diagnosed in this study. Future projections indicate that under global warming scenarios, the frequency of NSE-MLa Niñas may increase more relative to SE-MLa Niñas, possibly due to the enhanced PMM variability. These findings deepen our understanding of ENSO dynamics by uncovering subtropical processes as critical drivers of persistent La Niña conditions, with profound implications for advancing ENSO prediction systems."

Among the methods used to control nonpoint-source pollution, small water bodies such as ditches and ponds have received increasing attention due to their widespread distribution and low cost. However, most previous studies have focused on specific regions, and the key factors regulating phosphorus retention and their generalizable patterns remain unclear. Additionally, research on the synthesis of global water-body nutrient retention is largely limited to studies from North America and Europe. Here, we compiled a phosphorus retention dataset for small water bodies across China that incorporates research published in Chinese. Using multiple statistical analyses to assess the hydrological processes and external influencing factors on phosphorus removal rate and efficiency, our results show that the median total phosphorus removal rate in ditches and ponds across China was 33.7%. Among all hydrological and external influencing factors, hydraulic retention time (HRT) served as a pivotal parameter in the modulation of phosphorus removal efficiency. Extending HRT is an effective method to enhance phosphorus retention in water bodies, although it also demonstrates diminishing marginal returns. By regulating the HRT of small water bodies, a win–win situation with both pollutant reduction and agricultural production may be achieved, thereby enhancing the resilience of agricultural ecosystems to climate change. This study provides a scientific basis and technical support for achieving the dual goals of sustainable agricultural development and environmental improvement in developing countries—particularly in rice-producing regions."

Recharge in these regions is highly episodic and occurs mainly through ephemeral streams (i.e. focused recharge), yet the mechanisms that determine whether surface flows contribute to aquifer replenishment remain poorly constrained. A common assumption is that large floods dominate recharge, but evidence from long-term monitoring is limited and inconclusive. We combine a unique hydrogeological monitoring dataset from the arid zone (Fowlers Gap in western New South Wales, Australia) with numerical modelling of vadose zone processes to assess the controls on focused GW recharge. Our results show that even extreme floods that overtopped piezometers did not produce measurable recharge at the water table. In contrast, significant recharge occurred only during a temporal cluster of moderate flow events in 2022. Numerical simulations confirm that temporal flow clustering produces longer periods of ephemeral streamflow, which progressively wet the vadose zone, overcome evapotranspiration (ET)-driven moisture deficits, and increase relative hydraulic conductivity, enabling percolation to the water table. Isolated floods, by contrast, largely saturate only shallow sediments and water is subsequently lost to ET. By explicitly incorporating ET, our modelling provides a more realistic representation of dryland recharge dynamics and highlights the roles of antecedent conditions and vadose zone properties. These findings demonstrate that recharge is not governed by rainfall totals or intensity alone, but critically depends on the timing and sequence of storm events. The implications for climate change assessments and water management are substantial, as projected shifts toward more intense but less frequent rainfall may reduce opportunities for clustering and thereby limit GW replenishment. Process-based modelling and event-scale analyses are therefore essential for reliable recharge projections and sustainable GW management in drylands."

One key challenge in method development lies in balancing sensitivity, speed, and portability. To address it, a one-step assay targeting the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM was developed based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a. A sensitivity optimization paradigm─MOSAIC (multistrategy optimized sensitive assay via integrated CRISPR/Cas12a)─was proposed, incorporating component optimization, suboptimal-PAM-mediated CRISPR inhibition, and glycerol-assisted phase separation. The glycerol-assisted strategy exhibited the largest enhancement, followed by the suboptimal-PAM strategy and component optimization. When combined, these strategies demonstrated a synergistic effect, yielding greater improvement (10 000-fold) than a single strategy alone. MOSAIC reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 260 copies/μL, comparable to that of qPCR, and enabled faster quantification of blaNDM at 37 °C within 1 h on a standard plate reader. It achieved 100% diagnostic sensitivity and 95.45% specificity in clinical isolates, and 77.41–99.73% accuracy in environmental matrix-spiked samples, comparable to that of qPCR. It provides a technological foundation for on-site detection of blaNDM and offers an optimization paradigm and new insights for the development of one-step RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assays targeting various genes."

Sedlak,The Evolution of Constructed Wetlands from Small-Scale Effluent Polishing Solutions to an Essential Water Treatment Technology,"The desire to protect aquatic ecosystems and drinking water supplies from the adverse effects of nutrients, trace organic contaminants, and other constituents in municipal wastewater has led to a need for additional treatment, particularly in watersheds with insufficient dilution. Constructed wetlands have emerged as viable alternatives to advanced wastewater treatment processes for effluent polishing due to their low cost and ancillary benefits. Starting in the late 1980s, experiences gained from several decades of operating wetlands in small communities increased confidence that these nature-based treatment systems could be effective and reliable. As a result, investments were made in larger constructed wetlands, with surface areas greater than a million square meters (1 Mm2) and flows often exceeding 1 m3 s–1, on effluent-dominated rivers and as part of potable water reuse projects. More recently, new wetland designs have improved the constructed wetland system performance by taking advantage of sunlight-mediated processes in the water column and microbial processes on subsurface porous media. Research that provides additional insight into contaminant removal mechanisms, demonstrates long-term viability, and further improves treatment performance could expand the application of constructed wetlands to other difficult-to-solve water quality challenges, including the treatment of municipal water reuse concentrate and the mitigation of nonpoint source pollution."

We analyze a deep crustal earthquake swarm (February–August 2025) of over 5,000 events beneath the Abu Volcano Group, Japan. Using spectral characteristics, we distinguish deep low‐frequency earthquakes (DLFEs) from volcano‐tectonic events and identify several anti‐repeating pairs. All events are relocated with cross‐correlation and a double‐difference algorithm, revealing a complex multi‐cluster fault network comprising a steeply dipping conduit and sub‐horizontal fault strands. DLFEs migrate upward at ∼0.3 km/day along the conduit, suggesting fluid or magma ascent that triggers overlying brittle failure. Anti‐repeating earthquakes indicate small‐scale stress heterogeneity within adjacent fault patches.

 Blood vessels near injury sites rapidly dilate, become permeable, and release serum and leukocytes into the wounded tissue to support healing and regeneration. How the vasculature senses distant homeostatic tissue perturbations within seconds-to-minutes remains incompletely understood. Using high-speed imaging of live zebrafish larvae, we monitor two hallmark vascular responses to injury: vessel dilation and serum exudation.

 Hydrogel coatings are a promising strategy to reduce friction and wear in biomedical implants, yet replicating the durability of natural cartilage remains a key challenge due to the inherent trade-off between low friction and high wear resistance. Here, we present a picot-fiber hydrogel coating (PFHC) that mimics the hierarchical architecture of cartilage by integrating a lubricious surface layer with a tough, fiber-reinforced core layer. The picot fibers, formed by folded peptide strands with hidden loops, endow the core layer with efficient load-bearing capacity, while the loosely packed, open-structured top layer preserves hydration lubrication. The resulting PFHC achieves both ultralow friction (~0.009) and high wear resistance under long-term sliding over 100,000 cycles, comparable to natural cartilage. By decoupling lubrication and load-bearing functionalities across distinct structural layers, PFHC overcomes the conventional limitations of hydrogel coatings, providing a generalizable strategy to integrate lubrication and mechanical durability for reliable, long-lasting implant interfaces.

 Extensive studies have shown that talin is the essential player for inside-out activation of integrins by binding to the intracellular tail of β integrins. Here we show that, while talin binding is essential for inside-out integrin activation in focal adhesions, it is dispensable in curved adhesions - a distinct adhesion architecture exclusively mediated by integrin αvβ5 and selectively formed at curved membranes. Instead, a curvature-sensing protein FCHo2 binds to the HDRRE motif in integrin β5’s cytoplasmic tail and inside-out activates integrin αvβ5 in curved adhesions. FCHo2 does not bind to a similar motif in the homologous integrin β3. We identify a pivotal tryptophan (W), which is conserved in all homologous β integrins except β5, where it is replaced by a tyrosine (Y766). This tyrosine substitution is crucial for integrin β5’s unique capability in forming curved adhesions. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the phosphorylation state of Y766 regulates whether integrin ɑvβ5 forms curved adhesions or focal adhesions. Overall, our work unveils distinct molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms between curved adhesions and focal adhesions. Talin has been believed to be indispensable for integrin activation.

 The demand for high-performance filters in next-generation wireless communication systems underscores the limited electromechanical coupling of aluminum nitride-based film bulk acoustic resonators. Scandium incorporation enhances piezoelectricity but is hindered by crystallinity degradation and polarity inversion. Theoretical modeling reveals the polarity inversion interface between aluminum nitride and scandium-doped aluminum nitride as a key cause of piezoelectric degradation. This work proposes a dual-optimization strategy that improves crystalline alignment and eliminates polarity mismatch. A single-crystalline aluminum nitride seed layer promotes high c-axis oriented scandium-doped aluminum nitride films, yielding resonators with a maximum quality factor of 736. Subsequent seed layer removal eliminates the polarity inversion interface, raising the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of resonators from 6.0% to 13.2%. Filters fabricated with this strategy achieve a center frequency of 6.4 GHz, a 3 dB bandwidth of 740 MHz, and out-of-band rejection above 40 dB, indicating potential for Sub-7 GHz communication systems.

Here, the authors experimentally demonstrate control and generation of zero-energy kinks in a topological mechanical metamaterial via acoustic waves and numerically show rich acoustic-wavekink dynamics in highly discrete systems. 
 Kinks are localized transitions between topologically distinct ground states and play a central role in systems from condensed matter to cosmology. While acoustic wave packets (here defined as small-amplitude mechanical waves, sometimes referred to as phonons) have been predicted to drive kink motion deterministically, experimental evidence has been elusive, with only stochastic motion from thermal phonons or quasi-static loading observed. This is largely due to the discrete nature of real materials, where the Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier hinders controlled phonon-kink interactions. Here, we report experimental observation of acoustic-wave–mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks in a topological metamaterial, which eliminates the PN barrier by supporting a zero-energy kink. We also computationally reveal the dynamics of acoustic wave packet interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes—features absent in conventional discrete nonlinear systems. Our results enable remote kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.

 The increasing demand for renewable energy integration and scalable power generation highlights the need for efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cell systems. In this study, we present a modular hybrid design framework that enables flexible solid oxide fuel cell scale-up by interconnecting standardized component modules. We introduce a series-parallel configuration that strategically leverages anode and cathode off-gas recirculation to enhance both electrical and thermal efficiency. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate that the hybrid design achieves 66.3% electrical efficiency while reducing external water use by 59.9% and fresh air demand by 22%, outperforming conventional system designs. We further conducted a techno-economic analysis across four scale-up strategies and found that the hybrid design delivers the lowest levelized cost of electricity at 0.155 $/kWh. Through this work, we have highlighted the critical trade-offs between centralization and decentralization, high- and low-technology readiness level technologies, and economies of scale versus manufacturing capacity.

The results of a global expert survey reveal broad agreement on 13 key elements that should be included in defining transformational adaptation. 
 Transformational adaptation (TA) to climate risks has gained broad interest. While existing case studies and frameworks discuss key dimensions and elements that constitute TA to distinguish it from ‘business as usual’ or ‘incremental’ adaptation, a universally accepted definition of the concept remains elusive. Here we used a three-round Delphi study with experts from across the globe, to ascertain the level of agreement on key elements of TA, and to assess differences across expert types, geographical focus and administrative levels. We find broad agreement on 13 elements that are important in a definition of TA: root causes, climate resilience, time-horizon, diversity of knowledge, depth of change, distributive justice, context specificity, multiscale, restructuring, persistence, maladaptation, avoiding lock-ins and systemic change. However, notable differences exist in what expert subgroups value as important elements.

This study develops unit-level models to address this knowledge gap. 
 The massive production and consumption of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitate the development of end-of-life (EoL) recycling strategies to shape a sustainable LIBs life cycle. Pretreatment, which converts spent LIBs into black mass, represents a foundational stage in the recycling processes. However, our understanding of the impacts of pretreatment on the overall recycling performance and associated environmental footprint is limited. Here we develop operational unit-level models to evaluate the impacts of different pretreatment routes on industrial-scale LIB recycling. The pretreatment routes covered here include mechanical, thermal and chemical routes. We identify the mechanisms driving variability in materials recovery and environmental impacts across different pretreatment routes, cathode chemistries and regional contexts. Our high-resolution analysis reveals that pretreatment accounts for most materials losses and contributes to 16–38% of the environmental impact of LIBs recycling. By identifying key impact contributors, we further propose strategies for targeted process upgrade that could halve environmental impacts during the pretreatment stage. Additionally, this research provides comprehensive process inventories and bills of materials, facilitating further research initiatives, policy design and technology advancement in EoL LIB management, contributing to achieving circular economy in the LIBs sector.

 The structural complexity of tree crown describes the intricate arrangement and occupancy of leaves and thin branches in the canopy, which is crucial to shaping the stability of forest ecosystem. Numerous studies have provided sufficient theoretical basis and effective quantitative indexes for structural complexity, there are still some bottlenecks, such as: ecological niche occupancy and tree competitiveness have not yet been incorporated into the evaluation system for forest structural complexity; and the in-depth analysis of structural complexity at the individual scale has been ignored. In view of the above limitations, this study proposed a novel synergistic index, namely, the spatial occupancy index of tree crown (SOI) and taken the unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data of 14 plots of typical natural secondary forests and plantation (including six dominant tree species: Korean larch, Korean pine, Birch, Manchurian ash, Mongolian oak, and the plantation of Korean pine) as examples. Firstly, an optimized algorithm (i.e., 3D alpha shape-voxelization (3D-ASV)) was proposed to efficiently calculate the crown volume; Secondly, a coupling index based on crown volume was proposed to efficiently quantify the structural complexity and ecological niche of tree crowns. The results indicated that the 3D-ASV algorithm provides an obvious advantage in estimating tree crown volume, with the highest correlation with AGB (r = 0.63). Crucially, SOI is a comprehensive and effective index for quantifying structural complexity of tree crown, that is, SOI is not only highly positive correlation with canopy entropy, canopy cover, canopy top rugosity, fractal dimension (i.e., 0.72 vs. 0.52 vs. 0.57 vs. 0.40), but also compensates for their limitations in explaining tree competitiveness. We believe that SOI will complement the lack of structural complexity at the individual scale, and has the potential to become an ecological analysis and detection tool of forest structure, which will enable us to deepen our understanding of the theory of ‘structure determines function’ of ecosystems, and further promote the incorporation of ecological theories into forest management."

However, the interactions between EOC and nonmalignant cells before peritoneal metastasis remain unclear. To investigate this, whole EOC spheroids were observed using a multiphoton microscope, and their invasion ability was assessed. Mesothelial cells were identified as notable components of ascites through morphological assessment, immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Almost all EOC cells were spheroids, with 60% containing mesothelial cells. EOC cells quickly generate aggregated spheroids with mesothelial cells, and these aggregated cancer-mesothelial spheroids (ACMSs) invade collagen or mesothelial layers. Mesothelial cells forming ACMSs initiated the invasion. RNA sequencing analysis revealed marked RNA expression changes in mesothelial cells, whereas the changes in EOC cells were minor. Transforming growth factor–β1–stimulated mesothelial cells showed increased invadopodium formation along with fascin-1 up-regulation. These findings suggest that EOC cells alter mesothelial cells through ACMSs, thereby elucidating the rapid spread of EOC in the abdominal cavity."

The axolotl tail represents an opportunity to study regeneration of the primary axis including segmented muscle, vertebrae, and skin. During tail development, muscle stem cells (MuSCs) displayed expected specificity to the muscle lineage. Tail amputation, however, induced expansion of MuSC potential yielding clonal contribution to muscle, connective tissue including cartilage, pericytes, and fibroblasts. This expanded potential was not observed during limb regeneration, and cross-transplantation showed that these differences in potential are likely intrinsically determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling revealed that tail MuSCs revert to an embryonic mesoderm–like state. Through genetic manipulation involving the overexpression of constitutively active transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors orSmad7(antagonist of TGF-β signaling) in MuSCs, we demonstrated that the levels of TGF-β signal determine the fate outcome of MuSCs to connective tissue lineage or muscle, respectively. Our findings illustrate that variation in MuSCs may represent a fundamental difference between regeneration of primary axis versus appendage."

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of abundant extracellular vesicles (EVs) in planarians. Using imaging and molecular analysis, we show conservation of biogenesis, morphology, and protein composition of planarian EVs. Environmental stressors significantly elevate EV release, indicating that planarians dynamically regulate vesicle production. Functionally, planarian EVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring regulatory signals: We find that they shuttle small RNAs that effect systemic RNA interference (RNAi) throughout the organism. Notably, gene knockdown experiments reveal a crucial role for AGO-3, a member of the Argonaute family of proteins, in modulating the association of small interfering RNAs with EVs, linking the intracellular RNAi machinery to EV-based signaling. These findings highlight EVs as pivotal mediators of cell-cell communication in planarians, with broad implications for understanding the coordination of gene regulation and tissue regeneration in animals."

We circumvent these problems by making use of the critical behaviors in the Jaynes-Cummings model, to which the signal field is coupled. The information is encoded in the qubit’s excitation number, which displays a divergent changing rate at the critical point, and is extremely robust against decoherence and nonadiabatic effects. We demonstrate such a metrological protocol in a superconducting circuit, where an Xmon qubit, interacting with a resonator, is used as a probe for estimating the amplitude of a microwave field.

To resolve the incompatibilities between these two features, we propose a differential stochastic mapping method by applying information theory principles. We demonstrate CLAP on a 130-nanometer memristor chip, validating its versatility across diverse information processing tasks. In an electrocardiogram data collection task, CLAP achieves device authentication with an area under the curve of 99.46% and efficient signal compression with a software-level percentage root mean square difference.

We identify the RTX-family hemolysin EhxA as the driver of RBC-mediated thrombogenesis. Deletion ofehxAabolishes Ca2+influx, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, progression from discocyte to echinocyte to spherocyte, thrombin generation, RBC-endothelium adhesion, and RBC aggregation. Genetic complementation restores these readouts to wild type, and purified EhxA in bacteria-free assays recapitulates them while localizing to intact RBC membranes. By contrast, Δstx2mutants do not elicit these RBC phenotypes, distinguishing this pathway from Shiga toxin–dependent effects. Multiple regression quantifies the link between PS exposure, morphology, and procoagulant outputs. In rats, infection with wild type increased RBC remodeling and venous thrombosis, whereas infection with ΔehxAdid not. Together, the data define an EhxA-Ca2+-PS pathway that drives RBC structural remodeling and procoagulant activation during EHEC infection and nominate RTX toxins as targets for preventing toxin-induced coagulopathies."

Here, we find that degradation-tagged protein reporters could exhibit transient oscillatory expression, which standard single-scale models do not capture. We resolve this discrepancy by developing Gene Expression Across Growth Stages (GEAGS), a dual-scale modeling framework that explicitly couples intracellular gene expression to logistic population growth. Using a chemical reaction network model with growth phase–dependent rate-modifying functions, GEAGS accurately reproduces the observed transient oscillations and identifies amino acid recycling and growth-phase transition as key drivers. We reduce the model to an effective form for practical use and demonstrate its adaptability by applying it to layered feedback circuits, resolving long-standing mismatches between model predictions and measured dynamics. These results establish GEAGS as a generalizable platform for predicting emergent behaviors in synthetic gene circuits and underscore the importance of multiscale modeling for robust circuit design in dynamic environments."

We test these competing hypotheses by examining seasonal elevational ranges for 10,998 bird populations in 34 mountain regions. Multiple lines of evidence support the energy efficiency hypothesis, including that many mountain birds do not seasonally track their thermal niche with high fidelity while simulation models based on optimal energy balancing under current environmental conditions yield predictions that tightly match empirical data.

Vaccination of older adults with the adjuvanted vaccine did not restore CD8+defects but selectively enhanced T helper 17 (TH17) CD4+T cells and prevented their conversion into regulatory T cells, likely through lipid metabolic regulation.

Our meta-analysis differentiates scenarios that project biodiversity loss and that halt or reverse the trend based on their quantitative outcomes and explores their key characteristics such as scenario assumptions, drivers of loss, biodiversity indicators and models used. We found that bending-the-curve studies are scarce, and mostly do no account for climate change, which risks suggesting that the trend can be bent too easily. Our findings indicate that bending is only achievable with integrated efforts across different sectors, such as nature conservation, sustainable food production, diet change, and reduced food waste.

Cyclic peptide phage display with more than a billion variants is an invaluable tool in drug discovery. However, achieving efficient peptide cyclization on phages remains a challenge because of the limited availability of reaction sites, which also restrict scaffold diversity. Here, we report an isothiocyanate-derived cross-linker featuring dual reactive groups: a bromide that covalently attaches to cysteine thiols and a thiocyanogen that selectively forms a thiourea bridge with either the N-terminal amino group or ε-amines of lysine, depending on pH. This strategy enables pH-modulated cyclization. At pH 6.5, head–to–side chain cyclization occurs, and at pH 9.5, side chain–to–side chain ligation is performed. Both processes simultaneously generate thiourea scaffolds. To demonstrate the versatility and biocompatibility of this approach, we constructed cyclic peptide libraries using both cyclization methods and successfully selected binders for several targets, including cyclophilin D, murine double minute 2, and Keap1, with dissociation constants ranging from micromolar to nanomolar. Given the broad pharmacological potential of the thiourea moiety, this phage display library opens previously unidentified chemical space with high scaffold diversity and the integration of a proven pharmacophore for the development of cyclic peptide therapeutics."

Here, we developed a hydrogen-generating nanothrombolytic agent that enables enzymatic clot dissolution in combination with intelligent microenvironment reprogramming. Specifically, we assembled urokinase, a clinical thrombolytic drug, with hydrogenated silicene (SiH) nanosheet and fibrinogen, a substrate of coagulation reaction, to promote thrombolysis. Functionally, SiH nanosheet plays multiple roles in the nanothrombolytics: blocking the functional sites of urokinase to durably inhibit its activity in circulation to prevent systemic bleeding, followed by urokinase reactivation in response to SiH nanosheet self-degradation and prothrombotic microenvironment regulation through the in situ hydrogen generation, which mitigates the oxidative stress of vascular endothelial cells and inhibits their release of procoagulant factors. This microenvironment-adaptive thrombolysis strategy offers a promising paradigm for the precise management of thrombotic emergencies."

Here, we examined the development of four cooperative behaviors—fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty—in children (N= 413) aged 5 to 13 from five societies: urban United States, rural Uganda, Canada, Peru, and the hunter-horticulturalist Shuar of Ecuador. We also collected normative judgments from peers (N= 163) and adults (N= 86) of each community. We find substantial variation in cooperative behaviors and norms across populations, but, more generally, that children’s behaviors and norms tend to converge toward community-specific norms in middle childhood. We also identify three cooperative strategies—maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation—whose prevalence shifts with age and differs across societies. Together, these findings illuminate how cooperative behavior develops within and across cultures."

Bisphenol A (BPA), a known EDC, has been suspected to be linked to adiposity through activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis. Though many BPA alternatives have been introduced as substitutes, their effects on metabolic health remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanistic interactions of 11 BPA alternatives with PPARγ and their adipogenic potential. Using a PPARγ reporter assay, we assessed the binding affinity and activation potential of BPA alternatives, followed by X-ray crystallography of two potent activators, 4-benzyloxyphenyl 4-hydroxyphenyl sulfone (BPS4BE) and bisphenol PH (BPPH). Additionally, adipogenesis was assessed via a human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiation assay. Results revealed that the alternatives BPPH and BPS4BE potently activated PPARγ (BMD20 (μM): 0.23 and 0.34 respectively). Both significantly induced adipogenesis and a positive correlation was found between PPARγ activation and adipogenic differentiation. Crystallography revealed distinct binding modes for BPPH and BPS4BE compared to rosiglitazone, indicating partial agonism. These findings raise significant concerns about the safety of BPA alternatives and underscore the need for structure-based risk assessment to ensure safer substitutes."

Here, we aimed to identify the representative chemical and explore its effect and mechanism on bladder cancer progression with epidemiological and experimental methods based on the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). The quantile-based g-computation (QGC) model showed a positive association between urinary plasticizer metabolites and bladder cancer risks in older men (NHANES 2005–2018), with mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP, the secondary-metabolite of DEHP) identified as a main driver factor. We treated human bladder cancer cells with MEOHP at environmentally relevant concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 nM) and found that 100 nM MEOHP exposure activated a hybrid EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) phenotype. Mechanically, we confirmed that the environmental dose of MEOHP increased nuclear transposition of YAP and β-catenin (molecular initiating event, MIE), thereby sustaining the hybrid EMT phenotype of bladder cancer cells through a series of key events.

With new developments in MS instrumentation and analysis software, the approach has gained substantial momentum over the past decade. However, achieving high-quality analytical data that is reproducible and comparable across laboratories can be a bottleneck in non-targeted metabolomics and organic matter chemical analysis, especially for data reuse in repository-scale analyses. Understanding the capabilities as well as challenges of comparing LC–MS/MS data from different laboratories is necessary for inferring global trends from public data sets. To illuminate instrumentation factors that drive differences and variability, we used a standardized data analysis pipeline, including classical (CMN) and feature-based molecular networking (FBMN), to analyze data from a ring trial by 24 laboratories on identical sample sets of algal and DOM extracts that were mixed in predefined concentrations and spiked with standards. Our results showed that data sets from similar mass spectrometer types with unified instrument parameters were qualitatively comparable, resolving the same general trends and shared mass spectral features. Interlaboratory comparability was best for high-intensity features, while low-intensity features showed greater detection variability. Our analysis also highlights challenges when comparing data from instruments with different acquisition rates or operating with less standardized methods. Lastly, we provide recommendations for data integration, public data sharing, standardization, and best practices for standardized LC–MS/MS data acquisition, which will be critical for long-term time series and intercomparability of DOM chemical analyses."

However, the resulting large-scale production may pose health risks due to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) emissions. Here, we present the first trade-off analysis between PFAS wastewater treatment burdens and associated health benefits in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing and benchmark the costs against market values. Specifically, by 2035, the rapid expansion of these sectors is projected to discharge 4.4–10.9 kilotons of PFAS annually into wastewater, resulting in an estimated upper-bound range of 25–103 million comparative toxic units for human toxicity (CTUh) in the absence of treatment. Achieving the toxicity reduction via granular activated carbon (GAC), ion-exchange resin (IER), or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes will require annual investments of $16.5–50.0 billion across regions in 2035, equivalent to ∼0.5% of the respective electronics market value via IER. Moreover, we find that variations in breakthrough performance substantially alter both economic and environmental burdens, particularly in electronics wastewater, which is dominated by short-chain PFAS, whose limited removal efficiency amplifies these effects. By quantifying the cost-health nexus, our findings provide actionable insights for PFAS governance and reinforce the urgency of globally coordinated efforts to align industrial growth with environmental and public health protection."

However, inefficient electron transfer and metabolic imbalance between acidogenic bacteria and sulfidogens limit SSA performance, especially from mariculture solid wastes (MSW) containing high-strength sulfate. This work unveiled the neglected role and mechanism of rhamnolipid (RL) in modulating microbial interspecies electron transfer for SSA during MSW anaerobic fermentation. RL, at environmentally relevant levels of 20–200 mg/g suspended solids, simultaneously improved sulfide (40.1–87.9%) and short-chain fatty acids (8.0–19.3-fold) yield. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) exhibited higher capacitance and electroactivity to store or transfer electrons in the presence of RL. Proper RL facilitated pili-like filament formation and redox mediator secretion. The flavins and cytochrome c combination was promoted by RL to mediate one-electron transfer with a higher transfer rate via the flavin semiquinone intermediate. RL increased the dipole moment of the α-helix peptide and spontaneously interacted with the C═O of amide groups, enabling efficient electron hopping in EPSs. RL also activated key components in the intracellular electron transfer system, delivering more electron flow to sulfate reductase. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses verified the differential enrichment of microorganisms and key gene upregulation related to SSA, EPS secretion, quorum sensing, ATP, type IV pili, and electron shuttle synthesis. These findings provide new insight into the roles and interactive mechanisms of biosurfactants in modulating microbial electron transfer."

We perform injection‐reactivation experiments on critically stressed faults to test how different injection strategies shape slip and seismic moment release. We find that injection strategies regulate the cadence of slip events rather than the total seismic moment. Compared to continuous injection, cycled injection triggers frequent and smaller events, reducing maximum moment magnitude and deformation energy of individual events. Injection–extraction cycles actively reduce pore pressure, temporally partition successive slip events, and effectively suppress delayed seismicity. Regardless of constant or cycled injection rates, maximum seismic moment (M0 ${M}_{0}$) scales with cumulative injection volume (ΔV ${\Delta }V$) i.e.,M0∝ΔV3/2 $\left(\mathrm{i}.\mathrm{e}.,{M}_{0}\propto {\Delta }{V}^{3/2}\right)$.

While previous studies have primarily focused on the brine acidification induced by CO2 injection, triggering geochemical reactions in carbonate rocks and leading to mechanical degradation, the mechanical behavior associated with salt precipitation in drying zones, particularly the failure mechanisms, remains poorly understood. In this work, we designed a reservoir‐condition displacement system to mimic near‐wellbore drying process and further investigated the rock failure modes due to salt precipitation in red sandstone samples. Our study demonstrates that, despite the densification of the pore structure due to salt precipitation, the overall mechanical performance of the rock undergoes significant deterioration. More importantly, for the first time, we observe a distinct transition of failure mode from shear‐to tensile‐dominated under uniaxial compression. Microstructural analysis further shows that the growth of polycrystalline and bulk crystals induces microcrack initiation and propagation, with the failure mechanism of rocks subjected to salt precipitation primarily characterized by intercrystalline damage at weak bonding interfaces under external loading."

 CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing technologies offer promise for treating inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), however safe and efficient ocular delivery of precision editors remains challenging. To address this challenge, we report a class of Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB)-derived lipidoids that bind and deliver proteins. Subretinal injection of Cre complexed with these lipidoids into mT/mG mice leads to robust recombination in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. We employ the CBB-lipidoid platform to deliver adenine base editor (ABE) ribonucleoproteins (RNP). Incorporating CBB lipidoids into liposomes improves delivery efficiency. CBB11 stands out for facilitating precise in vivo ABE-mediated gene editing. Delivery of liposome-CBB11-RNP complexes results in a 120-fold increase in base editing compared to RNP alone and restores the scotopic ERG b-wave response in the rd12 mouse model.

 Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation is considered as an important contributor of aging, however, whether there is endogenous factor(s) in VAT that counteract this process remains obscure. Here we reported that interleukin (IL)−10 expressing B lineage (B-10) cells are greatly expanded in aged VAT in human and mouse. In aged VAT, B-10 cells are the primary source of IL-10. B cell-specific knockout of IL-10 exaggerated aging-related inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) and reduced lifespan, which could be partially recovered via adoptive transfer of B-10 cells from wild-type mice. Aged VAT microenvironment enhanced IL-10 secretion and proliferation of B-10 cells. The proliferation of B-10 cells was mediated by increases in BAFF in aged VAT. Knock-down of BAFF in VAT compromised aging-related expansion of B-10 cells.

Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26 × power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains  >90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing. Neuromorphic photonic systems can incur significant energy for moving and converting data between digital and analog domains. This work shows that integrating analog memory into these processors can save 26 × power over conventional digital-to-analog architectures while keeping  > 90% inference accuracy."

 Hydroxyl Radical Protein Footprinting is a powerful tool to probe protein higher-order structure, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. It is mostly performed in vitro, but recent advances have extended its use to live cells, nematodes, and 3D cultures. However, to the best of our knowledge, application in living mammalian tissues has not been accomplished. Here, we present the successful use of radical protein footprinting (RPF) in mammalian whole blood from wild-type and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Using persulfate photoactivated with the FOX Photolysis System, we achieve effective protein labeling without significant disruption to blood cell morphology. An optimized quenching protocol eliminates background labeling. We report oxidative modifications for the eleven most abundant proteins detected, revealing disease-associated conformational changes in multiple proteins. We validate that in-blood RPF identifies changes in protein structure resulting from complement activation and increased transferrin iron saturation in T2DM mice. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of RPF in mammalian blood and create opportunities for structural proteomics in preclinical models and clinical samples.

 The Rab11 endosomal recycling pathway is exploited by important respiratory RNA viruses such as IAV and RSV, aiding viral egress from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Late in infection, Rab11-containing vesicles specifically transport viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes towards the cell surface before packaging and budding. Rather than employing traditional Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, virus-infected cells generate remodelled Rab11-containing vesicles, as observed during IAV infection. Besides Rab11, no other conserved host co-factors have been identified among these various vRNP trafficking vesicles. Here we discover and confirm myoferlin’s association with IAV vRNPs in the cytoplasm and colocalisation with Rab11 during late stages of infection. We also find that this role is conserved in late-stage vRNP trafficking of other viruses, including RSV and SeV. Myoferlin likely recruits the EHD family of proteins, which are involved in endosomal biogenesis, to these unique vRNP trafficking endosomes, highlighting myoferlin’s pivotal role in viral replication.

Here, the authors present a fast two-stage framework that detects atomic and torsional errors with quantum-mechanical accuracy. 
 Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the field of 3D molecule generation. However, the lack of effective evaluation methods for 3D conformations limits further improvements. Current techniques, in order to achieve the necessary speed for evaluating large number of AI-generated molecules, often rely on empirical geometric metrics that do not adequately capture various conformational anomalies, or on molecular mechanics energy metrics that exhibit low accuracy and lack atomic or torsional details. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage approach that achieves both high speed and quantum mechanical level accuracy. The first stage, termed the validity test, employs an AI-derived force field to identify atoms with elevated energy resulting from implausible neighboring environments. The second stage, known as the rationality test, utilizes a deep learning network trained on data with density functional theory accuracy to detect rotatable bonds with high torsional energies. To demonstrate the functionality of our evaluation system, we applied our approach to five recently reported 3D molecule generation AI models across 102 targets in Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced dataset. To facilitate accessibility for the academic community, our method is available as an open-source package.

 Non-Abelian geometric phases offer fault-tolerant unitary operations that are essential for holonomic quantum computation. While the “all-geometric” approach has successfully enabled robust control of atoms, ions, and electrons in various quantum systems, its photonic implementations have remained limited by a lack of tunability—an essential feature for modern classical or quantum optical information processing. Here, we demonstrate nonvolatile multilevel tunable generic special-orthogonal (SO) geometric phases on a multilayer silicon photonic platform incorporating the phase-change material (PCM) of Sb₂Se₃. By toggling Sb₂Se₃ between crystalline and amorphous states, we dynamically control the number of degenerate states involved in the holonomy, enabling switching between different holonomic paths and SO(m) geometric transformations. Our results bridge the key gap between robust geometric-phase control and in-memory reconfigurable photonics, establishing a paradigm for fault-tolerant, high-dimensional operations in integrated optical systems.

 Spintronics has emerged as a revolutionary frontier in the pursuit of faster, more energy-efficient, and technologically advanced electronics. However, the transmission distance of conventional ferromagnetic spin–orbit torque is typically limited to <10 nm, posing a critical challenge for spin current transport. Here we grow Mn3Sn films with a 30° canted magnetic octupole moment oriented out of plane, in which the Kagome spin structure is fully perpendicular to the film surface. By introducing a spin–orbital coupled amorphous Pt overlayer, we demonstrate the electrical switching dynamics of magnetic octupoles in Kagome antiferromagnetic Mn3Sn. Remarkably, perpendicular spin currents reverse Mn3Sn layers up to 60 nm thick. The switching efficiency of Mn3Sn/Pt bilayers increases with antiferromagnetic thickness, peaking near 40 nm before decreasing, reflecting a long spin diffusion length sustained by twin topological spin structures. Direct observation of magnetic octupole dynamics further validates the presence of such twin spin orders. Moreover, our theoretical analysis reveals that twin topological spin canting intrinsically supports ultralong-distance octupole switching. These findings establish antiferromagnetic Mn3Sn as a robust platform for efficient spin transport and highlight the pronounced long-range nature of spin-orbit torque enabled by twin spin order.

 The 2017 Pohang Mw 5.5 earthquake is currently the largest seismic event induced by Enhanced Geothermal Systems. The high uncertainty on geological and mechanical conditions of the rupture fault of this earthquake has originated a debate on its triggering mechanisms. Here, we propose a stochastic poromechanical analysis approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling and poromechanical models to address the uncertainty problem. By conducting a large number of coupled poromechanical simulations varying the uncertain geomechanical parameters, we yield an exceedance probability of 7%-15% for the Pohang mainshock. Remarkably, this physics-based stochastic prior forecast is quite comparable to the posterior likelihood inferred from the magnitude-frequency relationship of recorded seismicity. Our results reveal a scaling relationship between the earthquake magnitude and the initial fault stability, which indicates a threshold of the initial Coulomb Failure Stress to differentiate if faults are initially, critically stressed, and thus, the earthquake magnitude. This Pohang threshold is −0.2 to −0.1 MPa, about one order of magnitude larger than that proposed for natural earthquakes. This study highlights that the reactivation of critically stressed faults may trigger damaging earthquakes even for small poromechanical perturbations and opens a promising avenue for assessing the likelihood of induced earthquakes based on physical understanding.

Despite this long history, such efforts remain challenging: using terraces as deformation markers requires knowledge of their initial geometry, and most attempts to attribute terrace formation to paleoclimate forcing rely on qualitative comparisons between paleoclimate archives and terrace ages. We illustrate how simulating alluvial valley profiles and terrace formation can substantially improve such analyses. We apply a physically‐derived model of alluvial river long profiles to the Río Santa Cruz, a glacially‐fed river in Patagonia with extensive terraces. To explore how different geomorphic drivers affect terrace formation, we impose (a) sinusoidal changes in the input sediment‐to‐water discharge ratio, (b) sediment pulses, (c) sinusoidal surface uplift and subsidence simulating glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and (d) sea‐level variations. Each forcing mechanism generates distinct terrace geometries and lag‐time distributions, with the river response time relative to the forcing timescale influencing both. We test which terrace‐formation drivers are most likely to have generated the terraces along the Río Santa Cruz, whose response time is considerably longer than timescales of glacial–interglacial cycles. Our results reveal complex patterns of incision and aggradation, including destructive signal interference leading to terrace‐formation gaps. Although terrace profiles may remain non‐unique, when combined with a quantitative understanding of alluvial river processes, they represent a powerful archive of diverse Earth‐system processes, including variations in water and sediment supply, sea‐level change, GIA, tectonic deformation and mantle dynamics."

Here, the authors discover that the GluA4 AMPA receptor subunit has distinct structural properties and conformational plasticity that tune its activation to glutamate. 
 AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPAR ion channels exhibit multiple subconductance states that tune neuronal responses to glutamate. GluA4 is the rarest subunit in the brain but is enriched in interneurons and the cerebellum. Rising evidence points to GluA4 AMPARs in the development of neurological diseases, but the structural mechanisms of GluA4 function remain enigmatic. Here, we show the distinct features of GluA4 that tune AMPAR function. We find that GluA4 AMPARs have a canonical “Y” shaped architecture where local dimer pairs are domain-swapped between the amino terminal domain (NTD) and ligand binding domain (LBD), both of which comprise the extracellular domain. All four LBDs are glutamate bound yet open the GluA4 ion channel by asymmetric hinging in all four channel helices. We observe that the glutamate-saturated LBD has conformational plasticity, which tunes the ion channel gate below. These data provide a framework for understanding channel subconductance, outline the distinct properties of GluA4, expand our understanding of conformational plasticity in AMPARs, and will inform therapeutic design.

Consequently, a bulk electrical conductivity of > 110 % IACS is obtained in copper at room temperature. 
 High electrical conductivity is crucial for electrics, electronics, communications. Eliminating defects such as grain boundaries and impurities is a primary approach to enhancing electrical conductivity in metals. Although reducing electron-phonon interaction can further contribute to electrical conductivity, only a marginal enhancement is obtained by imposing external pressure even high up to gigapascal. Here we report a contrary strategy to transforming defects into conductive benefits, by forming abundant defects of severely distorted lattice via heterogeneous interface-assisted plastic deformation in metal (copper). Such lattice distortions are generated under a non-extreme condition, and cause internal giant local stress significantly suppressing electron-phonon coupling and thus reducing phonon-caused electron scattering. Consequently, a striking bulk electrical conductivity of > 110% IACS is obtained in the copper at room temperature, which is equivalent to the effect of an external high pressure of about 10 gigapascals. Our work provides an extendable approach for developing high-performance metal conductors.

Here, the authors identify an interaction between the condensin and the mediator complexes. Its disruption disturbs mitotic gene expression, chromatin domain formation, and chromosome segregation. 
 Condensin organizes eukaryotic genomes into three-dimensional (3D) chromosome architectures that support accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this organization remain unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized interaction between the condensin subunit Cnd1 and the mediator subunit Pmc4 in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We characterize a condensin mutation, cnd1-K658E, which disrupts this interaction and observe that it impairs the formation of condensin-mediated chromatin domains during mitosis, resulting in chromosome segregation defects. This condensin-mediator interaction facilitates condensin recruitment to highly transcribed genes and mitotically activated genes, the latter of which demarcate condensin-mediated domains. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol treatment and Pmc4 mediator depletion impair expression of mitotically activated genes, diminish condensin enrichment at those boundary genes, and disrupt domain boundaries, suggesting that mediator contributes to mitotic gene expression and chromosome architecture via phase separation. Together, these results reveal a mechanism by which mitotic gene expression patterns shape condensin-mediated chromosome architecture to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. Accurate chromosome segregation relies on three-dimensional genome organization, yet its molecular basis remains unclear.

 Limb loss causes severe sensorimotor deficits and often necessitates prosthetic devices, particularly in lower-limb amputees. Although direct neural recording from residual nerves offers a biomimetic route for prosthetic control, low signal amplitudes and challenges in nerve interfacing have limited adoption. Intraneural multichannel electrodes provide a potential solution by enabling access to motor signals from muscles lost after amputation. Here, we report intraneural recordings from two transfemoral amputees using transversal intrafascicular multichannel electrodes implanted in distal branches of the sciatic nerve. We identified multiunit activity associated with volitional phantom movements of the knee, ankle, and toes, exhibiting joint- and direction-specific modulation distributed across electrodes. A Spiking Neural Network–based decoder outperformed conventional methods in predicting attempted movements, with further gains achieved by integrating intraneural and intermuscular signals. Motor and sensory maps showed minimal overlap, indicating early segregation within the sciatic nerve. These findings pave the way for bidirectional, neurally-controlled prosthetic systems.

 Recognition of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) is crucial for target site recognition by CRISPR–Cas systems. In genome editing applications, the requirement for specific PAM sequences at the target locus imposes substantial constraints, driving efforts to search for novel Cas9 orthologs with extended or alternative PAM compatibilities. Here, we present CRISPR-PAMdb, a comprehensive and publicly accessible database compiling Cas9 protein sequences from 3.8 million bacterial and archaeal genomes and PAM profiles from 7.4 million phage and plasmid sequences. Through spacer–protospacer alignment, we infer consensus PAM preferences for 8003 unique Cas9 clusters. To extend PAM discovery beyond traditional alignment-based approaches, we develop CICERO, a machine learning model predicting PAM preferences directly from Cas9 protein sequences. Built on the ESM2 protein language model and trained on the CRISPR–PAMdb database, CICERO achieves an average cosine similarity of 0.69 on test data and 0.75 on experimentally validated Cas9 orthologs. For Cas9 clusters where alignment-based predictions are infeasible, CICERO generates PAM profiles for an additional 50,308 Cas9 proteins, including 17,453 high-confidence predictions with CICERO confidence scores above 0.8.

 Transcription factors (TFs) search for and bind specific DNA target sites to control gene expression. However, eukaryotic TF target search within the chromatinized genome is poorly characterized. Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging to dissect the role of differentially-charged DNA-binding domain flanking regions in the target search of Sox TFs. We demonstrate that the flanking region of Sox2 markedly enhances search efficiency compared to the negatively-charged flanking region of Sox17. The involved mechanisms are distinct for naked DNA compared to chromatin. On DNA, the enhanced search of Sox2 is driven by an increased target recognition rate during 1D sliding, despite reduced sliding speed. Conversely, enhanced nonspecific interactions between the Sox2’s DNA-binding domain flanking region and nucleosomes facilitate binding to compact chromatin and reinforce pioneer activity. These findings provide critical insights into biophysical mechanisms governing TF target search within the chromatinized genome.

In this study, we investigated the bacterial community dynamics and functionality in an urban chlorinated DWDS, dominated by Mycobacterium, through a multiphasic approach which included 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, metagenomics and microscopy. Our results showed that biofilm communities were more functionally diverse compared to those from water and that the biofilm maturity was positively correlated with the prevalence of potential Mycobacterium emerging pathogens and a broader distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the microbial community. The reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and the corresponding genomospecies allowed the identification of key microbial taxa involved in the biofilm matrix remodeling, with 22% of them strongly responsible for biofilm formation. A diverse and novel viral community was detected across the system, including new putative Mycobacterium phages that might act against mycolic acids and thus contribute to biofilm destabilization.

However, conventional nanofiltration membranes are generally constrained by the trade-off between permeability and selectivity, which limits their practical application. In this study, we designed a reactive interlayer based on piperazine-grafted carboxylated cellulose nanofibers, which participates in the interfacial polymerization process to form a mixed nascent layer (MNL) with smaller pore sizes. This intermediate structure further regulated the formation of an ultrathin polyamide layer featuring uniform pore size distribution and a crumpled morphology. Combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we systematically elucidated the influence of different nascent interlayer structures on the final morphology and chemical composition of the polyamide layer. The resulting membrane exhibits exceptional ion sieving performance, with a Cl–/SO42– selectivity of up to 155.4, and maintains a high water permeance of 43.9 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 while demonstrating effective removal of various micropollutants.

As carbonate chemistry remained unchanged below 0.1% effluent, the toxicity was attributed primarily to contaminants. These findings indicate that EGCS effluents pose a significant threat to marine life."

Gu,Polyphosphate as an Integral Component of Global Phosphorus Cycling through Earth’s History,"Polyphosphate (polyP), a condensed linear form of orthophosphate residues, is functionally versatile phosphorus (P) polymer that has persisted since prebiotic Earth. Long treated as a cellular biochemical curiosity, it remains systematically overlooked in global P budgets and Earth system models. In this review, we compile the first global-scale synthesis of environmental occurrence, biological regulation, and ecosystem functions of polyP across terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and engineered systems. Integrating 568 environmental observations and over 3000 microbial genomes, we unveil that polyP is a quantitatively significant and phylogenetically widespread component of global P cycling, often comprising 5–40% of total phosphorus in major ecosystems. We synthesize current understanding of how microbial taxa, including bacterial or archaeal polyP-accumulating organisms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, mediate polyP turnover and interact with carbon/nitrogen cocycling under fluctuating redox, nutrient, and climatic conditions. Our quantitative assessment reveals that global polyP stocks in soils, sediments, and wastewater systems form a substantial, yet previously unaccounted, reservoir of recoverable and climate-sensitive P. The omission of polyP from existing models creates systematic blind spots in understanding P bioavailability, retention, cycling, and sustainability. Integrating polyP into the global P narrative is essential for advancing new frontiers in climate-smart biogeochemical forecasts, circular nutrient management, and long-term water-energy-food ecosystem security under global climate change."

We model Coulomb pre‐stress evolution along the Sagaing Fault from 1839 to 2025, incorporating coseismic stress transfer from 10 M ≥ 6.5 earthquakes and interseismic tectonic loading, to investigate their influences on the 2025 rupture. Results show that the 1839 Ava earthquake could have cast a long‐lasting pre‐stress shadow at both ends of the 2025 rupture, provided it ruptured the same seismogenic fault. Dynamic triggering effects, fault geometry complexity, and stress localization may explain rupture within these shadow zones. Further southward rupture propagation of the 2025 rupture into the Bago segment is likely inhibited by a combination of geometric and pre‐stress barriers, preventing a larger rupture."

Here, we use a laboratory fault that allows direct observation of slip to determine which fault conditions promote linked ruptures, and how to observationally evaluate their likelihood. Higher concentrations of normal stress due to increased normal force, applied stress asperities, or larger heterogeneity between the samples, all lead to significant increases in linked rupture likelihood. The mean radiated energy enhancement factor (REEF) of large events is an excellent proxy for linked event likelihood, and a combination of REEF and duration can identify the rupture style of some but not all events. The results imply that globally observed variations of REEF can be interpreted as variations in stress concentration."

However, sulfur biogeochemistry and its coupling with carbon and iron cycling remain poorly constrained in hydrothermal sediments. We investigated the effect of temperature on carbon‐sulfur‐iron diagenesis in subsurface sediments (≤370 m depth) of the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California. Sediments have a low average carbon‐to‐sulfur ratio (∼1.6), especially at hydrothermal active sites (1.3–0.67). These values are well below the typical value of 2.8 for marine sediment and could reflect carbon release and relative sulfur enrichment. Elevated temperatures accelerate the thermal breakdown of sedimentary organic matter, leading to hydrocarbon expulsion, increased dissolved organic carbon release, and ultimately carbon loss. Elemental sulfur content correlates positively with reactive iron, indicating iron oxides facilitate elemental sulfur accumulation. These results highlight the temperature effect on carbon storage and iron redox chemistry control on sulfur dynamics in hydrothermal systems."

Recently, there have been significant concerns of human infection risks during marine beach recreations due to the elevation of seawater temperature in the United States Eastern Seaboard. This study carried out a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to estimate health risks associated with V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus infections from water ingestion during recreational activities under varying climate scenarios that predict sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the next 75 years. Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate Vibrio concentrations at specific SSTs, ingestion dose during recreational activities, and dose‐response relationships were applied to predict the probability of infection under varying exposure scenarios. The risk of Vibrio infections along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard was first estimate for the year 2020 based on measured SSTs. The same approach was applied to predict the risk in the year 2100 based on projected SSTs using two IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The results indicate that the median risks of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus from recreational activities along the Eastern Seaboard increase significantly from 2020 to 2100, with rises of up to 1,000‐fold under RCP 8.5 and up to 100‐fold under RCP 2.6. Furthermore, the estimated risks represent a conservative lower‐bound of vibrio‐related health impacts because wound infection from water contact was not included.

 Flow of Earth’s upper mantle has long been considered to occur by slow, near-continuous creep. This behaviour is observed in classical high-temperature deformation experiments and is a fundamental component of geodynamic models. The latest generation of high-resolution experiments, however, have revealed that materials ranging from metals to ice exhibit a spectrum of behaviours, termed mild-to-wild plasticity, that range from this mild continuous flow to intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate. Here we show, using nanoindentation experiments, that olivine exhibits measurable wildness, even under conditions at which its behaviour is expected to be relatively mild. Specifically, during experiments on olivine single crystals at room temperature, continuous plastic flow is punctuated by intermittent bursts of displacement with log-normally distributed magnitudes, indicating avalanches of correlated dislocation motion that account for ~8 ± 6% of the plastic strain. The framework of mild-to-wild plasticity predicts that wildness should increase with depth in Earth, with flow of the asthenosphere occurring almost entirely by wild fluctuations of deformation at the grain scale. The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides additional constraints on models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mechanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events. Flow of Earth’s upper mantle may include intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate of increasing frequency with depth, according to results of nanoindentation experiments on olivine crystals."

 Soft and conducting organic materials are ideal candidates for stretchable bioelectronics and wearable devices. Despite recent advances, our understanding of conducting polymer nanostructures and how they arise remains incomplete, given the limited high-resolution studies and molecular-level descriptions of these systems. Here, we employ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate the evolution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) morphology in solution and the resulting solid state structure in the presence of ionic and molecular additives. Our results reveal the formation of heterostructural elongated fibers consisting of PEDOT:PSS micelles in solution. Cryo-EM further reveals that additives increase the number of fibrils, in addition to inducing the formation of crystalline domains. We observe that fibril and crystalline phases in solutions act as a template for the growth of these nanostructures in the solid state. Furthermore, exploiting cryo-EM reveals the role of solid-liquid interactions in PEDOT:PSS through the imaging of PEDOT:PSS nanostructures after the hydration of thin films. Hydration leads to the swelling of heterostructural fibers while reducing the crystalline domain size. Such behavior explains the mechanical robustness of PEDOT:PSS thin films processed with various additives as well as the high electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS in applications such as organic electorchemical transistors. Soft and conducting organic materials are promising for electronic devices, though their nanostructures are not fully understood, due to the lack of high resolution real spacing imaging of these complex systems.

The authors achieve bidirectional control of exciton energy in a twodimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductor via interfacial spin-exciton coupling. 
 Excitons are primary elementary excitations in solids that present both fundamental interest and technological importance, showing great potential for photospintronic and quantum transduction applications. The emerging coherent collective excitations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors raise prospects for spin-exciton interactions and multifield control schemes. However, realizing the arbitrary manipulation of excitonic quantum states, while preserving the inherent dynamic and response advantages of antiferromagnetic nature remains challenging. Here we achieve bidirectional modulation of the CrSBr exciton energy via interfacial interaction-modified spin-exciton coupling in a CrSBr/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Compared with pristine CrSBr, the photoluminescence peaks in the heterostructure can exhibit blueshift and redshift corresponding to 6.1% and 8.6% of the total bandwidth, respectively. We reveal that the interfacial charge-transfer-driven magnetic coupling in the heterostructure effectively enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the exchange interaction of CrSBr, thereby stabilizing its antiferromagnetic spin configuration, suppressing interlayer electron-hole recombination, and ultimately leading to an anomalous blueshift of the exciton emission. Our findings demonstrate an approach for bidirectionally modulating exciton energy in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, which provides substantial flexibility in device design and offers an avenue for potential wavelength control in quantum information and optoelectronic technologies.

Here, the authors report that molecular interface engineering on silver electrodes enables precise regulation of key reaction intermediates for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis. 
 Manipulating the selectivity-determining step in the hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing intermediates is critical to achieving high ammonia selectivity in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Here, we propose a molecular interface engineering strategy that functionalized with thiol-anchored aromatic ligands to regulate the interfacial binding affinity and activation of key nitrogen-containing intermediates on silver nanocube surfaces. By systematically varying the electronic properties of the substituents, we identify 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde as the most effective ligand, increasing the ammonia Faradaic efficiency from 50.8% to 98.9% and achieving a yield rate of 14,366.1 μg h–1 cmgeo–2 at –0.63 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical simulations further reveal that 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde modification promotes the activation of weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules and accelerates the hydrogenation of *HNO intermediates. This targeted modulation of interfacial binding affinity offers an effective strategy for selectivity control in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. The enhanced performance is further validated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyser, underscoring the practical viability of this molecular design strategy for selective nitrate conversion.

 Online acquisition of polarization kinetics data from impedance spectrum is critical for fault diagnosis and health assessment of fuel cells to overcome lifetime bottleneck, but it is technically challenging due to stringent measurement requirements and complex evolution under different operating conditions. To address this, we propose an impedance spectrum prediction method based on the denoising diffusion implicit model, which requires only collectable short time-domain profiles and can generate high-fidelity impedance spectrum through a stepwise denoising process. To validate our method, we performed extensive comparative impedance tests under various operating conditions for fuel cells with different power levels, constructing four datasets comprising over 5700 samples in total. Through performance evaluation experiments, robustness tests, and transfer learning experiments, our proposed method has demonstrated satisfactory performance and outperforms existing methods by down to 37.3% on median mean absolute percentage error. As a useful resource, we have released the trained model and the largest datasets of impedance spectrum for fuel cells to date. Reliable fuel cell monitoring needs rapid access to impedance.

 Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) technology plays an important role in protein structure and protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies. However, there are serious shortcomings in the data processing and analysis methods of XL-MS that limit its ability to perform in-depth analysis. Here, we built a deep learning-based XL-MS versatile platform, XL-MSDigger, to address the bottlenecks of XL-MS technology. The foundation of this platform is a deep learning-based multidimensional information prediction tool, Deep4D-XL, for cross-linked peptides. This tool is capable of accurately predicting retention time, collisional cross-section, and fragment ion intensity information of cross-linked peptides. Through the multidimensional information prediction, we develop rescoring algorithms and workflows for DDA and DIA analysis data, which improve the coverage of DDA-based XL-MS identification, and realize the evaluation of false discovery rate and high-reliability identification of DIA-based XL-MS analysis. In addition, XL-MSDigger enables DIA-based XL-MS analysis using predicted spectral libraries, allowing improved detection of protein–protein interactions in targeted or moderate-scale interaction analyses.

Here the authors discuss how these different changes in mountain regions affect downstream regions. 
 Mountains, often called the world’s ‘water towers’, are vital sources of freshwater that sustain ecosystems and societies far downstream. Climate change is altering their role, impacting the quantity, timing and quality of mountain water supply. While substantial research focuses on snow and glacier changes within mountains, a holistic understanding of how water cycle changes in mountains impact human water use and ecosystems downstream is still needed. Here we address how these changes cascade downstream, affect diverse social–ecological systems and pose challenges for adaptation. We also highlight major research gaps and outline research priorities for improving understanding of these coupled systems under a changing climate.

A study now provides an intelligent strategy to enable early warning of fouling events. 
 Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are widely implemented in many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), contributing to a sustainable urban water cycle. However, they are often challenged by the problem of membrane fouling. Developing tools capable of monitoring and providing early warning of fouling events is therefore essential to maintain the operational stability of MBRs. Here we propose a spectral sensing empowered machine learning strategy for prediction and providing early warning of fouling events and validate it in a full-scale MBR during long-term operation. Specifically, integrated with ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectral fingerprints that can sensibly profile the key molecular structures responsible for fouling, a data–knowledge codriven machine learning model was established. The model can accurately (R2 > 0.80) predict fouling tendency within the next 5‒7 days, which is superior to purely data-driven learning. Spectral fingerprints contributed 17‒30% of interpretability across models, and process conditions and other membrane/foulant material descriptors explained the rest. By exploring the spectral fingerprints of specific processes, our strategy could also be generalized to various WWTPs, offering an intelligent solution (for example, with the aid of spectral early warning) to achieve stable operation of WWTPs and ultimately contribute to a cleaner environment. Membrane bioreactors play a pivotal role in protecting the water environment and achieving a sustainable urban water cycle, but their operational stability faces great challenges due to membrane fouling.

 Clean cooking fuel interventions can substantially advance Sustainable Development Goals related to health, poverty, gender equality and (possibly) climate change. Here we systematically review gender roles within cookstove randomized control trials (RCTs) with respect to (1) health and exposure; (2) time, labour, finance and behaviour; (3) climate; and (4) the research activities. We focus on RCTs because public health scholarship considers RCTs, despite limitations, to provide the highest-quality evidence to guide policy and widescale programming. Across our 123 included studies, women are frequently targeted but then not acknowledged in time, labour, finances and even health outcomes. Acknowledgement of gender norms is scarce. Using WHO gender-responsiveness categories, we find that 37% of studies were gender-unequal or gender-unaware. Women are often monitored only as proxies for their unborn children, our category of gender-unaware but sex-aware (26%). Twenty-nine percent are gender-sensitive, with only 6% gender-specific and two gender-transformative studies. We present recommendations for the field to shift to more gender-sensitive research designs, without which the field risks leaning into existing inequalities and basing future interventions on spuriously gender-neutral premises.

 Climate change intensifies urban heat stress, creating urgent challenges for sustainable mobility. Here we analyzed 4068 individuals’ heat adaptation behaviors across different transportation modes in Beijing. Our findings, derived from a causal mediation framework, suggest that e-bikes offer superior climate resilience compared to traditional cycling and walking. E-bike users demonstrated strong overall adaptation and adopted significant protective measures, contrasting with pedestrians and cyclists who both showed significant reductions in mobility. Demographic analysis revealed female users exhibited particularly strong adaptation responses, while the elderly showed concerning gaps in adaptation capacity across all transportation modes. Urban design features further influenced adaptation, with green spaces helping to sustain mobility. These findings, while context-specific to the Beijing study area, suggest that supporting e-bike infrastructure represents a promising strategy for maintaining urban mobility while enabling effective heat adaptation behaviors under increasing climate stress.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are persistent coastal pollutants, yet the ecological and genomic strategies governing the persistence and function of degraders under in-situ stress remain elusive. Here we decode these adaptive mechanisms using metagenomics and cultivation in the Pearl River Estuary, integrated with global comparative analyses. We reveal a multi-level adaptive strategy where high PAH stress drives ecological network densification and selectively enriches the thermodynamically favorable catechol ortho-cleavage pathway. Crucially, we elucidate a conserved genomic “division of labor”, where chromosomes encode stable upstream activation steps, while plasmids serve as specialized, mobile reservoirs for downstream central aromatic processing. This plasmid-mediated functional partitioning is globally conserved across diverse coastal ecosystems, although the reliance on mobile vectors is dynamically tuned by environmental stability. Collectively, these findings unveil a holistic adaptive framework that integrates ecological cooperation with genomic partitioning, highlighting a plasmid-mediated “plug-and-play” mechanism that underpins microbial resilience and guides precision bioremediation.

 Tens of thousands of seabirds and coastal animals suffer from exposure to oily substances each year from oil product spills. Methods of bird assistance primarily include catching birds, removing contaminants from their feathers, and rehabilitation after laundering. Based on our practical experience in the treatment of birds contaminated with fuel oil, which was spilled into the Black Sea and the coast of the Krasnodar Territory as a result of an accident involving two tankers carrying 9200 tons of fuel oil, here we analyze the effectiveness of the traditional technology of cleaning birds with potato starch, followed by washing with detergents. Additionally, we collected dynamic data and applied Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods for stratification of non-survival risks in Black Sea bird species after washing and rehabilitation, respectively. Based on our experimental results and analysis, we consider the applicability of preventive measures to conserve bird populations, such as sound and kinetic deterrence.

This article presents data for the solar and battery supply chains to assess what progress had been made toward these goals before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act called many IRA provisions into question. The results reveal significant successes, but also persistent challenges, in building these supply chains. While the U.S. was slated to produce 61% of expected solar module demand in 2025, it would have produced only 37% of the cells and 11% of the ingots and wafers needed for those modules. In batteries, the U.S. could have realistically produced 100% of expected cell demand in 2025, but announced projects accounted for only 47% of the cathode, 23% of the anode, and 24% of the precursors. U.S. supply would have slightly increased as a percent of expected demand in 2030, but the situation would have remained broadly the same. There are four implications of the analysis. First, it demonstrates the difficulties of onshoring, especially in upstream components. Second, it shows that expected U.S. production would have, rather than exclude other countries, created global demand-pull. Third, it reveals that Biden’s tariffs would have likely increased the cost of U.S.-made panels and cells. We propose an alternative policy instrument."

To move towards decarbonization goals while maintaining a just transition in the electricity sector, we assess the regional employment implications in 2035 of two policy ambitions, the ‘Fit for 55’ package of the European Union (EU) and a hypothetical EU-wide coal phaseout. We account for changes in employment and associated skills covering the whole supply chain from resource extraction to decommissioning, including electricity generation, storage, and transmission. Employment transfers are distinguished from employment gains to identify skill needs at a NUTS 2 regional scale. We find that net employment creation is higher and more evenly distributed under the ‘Fit for 55’ policy plan compared to the hypothetical EU coal phaseout. Under both policy scenarios, the skill requirements for the workers in transition (many of whom are transferring from fossil fuel technologies to low-carbon technologies) depend on the specific region, while the skill sets needed for employment gains are similar across all European regions as they are driven by employment growth in technologies that require similar skills (wind and solar power).

Yet, how national plans align with EU-wide ambition, alongside the implications for investment, infrastructure, and power-system operation, remain insufficiently assessed. We address this gap by linking an EU-specific implementation of a prominent integrated assessment model with Member State-level disaggregation (GCAM-Europe) with a higher-resolution European electricity system model (EXPANSE). This modelling framework captures national heterogeneity, sectoral detail, and spatiotemporal variability in electricity demand, renewable supply, and storage, enabling the assessment of grid investments and infrastructure. We analyse four scenarios representing EU-wide (Fit-for-55) or national (NECP) targets, implemented through explicit policies (POLICY) or cost-optimal carbon caps (COST_OPTIMAL). Results show all scenarios achieve the −55% fossil CO2 reduction by 2030, with the electricity sector driving the largest chunk. Renewable energy nearly doubles, with POLICY scenarios accelerating electrification and heat pump deployment, while COST_OPTIMAL scenarios leaning more on biofuels. Efficiency targets are partially met, with POLICY scenarios distributing savings more evenly across Member States compared to concentrated reductions of COST_OPTIMAL scenarios. By 2035, power system transformation diverges strongly: COST_OPTIMAL scenarios expand ~1250 GW of new capacity, concentrated in few resource-rich regions, while POLICY scenarios reach ~1750 GW with broader spatial distribution, requiring higher investments in renewables and grids. Average wholesale electricity prices are higher and more heterogeneous under POLICY scenarios, reflecting carbon costs, transmission bottlenecks, and reliance on fossil backup. Results highlight trade-offs between economic efficiency and equitable burden-sharing, underscoring the importance of coordinated EU governance, infrastructure planning, and complementary policies to balance cost-effectiveness with political feasibility and social acceptance."

We introduce an expanded steel sector representation and a differentiated trade market to assess the impacts of CBAM implementation across OECD and non-OECD regions under deep decarbonization scenarios. Additionally, we explore the role of free emissions allowances, export rebates, and green subsidies in modifying CBAM outcomes. Our findings indicate that CBAM can reduce emissions leakage and incentivize the adoption of low-carbon steel technologies but may disadvantage exporters in regions implementing CBAM, leading to a net-loss of production in CBAM regions.

While anticipating job losses is crucial for designing effective policy responses, we examine the future of coal workers across time and geographies in China and India under mitigation scenarios. We focus on mine workers who have been less studied, outnumber those in coal power plants, and are more geographically concentrated. Our approach enriches the results of an integrated assessment model by incorporating mine-level data and coupling with a novel module for demographic and labour mobility to understand how concentrated vulnerabilities challenge the transition. A decline in coal jobs is inevitable in China due to continued mining productivity increase. The potential employment reduces by 41% in the next decade even under current climate policies. On the other hand, India faces a critical crossroads as projected mining production growth surpasses productivity increases. Beyond national climate ambitions, differences in mining productivity, local economic diversification, labour concentration, and employment patterns drive subnational disparities in vulnerability to accelerated mitigation. Notably, Shanxi and Jharkhand, the main mining regions for each country, account for a third of the 1.2 million workers who may struggle to transition to other sectors in the next decade under ambitious emissions mitigation. Although they are less exposed with a smaller mining workforce, the challenges for unproductive regions such as West Bengal or Shandong are even more urgent. Our findings provide quantitative insights to guide just transition policies, emphasising the need for targeted support, including transitional assistance and economic diversification, in the most affected coal-producing regions."

 Field-based measurements of soil health under various conservation management practices have been compiled into the global Soil Health Database (SoilHealthDB), supporting comprehensive analyses of the effects of systems such as cover cropping, no-tillage, agroforestry systems, and organic fertilization on soil health. To support more effective soil health assessments and related analyses, it is essential to maintain updated and standardized datasets.

All soil health indicators were harmonized to improve consistency, traceability, and analytical accuracy. The number of observations increased from 5,907 to 8,874, expanding global spatiotemporal coverage and improving representation across diverse climate regions. Several new variables related to cover crop management have been introduced, including cover crop termination date, cash crop planting date, cover crop termination method and residue return method, cover crop irrigation and fertilization practices. These additions enable more detailed assessments of best management practices. Furthermore, the inclusion of experiment duration-related data allows for more robust investigations of temporal trends in soil health outcomes. New indicators related soil carbon pools further enhance the database’s utility for evaluating the effects of conservation practices on carbon cycling. Overall, SoilHealthDB-V2 offers a robust, globally relevant foundation for soil health assessment and provides critical support for developing evidence-based conservation management strategies."

An arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from each source location in forward tracking is found to cause ambiguous self-recruitment. In contrast, we found that an arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from the settlement location in backtracking leads to unambiguous self-recruitment. 
 Accurately estimating self-recruitment (SR), which is the fraction of recruits at a location that originated locally, is fundamental to understanding population connectivity. Biophysical models typically compute SR by releasing larval particles from source locations and tracking them forward in time. However, forward-tracking studies employ a variety of particle-release strategies (random, constant, area-scaled or production-scaled), which often leads to ambiguous SR estimates. Using theoretical analysis supported by numerical simulations of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) larvae in Lake Erie, we show that SR is inherently dependent on larval production at all source locations. As a result, SR cannot be computed unambiguously in forward-tracking models unless the true larval production is known and released from every source location. In contrast, empirical parentage-analysis studies estimate SR directly as the fraction of locally produced juveniles among those sampled at a settlement location, without quantifying larval production at all sources. Motivated by this, we computed SR using backward-in-time particle tracking from the settlement location. We demonstrate that SR estimated using backtracking is independent of the number of particles released, which provides considerable benefit; namely the use of any magnitude of particles released and eliminating the need to identify all contributing sources or their larval output. This reduces the effort required to estimate SR and provides a theoretically consistent basis for its calculation. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for estimating SR and highlight the advantages of applying backtracking models for studying larval dispersal and recruitment."

Here, we include these effects in a new model. We create functions connecting changes in global temperature, carbon dioxide, and sea level to energy supply and demand, food systems, mortality, economic damages, and other important quantities. Including these effects will allow us to explore their impact on future changes in the human and climate realms. 
 Feedbacks from the climate to other components of the coupled human-Earth system are expected to strongly influence the co-evolution of human society and its environment. Representing these feedback loops between climate and society, via the Earth system's response to human activities and the subsequent effect back onto social systems, is essential in order to fully explore the dynamics of the coupled system. However, focus on these feedbacks has traditionally been limited, or excluded, in prior Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and IAM-based modelling protocols. This limits the understanding of the effects of climate change and the response of the overall system to future emissions scenarios and policies.The new IAM Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments version 2.1 (FRIDAv2.1), documented and explored within this paper collection, seeks to address this by internalising the feedbacks between subcomponents of the human-Earth system. Within this new IAM, these connections are therefore a key part of the structure, and are documented and discussed here.FRIDA represents these climate-to-society feedbacks, conceptualised as climate impacts, through global impact functions. Where possible, they are based on estimates from existing literature, reframed as functions of global climate variables to facilitate their representation within FRIDA. Other impact channels, with insufficient background literature to inform their structure and parameter values, are incorporated via the internal calibration of the IAM.Since the systematic representation of climate damages within an IAM is a relatively novel endeavour, the approach is constrained by literature limitations and necessary simplifications. In addition, the high level of abstraction of the FRIDA model imposes limits on the set of impacts which can reasonably be implemented, and the level of process detail amongst those included. Nevertheless, FRIDA's endogenous representation of climate feedbacks to human and natural systems enables valuable insights and intuition building on an underexplored topic. The general nature of the climate damage functions aggregated and documented here allows for their incorporation within other models and frameworks."

The MFES unit employs cathode boundary-layer pumping to rapidly separate cathodically generated OH– from bulk solution, achieving >96.0% phosphate removal without membranes. This system effectively treats phosphate (5–60 mg·L–1) and Ca2+ (10–100 mg·L–1) across varying concentrations and demonstrates robust tolerance to interfering ions (Mg2+, HCO3–, and NH4+). Using a 15 mm × 10 mm pore stainless-steel cathode, the process maintained >80.0% P removal during continuous 700 h operation without operational interruptions (e.g., backflushing). The MFES effluent feeds directly into the FB system, where fluidization accelerates amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) adsorption and crystallization onto seeds, enabling rapid product recovery. The MFES-FB process achieves (1) 73.8% overall P recovery and (2) energy consumption of 55.3 kWh·kg P–1 while eliminating membrane materials throughout the entire process. This study not only achieves long-term stable operation, demonstrating strong practicality and scalability, but more importantly reveals a “spatiotemporal decoupling” synergistic mechanism. This insight may help stimulate fresh perspectives for the future development of novel electrochemical resource recovery systems."

While hydrogen may provide global public good for reducing carbon emissions, it is important to quantify its potential impact on  local communities for ensuring equitable and socially accepted energy transitions. This study quantifies the effects of hydrogen infrastructure on nearby communities by using a high-resolution panel of residential property transactions in California from 2012 to 2021. The analysis incorporates three types of hydrogen infrastructure: hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), hydrogen production facilities (HPFs), and hydrogen corridor pipelines (HCPs). Our findings show that residential properties within a 2.2 km radius of an HRS experience an average devaluation of 2.74%–3.45% (or US$19,413–$24,444). Following a major hydrogen explosion, this depreciation intensifies to 4.41%–5.28%. HPFs also exert significant negative externalities, with property values declining by 4.52%–5.64% within a 4 km radius. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that minority communities, particularly those with low shares of White residents and high proportions of Black and Hispanic populations, experienced disproportionately greater devaluation. Our empirical evidence of the local impact can help policymakers better systematically promote the larger scale of hydrogen energy deployment while minimizing the potential negative impacts on local communities."

In wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), it is crucial to understand the metabolism of biochemical indicators (BCIs) because metabolites are indicative of consumption (e.g., illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals) or unintentional exposure (e.g., pesticides, endocrine disruptors). Phase I metabolites are more widely studied in WBE due to a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, stability and analyte cost. Phase II metabolites are often assumed to deconjugate within the sewer network due to high native concentrations of enzymes. This work deconstructs this assumption and demonstrates how the in-sewer stability of phase II metabolites is dependent on both the parent structure and the conjugate type. In total, 79 BCIs were assessed and compared to urinary metabolism studies via time-variable enzymatic deconjugation using two enzymes, β-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase. The concentrations of free analytes excreted as N-glucuronides, O-glucuronides, and sulfates increased following deconjugation, reinforcing the persistence of these BCIs during transport throughout the sewer network. Conversely, no concentration increase was observed for acylglucuronides, demonstrating complete in-sewer glucuronide cleavage. In-freezer stability of conjugates was also assessed over 6 months, where it was observed that the stability of the parent structure is the driver of stability rather than the conjugates themselves, indicating minimal enzymatic activity upon storage. Overall, this paper presents a framework that can be deployed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of phase II metabolism and improve the accuracy of WBE workflows as well as environmental risk assessment approaches."

This study explored the influence of extended exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) on the growth and movement of A549 lung cancer cells, with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic reprogramming. We demonstrated that prolonged exposure to PS-NPs markedly increased the ability of lung cancer cells to proliferate and migrate. Using an integrated approach combining transcriptomic profiling and C13-labeled glucose flux analysis, we observed that chronic PS-NPs exposure induced metabolic reprogramming characterized by the activation of gluconeogenesis and suppression of glycolysis. Mechanistically, PS-NPs upregulated the gluconeogenic enzyme mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2) and downregulated enolase-1  (ENO1), a glycolytic enzyme. Notably, knockdown of PCK2 attenuated PS-NPs-induced cell proliferation and migration, underscoring its functional role. We further identified that stress-responsive activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) serves as a crucial mediator of PCK2 and ENO1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by PCR (ChIP-PCR) confirmed enhanced binding of ATF3 to the promoter regions of PCK2 and ENO1 upon PS-NPs exposure. Silencing ATF3 abolished PS-NPs-induced changes in PCK2 and ENO1 expression and blocked the associated increase in cell proliferation and migration. Clinically, elevated ATF3 and PCK2 expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In conclusion, chronic exposure to PS-NPs promotes lung cancer progression by inducing metabolic reprogramming via ATF3-mediated regulation of PCK2 and ENO1. These findings shed light on the cancer-promoting capabilities of PS-NPs and identify the ATF3-PCK2 axis as a promising target for lung cancer therapy."

 Bacteriophage–antibiotic coadministration is increasingly used for refractory infections, yet the in vivo interactions among phages, bacteria, antibiotics, and host immunity remain poorly defined. We report a longitudinal, multiomic case analysis of a male in his seventies with cystic fibrosis (CF) experiencing an acute-on-chronic pulmonary exacerbation caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After colistin discontinuation due to nephrotoxicity, ciprofloxacin was initiated, with an intravenous two-phage cocktail introduced days later. Distinct mucoid and nonmucoid bacterial subpopulations associated differentially with antibiotic versus phage exposure, consistent with nonoverlapping selective pressures. Phage activity was temporally constrained, with one phage dominating early bacterial and genomic signals before attenuating after approximately seven days, despite continued genomic detectability. In contrast, the second phage showed no evidence of productive activity. This asymmetry coincided with phage-reactive humoral immunity: pre-existing IgM was associated with lack of recoverability of one phage, while treatment-associated IgM emergence temporally tracked attenuation of the dominant phage. Although phage-resistant variants arose during therapy, they showed limited expansion relative to susceptible populations. These findings define a mechanistic framework—chemobiotherapy—in which chemical and biological antimicrobials coordinate through ecological and immunologic complementarity rather than direct pharmacologic synergy.

 In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects. More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72–1.43; log-rank p = 0.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI −6.7–9.1, pnon-inferiority = 0.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p = 0.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except for grades 1–2 peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.033), grades 1–2 deafness/otitis (p = 0.021), and grades 1–2/3 nephrotoxicity (p = 0.005; p = 0.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects therefore more effective platinum drugs are expected.

Yang,Degraders of the dengue virus capsid protein exhibit differentiated pharmacology relative to capsid inhibitors,"The authors demonstrate that targeted protein degradation of the dengue virus capsid suppresses infection through capsid-dependent pathways rather than classical inhibition, revealing a new antiviral strategy effective against resistant viral variants. 
 Due to the limited size of viral genomes, most viral proteins are multifunctional; yet most direct-acting antivirals are designed as single-function inhibitors. The dengue virus (DENV) capsid protein serves as a building block for new virions while also interacting with multiple host factors to remodel the cellular environment. Using established capsid inhibitor ST148 as a targeting ligand, we develop a DENV capsid degrader, RPG-01-132, that exhibits a broadened spectrum of activity against the four DENV serotypes and an ST148-resistant mutant virus. Using multiple approaches, we show that RPG-01-132’s sub-micromolar antiviral activity is due to CRL4CRBN-dependent degradation of capsid and that this mechanism disrupts capsid-related pathways required for productive infection, including infectious virus output and capsid-mediated antagonism of the interferon response. This pharmacology is well-differentiated from ST148, which interferes with assembly of new virions, but has no demonstrated effect on the capsid’s nonstructural functions. These findings demonstrate that targeted protein degradation can thus enable antiviral pharmacology not observed with conventional antiviral inhibitors and that is resilient to point mutations that reduce inhibitor potency. The authors demonstrate that targeted protein degradation of the dengue virus capsid suppresses infection through capsid-dependent pathways rather than classical inhibition, revealing a new antiviral strategy effective against resistant viral variants."

Here, the authors report that chromium doping can enhance the activity and stability of cobalt spinel oxide through promoting interfacial water dissociation. 
 Although cobalt spinel oxide-based catalysts have demonstrated promising performance for the oxygen evolution reaction in acid, strategies reported have largely focused on manipulating the binding energies of reaction intermediates through tailoring the inherent electronic structures. The role of interfacial water structures on the electrode surface in promoting the acidic oxygen evolution reaction performance through controlled water activation has been largely overlooked. Here we show that introducing chromium dopant into cobalt spinel oxide can simultaneously increase the activity and stability by promoting interfacial water dissociation and dynamic electron transfer. The chromium dopant can not only dynamically regulate the electronic structure of cobalt and mitigate the over-oxidation of active cobalt sites at high overpotential, but also enhance the coverage of hydroxyl species on the catalyst surface, thereby optimizing the interfacial water structure, accelerating the reactant free-water supply and promoting subsequent interfacial water dissociation. Consequently, the obtained catalyst demonstrates enhanced performance in both solution electrocatalysis and device electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction performance by promoting interfacial water dissociation. The role of interfacial water structures in regulating the acidic oxygen evolution performance of cobalt spinel oxides has long been overlooked.

This article shows that abundant CO-rich syngas can be directly used to synthesize ethylene. 
 The electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction (COR) reaction offers a carbon- and energy-efficient pathway to ethylene. However, present systems typically rely on pure CO, making the process costly and difficult to scale. An economically feasible alternative is to use syngas—the predominant industrial CO source—produced globally at quantities approximately 250 times higher than pure CO, but containing hydrogen and other components. Therefore, for a syngas-based COR system, achieving high single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) is essential, as high gas flow rates introduce excess hydrogen, complicating and increasing the cost of downstream product separation. Nevertheless, optimizing SPCE leads to hydrogen dilution and insufficient CO transport to the copper cathode, which in turn decreases ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE). To overcome this trade-off, guided by Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory, here we develop a COOH-functionalized active carbon material which captures CO from syngas, strengthens CO adsorption on the copper cathode and thereby enhances ethylene FE even under CO-diluted conditions. This design enables an ethylene FE of 72% alongside a CO SPCE of 73% in a simulated syngas containing an H2/CO ratio of 2/1—outperforming reported systems operated with pure CO feed and offering a more scalable, resource-efficient route to sustainable ethylene.

 Variable renewable energy droughts, so called Dunkelflaute events, emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.  Temporal and spatial complementarities between wind and solar power strongly reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of Europe’s variable renewable energy droughts, according to a 38-year, multi-threshold analysis."

 Hydroclimate changes in Northern Africa reflect the interplay between mid-latitude westerlies and the West African monsoon, along with their intensity variations. The response of these atmospheric circulation systems to changing boundary conditions and their impacts on the precipitation during past episodes of climate change remain unconstrained, because of scarcity of well-dated terrestrial hydroclimate records from Northern Africa that reach beyond the Holocene interglacial. We present a 300,000-year hydroclimate record inferred from periods of speleothem formation from Tunisia, located in the northernmost Africa. This record captures the alternation of humid and arid phases during glacial and interglacial climate states, as well as the superimposed millennial-scale events. Humid conditions prevailed during the interglacial periods, while arid conditions were associated to glacial boundary conditions. Cave evidence suggests that these humid phases in northernmost Africa could mainly be attributed to the southward shift and strengthening of the mid-latitude westerlies and the Mediterranean storm track during interglacials, and vice versa in glacials. A comparison with palaeolake records from the Sahara suggests suggests that during interglacials winter westerlies and the summer West African Monsoon were crucial to bring moisture in Northern Africa, contributing to the development of wet conditions in the Sahara.  Humid climate in Northern Africa prevailed during interglacial periods over the past 300,000 years and was mainly driven by southward shifts and intensification of mid-latitude westerlies and the Mediterranean storm track, based on speleothem records from Tunisia."

 With shifting environmental trends, many Earth system elements may be poised to undergo critical transitions or ‘tipping’. Reliable anticipation of these tipping elements is vital to inform policy decisions. Many of the current methods for tipping point detection are based on loss of resilience or ‘critical slowdown’ of the system as it approaches a tipping point. However, these methods are prone to false alarms; the detected slowdown may be an artifact of nonstationary noise unrelated to tipping behavior. Here, we explore the efficacy of early warning signs based on a nonequilibrium thermodynamics framework. The model-free detection method relies on the increased intrinsic time-irreversibility due to detailed balance breaking, preceding the onset of tipping or instabilities. We demonstrate that these EWSs are effective for tipping point detection and robust against false alarms due to nonstationary noise, using idealized models for two key elements of the Earth system that are prone to tipping: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Arctic sea-ice loss. Increased intrinsic time-irreversibility provides a robust early warning for Earth system tipping points, outperforming traditional methods in the presence of nonstationary noise, according to a study based on a nonequilibrium thermodynamics framework."

 Retrieving granular information from large-scale geospatial databases is challenging and can require significant domain expertise, owing to complex data taxonomies and hierarchical data structures related to geometry and topology. In this research, a multi-agent system is developed that uses large language models (LLMs) for geospatial information retrieval based on natural language queries. The proposed solution employs LLMs within three agents that decompose data retrieval into sub-tasks: human instruction comprehension; data collection identification; and feature category screening. The three agents collaborate in a sequential workflow to accumulate knowledge and identify a pathway to the correct information within a hierarchical data structure. A data retrieval module subsequently interprets the search extent and retrieves data through API calls to the underlying databases. The proposed approach is evaluated in a case study with a large and complex geospatial database, the National Geographic Database operated by Ordnance Survey in the UK. Evaluation was based on a total of 83 sample queries, i.e. 40 human queries collected from volunteers, 40 synthetic queries generated by LLM, and 3 queries selected from a benchmark database. The proposed system answered majority of the queries successfully, namely 22 out of the 31 valid human queries, 29 out of 37 effective synthetic queries, and all 3 queries from the benchmark dataset. This demonstrates good potential for flexible data retrieval, locating a variety of geographical features from different data collections in response to natural language questions about tennis courts, public car parks, and restaurants, etc. The multi-agent solution was also evaluated using OpenStreetMap and the results demonstrate the transferability of the proposed method in handling different data taxonomies and structures. Our findings also highlight several research challenges around the “AI readiness” of documentation, complex geospatial data taxonomies, ambiguity in human language, and complex spatial reasoning. Overall, our study addresses two major research gaps: (1) the use of unstructured natural language to accurately retrieve geospatial information; and (2) the use of LLMs to navigate multiple heterogeneous datasets in a hierarchical data taxonomy."

 We present a merged database of five curated databases (DoD2k version 2.0.0) developed for Common Era (1–2000 A.D.)  paleoclimate research. A toolkit to create the database is also provided and leverages codebases developed by individual database developers and the paleoclimate data informatics communities over the past decade.  It includes Python notebooks for (1) loading each database from its public repository, using a common, compact set of terms for metadata and data management; (2) their merger using that common set of dictionary terms; (3) a multistage algorithm to identify candidate duplicates; (4) an operator-supervised, semiautomated decisionmaking procedure, checking against a common set of metadata and comparison metrics; and (5) creation and checking of the finalized, duplicate-free database across 22 dictionary terms.  Each of the curated databases, which arise from individual, community and PAGES (Past Global Changes) 2k working groups, represent a range of development approaches, from single archive, single observation datasets with a range of reported environmental responses, to multiarchive-multiobservation collections which target a specific climate response.The resulting DoD2k spans 13 archive types, 37 data types, and 4781 records within the Common Era. We illustrate the value of the DoD2k with two applications.  In the first, we extract the moisture (M) and temperature (T) sensitive subset of records and perform an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the resulting multi-archive, multi-observation MT-sensitive dataset.  In the second, we show that calcite speleothem oxygen isotopic composition is consistent with that simulated using simple models of this proxy system.

The dataset, processed using advanced computing, is openly accessible and offers a foundation for studying the role of ocean vortices on weather, climate, and ecosystems. 
 Satellite altimetry has revolutionized our understanding of ocean physics by providing global sea-surface height data. These measurements reveal the intricate dynamics of ocean mesoscale strain and vortices, and their interactions with multiple physical scales in the oceans. Although surface dynamics has been extensively studied, investigating the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies globally remains a computational challenge. In this study, we combine the comprehensive World Ocean Database (WOD) with a database of Eulerian mesoscale eddies (META3.2 DT). We pre-process and filter the WOD data, selecting quality controlled profiles at local depths greater than 100 m. By integrating WOD data with altimetry-derived mesoscale eddies, we aim to facilitate future studies on the role of mesoscale vortices in multiple processes, such as heat, mass and nutrient transport, and water-mass subduction. The analysis is performed using high-performance computing resources, with Python packages for parallel processing of the data and analysis of more than 4.2 million profiles with more than 35 million vortex observations.

Here, we analyzed the water quality of 20 kiosks from 4 different manufacturers across 6 states in the first comprehensive comparison of the chemical and microbial characteristics of kiosk water to paired tap samples. Of the 16 kiosks listing specific water treatment processes (others indicated “filtered” or “purified”), only 1 dispensed water with ionic composition (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+)  inconsistent with the stated treatment. Most kiosks tested used reverse osmosis (RO), which removed fluoride and residual disinfectant, although we found no evidence of microbial contamination. RO also provided the benefit of removing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. However, we frequently detected higher lead levels in kiosk water than in nearby tap water. Lead was detected (>0.05 μg/L, our method detection limit) in 15 kiosks; 5 were >1 μg/L (American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation), 2 were >5 μg/L (FDA allowable level for bottled water), and 1 was >10 μg/L (US EPA Action Level). Lead co-occurred with zinc and copper, consistent with corrosion of lead-containing plumbing materials. XRF analysis of plumbing in 2 kiosks from different manufacturers with nationwide distribution confirmed this suspicion although all components in question met the definition of lead free under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Lead release was most evident  with the use of RO treatment, which can produce corrosive water low in alkalinity and pH. Going forward, the removal of lead-containing plumbing components downstream of RO treatment and regulation with routine testing of kiosk water quality is imperative to address this unchecked public health risk."

However, conventional bioaccumulation assessments are costly, time-consuming, and low-throughput, limiting their utility for screening the growing array of emerging QACs. In this study, we developed a protein affinity ultrafiltration mass spectrometry (PA-UF-MS) strategy using human serum albumin (HSA) as a molecular bait to selectively isolate bioaccumulative QACs from disinfectants. We identified 12 traditional and emerging QACs, including several silanol alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (silanol-ATMACs), with strong HSA binding affinities [fold changes (FCs): 10.1–60.0]. Five silanol-ATMACs (C10–C18) were further structurally elucidated by MS/MS characterization and confirmed via a hydrolysis-based transformation experiment. In silico toxicokinetic modeling and in vivo rat experiments revealed longer elimination half-lives for silanol-ATMACs compared to ATMACs, indicating their bioaccumulation potential. These silanol-ATMACs were mainly detected in medical disinfectants with a median total concentration (∑silanol-ATMAC) of 779 mg/L. While detected at modest levels in indoor dust (median: 8.04 ng/g), silanol-ATMACs exhibited elevated concentrations in human serum, comparable to those of 18 traditional QACs (medians: 10.6 and 13.9 ng/mL, respectively). Our findings demonstrate the application of PA-UF-MS for prioritizing emerging bioaccumulative contaminants and highlight the need for further toxicological evaluation and human exposure assessment of silanol-ATMACs."

Here, we employed DNA quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) using two VFAs, acetate and propionate, in cyclic anaerobic/aerobic incubations to assess their effects on P cycling and microbial activity with biomass from two full-scale EBPR water resource-recovery facilities that utilize VFA addition. We found that anaerobic VFA uptake preferences differed within known groups of PAOs, such as Candidatus Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera-affiliated members (e.g., Ca. Phosphoribacter), between the two biomasses. The combination of qSIP with metagenomics identified isotopically labeled phages that were linked to active PAOs, highlighting their potential roles in modulating EBPR community composition and activity. The highest levels of anaerobic labeling from acetate were in genomes belonging to Saccharimonadales and Rickettsiales, which are generally host-associated with bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. This finding highlights the possibility of cross-feeding between PAO hosts and their parasites or predators, as well as the role of so-far uncharacterized organisms participating in carbon cycling under EBPR conditions.

This study investigated the Sb(V) adsorption mechanism on the (001) and (012) facets of hematite and the associated isotope fractionation mechanism, combining batch adsorption experiments, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that the adsorption capacity of the (012) facet is stronger than that of the (001) facet, with Sb existing in an edge-sharing complex form on the (001) facet, while edge and corner-sharing complex forms coexist on the (012) facet. The lighter Sb isotope is preferentially enriched on both facets through equilibrium fractionation, with the fractionation extent independent of pH and initial Sb concentration. Since the (001) facet contains fewer Sb atoms in the Sb–Fe shell, the complexation is weaker, resulting in a Sb isotope fractionation value (Δ123Sbaqueous-adsorbed = 14.11 ± 0.03 ‰) that is higher than that of the (012) facet (Δ123Sbaqueous-adsorbed = 9.8 ± 0.02 ‰).

However, real-world assessments of battery recycling at the industrial scale remain limited. Here, we present the most comprehensive life-cycle assessment to date using operational data from 46 recycling facilities in China, covering approximately 50% of the global capacity in 2023. We evaluate multiple recycling outputs, black mass, metal salts, precursors, and cathodes and reveal that new hydrometallurgical technologies for direct precursor and cathode recovery could reduce carbon emissions by 61% compared to mining production due to skipping multiple extraction steps. Real-world recycling often requires blending with virgin materials to maintain the targeted Ni–Co–Mn ratio for recycling the nickel–cobalt–manganese (NCM) precursor or cathode due to market preference for high-nickel chemistries. Our results show that, compared with virgin production, fully recycled cathode materials can reduce pack-level carbon footprint levels of lithium–iron phosphate (LFP) batteries by 11% (2–14%), significantly greater than previous estimates, and by 24% (12–27%) for NCM811 batteries. Coupled with dynamic fleet modeling, battery recycling is identified to cumulatively avoid 147–433 million tons of CO2 emissions in China by 2050.

This study investigated geogenic iodine dynamics in the Jianghan Plain agricultural system, where widespread high iodine groundwater (54.5–655 μg/L) drives irrigation practices. Field experiments and hydrogeochemical analyses revealed that 7 days of irrigation increased surface soil iodine by 27–99% (reaching 1.47–2.92 μg/g). Fe(II) oxidation during aeration drives iodine cycling via Fe(III) oxyhydroxide formation, immobilizing groundwater iodine and transforming iodide to organic iodine (16%) and iodate (11%). Organic matter (OM) played dual roles: as an iodine reservoir and precursor for organo-iodine compounds (OICs) formation. Using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we identified 93 newly formed OICs in dissolved organic matter (DOM) of aerated groundwater and 54 additional OICs in water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) of postirrigation soil, with highly unsaturated groundwater DOM and aromatic soil WSOM facilitating iodination.

All mixed dust extracts activated PPARγ within the exposure concentration range (7.8 × 10–2–10 mg dust/mL assay medium). A total of 123 putative agonists covering 35 structural categories were found, among which 30 chemicals were verified as specific PPARγ agonists through reference standards and in vitro assays.

The second type, “external functional materials”, mediates the exchange with external energy. We discuss the mechanisms of enhancing interspecies and extracellular electron transfer, which largely determine the microbial metabolism of substance and energy. We reflect on the remaining challenges in bringing functional materials to practical applications and clarify the potential suitable scenarios based on the properties of these materials. In the future, designing new functional materials using artificial-intelligence-driven models should necessitate identifying specific microbial metabolic mechanisms.

Studies have assessed methane emission measurement systems but have not quantified the effect on methane emissions of oil and gas operator access to methane emission data. In this study, methane emissions were measured with and without operator access to real-time methane emission data (“data-on” and “data-off”) and fugitive emission alerts (“alert-on” and “alert-off”). In two U.S. producing basins, 46 wellsite, processing, and production facilities were monitored for 10 months. In Basin 1, average emission rates decreased nonsignificantly by 7% after alerts were turned on (data-on/alert-off to data-on/alert-on mode). In Basin 2, emissions decreased by 39% after alerts were turned on (at the transition from data-on/alert-off to data-on/alert-on). When both data and alerts were turned off for the operator (data-on/alert-on to data-off/alert-off), emissions were reversed, increasing by 85%. Wellsites emitted disproportionately more than facilities. Basin 1 sites exhibited a more coherent site design than Basin 2. These findings suggest that operator access to continuous methane monitoring data and site-specific alerts at oil and gas production sites may correlate with reduced methane emissions, particularly for assets with heterogeneous equipment vintages and design. Longer periods of study will help to solidify these findings."

Extensions are commonly made of human hair, other natural fibers, or synthetic fibers that may be treated with dyes, flame retardants, waterproofing agents, pesticides, antimicrobials, and conditioning agents with hazardous properties. Hair extension use may contribute to exposure and health disparities. We used nontargeted analysis (NTA) to understand the chemical composition of 44 hair samples. We performed suspect screening and NTA using two-dimensional gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. We used the Highlight machine-learning platform to annotate detected chemical features by comparing their mass spectra to those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology library. We detected 933 chemical signatures, with 5,275 total detections across all samples. We confirmed and tentatively identified 169 chemicals then classified their potential hazard using structure (e.g., organohalogens) and presence on public chemical lists. Nearly 10% of samples contained hazardous organotin compounds, including some above 0.4% (w/w) tin. Four organotin structures were confirmed with reference standards, and seven structures were solved de novo. The remaining structures are tentatively annotated but unambiguously contain tin or tin and halogens based on the unique isotope patterns and mass defects. Forty-eight chemicals confirmed and tentatively identified in hair extensions were on a hazard list including California’s Proposition 65. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive testing of hair extensions publicly reported. Follow-up research to understand exposures and policies to increase disclosure and reduce hazards will reduce health risks."

We chronically exposed the medicinal leech Hirudo verbana for two months to four PFAS congeners at 1 nmol L–1 aligned with the EU Drinking Water Directive thresholds (PFAS total = 0.50 μg L–1): a legacy long-chain acid (PFOA), two short-chain ether replacements (HFPO-DA and PFMoBa), and an intermediate methoxy analogue (PFMOPrA). Histology, enzymatic histochemical staining, immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction tracked the canonical inflammatory sequence, represented by CD11b+ granulocyte influx, CD31+ neovessel formation, and recruitment of CD45+/ACP+ macrophage-like cells, together with transcriptional responses of oxidative stress genes (SOD and GST) and two immune mediators (HvRNASET2 and HmAIF-1), chosen for their known role in leech innate immunity. PFOA and PFMOPrA sustained the full CD11b/CD45/CD31 cascade, maintained high ACP activity, and strongly upregulated HvRNASET2, HmAIF-1, SOD and GST, signaling stability, and tissue-remodeling inflammation. By contrast, HFPO-DA and PFMoBa induced a granulocyte influx but failed to promote macrophage recruitment or neovascularization; HvRNASET2 transcripts rose, whereas HmAIF-1 expression, ACP activity, and CD31 signal remained at the baseline. These outcomes suggest that while all PFAS trigger the same innate-immune program, only PFOA and PFMOPrA sustained its full development. Taken together, these observations suggest that multiple structural and bioactivity determinants, potentially including but not limited to the chain length, shape the sustained response at the chronic level in leeches. This supports the need for multitemporal, policy-relevant PFAS hazard assessment."

Although the majority of published literature indicates that sulfidation can significantly mitigate the toxicity of Ag NPs, it remains unknown how the degree of sulfidation influences nano-bio interactions of Ag NPs in mammalian cells. To elucidate the potential role of sulfidation in the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs, we first synthesized and characterized Ag NPs with varying degrees of sulfidation. Unexpectedly, while high-degree sulfidation resulted in a reduction of the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs, mild sulfidation intensified their toxicity. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidative dissolution of low-degree sulfidized Ag NPs enhanced the release of Ag+, promoted the generation of reactive oxygen radicals, and aggravated lipid peroxidation within cells, thereby activating ferroptosis through inhibiting the expression of ferritin and glutathione peroxidase 4."

Both near‐surface and main pycnocline stratification are found to exhibit spatially structured, vertically coherent, global‐scale variations on seasonal‐to‐decadal time scales, suggesting that stratification at both levels are rapidly‐evolving and responsive components of the climate system. Variability in stratification is organized into well‐defined patterns that replicate the spatial footprints and time scales of major climate modes, pointing to these modes of variability as important drivers of stratification changes. Our diagnosed patterns and forcings of stratification variability provide a benchmark for advancing the climate models used to understand and predict the ongoing climate change."

Accurately assessing these hazards requires modeling frameworks capable of capturing both the individual and combined effects of multiple flood drivers, as well as the diversity of flood scenarios that can arise from their interactions. In this study, we implemented a physics‐based, high‐resolution modeling approach to assess flood hazards in Philadelphia, PA, a coastal city exemplifying multi‐driver flood risks over multiple decades (1985–2019), by simulating a wide range of flood events at a 10‐m resolution. By integrating watershed, coastal, and urban flood models, we explicitly resolved the interaction between fluvial, pluvial, and coastal processes across the city. From these simulations, we identified flood hazard hotspots and systematically attributed the primary drivers of flooding for each event. The results suggested that 44% of Philadelphia's flood events were compound floods, primarily driven by fluvial‐surge and fluvial‐pluvial combinations. Notably, 77% of these events involved fluvial flooding, either as a single flood driver or in combination with other drivers, underscoring the dominant role of riverine processes in the city's flood hazard. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of a comprehensive, process‐based approach for urban flood hazard assessment and highlights the importance of considering the full spectrum of flood scenarios to inform targeted and adaptive flood management strategies in coastal cities."

Dessler,The True Cost of Heat: Evaluating Heat‐Related Mortality Estimation Methods in Texas,"Different ways of counting heat‐related deaths (HRD) can give you very different numbers. This study examines HRD in Texas using three different definitions: The Optimal Temperature Method (OTM) estimates mortality based on deviations from a community's optimal temperature, capturing the effects of both moderate and extreme heat exposure. This method finds that 2.2% of summertime Texas mortality were heat related over the period 2010–2023. The Extreme Heat Method (XHM) counts deaths associated with extreme temperatures; we find that temperatures exceeding the 95th percentile were responsible for 0.5% of summertime Texas mortality over this same period. This means that moderate heat is responsible for 77% of HRD, with extreme temperatures responsible for the rest. The Excess Death Method (EDM) approach quantifies the mortality burden as the increase in mortality compared to what would have occurred with the climate of a baseline period; we find that summertime Texas mortality over this period was 1.7% higher than with the climate of the mid‐20th century. When comparing these estimates to official HRD values from the State of Texas, which are based on an official determination that heat contributed to the death, we find that official State HRD numbers appear to substantially underreport HRD, attributing just 0.3% of summertime deaths to heat, with the XHM method being the closest."

An additional 2,000 soil samples were tested by our team's field staff. The combined results were mapped and compared with total soil Pb concentrations measured by X‐ray fluorescence (XRF). The degree of soil contamination varied across sites and within each site. Quality control was provided by reanalyzing a subset of 120 soil samples from the three sites in the laboratory. Overall, total Pb concentrations were highest in Cerro de Pasco with 64% and 30% of samples in the 201–2,000 and 2,001–20,000 mg/kg range, respectively. Total Pb concentrations were somewhat lower in La Oroya with 88% of samples in the 201–2,000 mg/kg range and even lower in Callao with 79% below 200 mg/kg. However, extractable Pb proportions followed an inverse pattern, with the sum of the proportions of medium and high visual readings increasing from 46% to 57% and 69% in Cerro de Pasco, La Oroya, and Callao, respectively.

 Identifying a catalyst class to optimize the enantioselectivity of a new reaction, either involving a different combination of known substrate types or an entirely unfamiliar class of compounds, is a formidable challenge. Statistical models trained on a reported set of reactions can help predict out-of-sample transformations1–5 but often face two challenges: (1) only sparse data are available i.e., limited information on catalyst–substrate interactions, and (2) simple stereoelectronic parameters may fail to describe mechanistically complex transformations.6,7 Here we report a descriptor generation strategy that accounts for changes in the enantiodetermining step with catalyst or substrate identity, allowing us to model reactions involving distinct ligand and substrate types. As validating case studies, we collected data on enantioselective nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)-couplings8 and trained statistical models with features extracted from the transition states and intermediates proposed to be involved in asymmetric induction. These models allow for the optimization of poorly performing examples reported in a substrate scope and are applicable to unseen ligands and reaction partners. This approach offers the opportunity to streamline catalyst and reaction development, quantitatively transferring knowledge learned on sparse data to novel chemical spaces."

 Aluminium comprises over 8% of Earth’s crust and is the most abundant metallic constituent1. Historically, aluminium catalysis has predominantly exploited the inherent Lewis acidity associated with its stable +III oxidation state2. Owing to its uniquely low electronegativity (1.61)—the lowest among p-block elements—and the absence of an inert-pair effect, aluminium presents formidable intrinsic challenges for engaging in catalytic redox transformations. Here we report the redox catalytic capability of a low-valent aluminium species, carbazolylaluminylene3, which carries out a complete Al(I)/Al(III) catalytic cycle encompassing oxidative addition, double insertion, intramolecular isomerization and reductive elimination—fundamental mechanistic steps conventionally exclusive to transition-metal catalysis. Leveraging this Al(I)/Al(III) redox cycle, we achieve highly efficient and regioselective Reppe cyclotrimerization of alkynes4,5, producing diverse benzene derivatives with a turnover number of up to 2,290. Through X-ray crystallographic and quantum chemical analyses, we elucidate how the dynamic nitrogen geometry within the carbazolyl ligand framework precisely modulates the aluminium coordination environment, thereby facilitating the catalytic cycle. This work fundamentally advances the conceptual understanding of main-group redox catalysis. It further sets a compelling precedent for future catalyst design and sustainable synthetic methodologies centred on aluminium redox transformations.

 Orthosteric inhibitors block enzyme active sites and prevent substrates from binding1. Enhancing their specificity through substrate dependence seems inherently unlikely, as their mechanism hinges on direct competition rather than selective recognition. Here we show that a molecular glue mechanism unexpectedly imparts substrate-dependent potency to CSN5i-3, an orthosteric inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome (CSN). We first confirm that CSN5i-3 inhibits CSN, which catalyses NEDD8 (N8) deconjugation from the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, by occupying the active site of its catalytic subunit, CSN5, and directly competing with the iso-peptide bond substrate. Notably, the orthosteric inhibitor binds free CSN with only micromolar affinity, yet achieves nanomolar potency in blocking its deneddylase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the enzyme–substrate–inhibitor complex reveal that active site-engaged CSN5i-3 occludes the substrate iso-peptide linkage while simultaneously extending an N8-binding exosite of CSN5, acting as a molecular glue to cement the N8–CSN5 interaction. The cooperativity of this trimolecular CSN5i-3–N8–CSN5 assembly, in turn, sequesters CSN5i-3 at its binding site, conferring high potency to the orthosteric inhibitor despite its low affinity for the free enzyme. Together, our findings highlight the modest affinity requirements of molecule glues for individual target proteins and establish orthosteric molecular glue inhibitors as a new class of substrate-dependent enzyme antagonists. An orthosteric CSN inhibitor gains nanomolar potency via a molecular-glue mechanism, stabilizing a CSN5–N8–inhibitor complex that confers substrate-dependent inhibition despite weak free-enzyme affinity."

 Mpox, caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV; Orthopoxvirus monkeypox), is on the rise in West and Central Africa1–3. African rodents, especially squirrels, are suspected to be involved in MPXV emergence, but no evidence of a direct transmission to humans or non-human primates has been established4–9. Here we describe an outbreak of MPXV in a group of wild sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) in Taï National Park (Côte d’Ivoire). The outbreak affected one-third of the group, killing four infants. To track its origin, we analysed rodents and wildlife carcasses from the region. We identified a MPXV-infected fire-footed rope squirrel (Funisciurus pyrropus), found dead 3 km from the mangabey territory 12 weeks before the outbreak. MPXV genomes from the squirrel and the mangabey were nearly identical. A video record from 2014 showed a mangabey from this group eating the same squirrel species and diet metabarcoding of faecal samples collected from mangabeys before the outbreak identified two samples containing fire-footed rope squirrel DNA. One of these samples was also the first positive for MPXV. This represents a rare case of direct detection of interspecies transmission. Our findings indicate that rope squirrels were the source of the MPXV outbreak in mangabeys. Because squirrels and non-human primates are hunted, traded and consumed by humans in West and Central Africa10,11, exposure to these animals probably represents risk for zoonotic transmission of MPXV.

 Metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have demonstrated excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE), easy colour tunability and low-cost processability, making them promising next-generation display techniques1–3. However, PeLEDs still underperform compared with organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with an EQE of about 40% because of insufficient charge confinement and defect-caused non-radiative recombination on the film surface. Here we report a spontaneously formed 3D/2D vertically oriented perovskite heterojunction by means of a simple one-step spin-coating method, which could effectively confine the charge carriers and shift the radiation zone away from the defect-rich surface region. Notably, the 2D perovskite on top exhibits a wrinkled surface morphology, which offers up to 45.4% light extraction efficiency. The resulting PeLEDs achieved an EQE of 42.9% for the green emission (certified 42.3%). Our work sheds light on the strategies for fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs in the future.

Although recent structural studies have provided insights into endogenous receptors from select brain regions3, most previous work has relied on recombinant receptors and engineered constructs, which limits our understanding of native NMDARs across the whole brain. Here we identify and resolve ten distinct native NMDAR assemblies from the whole-brain tissue of female C57BL/6 mice using immunoaffinity purification, single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Analyses of the GluN1–GluN2A(S1), GluN1–GluN2A(S2), GluN1–GluN2A(S3), GluN1–GluN2B, GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluN2B(S2), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S1), GluN1–GluN2A–GluNX(S2), GluN1–GluN2B–GluNX and GluN1–GluNX structures reveal that GluN2A is the most prevalent subunit across assemblies. Moreover, the substantial conformational flexibility observed in the GluN2A amino-terminal domain may explain its fast kinetics and dominant role in gating. Dynamic movements of S-ketamine were also captured at the channel vestibule, as was pore dilation in both the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of a native GluN1–GluN2B receptor. The latter observation represents a previously unknown fully open state of NMDAR. Our large collection of heterogeneous NMDAR structures from whole brain reveals previously unrecognized properties of conformational diversity and channel dilation. Analyses of heterogeneous assemblies of native NMDA receptors from whole-brain tissue of mice reveal new characteristics of conformational diversity and channel opening."

 Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky adducts from genomic DNA and prevents the ultraviolet light-sensitivity disease xeroderma pigmentosum, cancer and premature ageing1. After initial lesion recognition by XPC in global genome repair or by stalled RNA polymerases in transcription-coupled repair, a lesion and surrounding DNA duplex are unwound by TFIIH, which includes the ATPases XPB and XPD, and additional NER factors XPA, XPF, XPG and RPA, to form a DNA bubble2 comprising around 27 nucleotides. The double strand–single strand (ds-ss) junction-specific endonucleases XPF and XPG cleave DNA on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion, respectively. Here we report the functional steps and atomic structures of the ATPase-driven and lesion-dependent DNA bubble formation and arrangement of the complete NER factors for dual incision. The unwinding of nearly 30 base pairs of DNA depends mainly on the double strand DNA translocase XPB and the duplex dividers XPA and XPF. XPD binds the lesion strand with XPF at the 5′ ds-ss junction. XPF cuts the lesion strand only after XPG binds the 3′ ds-ss junction. The ERCC1 subunit of XPF facilitates DNA strand separation and recruitment of RPA to the non-lesion strand. These findings provide insights on the causes of human diseases and potential targets for enhancing chemotherapeutic efficacy. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of nucleotide excision repair complexes reveal the roles of the constituent proteins XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG and RPA in DNA bubble formation and excision of the lesion strand."

 Caribbean reefs have experienced major human-driven changes to their coral and fish communities1–4, yet how these changes have affected trophic dynamics remains poorly understood owing to challenges in reconstructing the trophic structure of pre-human-impact reefs. Advances in fossil-bound protein nitrogen isotope (15N/14N) analysis now enable the reconstruction of ancient trophic dynamics5,6, as the 15N to 14N ratio reflects an animal’s trophic position7. Here we apply this method to modern and prehistoric (7,000-year-old) fish otoliths (ear stones) and corals from Caribbean Panama and the Dominican Republic, focusing on fishes occupying low to middle trophic levels. We find that although the trophic level typically declined in high-trophic-level fishes over time, it increased or remained unchanged in low-trophic-level fishes, indicating that modern food chains are 60–70% shorter than on the prehistoric reefs in both Panama and the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, across all trophic groups, we observed a marked reduction in dietary variation, with a 20–70% lower trophic range on the modern reefs compared to the prehistoric reefs. This pattern is best explained by less dietary specialization in modern reefs, consistent with less ecological complexity than in prehistoric reefs. These differences document and quantify the trophic simplification that has occurred on modern Caribbean reefs, a change that may increase their vulnerability to ecosystem collapse. Using nitrogen isotopes from ancient and modern fish otoliths and corals, the study shows Caribbean reef food webs are now 60–70% shorter and functionally less diverse, indicating human-driven trophic simplification and increased risk of collapse."

 Brain systems mediating responses to previously encountered threats provide critical survival functions. Fear memory and extinction are underpinned by neural representations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)1–7, but the contribution of non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, to these processes remains unresolved. Here, using in vivo calcium (Ca2+) imaging and causal astrocyte manipulations, we find that BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear state and support fear memory retrieval and extinction. By combining astrocyte manipulations with in vivo BLA neuronal Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we show that astrocyte Ca2+ signalling enables neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction, and readout through a BLA–prefrontal circuit. Our findings reveal a key role for astrocytes in the generation and adaptation of fear-state-related neural representations, revising neurocentric models of critical amygdala-mediated adaptive functions.

 Spatial orientation enables animals to navigate their environment by rapidly mapping the external world and remembering key locations1. In mammals, the head-direction (HD) system is an essential component of the navigation system of the brain2. Although the tuning of neurons in other areas of this system is unstable—evidenced, for example, by the change in the spatial tuning of hippocampal place cells3 across days4–11—the stability of the neuronal code that underlies the sense of direction remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in the post-subiculum of freely moving mice, we show stability and plasticity at two levels. Although the population structure remained highly conserved across environments and over time, subtle shifts in population coherence encoded environment identity. In addition, the HD system established a distinct, environment-specific alignment between its internal representation and external landmarks, which persisted for weeks, even after a single exposure. These findings suggest that the HD system forms long-lasting orientation memories that are anchored to specific environments.

 Inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 contribute to T cell dysfunction in cancer1–3. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the interactions in trans of these receptors with their ligands on cancer cells or in the tumour microenvironment lead to clinical responses in some but not all types of cancer. Signalling lymphocytic activation molecule 6 (SLAMF6, also known as Ly108) is a homotypic receptor preferentially expressed on progenitor or stem-like exhausted T (Tpex) cells, but not on terminally exhausted T (Tex) cells, as demonstrated in mouse models4–9. In contrast to Tex cells, Tpex cells retain the capacity for functional restoration after immune checkpoint blockade10–12. The role of SLAMF6 in T cells remains ambiguous, as it has both activating and inhibitory effects, complicating its evaluation as a therapeutic target. Here we find that SLAMF6 was triggered in cis by homotypic interactions at the T cell surface. These interactions elicited inhibitory effects that suppressed activation of T cells and limited anti-tumour immunity, independently of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells. mAbs against human SLAMF6 with a robust ability to disrupt the cis interactions strongly augmented T cell activation, reduced the proportions of exhausted T cells and inhibited tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that SLAMF6 functions exclusively as a T cell inhibitory receptor, which is triggered by cis homotypic interactions. They also position SLAMF6 as a promising target for therapies aimed at enhancing anti-tumour immunity, regardless of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells.

 Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating disease caused by impaired lymphatic drainage and is characterized by tissue swelling, fat expansion, inflammation and fibrosis1,2. However, the exact mechanisms that drive lymphoedema are poorly understood. Although lymphatic vessels are known to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the systemic circulation3, the importance of impaired lymphatic drainage for cholesterol clearance in humans and its relevance to lymphoedema remain unknown. Here we show that lymphatic drainage insufficiency in human lymphoedema leads to excessive cholesterol accumulation in the lymphoedematous dermal tissue and around lymphatic vessels. Cholesterol deposition resulted in dermal adipose tissue remodelling, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction, progressing to death and dermal fibrosis. Surgical intervention improved lymphatic drainage and reduced cholesterol deposition. Using two mouse models that reproduce features of human lymphoedema, we demonstrated that tissue swelling and dermal adipose tissue remodelling were ameliorated by the cholesterol-depleting agent cyclodextrin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that cyclodextrin restored lymphatic drainage by promoting the regeneration of lymphatic vessels. This study unravels the role of impaired cholesterol clearance in driving lymphoedema and identifies tissue cholesterol as a promising therapeutic target for this currently incurable disease. Mouse models show that lymphoedema caused by impaired lymphatic drainage is ameliorated by removal of cholesterol deposits, which promotes the regeneration of lymphatic vessels."

 Ancient DNA studies revealed that, in Europe from 6500 to 4000 bce, descendants of western Anatolian farmers mixed with local hunter-gatherers resulting in 70–100% ancestry turnover1, then steppe ancestry spread with the Corded Ware complex 3000–2500 bce2. Here we document an exception in the wetland, riverine and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, using genome-wide data from 112 people 8500–1700 bce. A distinctive population with high (approximately 50%) hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted 3,000 years later than in most European regions, reflecting incorporation of female individuals of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a Y-chromosome characteristic of people associated with the early Corded Ware complex. These distinctive patterns may reflect the specific ecology that they inhabited, which was not amenable to full adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced with Linearbandkeramik3, and resulted in distinct communities where transfer of ideas was accompanied by little gene flow. This changed with the formation of Lower Rhine–Meuse Bell Beaker users by fusion of local people (13–18%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their subsequent expansion then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwestern Europe, especially in Great Britain where they were the main source of a 90–100% replacement of local Neolithic ancestry. A distinctive population with high hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted 3,000 years later than in most European regions, contributing to later Lower Rhine–Meuse Bell Beaker users."

 Goal-directed navigation requires animals to continuously evaluate their current direction and speed of travel relative to landmarks to discern whether they are approaching or deviating from their goal. Striatal dopamine release signals the reward-predictive value of cues1,2, probably contributing to motivation3,4, but it is unclear how dopamine incorporates an animal’s ongoing trajectory for effective behavioural guidance. Here we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories. Trajectory error signals could be computed from locomotion or visual flow, and were independent from simultaneous dopamine increases reflecting learned cue value. Joint trajectory error and cue-value encoding were reproduced by the reward prediction error term in a standard reinforcement learning algorithm with mixed sensorimotor inputs. However, these two signals had distinct state space requirements, suggesting that they could arise from a common reinforcement learning algorithm with distinct neural inputs. Striatum-wide multifibre array measurements resolved overlapping, yet temporally and anatomically separable, representations of trajectory error and cue value, indicating how functionally distinct dopamine signals for motivation and guidance are multiplexed across striatal regions to facilitate goal-directed behaviour. Cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors, spatially and temporally separated from value coding, reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories."

 Volumetric additive manufacturing has emerged as a promising technique for the flexible production of complex structures, with diverse applications in engineering, photonics and biology1,2. However, present methods still face a trade-off between resolution and volumetric build rate, restricting efficient and flexible production of high-resolution 3D structures. Here we propose a method, called digital incoherent synthesis of holographic light fields (DISH), to generate high-resolution 3D light distributions through continuous multi-angle projections with a high-speed rotating periscope without the requirement of sample rotation. The iterative optimization of the holograms for different angles in DISH maintains 19-μm printing resolution across the 1-cm range that is far beyond the depth of field of the objective and enables high-resolution in situ 3D printing of millimetre-scale objects within only 0.6 s. Acrylate materials in a range of viscosities are used to demonstrate the general compatibility of DISH. Integrating DISH with a fluid channel, we achieved mass production of complex and diverse 3D structures within low-viscosity materials, demonstrating its potential for broad applications in diverse fields.

 Polyatomic molecules provide complex internal structures that are ideal for applications in quantum information science1, quantum simulation2–4 and precision searches for physics beyond the standard model5–9. A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue diverse quantum science applications7. Linear triatomic molecules contain ℓ-type parity-doublet states in the vibrational bending mode, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. Here we report optically trapped CaOH molecules prepared in ℓ-type parity-doublet states and realize a bare qubit coherence time of 
              $${T}_{2}^{* }=0.8(2)\,{\rm{s}}$$
              
            , which is longer than the 0.36 s lifetime of the bending mode10,11. We suppress differential Stark shifts by cancelling ambient electric fields using molecular spectroscopy and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time.

 Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation—either even or odd—defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit1. Notably, this parity can only be accessed by a measurement that couples two Majoranas to each other. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain1, implemented in quantum dots coupled using superconductors2. Even the minimal two-site chain hosts a pair of Majorana modes, often called ‘poor man’s Majoranas’, which are spatially separated but offer limited protection compared with longer chains3–5. Here we introduce a measurement technique that reads out their parity through quantum capacitance. Our method couples two Majoranas and resolves their parity in real time, visible as random telegraph switching with lifetimes exceeding a millisecond. Simultaneous charge sensing confirms that the two parity states are charge neutral and remain indistinguishable to a probe that does not couple the modes. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.

 Sleep is viewed typically through a brain-centric lens, with little known about the role of the periphery1,2. Here we identify a sleep function for peripheral macrophage-like cells (haemocytes) in the Drosophila circulation, showing that haemocytes track to the brain during sleep and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia due to wake-associated oxidative damage. Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in haemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater—a member of the Nimrod receptor family—reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts haemocyte localization to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1α and DRP1. Dysregulation of mitochondria, reflected in high oxidation and reduced NAD+, is accompanied by impaired memory and lifespan. Thus, peripheral blood cells, which we suggest are precursors of mammalian microglia, perform a daily function of sleep to maintain brain function and fitness.

 Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light–matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits1, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius rp, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of rp from recent measurements2–7 of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen8,9. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S–6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of rp and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result ν2S–6P = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of rp = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.

 Quantum key distribution (QKD) makes use of the principles of quantum mechanics to enable provably secure communication1,2. One substantial challenge persists in building large-scale QKD networks with many clients over long communication distances3. Although quantum relays continue to pose practical difficulties4, existing trusted-node networks5–9, point-to-multipoint networks10,11 and wavelength-multiplexed entanglement networks12,13 encounter issues such as reliance on trusted intermediaries or limited distances. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) provides a compelling architecture that can overcome those issues while enhancing communication distance14. Although long-distance point-to-point TF-QKD has been achieved15–21, realizing large-scale networks requires scalable quantum devices. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of an integrated-photonics TF-QKD network with exceptional scalability and reliability. This network includes 20 independent client-side QKD transmitter chips with one server-side optical microcomb chip. The microcomb generates a broad range of ultralow-noise coherent frequency combs with Hz-level linewidths, which serve as seeds and references for all client chips. Each client chip regenerates ultralow-noise light phase-locked to microcombs and prepares quantum keys. We sequentially implement pairwise QKD across 20 client chips through ten wavelength-multiplexed channels, with each surpassing the repeaterless bound at 370 km in spooled fibre, achieving a networking capability (client pairs × communication distance) of 3,700 km. We further demonstrate the wafer-scale reproducibility of both server-side microcomb chips and client-side QKD transmitter chips, together establishing system-level scalability. Combining mass-manufacturability, cost-effectiveness and high scalability of integrated photonics with long-distance quantum communication represents a viable path to large-scale quantum networks. A lab-scale proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum network comprising one server chip and 20 client photonic chips implementing twin-field quantum key distribution shows excellent scalability and reliability and yields a pathway towards future large-scale networks."

 Interactions between genes or cis-regulatory elements (CREs) underlie many biological processes. High-throughput CRISPR screens have allowed researchers to assess the impact of activation or repression of gene and regulatory elements on many phenotypes. However, assessment of interactions between those genes or elements remains limited. To enable efficient highly-multiplexed control of regulatory element activity, we combine a hyper-efficient version of Lachnospiraceae bacterium dCas12a (dHyperLbCas12a) with RNA Polymerase II expression of long CRISPR RNA (crRNA) arrays. We demonstrate this system with several activation and repression domains, in cultured primary immune cells, and to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells. We also develop approaches to use dCas12a for simultaneous activation and repression. Lastly, we demonstrate that dHyperLbCas12a effectors can be used to dissect the independent and combinatorial contributions of CREs to gene expression. These tools create possibilities for highly multiplexed control of gene expression in many biological systems. CRISPR/Cas9 screens have identified genetic contributions to many phenotypes.

The material exhibits enhanced structural stability, improved energy release, and low sensitivity, offering insights for designing high-performance energetic materials. 
 The formation of stable amorphous phases in rigid organic small molecules is fundamentally hindered by their pronounced crystallization tendency. This challenge is particularly acute in energetic materials, in which the amorphous phase must be stabilized without inert additives to preserve high energy density. Here, we overcome this longstanding obstacle by realising a stable amorphous energetic material based on the small molecule explosive (4,4′,5,5′-tetranitro-1H,1′H-2,2′-biimidazole-1,1′-diamine, DATNBI). The amorphous DATNBI (AEM-DATNBI) prepared via a melt quenching process, exhibits a glass transition temperature of 59.67 °C and demonstrates remarkable structural stability below this threshold, maintaining its integrity for over 24 hours at 60 °C. This stability originates from a synergistic interaction between the non-planar molecular framework and a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network formed by -NH₂/-NO₂ groups. This unique amorphous structure not only enhances safety by suppressing hotspot formation but also accelerates energy release, leading to faster combustion and more complete decomposition. This study demonstrates a general strategy leveraging steric hindrance and intermolecular interactions, thereby extending the realm of amorphous materials to energetic compounds and other functional rigid organic small molecules. This work develops a strategy to construct a stable amorphous energetic material with self-healing capability via entropy-mediated solidification. The material exhibits enhanced structural stability, improved energy release, and low sensitivity, offering insights for designing high-performance energetic materials."

 Early childhood represents a critical window of rapid brain growth and heightened vulnerability, yet the impacts of heat on development remain unclear. Here, using data from the Chinese National Cohort of Motor Development, comprising 101,228 children aged 3–5.5 years from 551 cities, we examined early-life exposure to ambient temperature. Within the observed range of 0–25 °C, we found that both prenatal and postnatal heat exposure were associated with increased risk of suspected neurodevelopmental delay. The exposure–response relationship followed a J-shaped pattern, with risk rising steeply at higher temperatures. Compared with the temperature of lowest risk, extreme heat (95th percentile) was linked to 35% higher risk during pregnancy and 53% higher risk from birth to age 3 years. Suspected neurodevelopmental delay risk increased across all examined heatwave definitions postnatally. These findings underscore the vulnerability of the developing brain to heat exposure and highlight the global relevance of temperature-related neurodevelopmental risks under climate change.

 Deep-focus earthquakes (> 300 km depth) are widely distributed in global subduction zones, but their mechanism is still debated because the fine structure of deep subducting slabs is unclear. Here we use a modified double-difference tomography method to investigate 3-D P and S wave velocity (VP, VS) structures of the subducting Pacific slab beneath central Japan. A three-layered anomalous belt is revealed in the deep slab: the portion at 330-380 km depths shows low VP, low VS and high VP/VS ratio, whereas the up-dip (<330 km depth) and down-dip (>380 km depth) portions exhibit low VP/VS ratios. From top to bottom, these layers correspond to three distinct olivine states: (meta)stable α-olivine, unstable/transforming olivine, and stabilized β-olivine (wadsleyite). The high-VP/Vs zone may indicate water in and around the metastable olivine wedge, suggesting that deep-focus earthquakes could be triggered by metastable olivine phase transition, promoted by deep dehydration.

 Contemporary glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate, an irreversible trend closely associated with ongoing global warming. Approximately 290 million years ago, Earth experienced a comparable large-scale glacial retreat, marking a pivotal transition of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) toward a greenhouse condition. This profound climatic shift, termed the Artinskian Warming Event (AWE), has been extensively attributed to volcanic degassing. Nevertheless, how continental weathering shaped climate dynamics throughout this period remains enigmatic. To address this issue, we integrated multiple geochemical proxies indicative of the carbon cycle, volcanism, and weathering, and applied the Celine Model to constrain silicate weathering fluxes. Based on the coupled variations between mercury enrichment and estimated weathering flux during the Artinskian, we propose that the AWE was not only driven by volcanic degassing but also amplified by an abrupt drop in low-latitude mafic weathering flux, rendering this interval the most intense deglaciation phase of the LPIA.

 Between 10 and 6 ka, one of the most devastating ecological events for marine life was occurring as the well-ventilated, oxygen-rich glacial eastern Mediterranean deep waters had turned into a dead zone and organic matter accumulated in thick sediment layers, called sapropels. Numerous hypotheses on sapropel formation have been put forward, but a thorough evaluation of the potential drivers is yet missing. Our numerical modelling study, from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene, captures the onset and termination of sapropel formation S1. The predominant driver is the surface water buoyancy gain due to sea-level rise and surface warming during the deglaciation, which reduces ventilation and consequently causes a substantial oxygen decline at depth. During the African Humid Period, enhanced nutrient supply and continued low microbial activity in cold waters, where remineralisation occurs at greater depths, result in anoxia and S1 forms. Despite prevailing poor ventilation of the deep sea and continued high nutrient supply, S1 terminates at 7 ka due to higher microbial activity in a warming ocean, which curtails the flux of organic matter to depths. The primary causes of sapropel formation in the eastern Mediterranean are surface water buoyancy gain during deglaciation and enhanced nutrient supply, which lead to oxygen declines at depth, according to analyses of transient deglacial simulations."

Current mainstream models of these driving mechanisms are mostly based on machine learning integrated with the SHAP method, but often neglect spatial dependencies between samples—especially the implicit spatial relationships underlying port city economic activities. In recent years, AIS data has become an important tool for uncovering these implicit spatial relationships. Therefore, we propose the PortCity2Vec framework, based on AIS data and embedding representation learning, to explicitly capture implicit spatial relationships among port cities. Furthermore, we develop a spatial XGBoost model integrated with GeoShapley to incorporate these implicit spatial relationships, thereby revealing the driving mechanisms behind socioeconomic indicators and quantifying the core roles of spatial relationships and geographic features in the port economy. The results show that: (1) Implicit economic interactions among port cities extend beyond physical adjacency, indicating that port economy is influenced not only by physical proximity but also by connections within an implicit spatial structure; (2) Introducing socioeconomic indicators and geographic features of nearby port cities within the implicit spatial structure improves model accuracy, increasing R2 from 0.6554 to 0.8541; (3) The port economy correlates positively with cargo turnover and grain crop output, but negatively with forestry and meat output. These findings highlight the key roles of economic and transport intensity and reveal resource allocation gaps. (4) Embeddings of implicit spatial relationships and geographic features effectively capture regional potential economic connections and marginal contributions that traditional models struggle to identify, thereby enhancing both the performance and interpretability of the model."

Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs have crucial functions in the brain, such as regulating neuronal transmission and synaptic plasticity. However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which circular RNAs function remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated howcircHomer1, a brain-enriched circular RNA derived from theHomer1gene, affects hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Our results demonstrate thatcircHomer1plays a vital role in mediating the dendritic targeting of messenger RNAs that encode postsynaptic proteins by acting as a molecular bridge between the motor protein Kinesin 1 and core components of neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules, including Fused in Sarcoma and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, at dendrites. This interaction influences synaptic function, the structural morphology of dendritic spines, and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. Thus, our study highlights a role of circular RNAs in mediating synaptic messenger RNA targeting to shape dendritic spines and consequently neuronal functions."

In this study, we present “YORU” (your optimal recognition utility), a behavior detection approach leveraging an object detection deep learning algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches, YORU directly identifies behaviors as “behavior objects” based on the animal’s shape, enabling robust and accurate detection. YORU successfully classified several types of social behaviors in species ranging from vertebrates to insects. Furthermore, YORU enables real-time behavior analysis and closed-loop feedback. In addition, we achieved real-time delivery of photostimulation feedback to specific individuals during social behaviors, even when multiple individuals are close together. This system overcomes the challenges posed by conventional pose estimation methods and presents an alternative approach for behavioral analysis."

Hainan gibbons (Nomascus hainanus) feature a mysterious rebound, from ~13 individuals in 2003 to 42 currently. Using reliable genomic data from the fecal samples of 18 gibbons, generated through a systematically established pipeline, and from four museum specimens, our analyses reveal that Hainan gibbons have the smallest effective population size and low genetic diversity but, unexpectedly, low inbreeding and genetic load among threatened primates assessed thus far. This results from a millennial expansion mitigating bottleneck effects and a high local recombination maintaining selection efficiency. Notably, we uncover two cryptic lineages, whose recent crosses led to new family groups with increased heterozygosity. Our study reveals the importance of demographic history, genome architecture, and behavioral regulation in the recovery of endangered species and highlights the great potential of fecal genomic research in conservation biology."

The current dogma is that vertebrates develop cone-dominated retinas first, adding rods later. Here we show that larval deep-sea fishes have “hybrid” photoreceptors, expressing cone-specific genes in rod-like cells. Through development, they either retain these rod-like cones (inMaurolicus mucronatus) or transition to true rods expressing rod-specific genes and transcription factors (inVinciguerria mabahissandBenthosema pterotum). Unlike most marine fish larvae, which inhabit brightly lit waters, deep-sea fish larvae experience deeper and dimmer environments. By combining rod-like morphology with cone-like molecular machinery, hybrid photoreceptors likely maximize visual performance under such conditions. Consistently, spectral maxima predictions and environmental light estimations suggest tuning to the prevailing light environment throughout life. Our findings provide molecular, morphological, and functional evidence for the evolution of an alternative developmental trajectory for vertebrate vision."

In the Himalaya, recurrence intervals are usually modeled as cyclic or quasiperiodic, whereas globally, they range from periodic and clustered to random. Statistical analyses of a 6000-year lake-sediment seismic record, calibrated against regional instrumental data, worldwide paleoseismic records, and synthetic seismic catalogs, demonstrate that time intervals between large earthquakes (M≥ 6.5, based on shaking intensity thresholds calibrated locally) robustly follow a Poisson distribution. Second-order fluctuations indicate event clustering. These observations contradict periodic or quasiperiodic recurrence models. Comparisons with paleoseismic data from other tectonic settings and realistic synthetic catalogs confirm the robustness and broad applicability of these findings. Thus, major earthquakes appear as stochastic as smaller ones, challenging recurrence models derived from limited datasets and substantially increasing seismic hazard estimates."

Counterfactual analyses reveal that mitigating multiple threats is essential to achieving nonnegative vertebrate population trends and halting biodiversity loss."

Matrix-bound nanovesicles (MBV) are a recently identified type of EV embedded within the extracellular matrix with potent local and systemic immunomodulatory effects on myeloid cells. These effects are durable and last beyond the predicted life span of differentiated myeloid cells such as macrophages. The present study investigated MBV-directed epigenetic modification in myeloid precursors as a potential explanation for their prolonged immunomodulatory effects. Flow cytometry and ATAC sequencing studies show that MBV are internalized by myeloid cell progenitors in the bone marrow and in macrophages after terminal differentiation. This internalization is coincident with epigenetic changes that are associated with modulation of macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, MBV treatment differentially alters chromatin accessibility as a function of cell differentiation state (i.e., myeloid progenitor versus macrophage). The present study shows the epigenetic effects of MBV on myeloid cells, representing a potential avenue to exploit the therapeutic potential of biologic scaffold materials."

Although chemical gradients are known to drive diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, these nonequilibrium forces have largely been ignored in porous media flows. Under typical subsurface conditions, flow velocities within preferential pathways exceed phoretic velocities by orders of magnitude, suggesting that diffusiophoresis would be limited to stagnant pockets. Here, using microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that even moderate solute gradients, typical of natural mixing, can markedly alter colloid transport. We uncover a previously overlooked effect: cross-streamline phoretic migration within preferential flow pathways, which changes macroscopic dispersion by orders of magnitude and suppresses the impact of geometric disorder on transport. Our findings challenge classical models of colloid transport, highlighting the broad implications of solute gradients for technological, biomedical, and environmental applications."

Here, we develop a biomimetic magnetoelectric nanoparticle (DC@CFO/BFO) by coating core-shell CoFe2O4@BiFeO3particles with dendritic cell membranes to enable selective targeting of CD4+T cells. Under magnetic field stimulation, DC@CFO/BFO localizes to ribosomes and enhances protein synthesis by modulating electrostatic interactions at the ribosomal exit tunnel. This ribosome-targeted modulation promotes type II immune response via IL-4 induction and TAF9B-dependent transcriptional programming, thereby enhancing T helper 2 (TH2) cell proliferation. In murine models of colitis and arthritis, both systemic administration of DC@CFO/BFO and adoptive transfer of magnetoelectricity-responsive TH2 cells attenuated inflammation and restored immune homeostasis. In contrast, these effects were abrogated inTaf9b-deficient T cells, underscoring the essential role of TAF9B in mediating this response.

However, the mechanisms underlying this neurotoxic process remain unclear. Using PD patient-derived and CRISPR-engineered induced pluripotent stem cell midbrain dopaminergic neurons lacking DJ-1, we identified defective sequestration of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, which culminated in DA oxidation and α-synuclein pathology. In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology. Furthermore, VMAT2 activity and vesicle endocytosis are processes dependent on adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), which is notably reduced in DJ-1–deficient dopaminergic neurons. ATP supplementation restored vesicular function and alleviated DA-related pathologies in mutant dopaminergic neurons. This study reveals an ATP-sensitive mechanism that regulates DA homeostasis through VMAT2 and vesicle dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, highlighting enhanced DA sequestration as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD."

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway and has long been viewed as a cytoplasmic enzyme. Here, we reveal that PAL responds to elevated flavonoid levels inArabidopsisby undergoing phosphorylation and relocating to the nucleus. Nuclear sequestration of PAL reduces its cytoplasmic abundance and enzymatic activity, resulting in rapid suppression of phenylpropanoid metabolic flux. In parallel, nuclear-localized PAL interacts with the transcription factor TT8, disrupting MBW complex formation and down-regulating flavonoid biosynthetic genes. This dual mechanism enables PAL to act as a metabolic feedback regulator that dynamically adjusts flavonoid production in response to internal metabolic states. Our findings redefine PAL as both a biosynthetic enzyme and a responsive integrator of cellular metabolic status, establishing a previously unknown paradigm for feedback control in plant specialized metabolism."

However, recent studies suggest that the “older” indirect corticospinal pathways, mediated by spinal premotor interneurons (PreM-INs), also contribute, highlighting the need to clarify their functional differences. Here, we recorded neuronal activity from PreM-INs and CM cells in macaques during a precision grip task to compare their roles in generating hand muscle activity. Our results show that PreM-INs exert stronger facilitation across a broader set of muscles, promoting synergistic coactivation, whereas CM cells provide more selective facilitation, enabling control of relatively individual muscles. Decomposition analysis further revealed that these systems correspond to different control modes—synergy-based and individual-based control—balancing stability and flexibility.

As a full characterization is prohibitively resource intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independently distributed (IID) quantum states and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of multiple copies of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ (Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger) states, reporting statistically sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. In addition, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identically distributed (but still assumes independent copies); can achieve closeN−1scaling, in the number of states measuredN; and can be implemented in a device-independent manner. Together, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations."

Monoamine neurotransmitters released in target brain regions conjointly regulate adaptive learning and plasticity. However, our understanding of these multianalyte mechanisms remains nascent, in part due to limitations in measurement technology. Here, during associative conditioning in honey bees, we concurrently tracked subsecond fluctuations in octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin in the antennal lobe, where plasticity influences odorant representations. By repeatedly pairing an odorant with subsequent sucrose delivery, we observed individual differences in the conditioned response to odor, which occurred after a variable number of pairings (learners) or not at all (non-learners). The distinction between learners and non-learners was reflected in neurotransmitter responses across experimental conditions. The speed of learning, the number of pairings prior to a proboscis extension reflex, could be predicted from monoamine opponent signaling (octopamine-tyramine), from both the first presentation of the odorant alone, prior to any pairing with sucrose, and the first conditioned response to the odorant, coming after a number of sucrose pairings. These results suggest that monoamine signaling phenotypes may relate directly to the now widely reported socially relevant genetic differences in honey bee learning."

However, their practical implementation is impeded by the low operating rate threshold (<1 milliampere per square centimeter) and poor cycling stability, owing to dendritic sodium (Na) growth. Here, a high-rate and durable AFSB is successfully realized via a spatially anion-confined electrolyte strategy. Specifically, positively charged nanoparticles are introduced into the electrolyte to selectively anchor anions, generating localized contact ion pair–dominated solvation to facilitate rapid Na+desolvation at electrode interface and form an anion-derived solid electrolyte interphase. Meanwhile, rapid ion transport in the bulk electrolyte is maintained by the solvent-separated ion pair solvation structure in the nanoparticle periphery. These factors conjointly enable flat and dense Na deposition at high current densities. Consequently, an energy-type Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||Al full cell exhibits an energy density of 415.6 watt-hour per kilogramcathode+anodeeven at 1 C (2.1 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.2% capacity retention over 400 cycles.

The neuronal membrane–associated periodic skeleton (MPS), an actin spectrin–based cytoskeletal lattice, is known to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in axons, but its broader role in other neuronal compartments and endocytic pathways remains unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways—CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and fast endophilin–mediated endocytosis—are spatially gated by the MPS and occur exclusively within MPS-free “clearing” zones throughout all neuronal compartments. Disrupting the MPS broadly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis. We also identify a previously unknown feedback loop in which ligand-triggered endocytosis activates extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling, promoting protease-mediated spectrin cleavage and MPS disruption, which in turn facilitates further endocytosis. Furthermore, the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein endocytosis, thereby suppressing Aβ42 production and linking MPS integrity to neurodegeneration. Our findings establish the MPS as a dynamic, signal-responsive modulator coupling membrane trafficking with cortical cytoskeletal organization and neuronal health."

Owing to the chiral anomaly present in a finite-size sample, the gapless surface Dirac cone, neighbored by facets with surface Dirac masses of opposite signs, is further converted, exhibiting 2D planar one-way propagation. In conjunction with 1D hinge states, we experimentally observe a closed chiral loop for nonreciprocal hinge–surface transport across dimensions in topological photonics, similar to that theoretically proposed in 3D quantum anomalous Hall materials. Our findings enrich the chiral boundary features of 3D magnetic topological insulators and offer a topological strategy for exploring ideal cross-dimensional devices."

We resolve this challenge by demonstrating robust room-temperature ferroelectricity in epitaxial metastable κ-Ga2O3, grown via industry-compatible metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, creating an intrinsically ferroelectric wide-bandgap semiconductor. Through systematic characterization including piezoresponse force microscopy, polarization hysteresis measurements, and positive up–negative down tests, we provide conclusive evidence of stable ferroelectric switching down to 5-nanometer thickness—exceeding conventional ferroelectric limits—via a unique octahedral-tetrahedral transformation.

This study reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship between TOPPs and ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2)–mediated ethylene signaling. We identified that ethylene can induceTOPPs’ expression, andtopp1/4/5mutants exhibited partial ethylene insensitivity with reduced EIN3 protein. Mechanistically, TOPPs function upstream of EIN2 and interact with its carboxyl-terminal domain (CEND) to dephosphorylate the S655 residue. This site-specific dephosphorylation promotes EIN2 stability and EIN2 CEND nuclear accumulation, thereby activating ethylene responses. Notably,EIN2S655A-YFP/ein2-5plants displayed constitutive ethylene responses and improved salt tolerance. Further investigation showed that EIN3/EIN3 like 1 (EIL1) activatesTOPPs’ expression by binding to their promoters, amplifying ethylene signaling accordingly. Together, our finding establishes TOPPs as key regulators in ethylene signaling and reveal a dephosphorylation switch mechanism governing EIN2 function, providing critical insight into how EIN2 posttranslational modifications mediate plant stress adaptation."

Here, we present a strategy for generating tunable three-dimensional optohydrodynamic torques through phase gradient–driven nanoparticle assemblies. Using programmable optical ring vortices (Laguerre-Gaussian beams), we assemble and rotate colloidal clusters with certain particle numbers, whose induced hydrodynamic flows apply switchable in-plane and out-of-plane torques on target particles. Torque control is achieved via two mechanisms: (i) reversing the handedness of circular polarization to break rotational symmetry and (ii) displacing optical ring vortices and modulating cluster rotation speed. These complementary controls provide robust, high-resolution torques tuned in arbitrary directions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate full three-dimensional orientation control of a single cell. This framework greatly expands the capabilities of optohydrodynamic systems by explicitly incorporating light-driven interparticle interactions and establishes a foundation for advanced applications in biophysics, microrobotics, and biomedical engineering."

Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of opioid receptors (ORs) offer a promising approach to enhance opioid efficacy while reducing risks of overdose. In this study, we unveil the selective mechanism of PAM modulation of the OR family through structure elucidation of the δ-opioid receptor and μ-opioid receptor (μOR) bound to orthosteric agonists and PAMs BMS986187 (BMS187) and BMS986122 (BMS122). In addition, we uncovered an unexpected but conserved allosteric site across the transmembrane helices TM2 to TM4 of ORs, occupied by BMS187 but not BMS122. Leveraging these structural insights, we designed 9-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl)-3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-3,4,5,6,7,9-hexahydro-1H-xanthene-1,8(2H)-dione (MPAM-15), whose αβ cooperativity factor is 33-fold higher than BMS122 and threefold higher than BMS187, indicating markedly stronger positive allosterism. Animal studies demonstrate that MPAM-15 shows excellent brain penetration and enhances morphine-induced antinociception without exacerbating respiratory depression or constipation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that MPAM-15 promotes and stabilizes the conformational equilibrium of μOR toward the canonical active state, providing a mechanistic basis for its enhanced allosteric potency. These discoveries substantially advance our understanding of OR allosteric mechanism and pave the way for the structure-based development of allosteric opioid analgesics."

Most inhibitors bind conserved active sites, frequently lacking specificity. Targeting allosteric sites can increase specificity, reduce toxicity, and allow fine-tuning of activity; however, most allosteric sites in enzymes are unmapped. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental allosteric map of the Src protein kinase. We quantify the effects of more than 50,000 single and double amino acid substitutions on activity and abundance and use thermodynamic modeling to disentangle changes in fold stability and catalysis. The comprehensive energy landscape reveals that allostery across the kinase domain is extensive, directionally biased, and modulated by its regulatory domains. Inhibitory—but not activating—allosteric mutations show a strong distance-dependent decay away from the active site. Using the map, we identify multiple potentially druggable allosteric sites not previously reported in Src or other kinases. Our results establish a framework for comprehensive mapping of allostery in kinases and other enzymes important for medicine and biotechnology."

By encoding input data in the spatial polarization distribution of a tailored optical cavity and allowing light to pass through it multiple times, we achieve nonlinear transformations at extremely low optical power. Coupled with a simple trainable readout, our optical learner consistently outperforms linear digital networks in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, delivering accuracy matching fully nonlinear digital models.

Here, we use a high-resolution, bottom–up assessment framework to analyze drought impacts on yields of four major crops—maize, soybean, rice, and wheat—at county, provincial, and national levels over 1997–2021. Results show yield losses escalate dramatically with spatial granularity, from 3.3% at the national level to 10.8% at the county level, with soybeans (16.3%) and maize (11.4%) being the most vulnerable. Despite an increase in drought frequency, drought-induced crop losses declined significantly, owing to the improvements in irrigation. Notably, a 10% increase in agricultural water use was significantly associated with a 1.71% reduction in yield losses. Our findings not only highlight the critical importance of scale-dependent risk assessments but also provide robust evidence and spatial pattern for the significant role of irrigation in mitigating drought risks."

The new net phosphorus gain/loss maps allow us to assess sources, drivers, and model fidelity, thereby supporting future research and management of phosphorus contamination. 
 Excess riverine phosphorus represents a preeminent catalyst for water quality degradation. Spatial mapping and characterization of the net gain and loss of riverine phosphorus help discern the critical source areas. Here, we developed a dataset encompassing phosphate (PO43-) and total phosphorus (TP) gain and loss across catchments in the conterminous United States (CONUS). We compiled 51,394 PO43- and 285,675 TP concentration data points and estimated PO43- and TP loads at 963 and 2,317 stations, respectively. Next, we leveraged the upstream-downstream topology information from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) catchment map at the Hydrologic Unit Catalogue-12 (HUC12) level to derive the net gain and loss of riverine phosphorus across catchments in the CONUS. Such maps can be used to estimate potential contributions of point and non-point sources to riverine phosphorus pollution at refined spatial scales, identify different major factors controlling local riverine P gain and loss compared to P loads, and evaluate watershed model’s fidelity for representing riverine P cycling.

It is designed to flexibly include new glacier data as it becomes available. We tested the method with idealized experiments and found promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency, showing strong potential for real-world applications. 
 The growing availability of glacier observations poses a challenge for models to integrate this heterogeneous information in a dynamically consistent way. At the same time, estimates of current glacier volume and area remain uncertain, as many global inventories and thickness datasets date back to the early 2000s. We present the Open Global Glacier Data Assimilation Framework, named AGILE, a time-dependent variational method inspired by 4D-Var data assimilation. AGILE is built on a reimplementation of the OGGM flowline glacier evolution model in PyTorch, enabling full differentiability through automatic differentiation (AD). We test AGILE v0.1 in a series of idealized experiments designed to reflect common initialization and calibration scenarios in global glacier modeling. The goal is to recover glacier bed topography and distributed ice volume in 2020 through transient calibration, based on dynamical simulations starting in 1980. In these experiments, we assume a perfectly known mass balance and fixed ice dynamics parameters. While this setup simplifies real-world complexity, it allows us to isolate and evaluate the core functionality of the approach. Our results show that AGILE efficiently optimizes multiple control variables by leveraging AD-derived gradients, requiring only a few iterations to substantially improve upon initial guesses. We also examine the potential to reconstruct earlier glacier states (e.g., in 1980) without direct observations and find that this is fundamentally limited because glacier dynamics are governed by a diffusion equation, which leads to a loss of information about past states over time, even in an idealized setting. Overall, our experiments demonstrate AGILE’s potential as a flexible and efficient data assimilation framework. Its ability to integrate diverse datasets in a dynamically consistent manner makes it a promising tool for future real-world glacier modeling applications."

The model reveals strong regional differences and large annual swings in economic impacts, offers insights for climate policy discussions, and provides a strong foundation for future model development. 
 Global warming poses substantial risks to natural and human systems worldwide. Understanding the complex interactions between climate change and the economy is essential for designing effective policies and mitigation strategies. Yet, existing modeling tools are often limited by coarse spatial aggregation, simplified climate representation, or lack of interaction between climate and the economy. To address these gaps, we develop a novel framework that couples an Earth System Model (ESM) – the Norwegian Earth System Model version 2 (NorESM2) – with a spatially disaggregated Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), the Disaggregated Integrated Assessment Model (DIAM). The resulting modeling tool, NorESM2–DIAM, incorporates state-of-the-art climate and weather dynamics, allows economic impacts to depend on the full distribution of weather outcomes, and captures realistic spatial heterogeneity. To our knowledge, it is the first framework to fully couple an ESM with a high-resolution cost-benefit IAM. The primary contribution of this paper is to develop and implement the methodology that enables this coupling. We demonstrate the utility of NorESM2–DIAM through a baseline simulation. The results show that the economic impacts of global warming vary dramatically across space and that internal climate variability generates substantial volatility in regional GDP, highlighting the importance of high-resolution economic impact assessments. Although the baseline simulation focuses on regional temperature, the framework can be easily extended to incorporate additional variables such as precipitation and extreme events. It can also be applied to study a wide range of climate policies. NorESM2–DIAM represents an important step towards improving the understanding of economic impacts of climate change and can ultimately become an important source of information for decision-makers."

Quorum sensing (QS) represents the microbial communication mechanism that coordinates population-level behaviors. It has emerged as a novel strategy to enhance microbial performance. Currently, most studies investigate the positive performances of exogenous quorum-sensing molecules (QSMs) in lab-scale batch bioreactors. However, full-scale engineering lacks sufficient operational guidance. This Perspective proposes a translational framework to bridge the gap between laboratory insights and practical application. The following four points are of great concern: standardized QSM quantification, targeted regulatory design, operational optimization, and ecological risk assessment. First, this Perspective elucidates the dose–response relationship between QSM concentrations and activation thresholds, subsequently proposing targeted intervention strategies. Then, high-efficiency regulation requires the development of cost-efficient QSM analogues and microbial consortia with productive QSM secretion capabilities. Next, operational strategies must counter the short half-life of the QSM through pulsed dosing or attenuation suppression. Finally, ecological assessments should evaluate pathogenicity risks, ecosystem disruption potential, and the probability of gene transfer. Advancing QS-based regulatory strategies demands integrated efforts across microbiology, chemical engineering, and environmental risk science to ensure safe and effective deployment in wastewater biotreatment."

However, mechanisms underlying F-53B-induced ASD-like pathology and oligodendrocyte dysfunction remain unclear. In this study, we exposed Sprague–Dawley rats to F-53B (0, 8, 80, 800 μg/kg/d from preconception through postweaning) and compared adverse outcomes to a valproic acid-induced ASD model. We found that F-53B crossed the blood-brain barrier, deposited in offspring brain, and induced ASD-like neurobehaviors, including social deficits, stereotypic behaviors, memory impairments, and reduced novelty preference. Neuropathologically, F-53B triggered hippocampal and callosal hypomyelination, delayed oligodendrocyte maturation, and disrupted neuronal mitochondrial cristae. Interestingly, plasma oligodendrocytes-derived exosomes (ODEXs) from F-53B-exposed offspring failed to restore neuronal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro. Proteomic profiling of ODEXs identified suppression of ATP synthesis-related proteins, notably chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (an ASD-characterized biomarker) and ATP citrate lyase. Molecular docking suggested F-53B could bind to their amino acid residues. Downregulation of these proteins in the hippocampus and corpus callosum aligned with behavioral and myelination abnormalities in rat offsprings. Our study establishes ODEX-mediated ATP synthesis disruption as central to F-53B-induced ASD-like pathology, urging reevaluation of perfluorooctanesulfonate alternatives for neurotoxicity."

We find that hilltop curvature and hillslope length vary with paleotemperature, not modern climate or uplift. Despite gentler slopes, erosion rates near the Last Glacial Maximum ice margin are similar or higher than southern sites for resistant bedrock units, suggesting frost cracking and solifluction enhanced hilltop lowering and valley infilling. Hillslope morphometry patterns resemble landscapes responding to modern Arctic climate gradients, implying a long‐lived geomorphic signature of permafrost‐driven processes. This cold‐climate legacy can remain imprinted in modern mid‐latitude terrain, complicating efforts to link current climate with landscape form where erosion rates are slow."

Frequency–wavenumber analysis, beamforming, and local back‐projection consistently locate sources along a fixed, wave‐breaking coastal segment, while particle‐motion ellipticity confirms the Rayleigh character. Calibrating distributed acoustic sensing strain to ground velocity and combining nearshore wave energetics yields an energy‐conversion efficiency on the order of 10−6.

Voigtländer;B. Gee,Why Firn Quakes,"Snow dampens sounds, but anecdotal reports concisely describe audible propagating collapse events—firnquakes—in Antarctic and Arctic snowfields. We propose combining granular and continuum mechanics to form a testable theory for conditioning, triggering, and propagation of firnquakes consistent with scarce data. A central condition for collapse events is unconsolidated firn at depth. As firn grains compact, stresses are transmitted along force chains which carry the overburden and transition into a continuous medium by pressure sintering. This granular legacy creates solid‐like supports of denser layers that keep the material below unconsolidated. Dynamic amplification triggers local brittle failure of the supports, which induces a cascade of collapse propagation. Using bulk density from ice cores as proxy for stiffness, we find the flexural wave speed by collapsing supports matches the recorded firnquake velocities on the order of 100 m/s. Our theory is to be tested in firn sheets and other compacting granular materials."

Using machine learning techniques, we detected and precisely located 46,252 aftershocks, revealing several fault planes corresponding to active faults ruptured during the mainshock. Two subparallel landward‐dipping planar structures were identified near the mainshock hypocenter, converging westward to the Wajima‐Oki segment. This geometry suggests that complex rupture episodes near the hypocenter resulted from successive ruptures on adjacent fault planes rather than slip on a single plane. At the western edge of the 2024 rupture area, aftershocks extend close to but rarely occur on the fault that ruptured during the 2007 Mw 6.7 earthquake, suggesting that the 2024 earthquake did not re‐rupture the same faults of the 2007 earthquake."

It operates without sorting or downcycling for circular, low-emission aluminium recovery. 
 The global transition to a circular economy hinges on the development of sustainable recycling processes for end-of-life vehicles. Ongoing electrification and material choices over the recent decades hinder their integration in existing recycling pathways. This results in a large surplus of low-grade aluminium scraps and forfeits substantial energy, emissions, and cost savings, making the need for novel recycling approaches an urgent problem. This study presents a process for directly upcycling mixed end-of-life vehicles scrap into a high-performance aluminium alloy under realistic industrial conditions. It is compatible with existing infrastructure and dispenses the need for sorting, dilution or downcycling. By leveraging metallurgical principles and accelerated precipitation, the produced alloys achieve yield strengths that even surpass the commercial automotive alloy spectrum. This approach establishes a circular, low-emissions route to high-value aluminium recovery and offers a strategic model for transforming today´s and future´s critical raw material streams into next-generation structural alloys.

Precise phase and composition control enable high power factor and output performance, highlighting its potential for flexible electronics. 
 Flexible thermoelectric materials hold great promise for sustainable energy supply in flexible electronics. However, beyond the long-standing champion Bi2Te3-based flexible films, high-performance alternatives remain scarce. Here, we report a promising flexible thermoelectric material based on eco-friendly MgAgSb, a bulk-proven high-performance system whose development in flexible form has long been hindered by its intrinsic brittleness and phase complexity. Using molecular beam deposition, we manage to precisely stabilize MgAgSb within its α-phase range and finely control its stoichiometry. As a result, we successfully fabricate the α-MgAgSb film with exceptional performance, achieving a room temperature zT of 0.8 and a peak power factor of 19.3 μW cm-1 K-2, ranking among the promising flexible thermoelectric materials developed. Moreover, the α-MgAgSb film is revealed to exhibit notable flexibility and stability under repeated bending and heating. Leveraging this high-performance stable α-MgAgSb film, the flexible thermoelectric device delivers a maximum normalized power density of 4.9 μW cm-2 K-2. This work opens a pathway for flexible MgAgSb applications and offers strong potential for realizing self-powered flexible technologies.

Fitting a dynamical systems model to fMRI data, Song and colleagues show that the geometry of neural dynamics along the attractor landscape reflects changes in attention. 
 Large-scale brain activity reflects changes in attention. To understand how, we tested a hypothesis that the geometry of neural dynamics on the cortical attractor landscape, or movement along its “hills and valleys”, reflects attentional states. A dynamical systems model separating intrinsic dynamics from stimulus-driven influences was fit to fMRI data collected during rest, tasks, and movie-watching. Model simulations revealed a set of attractors aligned with canonical functional brain networks. The speed and direction of neural trajectories toward these attractors varied systematically with attentional states over time and across contexts. When participants were paying attention to effortful tasks, neural dynamics converged fast and directly toward a task-relevant attractor. In contrast, when participants were engaged in sitcom episodes, neural dynamics occupied a flatter region of the landscape, directed away from attractors. These findings demonstrate that while attractor locations are largely determined by cortical organization, the geometry of neural dynamics changes systematically across attentional states and contexts. Attention fluctuates over time and across contexts—how is this reflected in the brain? Fitting a dynamical systems model to fMRI data, Song and colleagues show that the geometry of neural dynamics along the attractor landscape reflects changes in attention."

Lactate influx via MCT1 triggers histone lactylation in fibroblasts to activate profibrotic genes. 
 Hypertrophic scar (HS) is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by fibroblast hyperactivation and aberrant extracellular matrix deposition. This study identifies macrophage-derived lactate as a key mediator of fibroblast phenotypic remodeling via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated histone H3 lysine 23 lactylation (H3K23la) in HS. Elevated lactate levels and MCT1 expression were observed in HS tissues, with macrophages in stiff mechanical microenvironments identified as the primary lactate source. Lactate influx through MCT1 upregulated H3K23la, thereby promoting transcriptional activation of profibrotic genes HEY2 and COL11A1. Mechanistically, HEY2 activated YAP1/SMAD2 signaling, while COL11A1 stabilized MCT1 to enhance lactate transport, forming a positive loop that amplified fibrosis. Fibroblast-specific Mct1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Mct1 in male mice reduced collagen deposition, accelerated wound healing, and attenuated scar formation. Our findings redefine the macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk in HS and establish the MCT1-H3K23la-HEY2/COL11A1 axis, particularly its self-reinforcing loop, as a novel therapeutic target.

 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) continuously circulates through the brain and surrounding tissues to remove metabolic waste, a process that becomes less efficient with ageing and in neurodegenerative disease. Visualizing this drainage in living animals has been difficult because existing imaging tools either lack depth, require radioactive tracers, or are too slow to capture dynamic flow. Here, we show that whole-body photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) enables three-dimensional, real-time tracking of CSF transport in mice using indocyanine green. We visualize CSF movement from the spinal canal into the brain, quantify its efflux under different anesthesia conditions, and detect impaired clearance in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Compared with healthy animals, diseased mice retain the tracer in the brain for several days, indicating reduced waste removal. These results establish PACT as a non-invasive platform for measuring CSF and glymphatic function in vivo, providing a way to study how brain fluid transport is altered in ageing and neurological disorders. This study develops photoacoustic computed tomography, which enables real-time, whole-body 3D imaging of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways in mice and captures anesthesia-dependent CSF flow changes and impaired CSF clearance in an Alzheimer’s disease model."

 Many oceanic and some continental transform faults host coupled tectonic shear and magmatism, complicating seismic and volcanic hazards. Here we integrate high-resolution seismic tomography and three-dimensional finite-element modelling to investigate fault–magma interactions along the eastern North Anatolian Fault Zone. Tomography reveals two shallow magma reservoirs beneath the Erzincan Basin and the Karlıova Triple Junction, characterised by high Vp/Vs (>1.85). The western reservoir is largely aseismic while the eastern reservoir has persistent seismicity. Time-dependent models demonstrate that right-lateral shear focuses tensile stresses around both reservoirs that encourage reservoir rupture and dyke injection. This stress concentration occurs even when the initial magma-generated excess pressure is zero, and may gradually expand towards the surface. Upward stress transfer is enhanced within the fractured damage zone, facilitating dyke propagation. The results may apply to many transform faults and are of great importance for evaluating the coupled earthquake–volcano hazards in such fault zones. The interplay between tectonic transform loading and evolving magma reservoirs in the eastern North Anatolian Fault Zone is potentially responsible for generating volcanic and seismic hazards, according to geophysical analysis and finite-element modelling."

 Over 100 countries have announced net-zero emissions goals. Although these net-zero emissions goals may be consistent with global 2 °C climate stabilization, their impacts on equity between developing and developed regions remain poorly understood. Here, we used an integrated assessment model and developed scenarios based on the National Determined Contributions and Net Zero Emissions targets, aiming to achieve the 2 °C goals, along with a baseline scenario that followed the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 baseline projections. Moreover, we show the extent to which individual national net-zero emissions goals are far from equitable and explored potential measures. The results indicate that net-zero emissions without financial support causes large macroeconomic losses in developing countries. The financial transfer of approximately 2.7 trillion US dollars per year to developing regions equivalent to 5% of household consumption in developed regions is sufficient to alleviate such economic burdens. If developed countries should undertake additional physical emissions reductions, the required carbon dioxide removal will scale to 26 Gigatons of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to over 10% of household consumption. This result suggests that rather than pursuing additional net-negative emissions in developed countries, international financial transfer could be a more pragmatic approach to attain the global net-zero emissions goal. Current national net-zero pledges risk large economic losses in developing regions, and international financial transfers of about 2.7 trillion US dollars per year could effectively offset these impacts, according to a computable general equilibrium model and scenario analysis."

In this study, we found that early damage in zebrafish and rodent demyelination models is characterized by myelin swelling. We show, through live imaging, that myelin swelling does not always lead to myelin loss and that swellings can sometimes resolve, allowing sheaths to remodel. Increased neuronal activity during early demyelination exacerbates myelin damage, whereas reducing neuronal activity mitigates myelin swelling in both zebrafish and mice. In human multiple sclerosis tissue, myelin swelling is also dynamic and is prominent around active lesions. Our data indicate that myelin swelling is a conserved feature of demyelination and that damage to myelin sheaths can resolve, opening opportunities for targeting human disease."

Mice with global or DC-specific deletion of Etv3 manifested the expansion of CD25lowregulatory T (Treg) cells, spontaneous activation of conventional T cells, and multiorgan T cell infiltration. Etv3 deficiency exacerbated TLR7-driven systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)–like disease, supporting the reported genetic association of humanETV3with SLE. Etv3-deficient migDCs up-regulated multiple costimulatory molecules, including OX40 ligand (OX40L/TNFSF4), whose blockade partially rescued the Tregcell abnormalities.

We evaluate the effectiveness of this large-scale conservation action by assessing fish communities across mainstem habitats before and after the ban (2018 to 2023). The seven-decadal biodiversity loss was halted with improvements in fish biomass, body condition, species diversity, and initial recovery of threatened species. Eliminating fishing pressure was likely key to this recovery, in addition to actions targeting water quality improvement, hydrological and riparian habitat restoration, and vessel traffic reduction.

Simulation and inoculation experiments suggest that significant resistance gains are possible through selectively breeding trees with an average of 70 to 85% American chestnut ancestry. The resources developed in this work are foundational for breeding to create diverse restoration populations with sufficient disease resistance and competitive growth."

Vance,Poxvirus attack of antiviral defense pathways unleashes an effector-triggered NF-κB response,"Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a form of pathogen sensing that involves detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors or “effectors.” To discover ETI pathways in mammals, we developed a screening approach in which we expressed individual virulence factors in a human monocyte cell line and assessed transcriptional responses by RNA sequencing. We identified a poxvirus effector, myxoma virus M3.1, which elicited an antiviral nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) response. NF-κB was unleashed by an ETI pathway that sensed M3.1 attack of two antiviral complexes: zinc finger antiviral protein and TBK1. NF-κΒ activation occurred because the proteins inhibited by M3.1—N4BP1, ZC3H12A, and TBK1—are negative regulators of NF-κB. Our study established a systematic approach for the discovery of ETI pathways, and the results illustrated how negative regulators of immune responses may function in pathogen sensing."

Christopher Garcia,Structural ontogeny of protein-protein interactions,"Understanding how protein binding sites evolve interactions with other proteins could hold clues to targeting “undruggable” surfaces. We used synthetic coevolution to engineer new interactions between naïve surfaces, simulating the de novo formation of protein complexes. We isolated seven distinct structural families of protein Z-domain complexes and found that synthetic complexes explore multiple shallow energy wells through ratchet-like docking modes, whereas complexes formed by natural binding sites converged in a deep energy well with a relatively fixed geometry. Epistasis analysis of a machine learning–estimated fitness landscape revealed “seed” contacts between binding partners that anchored the earliest stages of encounter complex formation. Our results suggest that “silent” surfaces have a shallower energy landscape than natural binding sites, disfavoring tight binding, likely owing to evolutionary counterselection."

Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism.Slc25a45-deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss. Our study suggests that mitochondria serve as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching, with implications for metabolic adaptation and the efficacy of GLP-1RA–based anti-obesity therapy."

How cytoplasmically generated mRNA fragments affect nuclear transcription remains poorly understood. Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we uncover ILF3 as an RNA binding protein connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay and transcription during TA and show that it is required for a range of TA substrates. ILF3 is enriched at adapting genes’ RNAs, and its artificial recruitment through dCas13 promotes gene expression. Using tiling oligonucleotide screens, we identify trigger RNA fragments that activate adapting genes when introduced into cells. Further functional dissection reveals a critical role for homology between trigger and target sequences. These findings enhance our molecular understanding of TA and inform the design of programmable oligonucleotides for gene expression augmentation."

Here we report the experimental realization of single-crystalline θ-phase tantalum nitride (θ-TaN), a metastable transition metal nitride predicted to overcome this limitation. We measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of ~1100 watts per meter-kelvin, nearly three times that of copper. Synchrotron-based inelastic x-ray scattering revealed a distinctive phonon band structure with a large acoustic-optical gap and phonon bunching, which suppress phonon-phonon scattering. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirmed exceptionally weak electron-phonon coupling and validated first-principles calculations. These findings redefine the thermal transport limits of metallic materials and open new opportunities for advancing thermal management in electronics and power systems."

These appressoria develop semipermeable cell walls and accumulate osmolytes internally to create turgor by osmosis. Although melanin is known to be important for turgor generation, the mechanism underlying wall semipermeability remains unclear. By using reverse genetics, we identified that the enzymes PKS2 and PBG13 are required for forming the semipermeable barrier in fungi causing anthracnose and rice blast diseases. These enzymes synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid polymers that are essential for pathogenicity. These polymers reduce cell wall permeability and generate turgor, independently of melanization. Our findings uncover a mechanism of fungal turgor generation, linking enzyme function to pathogen penetration and disease potential, presenting new targets for disease control."

InArabidopsis, the polyamine thermospermine (tSpm) affects xylem cell fate. tSpm induces translation of SUPPRESSOR-OF-ACAULIS51 (SAC51) and SAC51-LIKEs (SACLs), which inhibit heterodimerization of the xylem development proteins LONESOME-HIGHWAY (LHW) and TARGET-OF-MONOPTEROS5. Here, we report a methyltransferase, OVERACHIEVER, that methylates the peptidyl transferase center of the 25Sribosomal RNA (rRNA). Residue m3U2952 promotes functional tSpm binding to a specific site connecting the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA) with rRNA residues in the peptidyl transferase center. This interaction enhances the translation of SACLs but inhibits that of LHW. Our study uncovers the dependency between a conserved rRNA base methylation and a polyamine in orchestrating cell fate decisions, highlighting a role for the ribosome chemical landscape in translational regulation."

Mammalian whiskers are elongated keratin rods attached to tactile skin structures that extend the animal’s sensory volume. We investigated the whiskers that cover Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) trunks and found that they are geometrically and mechanically tailored to facilitate tactile perception by encoding contact location in the amplitude and frequency of the vibrotactile signal felt at the whisker base. Elephant whiskers emerge from armored trunk skin and shift from a thick, circular, porous, stiff base to a thin, ovular, dense, soft tip. These functional gradients of geometry, porosity, and stiffness independently tune the neuromechanics of elephant trunk touch to facilitate highly dexterous manipulation while ensuring whisker durability."

However, NH3productivity is often limited by sluggish Li-ion desolvation and diffusion at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we present a concerted desolvation:diffusion layered SEI architecture that provides abundant Li-ion flux for efficient N2conversion toward NH3production at high current densities. The SEI comprises stacked inorganic layers with low ion-binding affinity and high ion-conductivity functionalities that increase Li-ion flux by two orders of magnitude. This design strategy achieved N2electroreduction in a 2 M lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate electrolyte with a Faradaic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 21% for NH3production at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter (mA cm−2). The system sustained an 80% Faradaic efficiency over 40 hours, after which performance declined."

Despite its great potential, biochar production and scale use remain strikingly limited in Brazil. Here, we explored the multifaceted potential of biochar in Brazil, focusing on its capacity to promote circularity, create novel inputs for agricultural and environmental purposes, and optimize infrastructure for the production and cycling of organic residues from diverse agricultural and energy production chains. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders, and a workshop was organized with participants representing universities, public research institutes, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. We analyzed the current Brazilian scenario, identifying the main barriers preventing the widespread use of biochar in the country, as well as possible solutions in the economic, political, technological, research and development, and innovation sectors. Based on this assessment, our results show that stakeholders view the Brazilian biochar sector as emerging but constrained by regulatory uncertainty, market fragmentation, and logistical bottlenecks. They identified five priority levers for change: the creation of clear and credible regulatory frameworks, region-specific strategies for biomass use and on-farm deployment, integration of biochar into robust carbon market mechanisms, strengthening of targeted research and demonstration projects, and development of business models that combine agricultural benefits, carbon removal, and co-products."

However, few account for the storage, fate, and transport of sediment properties, such as lithology or geochemistry. We present new Landlab model components that track such properties. Our unit-agnostic approach allows users to define the sediment properties for a wide range of applications (for example, mass of magnetite, volume of quartz, number of zircons, number of 10Be atoms, equivalent dose of luminescence). 
 We present a set of new Landlab numerical model components that allow users to track sediment properties across a landscape grid. The components use a mass-balance approach to partition the mass concentration of each property based on sediment fluxes calculated by various Landlab flux components. The methods are generic, allowing the user to assign any sediment property that can be expressed as a mass, volume, or number concentration (for example, mass of magnetite, volume of quartz, number of zircons, number of radiogenic 10Be atoms, “equivalent dose” of luminescence). Several properties can be tracked at once, each with concentration tracked in both sediment and bedrock at every location on the grid. Two ConcentrationTracker components have been formulated; one for distributed, space- and time-varying hillslope regolith movement and another for transport in fluvial networks, allowing for interaction between sediment in the water column and on the channel bed. These components can be used individually to study a single process or coupled to study the interactions of multiple processes acting on a dynamic landscape. We present two examples that illustrate the diverse uses of the ConcentrationTracker components: colour banding in hillslope regolith and provenance tracking of fluvial sediments."

Here, we combine a 13 year field trial with graded straw biochar applications (0–22.5 t ha–1 season–1) and a 60 day anaerobic incubation of year-13 soils to investigate how mineral and microbial processes regulate soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (P), and methane (CH4) dynamics. Long-term biochar progressively depleted Fe oxides and enriched Ca phases, promoting the formation of Ca-bridged OC-mineral-P complexes that costabilize OC and P. Under prolonged anoxia, soils amended with high rates of biochar exhibited 2.5–3.2-fold slower Fe(III) reduction and delayed sulfate reduction, resulting in 53–80% lower CH4 emissions and 60–71% P release relative to the no-biochar control. Nanoscale imaging and microbial profiling corroborated this mineral transition, showing a shift toward redox-resilient organo-mineral complexes and microbial communities associated with suppressed methanogenesis and enhanced nutrient retention. These findings provide long-term field-based evidence that biochar can simultaneously sustain crop productivity, enhance C and P retention, and mitigate CH4 emissions in flooded rice agroecosystems. Our findings highlight biochar’s potential as a scalable nature-based strategy for integrating nutrient management with climate mitigation in global rice production."

This paper reported for the first time the impact of hydraulic pressure on hollow fiber (HF) layer-by-layer (LBL) nanofiltration (NF) membranes. The evolution of microdeformation and consequent performance degradation of LBL HF membranes was analyzed by focusing on the Young’s modulus of the substrate. Irreversible radial compaction and circumferential expansion under high pressure in a poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrate were observed in the membrane morphology and performance changes. The lower the substrate Young’s modulus, the more pronounced the deformation at the same operating pressure and the lower the critical pressure at which performance begins to deteriorate. In responding to the deformation of the substrate, we propose a compaction–expansion model where the LBL skin layer imbedded into the substrate pore exhibits a three-stage response: (1) compaction, (2) limited stretching, and (3) significant stretching. Beyond stage (3), when stress was released, the decreased separation performance was irreversible.

Bonk;Emelia Myles-Gonzalez;Nathan Zeinstra;Robert H. Hanner,Beyond Species Richness: A Statistically Rigorous Comparison of eDNA and Conventional Fish Sampling Methods,"The comparative performance of different fish sampling methods remains unclear due to a lack of statistically rigorous comparisons. This issue has been exacerbated in recent years due to environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding becoming increasingly popular. However, limited research has compared multiple conventional methods simultaneously to eDNA metabarcoding. To address this, 12S metabarcoding, COI metabarcoding, electrofishing, hoop netting, seine netting, minnow trapping, and gill netting samples were taken at 10 sites across four waterbodies from July eighth to July 13th, 2023. Typically, during sampling method comparisons, diversity or species richness is used as the metric. However, relying solely on these metrics often leads to misinterpretation. In order to rigorously statistically compare the methods, four metrics were used: accuracy, consistency, diversity, and congruency. A novel integrative statistical approach for conducting methodological comparisons was conducted by utilizing the four metrics. By conducting a thorough statistical analysis, a variety of novel insights are highlighted. Specifically, hoop netting was accurate when compared to seine netting and gill netting, COI was accurate when compared to seine netting, seine netting was consistent with COI and hoop netting, eDNA (COI + 12S) found higher levels of species richness, and COI was congruent with four conventional methods. When the specific results are synthesized, three main findings were discovered: (1) COI outperformed 12S on three out of the four metrics, (2) seine netting is largely redundant in the presence of COI, and (3) eDNA captures a more complete picture of biodiversity and is best compared to a combination of conventional methods; however, in order to accomplish this, multiple markers need to be utilized (12S + COI). However, the findings also raise concerns with respect to the validity and accuracy of 12S results, suggest that a combination of methods need to be utilized in the majority of situations, and question the overall reliability of eDNA metabarcoding. Ultimately, we recommend that researchers conduct rigorous statistical analyses, moving beyond superficial comparisons, to develop numerical evidence to support and strengthen their conclusions."

While life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely adopted, methodological inconsistencies across studies have limited the comparability and reliability of results. This study addresses this gap by systematically reducing variability in published LCA estimates, providing a harmonized baseline for the environmental performance of biosolids processing technologies. The study adopted a harmonization approach to align methodological choices across 19 LCA studies covering four biosolid processing systems. Harmonisation significantly reduced variability and clarified comparative environmental outcomes: anaerobic digestion had the lowest mean harmonized global warming potential, while incineration and composting remained the highest-impact systems. Pyrolysis presented the widest postharmonization range, reflecting ongoing uncertainties and technological heterogeneity. A biosolids LCA benchmarking tool was also proposed to enable the development of customized harmonization results based on site-specific conditions. Moreover, a novel approach, partial harmonization, was introduced to serve as a sensitivity analysis that isolates the influence of individual LCA inputs to identify key sources of variation. Among 92 LCA inputs, this method identified inputs such as electricity mix, system boundaries for energy recovery, and fertilizer substitution assumptions as dominant drivers of variability."

Substituting hazardous pesticides with less impactful alternatives comes with challenges related to systematically matching crops, pests, and pesticides, considering regulations, equal efficacy, and combining pesticides to collectively control a wider set of pests across critical crop stages. We propose a quantitative framework to define and assess functionally equivalent scenarios for substituting hazardous pesticides in real-life agricultural applications to reduce human and ecosystem health impacts. Testing our framework on pesticide use in Thailand highlights that particularly hazardous pesticides are applied to certain crops (e.g., tomato, Brassica vegetables) and pests (e.g., tomato leaf miner flies, different thrips species). We found that the number of scenarios combining different pesticides is not an indicator of the variability in scenario impacts: some crop–pest class (e.g., insects) pairs with >10,000 possible scenarios of pesticide combinations vary less in impact performance than some pairs with fewer scenarios. For each crop–pest class pair, we recommend the 10% best-in-class impact performance scenarios for substituting more hazardous scenarios. Our framework can inform policymakers to identify hazardous pesticides for phase out, support ambitions of UNEP’s Global Framework on Chemicals, and aid farmers to reduce their pesticide-related chemical footprint."

Here we introduce a nanoconfinement-assisted EO strategy using TiO2 nanotube (NT) anodes that overcomes these challenges. Compared with TiO2 film and nanoparticle electrodes, the TiO2 NT system achieved 95.6% phenol removal (vs 61.3% and 78.1%), a 3-fold higher degradation rate constant, 71.9% mineralization efficiency (vs 10.8% and 17.9%), and ∼80% lower chlorinated byproduct conversion. Six representative pharmaceutical and personal care products were removed by >90% with concurrent toxicity reduction. Mechanistic investigations combined with density functional theory revealed that spatial confinement enriches pollutants and reactive species at the electrode interface, strengthening direct electron transfer (DET) and indirect direct electron transfer (IDET). More importantly, confinement promoted radical–radical cross-coupling, establishing a synergistic pathway between DET and IDET with the lowest thermodynamic barrier, driving deep mineralization while minimizing chlorination. The nanoconfinement-assisted EO system further demonstrated efficient pollutant removal, toxicity control, and long-term stability in treating biologically treated coking wastewater. These findings highlight nanoconfinement as a powerful design principle for advancing EO toward practical saline wastewater treatment."

To address this gap, we developed a Suspect List-Guided High-Throughput Screening strategy that integrates literature-informed suspect list construction with developmental trend-guided, stage-resolved end points evaluation to identify environmental substances associated with advanced embryonic developmental timing across a broad chemical space. By retrospectively screening over 9,300 toxicity records from public repositories, we curated a suspect list of 46 substances linked to affect developmental timing-related end points. Experimental validation in zebrafish confirmed that 27 compounds (58.7%) significantly affected at least one stage-resolved morphological end point, including epiboly progression, somite formation, and/or yolk sac dynamics. Notable, the sulfonamide antibiotics sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) exhibited pronounced effects at environmentally relevant concentrations (from ng/L to low μg/L). Exploratory transcriptomic analyses further revealed coordinated pathway-level responses related to neuromuscular and cardiovascular development, supporting a shift in overall developmental timing rather than overt toxicity. Furthermore, eight additional sulfonamides produced comparable effects, suggesting a potential class-wide phenomenon. Together, our integrated approach identified a set of environmental substances associated with advanced embryonic developmental timing at environmentally relevant levels and highlighted their potential ecological relevance."

However, the coexisting organics in high-salinity wastewater raise concerns regarding their potential adverse impacts on NF membrane salt separation performance. Herein, we investigated this long-overlooked phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms by focusing on Cl–/SO42– separation in an actual reverse-osmosis concentrate treatment. The results demonstrated that the coexisting organics compromised the Cl–/SO42– separation factor from 100–150 to 20–40. Static adsorption experiments revealed that organic adsorption is governed by electrostatic interactions in low-salinity solutions but dominated by nonelectrostatic interactions due to the enhanced charge-shielding and salting-out effects in high-salinity solutions. Consequently, organic adsorption not solely is limited to positively charged organics but also involves neutral and negatively charged organics, with the adsorption amount increasing with the hydrophobicity of the organic compounds and the membrane. Performance characterization revealed that organic adsorption induced the attenuation of the membrane surface negative charge density and increased the molecular weight cutoff, thereby weakening the steric, Donnan, and dielectric exclusion. This study yields critical insights into strategies for enhancing salt separation performance, optimizing NF process design, and elevating the economic viability of ZLD systems in industrial practice."

In this study, 800-day microcosm experiments were performed with PE samples retrieved from an active landfill site with distinct landfill durations. Results demonstrated that anaerobic microbes slowly degrade PE while enhancing the release of secondary pollutants, such as nanoplastics (NPs) and phthalate esters (PAEs). Microbial colonization increased the surface roughness of PE samples and the abundance of oxygenated functional groups, driving oxidative chain scission, NP release (2.4–4.3 × 1011 particles mL–1 leachate), and PAE biodegradation. Logarithmic curves derived from an improved Polymer Aging Index revealed a midage acceleration window, with PE buried for 7 years being the most susceptible to microbial attack. PE-associated microbial communities were dominated by deterministic assembly processes, with functional taxa being the dominant drivers of PE aging, and PAE degraders exhibiting dual-threshold dynamics. Together, this study identifies a coupled oxidation-biodegradation-fragmentation feedbacks mechanism that governs the fate of PE in landfills, highlighting the dual microbial role in degrading PE and amplifying associated pollutant release."

However, there is a dispute whether the hydrogen peroxide-induced regeneration of Fe(II) is the rate-limiting step in this process. This study systematically investigates the structure–activity relationship between organic substances and iron species in a Fenton-like system, with a focus on the degradation mechanism of phenolic pollutants. By integration of electrochemical characterization and quantum chemical calculation, three kinetic degradation modes are proposed, which are closely related to the molecular redox properties and coordination capability. The three phenolic–Fe(III) interaction modes include: (i) strong reductive electron transfer (zero-order kinetics), (ii) strong coordination forming ligand-stabilized Fe(III) complexes (autocatalysis), and (iii) synergistic electron transfer-coordination (mixed kinetics). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the intramolecular electron transfer pathway within the organo–Fe(III)–hydroperoxide complex exhibits a significantly lower activation energy (0.77 eV less) than traditional radical-mediated pathways, rationalizing the dominance of direct electron transfer over hydroxyl radical generation. This finding provides a unified theoretical framework that resolves long-standing ambiguity in the Fenton-like mechanism and offers new substrate-specific wastewater treatment design guidance."

This study comprehensively investigates the occurrence and dietary exposure of ultrashort-chain PFASs through a China Total Diet Study. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA), and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) were detected in foods, exhibiting distinct differences in their dietary and regional distributions, particularly in plant-origin foods. Among them, TFA was the most prevalent and contributed the most in all food samples, with concentrations ranging from 1.45 to 39.0 ng/g (wet weight). These levels were 2-fold to 3-orders of magnitude higher than those of PFPrA and TFMS and other chain-length PFASs previously found in the same samples. Data on dietary exposure assessment indicated that the estimated dietary intake (EDI) of TFA ranged from 172.7 to 660.3 ng/kg body weight/day, accounting for an average of 96.9% of the total exposure to ∑17 PFASs for the general population. Furthermore, a preliminary assessment suggests that diet played a more significant role than drinking water in human exposure to ultrashort-chain PFASs, with plant-origin foods contributing over 90% of the total dietary exposure. These findings underscore the necessity for monitoring ultrashort-chain PFASs to assess their potential health risks from dietary exposure."

While PFAS exposure has been linked to endocrine diseases, epidemiological evidence regarding its association with dyslipidemia and its subtypes remains limited. This study comprehensively evaluated the associations between serum PFAS levels and dyslipidemia (including its subtypes) in adults, while also investigating the effects on the Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index. We recruited a group of adult participants from Shandong Province, East China, which consisted of individuals with dyslipidemia and healthy controls. Multiple statistical approaches were applied, including multivariable logistic regression for single-PFAS associations, quantile-based g-computation (qg-comp) model for mixture effects, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models for dose–response analyses. Serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) were significantly associated with elevated TyG index levels. Exposure to PFOA and PFNA were associated with hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.09; OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.15–3.50, respectively) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00–1.07; OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01–2.94, respectively). PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were associated with an increased risk of hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23; OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05–1.54, respectively). Furthermore, significant joint effects of PFAS mixture exposure were observed on the risk of dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia, respectively. Dose–response analyses revealed predominantly linear relationships between most PFAS concentrations and dyslipidemia and its subtypes. Exceptions included significant nonlinear relationships for PFOA, PFNA, and PFOS with dyslipidemia; for 6:2 Cl-PFESA with hypercholesterolemia; and for PFOA and PFNA with hypertriglyceridemia. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure to specific PFAS may contribute to endocrine disruption and increase the risk of dyslipidemia in a compound and subtype-specific manner. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence by simultaneously delineating the distinct and joint effects of multiple PFAS on dyslipidemia phenotypes and the TyG index. Our findings underscore the utility of the TyG index as a potential predictive indicator and highlight the importance of considering complex exposure patterns and nonlinear relationships in assessing the cardiometabolic risks of PFAS."

We aimed to understand the experiences and challenges for underrepresented professionals in EO, particularly related to their multiple and intersecting identities, and supportive factors that enable individuals to begin, maintain, and advance their careers despite the challenges. Most notably, citizens of non‐Western countries and immigrants in the West encounter significant disadvantages in EO. Participants from low‐income, working‐class, immigrant families, and first‐generation college students cited economic hardship and disparities in access to resources, quality education, and appropriate technology for developing and advancing their expertise in EO. These and other factors, compounded by stereotyping and bigotry, can lead to denied opportunities and stagnated careers. The culmination of these events makes it difficult, if not impossible, to attain the high‐level positions coveted in the field. Despite the complex barriers underrepresented individuals experience in life and in the field of EO, they persist using a variety of strategies. Fueled by their desire for a more diverse and inclusive field and passion for EO, underrepresented individuals found their main drivers for success in personal resilience, perseverance against hardships, self‐confidence, and lessons from lived experiences.

Recent studies have uncovered potential cold‐to‐warm transitions in specific ice‐shelf cavities, which could lead to a dramatic increase in sea‐level rise. Here we demonstrate that brine rejection in coastal polynyas promotes bistable dynamics in ice‐shelf cavities, which would be otherwise monostable, for a broad diversity of Circumpolar Deep Water temperatures. We develop a generic low‐dimensional box model featuring warm and cold circulation modes and apply it to nine ice‐shelf cavities. We find that most ice‐shelf cavities are in a bistable regime and are therefore susceptible to irreversible abrupt transitions for a realistic range of sea‐ice formation rates. Bistability is robust to changes in cavity parameterization. However, the vertical mixing scheme at the ice‐shelf front can be tuned to make the transitions reversible."

While some theoretical and numerical studies suggest that seismic waves are sensitive to fracture connectivity, an experimental validation of this critically important phenomenon was so far unavailable. In this study, we present a novel methodology for fabricating synthetic analogs of rock samples containing connected and unconnected fluid‐saturated fractures with well‐constrained geometric characteristics. Using a low‐frequency forced‐oscillation apparatus, we show that the P‐wave velocities are higher in samples with unconnected fractures than in those with connected ones. Complementary numerical simulations corroborate these findings and indicate that the dominant mechanism behind the observed differences is wave‐induced fluid pressure diffusion within connected fractures. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that, for otherwise identical fracture networks, the presence of interconnectivity produces a measurable reduction in P‐wave velocity at seismic frequencies, which is consistent with that previously predicted by corresponding numerical models. This, in turn, opens new and important perspectives for the seismo‐hydraulic characterization of fractured rocks."

The disequilibrium concept relates shoreline change to instantaneous and equilibrium beach states. While PF shifts the shoreline geometrically, SLR induces disequilibrium that produces wave‐driven changes due to apparent profile changes. For the first time, 24 experiments from wave flumes of different scale (including new high‐low energy cyclic waves experiments) are gathered into a dimensionless data set through a scaling technique to investigate SLR‐induced processes. The data indicate trends (possibly linear) between relative wave power and wave‐driven shoreline changes for a given SLR, highlighting the effects of changing background wave energy. Cyclic wave experiments best represent Bruun model's behavior. Wave‐energy dissipation emerges as a key variable for quantifying SLR‐induced disequilibrium, offering new pathways for future improvements of equilibrium shoreline models under SLR and wave‐climate change."

Deviations are anticorrelated when knickpoints are present and correlated when they are absent.

Joint calibration of both GPP and ET achieved the highest overall model performance (0.89), outperforming GPP‐only (0.75), ET‐only (0.78), and the default configuration (0.70) on a normalized scale from 0 to 1. Additionally, optimization produced a revised value for the hydraulic trait parameter psi50 that aligns more closely with trait‐based observations. When applied regionally at Ozarks Complex domain, the optimized point‐scale parameters reduced gross primary productivity overestimation by 39% and evapotranspiration underestimation by 10% compared to the default CLM5 configuration. Despite these improvements, challenges in upscaling remain due to uncertainties in input data and reference data sets, as well as the limited temporal and spatial coverage of NEON observations."

The method is based on formulating and integrating dynamical systems whose attractive set, that is, stable fixed points, is constituted of extreme states residing on the convex hull, namely archetypes. It is shown that these states tend to organize into clusters leading to the concept of ’hull clustering’. The method is applied to tropical monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the period 1950–2014 and to the 850‐K northern hemispheric winter potential vorticity over the period 1979–2021. The SST archetype clusters yield broadly five clusters reflecting El‐Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) flavors, representing conventional and Modoki El‐Niño and La‐Niña phases. The application to the stratospheric polar vortex yields broadly three to five clusters representing different states of the winter polar vortex including splitting and displacement over parts of the northern hemisphere.

However, the observed changes in streamflow in these basins and their drivers remain poorly understood. Using in situ and satellite observations, and hydrological modeling, we show contrasting trends, with a ∼8% (p‐value = 0.046) increase in streamflow in the Indus Basin due to rising precipitation. In contrast, a sharp decline of ∼17% (p‐value = 0.008) in the Ganga Basin driven by intensive groundwater pumping during 1980–2021 and despite the overall increase in streamflow in the Indus Basin, two sub‐basins, Ravi and Sutlej, faced a decline in streamflow. Three major sub‐basins of the Ganga River, including Yamuna, Ramganga, and Upper Ganga, also experienced a decline in streamflow. About 60%–80% of the streamflow decline in the Ganga Basin is attributable to intensive groundwater pumping, further amplified by weakening summer monsoon precipitation. Drought‐induced groundwater pumping exacerbates river drying, especially during the dry season (October–May). Our findings highlight the dominant role of coupled climate‐human interactions in driving streamflow changes and emphasize the urgency of integrated surface‐groundwater management to safeguard water and food security in India."

Here, the authors report that ATRX loss can perturb alpha-globin gene expression by promoting G4- and R-loop-associated DNA damage via a G-rich repeat. 
 Germline mutations in the chromatin remodelling protein ATRX cause a severe developmental disorder associated with α-thalassemia. In addition, ATRX is amongst the twenty genes most frequently mutated in cancer. How ATRX mutations alter gene expression remains unclear. Using the α-globin locus as a model, here we show that ATRX deficiency downregulates α-globin in a subset of cells exhibiting DNA damage. A G-rich repeat at the α-globin locus serves as a potential site of G-quadruplex formation and DNA damage. ATRX binds this repeat co-transcriptionally, and its loss increases R-loop accumulation at this site, leading to local DNA damage and transcriptional disruption in cis. Deletion of this repeat abolishes this effect, while targeted DNA damage reinstates it. These findings reveal a mechanism linking ATRX’s role in genome stability to transcriptional regulation and uncover a molecular basis of human genetic disease mediated via a distal G-rich repeat.

 Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) consists of degraded DNA fragments released into body fluids. Its genetic and pathological information makes it useful for prenatal testing and early tumor detection. However, the mechanisms behind cfDNA biology are largely unknown. In this study, for the first time, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic basis of cfDNA end motif frequencies, termed cfGWAS, in 28,016 pregnant women. We identify 15 study-wide significant loci, including the well-known cfDNA-related genes DFFB and DNASE1L3, as well as novel genes potentially involved in cfDNA biology, such as PANX1 and DNASE1L1. The findings are further verified through three independent GWAS studies and experimental validation in knockout mice and cell lines. Subsequent analyses reveal strong causal relationships of leukocytes, especially neutrophils, with cfDNA features. In summary, we introduce the cfGWAS, revealing the genetic basis of cfDNA biology on a genome-wide scale. Novel knowledge uncovered by this study promises to revolutionize liquid biopsy technology and lead to potential new drugs targeting certain diseases. Given that millions of cfDNA whole genome sequencing data have been generated from clinical testing, the potential of this paradigm is enormous.

Subtle alterations in the building units can yield a diversity of topological architectures. Differences in the photothermal conversion properties of 1(OTf)12 − 6(OTf)8 are investigated. Various photothermal conversion efficiencies (23% − 81%) are obtained because of the synergistic effect of π···π stacking interactions and the free radical effect of building units.

 Purine nucleotides are ubiquitous molecules essential for all life.

Analysis of this series of structures and the accompanying biochemical data also reveal the molecular features and transient conformational changes that underlie allosteric regulation and catalytic coupling of the domains.

 Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful tool for spectral imaging of biological samples, thanks to its narrow bandwidth (10 cm⁻¹) compared to fluorescence. Single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy has been demonstrated with near-field amplification as in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy or fluorescence detection as in stimulated Raman excited fluorescence and bond-selective fluorescence-detected infrared-excited spectro-microscopy. However, these methods often require elaborate sample preparation or sometimes generate background signals when unintended processes lead to fluorescence emission. In response to these issues, we developed electronic resonance stimulated Raman scattering (ER-SRS) to achieve single-molecule sensitivity in far-field vibrational microscopy without relying on fluorescence detection. ER-SRS has encountered difficulties due to large electronic backgrounds. To overcome this, we employed Raman-amplified nonfluorescent molecular probe (RANMP) alongside our synchronously pumped, independently tunable double optical parametric oscillators for effective optimization of the signal-to-background ratio. The optimization of probe and light source allowed us to successfully detect ER-SRS signal from single particles in solution and from single molecules embedded in polymer matrix. ER-SRS combined with RANMP provides single-molecule sensitivity without fluorescence detection, enabling applications in biological and chemical imaging, particularly in multiplexed imaging.

 Antarctic sea ice is projected to decline with continued global climate change, potentially impacting Antarctic ecosystems on several levels. Here using a series of models, we show that substantial regional and seasonal differences exist in when and how climate change patterns manifest in Antarctic sea ice, phytoplankton, krill, fish and penguins. Climate-driven changes in fish and penguins tend to emerge from historic variability earlier than sea ice and lower trophic levels. Changes are highly seasonal and can be either negative or positive; for example, krill growth increases in the spring, but decreases in the summer in many regions. The earliest climate signals emerge in Eastern Antarctic regions, while the Ross Sea remains a refuge from climate change into the twenty-first century. In the coming decades, summer sea ice loss in the Weddell Sea could improve the region for fish and krill growth, while remaining habitable for Emperor penguins.

 Marine microorganisms drive the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles, yet most cannot be cultured in laboratories, severely limiting in-depth studies of their ecological roles and application potential. In a decade-long study, we isolated 16,931 microbial strains from 1516 sampling sites across seven oceanic regions. By integrating omics and environmental data, we found that light conditions—such as long-term variations in sunlight at different latitudes and depths—are key factors shaping microbial biogeography and metabolic strategies. Moreover, 71.67% of the strains exhibited strict light-pattern specificity, a trait linked to differences in metabolic strategies adapted to their native environments. Based on this, we developed a database to predict optimal culture conditions for uncultured microorganisms, clarified the core reasons for their culturability challenges, and provided a practical pathway for exploring the potential of unknown microbes.

 As a major ocean circulation system, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may approach a critical transition under anthropogenic forcing, yet how large-scale AMOC changes imprint on regional circulation pathways remains incompletely understood. While persistent changes in overturning are expected to be meridionally coherent, their horizontal expression may be highly non-uniform. Here, we use 22,000-year-long transient deglacial climate simulations to examine how latitudinally coherent AMOC variations are redistributed across the upper Atlantic circulation. By separating externally forced, long-term AMOC changes from internally generated, short-term variability, we show that the former are disproportionately reflected along the full meridional extent of the South Atlantic western boundary current system. In contrast, North Atlantic counterparts relate primarily to higher-frequency, unforced AMOC variability. Our findings highlight South Atlantic western boundary transports as outstanding fingerprints of past externally forced AMOC changes, thereby outlining their particular sensitivity to a predicted, anthropogenically forced weakening of the AMOC. Persistent changes in the Atlantic overturning circulation leave their clearest imprint on the South Atlantic western boundary current system, revealing an overlooked regional sensitivity, according to transient climate simulations spanning the past 22,000 years."

We, unexpectedly, found that CBX7 formed a methylation-dependent transcriptional complex, which induced gene transcription by binding to cytokine gene promoters. CBX7 translocated to the cytosol and formed a methylation-dependent signaling complex with c-Raf, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and casein kinase-2 (CK2)–α to generate and sustain extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling.CBX7is an allergen-inducible gene. Genetic and pharmacologic interventions established an essential role for CBX7 for the production of cytokines by mouse and asthmatic patient lymphoid cells, and for the induction of allergic asthma in multiple mouse models. RNA sequencing demonstrated a large-scale loss and gain in gene transcription inCbx7−/−T cells. The top down-regulated pathways included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, asthma, and T helper cell differentiation.

HLA allelic influence on the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire shapes thymic selection and controls activation of diabetogenic clones yet remains largely unresolved in T1D. We sequenced the circulating TCRβ chain repertoire from 2250 HLA-typed participants across three cross-sectional cohorts, including individuals with T1D and healthy related and unrelated controls. We found that HLA risk alleles show higher restriction of TCR repertoires in individuals with T1D. We leveraged deep learning to identify T1D-associated TCR subsequence motifs that were also observed in independent TCR cohorts residing in pancreas-draining lymph nodes of individuals with T1D. Collectively, our data demonstrate T1D-related TCR motif enrichment based on genetic risk, offering a potential metric for autoreactivity and groundwork for TCR-based diagnostics and therapeutics."

However, the choice of dielectrics is often restricted within the transparency window. We introduce object-driven engineering of the process of silicon-based dielectric materials for metasurfaces: visibly transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with a high refractive index of 3.48 and oxygen-doped a-Si:H (a-SiOx:H) exhibiting strong dispersion (Abbe number < 10). Both films are fabricated via chemical vapor deposition with precise control over atomic bonding and dopants, revealing the link between optical properties and the amorphous silicon network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a-Si:H in metalenses with conversion efficiencies of 66.3, 92.0, and 97.0% at 450, 532, and 635 nanometers, respectively. In addition, a wavelength-decoupled a-SiOx:H beam-splitter achieves a 3.67-fold steering intensity contrast between 450 and 635 nanometers.

Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the non-equilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting non-equilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the nonlocal redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation—an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons."

Microtubule cytoskeletal fibers offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties. This nuclear spin-driven effect is enhanced under an applied weak 3-millitesla magnetic field. Our theoretical radical pair model achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results support a connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing further insights into how weak magnetic fields may influence biomolecular functions."

Here, we identify elongation of very-long-chain fatty acid protein 6 (Elovl6) as a critical regulator in CRC progression. Clinical data reveal significant down-regulation of Elovl6 in colon cancer tissues, with low expression levels correlating with unfavorable patient prognosis. We demonstrate that Elovl6 exerts potent tumor-suppressive effects, significantly inhibiting cellular proliferation in vitro and attenuating tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, it maintains intestinal microbial homeostasis by preventing the expansion of opportunistic pathogens while simultaneously orchestrating metabolic reprogramming through modulation of phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. Notably, we find that stearic acid, a key Elovl6-derived metabolite, promotes mitochondrial fusion by stabilizing mitofusin 1 protein. These findings not only position Elovl6 as a promising therapeutic target but also suggest that dietary supplementation with stearic acid could represent a viable strategy for CRC prevention and treatment."

We demonstrate its biological potential in a glioblastoma model, where the simultaneous bidirectional modulation of five among the most deregulated microRNAs results in critical mass interference against the tumor. In parallel, microRNA-mediated chaperoning of an anti-p50 aptamer within the platform allows us to selectively block the nuclear factor κB pathway, a difficult-to-drug target.

Presynaptic diacylglycerol (DAG), Ca2+, and Ca2+-calmodulin signaling converge on the essential synaptic vesicle (SV) priming protein Munc13-1 via its regulatory C1, C2B, and CaM-binding domains. Using brainstem-specific heterozygous mice expressing a DAG-binding-deficient Munc13-1 variant (Munc13-1H567K), we compared synaptic transmission in situ at glutamatergic calyx of Held synapses carrying either a single Munc13-1H567Kor a single Munc13-1wtallele. Munc13-1H567K/−synapses show enhanced initial strength but impaired steady-state release and slower recovery from depression. These deficits result from an increased initial abundance of fully primed SVs and a loss of activity-dependent acceleration of SV priming. Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is strongly reduced in Munc13-1H567K/−synapses and either increased or attenuated by C2B mutations that enhance or weaken Ca2+-phospholipid binding.

Subsequent automated synthesis and validation found a high-performance catalyst, TiFeNiZn-CoOOH, which exhibited an exceptional OER overpotential of 263 millivolts at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter. Feature importance and statistical analysis of more than 5 million structures confirmed that Zn consistently shows the highest active site occupation probability, and the [CoNiZn] coordination yields the lowest overpotential.

We found that genes within the IIS pathway evolved opposite roles in organ growth across wing-dimorphic insects, playing opposite roles in regulating the developmental switch between short and long wings. In the firebug, the InR-Chico-PI3K-PDK1-Tsc1/2-TORC1 cascade redirects the switch from short to long wings by inactivating IIS, whereas in the planthopper, the InR-Chico-PI3K-Akt-FoxO cascade redirects this same switch by activating IIS. Activation or inactivation of IIS results in low ecdysteroid titers in both species by regulating different genes within the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway, which in turn induces long wing development. Our findings reveal a negative relationship between IIS and organ growth and a mechanism for how a hormone pathway can translate opposing IIS activities into the same developmental switch across species."

We developed a functional screening workflow in which we screen panels of TCRs for reactivity to individual viral genomes or to ~1000 viral reference strains and then sort out the immunogenic peptides by labeling antigen-presenting cells that are in proximity to activated T cells. Using this workflow, we identified the target specificities of T cells that are circulating in up to 14% of individuals, including a pre–COVID-19 seasonal coronavirus-reactive TCR that cross-reacts with peptides within pandemic coronaviruses; an influenza B–reactive TCR that targets a highly conserved epitope; and TCRs targeting Herpesviridae family viruses that cause long-term latent infections.

Electrophysiology shows that ivermectin activates GlyR even with strychnine present. Structures with both ligands reveal intermediate states featuring a desensitized TMD and an ECD between closed and desensitized conformations, providing insights into domain cooperativity and ligand efficacy. Molecular dynamics simulations show how ivermectin affects strychnine dynamics. These data support a model where ivermectin activates GlyRs through a concerted and near-symmetric TMD mechanism, whereas allosteric ECD motions are graded and spatially heterogeneous.

With a precalculated, sample- and geometry-specific structure factor–based correction, the linear fitting of diffraction intensities allows the determination of the Debye-Waller factor and, thus, temperature with a precision of 10−4square angstrom per °C. Using graphene as a model material, this work reveals the influence of sample tilt, lattice thermal expansion, and sample thickness on Debye-Waller factor and offers a route to improving the measurement precision along with spatial resolution.

Gianneschi,Exploring allomelanin: A comparative analysis via natural product extraction and synthesis,"Allomelanin is a nitrogen-free class of melanin commonly found in plants and fungi. Although synthetic analogs have been developed from 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,8-DHN), detailed physicochemical comparisons with natural allomelanins remain limited. Herein, we extracted allomelanin from black knot fungus, chaga mushroom, and black oat using an acid-base extraction protocol, comparing them against a library of synthetic analogs derived from a range of putative, natural precursors. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that simple homopolymerization of 1,8-DHN does not adequately represent natural allomelanin structures. Instead, heterogeneous copolymerization of 1,8-DHN with catechol or tannic acid yields materials with physicochemical properties more consistent with natural extracts. This is also supported by their enhanced antioxidant and dye/metal adsorption properties. Like their synthetic counterparts, extracted natural allomelanins exhibit intrinsic porosity, reaching a Brunauer-Emmet-Teller area of 155 square meters per gram, potentially facilitating nutrient transport and toxin adsorption, although further studies will be required to probe this."

Normal-dispersion Kerr combs are critically needed because of their standout advantages, yet this dispersion regime remains unexplored on x-cut TFLN. Here, we design and demonstrate microresonators suitable for the robust generation of normal-dispersion Kerr combs. We show Kerr combs that substantially surpass state-of-the-art microcombs on x-cut TFLN in key performance metrics and an ultrabroad frequency comb whose existence is underpinned by both normal-dispersion Kerr dynamics and stimulated Raman scattering. Our work will unlock high-speed and low-energy-consumption photonic circuits for communications and signal processing enabled by a monolithic microcomb technology while also stimulating investigations of previously unknown nonlinear states that may synergize hybrid material nonlinearities."

Moreover, T cell defects were recently involved in the age-related loss of tissue integrity and function. Mechanistically, thymic involution is driven by several factors, including hormonal modifications and chronic inflammation, leading to functional changes in the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. These progressive changes alter the cross-talk between developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells, which is pivotal for thymic function. Promising strategies to counteract thymic involution and rejuvenate immune T cell function have been recently identified. This review summarizes key insights into the underlying mechanisms of thymic involution and discusses current and emerging rejuvenation strategies to restore thymic function.

This study aims to further explore the underlying biomechanism and modifying effects of maternal genetic regulators. Among 1944 mother-child pairs from the Shanghai Birth Cohort, meet-in-the-middle, mediation, and enrichment analyses were combined with the early pregnancy untargeted metabolome to explore potential biological links between prenatal ALAN exposure and early life growth. Maternal polygenetic risk scores (PRS) for glucose- and lipid-metabolism-related phenotypes were constructed and dichotomized (high/low) to examine gene-environment interactions. We identified 35 mediating metabolites between prenatal ALAN exposure and growth outcomes, which were enriched in neural signal transduction-related pathways and associated with the circadian rhythm. The effects of ALAN exposure on fetal and child growth were more pronounced among mothers with high PRS levels for fasting glucose, HbA1c, and triglycerides. To sum up, prenatal ALAN exposure may be associated with reduced weight and adiposity gains during the first 1000 days. These associations may be partly explained by disturbances in maternal circadian rhythms and appeared more pronounced among mothers with high genetic predispositions to glucose and triglyceride levels."

Pulse‐like infrasound activity gradually became intermittent and waned at the end of the day. Seismic‐infrasonic amplitude ratio decreased, while the infrasound frequency index increased with time. These results suggest less interaction with water due to drying out of the vent. Satellite observations also show increased ground surface temperatures inside the crater from 13 to 14 July.

Yet observations indicate that intense substorms can also be directly driven, though the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. For the first time, global observations strongly indicate that substorm triggering is linked to enhanced dayside‐driven convection and Region 1 FAC, supported by simulations. At 17:17UT during the May 2024 superstorm, a shock‐compressed southward interplanetary magnetic field enhanced sunward convection and auroral currents. These rapidly extended to the nightside, initiating substorm expansion within 6 min. Simulations reproduce this response, revealing that dayside‐driven convection of closed field lines depleted nightside flux and thinned the current sheet. This lowered onset threshold and triggered substorm expansion with negligible flux loading. Following onset, nightside flux loading became significant as a reconnection X‐line formed near 10 Earth radii, extended azimuthally, and supported a global substorm current wedge."

Water samples were collected from key areas in the lower Belize River, including above and below the Belize City, an open fish market, and sewage lagoon outfall, and coral reefs. Water samples underwent qPCR analysis for a suite of antibiotic resistance gene classes (sul1, sul2, ermF, tetA, and blaSHV), intI1, and 16S rRNA. Additionally, a subset of samples were tested for extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL) E. coli and underwent shotgun sequencing. Results show that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were highest and most diverse near Belize City, particularly near the treatment lagoons and open fish market. The coral reef regions had lower levels of antibiotic resistance though not void of their presence. This study is an application of a modified Global Tricycle Surveillance protocol integrated with qPCR‐ and metagenomics‐based characterization of environmental antibiotic resistance in understudied areas.

Here the authors show with mouse models that tumor-derived Wnt ligands activate liver stromal fibroblasts to facilitate hyaluronan accumulation in the microenvironment, promoting gastric cancer liver metastasis. 
 The majority of gastric cancer cells proliferate in a Wnt ligand-dependent manner. To investigate this, we generated mice harboring Kras, Tgfbr2, and Trp53 (KTP) as well as with the same mutations plus Wnt1 expression (WKTP) in gastric mucosa. While KTP mice develop gastric metaplasia, WKTP mice develop dysplastic tumors, highlighting the role of ligand-dependent Wnt signaling in primary tumorigenesis. Organoids derived from WKTP mice form liver metastases following splenic transplantation, whereas KTP organoids do not. Notably, Apc disruption fails to induce metastasis of KTP cells, suggesting that stromal Wnt signaling promotes metastasis. Mechanistically, tumor-derived Wnt ligands cooperate with TGFβ signaling to induce Has2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to hyaluronan accumulation in the metastatic microenvironment. Strikingly, hyaluronidase expression in WKTP cells significantly suppresses liver metastasis. Here we show the critical role of ligand-dependent Wnt signaling and Has2-mediated hyaluronan deposition in metastasis, offering potential therapeutic strategy against gastric cancer metastasis.

 Anecdotal reports about smoking that might prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection inspire the search for nicotine and its pyrolysis products as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro). This effort leads to the discovery of 3-vinylpyridine as an MPro inhibitor. 3-Vinylpyridine resembles part of nirmatrelvir in binding to MPro but does not involve a critical interaction with residue E166, whose mutation has led to resistance to nirmatrelvir. Integration of the two molecules, followed by a medicinal chemistry campaign, produces several molecules with better in vitro potency than nirmatrelvir. Two lead molecules, YR-C-136 and SR-B-103, display better pharmacokinetic characteristics than nirmatrelvir in virus-challenged male mice and much better antiviral efficacy in virus-challenged female mice. Both molecules maintain high potency in inhibiting the nirmatrelvir-resistant MPro (E166V/L50F) variant. They also exhibit a broad and highly potent antiviral spectrum against most pathogenic coronaviruses. With high in vivo potency, both molecules are potentially standalone pan-antivirals for coronaviruses and may serve as countermeasures for future coronavirus outbreaks. Here the authors identify nicotine-derived inhibitors of the SARS-CoV−2 main protease that outperform Paxlovid in cells and mice, remain effective against resistant variants, and show broad activity against multiple human coronaviruses."

Here the authors show distinct timing between caudal orbitofrontal and cingulate signals, that orbitofrontal stimulation increases avoidance, and that physiological responses mirror behavior. 
 Mood disorders are associated with complex disruptions in brain networks, including those associated with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). Differential functions of these regions, especially the functions of the far-caudal OFC, are incompletely understood. We trained macaques to perform an approach-avoidance task and recorded cOFC and pACC neuronal activity and autonomic/somatic responses during performance, including during electrical microstimulation (EMS) of the cOFC. The cOFC was sensitive to both positive and negative stimuli, whereas the pACC was significantly more active during aversive outcomes. cOFC EMS increased avoidance, suggesting a causal cOFC function in cost-benefit decision-making. The cOFC activity led pACC activity during the decision period, supporting cOFC network prominence. Autonomic and somatic responses were positively correlated with behavioral patterns, consistent with a coordinated body-brain involvement during emotionally significant decision-making. We suggest that dysfunction of this network could potentially contribute to the etiology of mood disorders. The roles of orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex in emotional decisions remain unclear.

 Conventional storage and retrieval of nucleic acid specimens, particularly unstable RNA, rely on costly cold-chain infrastructure and inefficient robotic handling, inhibiting large-scale nucleic acid archives needed for global genomic biobanking. We introduce a scalable room-temperature storage system with minimal physical footprint that enables database-like queries on encapsulated, barcoded, and pooled nucleic acid samples. Queries incorporate numerical ranges, categorical filters, and combinations thereof, advancing beyond previous demonstrations of single-sample retrieval or Boolean classifiers. We evaluate this system on ninety-six mock SARS-CoV-2 genomic samples barcoded with theoretical patient data including age, location, and diagnostic state, demonstrating rapid, scalable retrieval. We further demonstrate storage and sequencing of human patient-derived nucleic acid samples, illustrating applicability to clinical genomic analysis. By avoiding freezer-based storage and retrieval, this approach scales to millions of samples without loss of fidelity or throughput, enabling large-scale pathogen and genomic repositories in under-resourced or isolated regions of the US and worldwide.

Here, the authors identify stable sites whose disruption is linked to blood cancers, aging, and cardiovascular risk. 
 The abundance, dynamics, and context-dependent heterogeneity of DNA methylation, where a pattern considered abnormal in one cell type may be normal in another, complicate the identification of early methylation changes that drive or signal disease development. This complexity can obscure early markers of increased disease risk, making it challenging to detect and intervene in disease processes at their inception. Here, we report 31,744 CpG loci exhibiting highly consistent methylation profiles in the blood of young, healthy individuals. We assess alterations at these epigenetically stable loci in 8,886 individuals across 29 diverse cohorts, including those with hematological cancers (n = 3159), cardiovascular complications (n = 2788), and healthy controls (n = 2939). Our findings reveal methylation pattern disruption in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, correlating with clonal burden dynamics and mutation frequency throughout leukemia treatment. In non-cancer cohorts, we observe that methylation levels at epigenetically stable loci become increasingly variable with age, a shift linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk and lower survival rates. This study highlights DNA methylation instability as a blood-based biomarker for both hematological cancer and cardiovascular disease and uncovers a mechanistic link between methylation dynamics and the expansion of maladaptive hematopoietic clones. DNA methylation heterogeneity and dynamics hinder distinguishing early pathological changes from normal variation.

 Understanding near-trench interseismic deformation at subduction zones is crucial for assessing the hazards of giant earthquakes, especially trench-breaking tsunamigenic earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. However, interseismic locking preceding such trench-breaking tsunamigenic events remain poorly constrained due to the limited sensitivity of onshore geodetic observations. Here, we present seafloor geodetic observations along the southwestern Kuril trench, a region with the potential for large coseismic ruptures reaching the trench, as inferred from historical tsunami records. Our results show high slip-deficit rates near the trench during 2019–2024 and suggest that a slip deficit of 20.5–30.0 m may have accumulated over the past ~400 years, considering the long-term low seismic activity in this region. These findings imply future recurrence of a megathrust earthquake (Mw ~8.8) with rupture reaching the Kuril trench. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of seafloor geodetic monitoring for seismic and tsunami hazard assessment at subduction zones.

 The cause of mare asymmetry between the lunar nearside and farside remains a long-lasting conundrum. Due to scarcity of directly sourced deep samples, the formation mechanism of this phenomenon has not been well constrained. Here we characterized a class of rare impact glass beads with extremely high TiO2 (16–25 wt%) and FeO (25–35 wt%) in the Chang’e-5 regolith. Petrological modeling indicates that the precursor rock of these glass beads cannot be formed through normal magmatic evolution, but rather has a deeper mantle origin. Phase diagram calculations show that the precursor rock has a typical mineral assemblage similar to ilmenite-bearing cumulates. Based on different residual anorthite proportions, the restored Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) original crystalline mineral assemblage is predicted to contain ~15–20 vol% ilmenite, significantly higher than the average predicted levels. Therefore, the nearside ilmenite-bearing cumulates may have higher ilmenite abundance than farside, causing increased partial melting and more abundant volcanism. Lunar mare asymmetry could be explained by a higher nearside ilmenite content which would cause increased partial melting and volcanism relative to the farside, according to observations and petrological modelling of high-Ti glass impact beads in Chang’e-5 samples."

Previous studies have shown that techniques using hydrated electrons can effectively degrade these compounds. However, such reactions typically necessitate alkaline and anaerobic conditions or involve the use of surfactants. Herein, we introduced a novel approach that utilized indole as the monomer molecule for in situ polymerization within the clay interlayer to generate polyindole. In the system, polyindole could both serve as the precursor to provide hydrated electrons and, with its own organic polymer structure, create a hydrophobic phase to effectively adsorb perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Without the need for surfactants, the “adsorption-concentration-reaction” strategy for PFOA could be realized. At the same time, as the degradation of PFOA by the generated hydrated electrons occurred mainly within the clay layers, the confinement effect could be harnessed to reduce the mass transfer of O2 and H+ from the solution to the layers. It thereby weakened the quenching of hydrated electrons and enhanced their utilization efficiency. Therefore, this study represents a novel attempt to use in situ polymerization for constructing a polyindole-based nanocomposite, offering a sophisticated solution for degradation of PFASs."

While sediment‐water interactions are widely recognized, quantitative understanding of sediment legacy effects remains limited. To address this gap, we developed a two‐layer sediment model integrated with a physical‐biogeochemical framework for the Pearl River Estuary to elucidate how legacy organic matter perpetuates hypoxia via benthic‐pelagic coupling. Results show that sediment oxygen consumption accounts for 44% of total oxygen depletion in low‐oxygen zones, increasing to 81% in near‐bottom waters. This oxygen demand is significantly supported by legacy organic matter, without which would reduce primary production by 68% and the hypoxic area by 53%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sediment legacy effects amplify hypoxia sensitivity to nutrient loading and may lead to hysteresis and regime shifts if unaddressed. Therefore, effective hypoxia mitigation requires management strategies tailored to system‐specific sediment‐water coupling dynamics."

Modeling results show that: (a) buoyant rise of subcontinental lithosphere up and toward the rift zone, which inhibits asthenosphere upwelling and decompression melting; (b) a weak mid‐lithospheric discontinuity lengthens magmatic lag by ∼15 Myr and widens the COT by >200 km; (c) the lateral distance over thick, depleted mantle influences rift magmatism is governed by lithospheric density and rheology; and (d) magmatic lag scales linearly with the density contrast between lithospheric mantle and asthenospheric mantle.

Here, authors discover a histidine-rich coiled coil protein in mussel glue that challenges the prevailing understanding of how mussel stick tight, with the findings relevant to the design of improved glues. 
 Challenging to engineer in synthetic glues, wet adhesion is critical for many technical and biomedical applications. Mussels, however, have evolved underwater glues that adhere effectively onto slippery seashore surfaces. Past research on mussel adhesion highlights the importance of the post-translationally modified amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), found in abundance in mussel glue proteins. Yet, DOPA alone is insufficient to match native adhesion in synthetic mimics. Here, we provide evidence that a previously uncharacterized histidine-rich protein (mefp-12) plays a crucial role in the formation, curing, and performance of mussel glue. Biochemical analysis localizes mefp-12 within vesicles of the mussel glue secretory glands, while AI-assisted modeling of its sequence predicts Zn-stabilized coiled coil conformation and several domains resembling zinc-finger motifs. In vitro investigation of a His-rich α-helical peptide from mefp-12 shows Zn- and pH-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), coalescence, and spreading over the substrate. Exposure to seawater pH induces subsequent self-organization of the fluid condensates into solid nanoporous networks resembling the structure of the native mussel glue. Based on these findings we gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of mussel glue formation and function that challenges the dominant DOPA-centric paradigm, providing inspiration for design of bio-inspired wet adhesives.

 The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a critical global health challenge that renders conventional antibiotics ineffective. Developing innovative strategies to resensitize drug-resistant pathogens to existing antibiotics represents a promising therapeutic approach. Here, we present a biomimetic nanoplatform (Ce-Car@EV NPs) through the rational integration of ginger-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and a pH-responsive cerium-carbenicillin coordination nanoparticles (Ce-Car NCPs). This design enables prolonged circulation and targeted degradation in acidic infection sites, releasing Ce4+ ions and carbenicillin. The released Ce4+ ions penetrate the bacterial cells, where they disrupt ATP synthesis, impede oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibit the activity of efflux pump. By depleting ATP, blocking efflux pumps, and thereby reversing bacterial resistance, Ce4+ ions act as a potent adjuvant to carbenicillin. Here we show that this strategy effectively restores carbenicillin efficacy against drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa both in vitro and in vivo, establishing a therapeutic strategy leveraging metallic adjuvants to counteract antimicrobial resistance.

 Post-fire vegetation recovery in boreal forests is shaped by the complex interactions among burn severity, ecological conditions, and climatic factors. Traditional pixel-based assessments often overlook the spatial configuration and shape of burned areas, potentially underestimating heterogeneity and misrepresenting recovery dynamics. Here, we developed a patch-level framework to quantify recovery time for the 2003 Siberian wildfire, examining the combined effects of patch morphology, burn severity, climatic factors, and topography. By 2023, 72.7% of burned patches had recovered, with an average recovery time of 12.2 years. Recovery was fastest in smaller, more compact patches, whereas larger and elongated patches recovered more slowly. Within patches, recovery time increased from edges toward interiors, indicating consistent edge-to-interior gradients. Climatic factors, particularly higher temperature and radiation, slowed recovery, whereas greater precipitation and soil moisture accelerated it. Burn severity also delayed regeneration, while topographic influences were minor in this low-relief landscape. These results demonstrate that patch morphology and climate jointly shape post-fire recovery and emphasize the importance of incorporating spatial configuration into forest resilience assessments and restoration planning. The patch-based framework provides a scalable, ecologically realistic approach applicable to fire-prone ecosystems worldwide."

Kaplan,"Modelling framework for asynchronous land-atmosphere coupling using NASA GISS ModelE (NASA-GISS E2.1) and LPJ-LMfire  (v1.4.0): design, application and evaluation for the 2.5 ka period","This study presents an experimental framework for asynchronous land-atmosphere coupling to include biogeophysical feedbacks using a dynamic vegetation model with an Earth system model that lacks a fully dynamic vegetation component. The framework is implemented for the 2.5 ka period and also illustrates the role of model performance metrics (bias, variability), while evaluating the simulated climate against the multi-proxy paleoclimate reconstructions. 
 While paleoclimate simulations have been a priority for Earth system modelers over the past three decades, little attention has been paid to the period between the mid-Holocene (6 ka) and the Last Millennium, although this is an important period for the emergence of complex societies. Here, we consider the climate of 2500 BP (before present or 550 BCE), a period when compared to late preindustrial time, greenhouse gas concentrations were slightly lower, and orbital forcing led to a stronger seasonal cycle in high latitude insolation. To capture the influence of land cover on climate, we asynchronously coupled the NASA GISS ModelE Earth system model with the LPJ-LMfire dynamic global vegetation model. We simulated global climate and assessed our results in the context of independent paleoclimate reconstructions. We also explored a set of combinations of model performance parameters (bias and variability) and demonstrated their importance for the asynchronous coupling framework. The asynchronously coupled model system shows strong vegetation-albedo feedback on climate and is comparatively more sensitive to the bias correction than the internal model variability and green Sahara conditions. In the absence of a bias correction, while driving LPJ-LMfire in the coupling process, ModelE drifts towards colder conditions in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in response to land cover simulated by LPJ-LMfire. A regional precipitation response is also prominent in the various combinations of the coupled model system, with a substantial intensification of the Summer Indian Monsoon and a drying pattern over Europe. Evaluation of the simulated climate against reconstructions of temperature from multiple proxies and the isotopic composition of precipitation (δ18Op) from speleothems demonstrated the skill of ModelE in simulating past climate. A regional analysis of the simulated vegetation-climate response further confirmed the validity of this approach. The NASA GISS ModelE was found to be particularly sensitive to the representation of shrubs and this land cover type requires particular attention as a potentially important driver of climate in regions where shrubs are abundant. Our results further demonstrate the importance of bias correction in coupled paleoclimate simulations. This study presents a generalized framework for incorporating biogeophysical responses into climate models without dynamic vegetation, for simulating past climates, in line with the recommendations of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP)."

To understand this relationship, we integrate GNSS with local seismic observations from 2013 to 2024 to model the reservoir strain field, relocate earthquakes, and determine focal mechanisms. Our preferred model identifies a shallow spheroidal reservoir at ∼4 km depth that underwent ∼15 MPa of overpressure and a volume change increase of ∼0.23 km3. Seismicity clusters align with dilatational strain, and focal mechanisms are dominated by strike‐slip faulting consistent with the regional NE–SW tectonic stress regime. We distinguish two phases of unrest: 2013–2018, when seismicity concentrated in dilatational faults, and 2018–2024, when swarms became more energetic with increased magma flux and strain rates. These results demonstrate how magma input, crustal deformation, and faulting interact during prolonged volcanic unrest."

Our modeling confirms the observation and demonstrates that this phenomenon primarily arises from the 3D displacement pattern generated by earthquakes, not from the effect of the Earth's curvature.

We show that fluctuations in Cenozoic benthic foraminiferal δ13 ${\delta }^{13}$C and δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O follow a Laplace distribution. We present a simple model to explain this behavior: isotopic fluctuations respond to big and small “kicks” in the same way. We then use this to develop an expectation for the largest Cenozoic δ13 ${\delta }^{13}$C and δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O fluctuations. While the other hyperthermals of the early Cenozoic are encompassed the expected range, we quantify that the PETM isotopic signatures were larger than these expectations, by 1.15 ± $\pm $ 0.25‰ for δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O and 1.75 ± $\pm $ 0.24‰ for δ13 ${\delta }^{13}$C. This supports the view that the PETM is an extreme outlier amongst Cenozoic perturbations to the climate system and thereby was likely triggered by a large and unusual external perturbation."

We integrate pore‐to‐network‐scale dye visualization experiments and numerical simulations to investigate solute trapping at fracture intersections. At the network scale, 3D flume experiments show localized tracer retention caused by density‐induced convection and inertia‐driven vortices. Millifluidic experiments and simulations reveal that density contrast, flow imbalance, and fluid inertia govern these dynamics. Maximum trapping occurs when bottom fracture flow is ∼10% greater than the top, maximizing mass entry while minimizing loss. This imbalance promotes vortex‐driven retention and extended solute residence, leading to breakthrough curve tailing. Simulations in smooth and rough‐walled fractures confirm that roughness alters trapping locations but not the underlying mechanisms. These findings highlight the central role of coupled pore‐scale processes in controlling network‐scale transport and subsurface reactivity."

In this study, we investigate how a weakening of the AMOC would influence ocean heat storage in a warming climate by comparing two idealized experiments with two different AMOC evolutions from the global climate model EC‐Earth3, after abrupt carbon dioxide quadrupling. We find that AMOC weakening influences both vertical and inter‐basin heat redistribution. For a stronger AMOC decline, more heat is stored in the Indo‐Pacific Ocean and in the intermediate ocean layers above 700 m, while less heat accumulates in the deeper ocean layers, especially in the Atlantic. Globally, we find a 3% increase in cumulated ocean heat uptake at the end of the simulations."

 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and have been targeted mainly through their orthosteric site, where the endogenous agonist binds1. However, allosteric modulation has emerged as a promising and innovative strategy in the realm of GPCR drug discovery1. Here, drawing inspiration from the natural regulation of GPCRs by transmembrane proteins, we have developed GPCR exoframe modulators (GEMs), de novo designed proteins that specifically target the transmembrane domain of GPCRs. Utilizing a hallucination-like design approach, we crafted GEMs with three strategic structural prompts to achieve the desired binding modes. We selected the dopamine D1 receptor as a prototypical model and systematically investigated four GEMs. Structural studies and functional assays revealed that these GEMs bind to the transmembrane domains and function as diverse allosteric modulators, including agonist-positive allosteric modulator, negative allosteric modulator and biased allosteric modulator. The ago-PAM GEM restores the activity of various D1 receptor loss-of-function mutants, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for GPCR-related disorders.

Cryo-EM structures of ROS1 reveal how ligand activates the receptor and how monoclonal antibodies inhibit ROS1 signaling. 
 Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are key regulators of cellular signaling and are often co-opted in cancer. ROS1 is an orphan RTK aberrantly expressed in multiple tumors, yet no approved biologic therapies target it, and its activation mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present Cryo-EM structures of mammalian ROS1 in ligand-free and NELL2-bound states, revealing how trimeric NELL2 induces both receptor clustering and a conformational switch that relieves receptor autoinhibition – both mechanisms are required for ROS1 activation. These structures, along with biochemical characterization, reflect a striking evolutionary divergence in regulatory logic compared to the invertebrate ortholog Sevenless (dROS1), highlighting how conserved RTKs can adopt fundamentally different activation strategies. Guided by these structural insights, we develop monoclonal antibodies that either block ligand binding or trap ROS1 in an inactive conformation. These agents potently suppress ROS1 signaling, representing distinct mechanistic classes of biologics that directly target ROS1 activity.

 The luminescent and magnetic properties of trivalent lanthanides (Ln3+) are indispensable for many emerging technologies, but exacting fine control over these properties requires an understanding of how to purposefully engineer the coordination geometry and site symmetry of Ln3+ centres. Here, we use the Cambridge Structural Database to extract the structures of 12,670 eight-coordinate Ln3+ centres and use Continuous Shape Measures, Continuous Symmetry Operation Measures, and a new structural similarity-based network analysis to survey geometry and structure trends. This survey is then leveraged to deliver concrete strategies for controlling the coordination geometry of eight-coordinate Ln3+ centres using familiar concepts like Ln3+ metal size and ligand denticity, bite angle, flexibility, shape, symmetry, and size. Ultimately, we present a roadmap for targeting each of the six common eight-coordinate geometries – hexagonal bipyramidal, cubic, square antiprismatic, dodecahedral, bicapped trigonal prismatic, and snub disphenoid – which are each demonstrated to have unique use-cases in diverse research areas. The effects of crystal packing and non-covalent interactions are also illustrated, allowing fine-grained control over the geometry and symmetry of Ln3+ centres. This work ultimately serves to inform the deliberate design of Ln3+ coordination complexes and materials for applications including data-storage, quantum information processing, lighting, thermometry, and medical bioimaging.

Here, Sun et al. report light-controlled modulation of two distinct conductive pathways in single donor-acceptor Stenhouse adduct molecule with three thiomethyl anchoring sites. 
 Manipulating intramolecular electron transportation can fundamentally modulate the optical property, electromagnetic behavior and chemical reactivity of molecules. Achieving simultaneous control of multiple ( ≥2) transport pathways within a single molecule, however, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report light-gated modulation of two distinct conductive pathways in single donor-acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) molecules using the scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction (STM-BJ) technique. The donor and π-bridge pathways are separately controlled by designing DASAs with two thiomethyl anchoring sites. In the donor pathway, a side-chain modulation mechanism operates, where linear-to-cyclic isomerization induces electronic redistribution and increases the conductivity. In contrast, the π-bridge pathway is governed by a main-chain modulation mechanism, in which deformation of the π-conjugated backbone decreases the conductivity. By synthesizing DASAs containing three thiomethyl anchoring sites, these two conductive pathways are integrated within a single-molecule junction and can be simultaneously modulated under 635 nm red-light irradiation and dark relaxation. The π-bridge transport in the linear state exhibits mixed through-bond and through-space character, while photoisomerization leads to an increased through-space contribution in the cyclic state driven by cyclopentenone formation. These results highlight DASAs’ potential in understanding molecular electronics and developing photoresponsive molecular-scale devices.

Here the authors show that individual drainage basins have different thresholds and loss patterns, suggesting the need to consider the dynamical interactive nature of the basins and their individual tipping points. 
 The Antarctic Ice Sheet is subject to amplifying feedbacks which can accelerate ice loss and lead to effectively irreversible retreat. We here analyse the distinct nature and risk of long-term ice loss for each individual drainage basin under different levels of warming. Depending on topographic and climatic conditions, we find that ice loss in some basins unfolds gradually with warming, whereas other basins are characterized by a critical threshold or tipping point beyond which large parts eventually disintegrate. A first threshold, potentially as low as 1–2 °C above pre-industrial levels, triggers the long-term collapse of ~40% of marine ice volume in West Antarctica. Marine-based sectors in East Antarctica, representing ~5 m of potential sea-level rise, are at risk of losing stability at 2–5 °C. Our results imply that the Antarctic Ice Sheet does not act as one single tipping element, but rather as several tipping systems interacting across drainage basins. Climate change threatens the future of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here the authors show that individual drainage basins have different thresholds and loss patterns, suggesting the need to consider the dynamical interactive nature of the basins and their individual tipping points."

 The planetary boundaries framework sets precautionary limits to keep humanity within a safe operating space, aiming to maintain a stable, Holocene-like Earth system. Current methods for estimating these limits, however, create an imbalance by overstating biogeochemical risks relative to climate change. Here we propose a revised, flow-based, method for estimating the climate change boundary, aligned with the other biogeochemical flow boundaries.

 In the field of underground engineering, particularly in water conservancy, hydropower, and transportation tunnel projects, the high-resolution reconstruction of deep-buried long tunnels and other confined underground spaces serves as a fundamental data source for precise, efficient, and safe measurement of geological parameters. Due to the lack of control points and GNSS, important orientational data such as geological spatial attitude are difficult to be measured. Parallel photogrammetry can quickly acquire highly overlapping image data, but it still suffers from significant cumulative model drift and lack of absolute true geo-referenced pose in long tunnel reconstruction. To address these challenges, a novel sparse reconstruction method is proposed that integrates parallel photography with laser-coplanar directional control. First, an absolute orientation control system is established, in which the underground spaces with true directional geo-reference can be determined by combination of a geological compass and a laser level, i.e., a geological compass is used to measure absolute direction and a laser level is used to determine the vertical and horizontal pose angles parameters. Laser feature correspondences are extracted from both vertical and horizontal laser planars through a deep convolutional matching network guided by projected laser lines. These absolute orientation parameters, together with the global planar constraints, are incorporated as novel geometric constraints for the bundle adjustment optimization. The proposed method not only provides an absolute direction reference in constrained underground scenes without relying on GNSS, effectively mitigates model drift and enhances sparse reconstruction accuracy."

We tested this hypothesis using above-ground biomass trends from 2017 to 2024 across Spain, a region experiencing intensifying drought and extreme events as well as increasing wildfire pressure. Using statistical matching techniques that control for initial biomass conditions and climate exposure, we compared live biomass carbon conservation performance between PAs and non-PAs. PAs significantly outperformed non-PA counterparts, showing better live biomass carbon conservation in 70% of biomass-matched comparisons and maintaining this advantage in 59% of climate-controlled comparisons-representing a statistically significant 9% advantage over the null hypothesis. We find that most strict PAs (National Parks) have an enhanced effectiveness, showing better performance in carbon conservation in 85% of biomass-controlled and 68% of climate-controlled matches, respectively. This advantage demonstrates that protection status itself, not merely favorable location, can drive enhanced carbon conservation.

Existing climate regulations can inadvertently support this trend, notably the attribute-based vehicle emissions standards (VES) that have less stringent requirements for larger vehicles. We utilize a model of demand and supply interactions to simulate a VES that is neutral regarding vehicle class and size, as well as a truck purchase tax and electric vehicle efficiency standard. Relative to the attribute-based version, a neutral VES can induce modest but additive reductions in GHG emissions and new vehicle mass. Additional instruments can further reduce vehicle emissions and size, and reduce battery capacity among electric vehicles. In short, careful policy design can help to reduce vehicle upsizing trends while contributing to GHG mitigation."

Here, we develop a new simple climate model to help study this. We reduce the number of inputs so that our model can be connected to a model of the human causes of climate change. This way, we can study the interaction between climate change and society, including climate impacts. Our model broadly agrees with historical observations. 
 The new global Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments version 2.1 (FRIDAv2.1) Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) seeks to study the dynamics of the coupled human-Earth system. Connecting anthropogenic emissions to the resultant climate response is one part of the two-way feedback within this system, with the resultant climate impacts the other. This paper documents both the Climate Module within FRIDAv2.1, and the modified version separately simulated as a standalone simple climate model termed FRIDA-Clim version 1.0.1. This approach, based loosely on the existing FaIR simple climate model, simulates the key radiative forcings and the resultant temperature response, with process-based representations of the carbon cycle across the ocean, land, and atmosphere. When connected within the FRIDA IAM, it features deep connections to the other modules, being affected by processes such as water use for irrigation and land use change. In both uses, i.e. with the climate response interactively connected to the upstream human drivers and downstream climate impacts within the FRIDA IAM (coupled) and when ran separately as FRIDA-Clim driven by exogenous forcings (uncoupled), its climate drivers are simplified as compared to FaIR. This is to allow for this reduced set of key drivers to be interactively simulated within FRIDA, tightly coupling the evolution of the social and climate systems within the full model. Both the Climate Module and FRIDA-Clim are fully calibrated to accurately reproduce observations of key climate variables, with a systematic exploration of the uncertainty in the climate response. Together with the rest of the FRIDA model, this module is used to incorporate climate change systematically in the FRIDA System Dynamics IAM. As a standalone climate model, FRIDA-Clim comprises a simple climate model, enabling fast calculation of the global climate response to forcing; to explore this, the response of the model to both idealised CO2 emissions experiments and plausible future scenarios is also presented here. This setup will allow FRIDA-Clim to contribute to inter-model simple climate modelling initiatives, helping to explore the structural uncertainty in this modelling domain."

However, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in molecular assembly mechanisms and redox characteristics of DOM remains unclear, hindering the mechanistic understanding of landfill stabilization. Here, we develop a novel molecular modeling approach integrated with an ecological model to elucidate DOM molecular chemical heterogeneity, redox properties, and assembly dynamics across 20 year landfill layers. Ar–OH, quinone, Ar–COO–, Ar–SH, and Ar–NH2 are key redox sites. The enhanced electron transfer capacity of DOM during stabilization arises from synergistic electronic–structural interactions throughout its entire molecular framework rather than isolated redox sites, including ortho-positioned –NH2 and –OH, electron-withdrawing –COO– and electron-donating –OH adjacent to –SH on benzene rings, and π–π stacking. Molecules containing multiple redox sites and featuring extensively π-conjugated systems play a crucial role in enhancing the long-term stability of landfills. Ecological models revealed that stochastic processes dominate DOM molecular dynamics (>90%), while deterministic processes slightly strengthened with the stabilization process (from 8.55% to 9.18%), governing its chemical and redox properties. This research advances molecular-level insights into waste stabilization processes that will inform refined waste management strategies to mitigate landfill ecological impacts."

Here, we compared the effects of pristine and field-aged polyethylene SNs through a year-long exposure experiment with tea plants (Camellia sinensis). Both pristine and aged SNs impaired soil and plant health, but the adverse effects of aged SNs were more pronounced. Pristine SNs decreased soil pH and increased chromium content, while aged SNs further depleted soil available nitrogen, promoted stronger rhizosphere microbial restructuring, and induced ferroptosis-like lipid peroxidation in roots, leading to deterioration of tea quality. Beneficial rhizosphere groups such as Proteobacteria and Rozellomycota declined, while denitrifiers bacteria and saprotrophic fungi were enriched, aggravating nitrogen loss. These shifts disrupted the soil-plant C–N balance, impairing tea plant nitrogen metabolism, which in turn suppressed glutamate and theanine biosynthesis, reallocating metabolism toward bitter ester-type catechins, and ultimately reduced tea flavor and quality. Our findings show that aged SNs act as emerging agricultural pollutants, disrupting nitrogen metabolism across soil-root-leaf scales. Recognizing aged SNs as part of global plastic pollution highlights their dual agronomic and environmental risks, underscoring the need for sustainable management and recycling in high-value agriculture."

Here, we selected ferrihydrite and goethite, the active components of iron plaques, to elucidate this selective filtration. We demonstrated that under equimolar concentrations, ferrihydrite and goethite exhibited higher affinity for arsenate, substituting 31.36% to 46.99% of preadsorbed phosphate across pH 4.0–8.0. Then, our Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that phosphate formed labile monodentate and outer-sphere complexes via charge reorganization and electrostatic interactions, facilitating its ready remobilization into the rhizosphere. In contrast, arsenate formed stable bidentate-binuclear complexes through significant electron redistribution and stronger Fe–As bonds, leading to its strong sequestration on rice root iron plaques. Furthermore, our DFS measurements directly quantified that the binding free energy of arsenate to Fe oxyhydroxides was 14.57–27.01% higher than that of phosphate. Finally, we confirmed that Fe plaques enhanced phosphate uptake while lowering arsenate bioavailability through Fe–As coprecipitation using rice hydroponic experiments.

Here, using long-term in vitro and in vivo exposure models with environmentally relevant doses combined with multiomics analyses, we show that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exert antithetical effects in HCC and normal hepatocytes. Whereas PFAS promote ferroptosis in normal cells, chronic exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and its replacement 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) markedly enhances ferroptosis resistance in HCC. Mechanistically, these contaminants bind to and activate STAT3, which transcriptionally upregulates GPX4, establishing a STAT3-GPX4 self-activating loop that suppresses lipid peroxidation and protects tumor cells from ferroptotic death. Notably, 6:2 Cl-PFESA shows stronger activity than PFOS, challenging its designation as a safer substitute. Our findings reveal a striking cell type-specific duality of PFAS action─inducing ferroptosis in normal hepatocytes but enabling evasion in HCC through signaling reprogramming. This dichotomy advances understanding of pollutant-cancer interactions, highlights the STAT3-GPX4 axis as a therapeutic vulnerability, and underscores the health risks posed by PFAS replacements."

The PFOS was transferred to honey, accumulated in bee tissue, and was detected in feces at all exposure concentrations. At the sublethal exposures, adult bee colonies in all treatments appeared healthy, colonies were sustained, brood was produced, and resources were stored, but adverse life stage development and intergenerational effects were evident even at the lowest exposure concentration of 5 μg L–1.

Experiments were conducted using two trapped gases (i.e., at residual nonwetting saturation), two grain sizes, and three aqueous velocities. Mass transfer characteristics including dissolved gas enrichment, dissolved gas breakthrough times, and changes in gas saturations were assessed by observation and by the ANOVA test to evaluate the overall mass transfer behavior dependence on these three system parameters. Results showed that partitioning of any one gas component is highly dependent on all other gas components and that mass transfer is not consistent with local equilibrium assumptions (LEA), even at aqueous velocities below where LEA was expected. These findings show that the LEA velocity threshold remains uncertain and highlight that multicomponent kinetic mass transfer models that consider the gas–water interfacial area should be used to accurately simulate gas partitioning."

However, its global warming potential (GWP) remains above that of fossil-based caprolactam. In contrast, the alcoholysis and acidic processes lower GWP by ∼35%, whereas the NaOH route achieves an ∼80% reduction to 1.46 kg CO2-eq/kg caprolactam. Although chemical recycling can mitigate impacts, no process consistently meets the net-zero emission carbon budget needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. As the NaOH process comes closest to this target and demonstrates the strongest environmental and economic performance, future research should focus on scaling-up solvent-free chemical recycling."

In a mother–infant cohort, we quantified four MEL derivatives in matched maternal urine (median: 31.9 ng/mL), maternal blood (1.10 ng/mL), amniotic fluid (15.0 ng/mL), and cord blood (2.01 ng/mL), demonstrating substantial fetal exposure. Transplacental transfer efficiencies of MEL, ammelide, and cyanuric acid (CYA) were 1.46, 1.36, and 1.64, respectively, and were inversely correlated with their log Kow values. Maternal MEL concentration was negatively associated with birth weight, particularly in female infants (10β = 90.5%, 95% CI: 83.0%, 98.9%), estriol mediating approximately 30.7% of this effect. BeWo assays demonstrated that MEL derivatives cross the placental barrier via combined passive diffusion and transporter-modulated processes, involving folate-related transporters together with multiple xenobiotic transport systems. In trophoblast cells, coexposure to MEL and CYA (1:9) at environmentally relevant concentrations suppressed estradiol and estriol secretion in a nonmonotonic, dose-dependent manner, accompanied by down-regulation of key steroidogenic enzymes and compensatory up-regulation of estrogen receptors. Overall, this study provides integrated evidence that MEL analogues may cross the placenta via nutrient-mimicking transport pathways and disrupt placental steroidogenesis, potentially impairing fetal growth."

Conventional processes for recovering Li from spent LIB leachate are energy-intensive or chemically demanding, compromising the environmental and economic viability. This study introduces an ecofriendly approach using capillary-driven three-dimensional (3D) evaporative crystallization within a porous cotton matrix. Low-solubility salts (CoCl2, MnCl2, and NiCl2) crystallize proximally, while highly dissolvable LiCl migrates toward the distal zone, achieving spatial separation on the crystallizer. Maximum selectivity reached 109.5 (Li/Co), 7.8 (Li/Ni), and 3.2 (Li/Mn) in the simulated leachate, corresponding to a 4.7-fold enrichment of Li abundance. A comparable selective Li separation was demonstrated for a real leachate, confirming the practical potential of the approach. The natural-physiochemical-process-induced 3D evaporative crystallization eliminates high energy or chemical inputs, providing a sustainable and low-cost pathway for selective Li recovery from variable spent LIB leachates."

We present a new basin‐wide 3‐D gravity model, updated by the most comprehensive sediment thickness and seismic observations, offering the first systematic view of crustal architecture. Since ∼45 Ma, the western Gakkel ridge (3°W–85°E), spreading at ∼10–14 mm/yr, has produced generally thin (2–4 km) crust. In contrast, the slower eastern Gakkel ridge (85–126°E; ∼6–10 mm/yr) generates basin‐wide robust volcanic crust 6–8 km thick. This “slower‐yet‐thicker” relationship challenges the classical spreading‐rate paradigm, showing that mantle fertility, elevated temperatures, and active upwelling—not spreading rate alone—govern crustal production at eastern part of Gakkel ridges."

However, the environmental factors controlling REY enrichment remain poorly understood, largely because paleoceanographic proxies are absent in pelagic clays. This study focused on two sediment cores with an ultra‐enrichment layer of REY (UELR) from the western and southeastern Pacific. Detailed rock magnetic and transmission electron microscope analyses revealed high magnetofossil abundance in the UELR. It is proposed that strong bottom currents triggered intense upwelling, enhancing primary productivity. This, in turn, stimulated both fish and magnetotactic bacteria reproduction, making the strong coupling between magnetofossils and phosphate, mainly from fish bones and teeth, which efficiently absorbed substantial REYs from seawater. Moreover, magnetic parameters related to eolian dust can also indicate REY composition and the enrichment environment. Therefore, environmental magnetism holds significant potential for investigating the mechanisms of deep‐sea REY enrichment."

 The electrolytes of aqueous batteries are mostly acidic or alkaline, resulting in inevitable side reactions. More importantly, when batteries are disposed of, strongly acidic and alkaline solutions harm the environment. In this study, we synthesized covalent organic polymers as negative electrode materials for aqueous divalent ion (Mg2+ and Ca2+) storage, which exhibit favorable performance in electrolytes with a pH of 7.0 (the electrolytes are environmentally benign and can even be “brine” in tofu production). Polymers containing electron-donating linking bonds exhibit fast kinetics and low potential for use in aqueous Mg2+/Ca2+ batteries. In neutral electrolytes (pH = 7.0), Hexaketone-tetraaminodibenzo-p-dioxin covalent organic polymers exhibit 120,000 cycles and deliver specific capacities (up to 112.8 mA h g-1). The negative electrode was paired with a positive electrode, creating a full cell that has a voltage interval of 2.2 V and achieves a specific energy of up to 48.3 Wh kg-1, which is calculated on the basis of the total mass of the negative electrode, positive electrode, and electrolyte at the full cell level, together with long-term cycling stability over 120,000 cycles at a specific current of 20 A g-1.

This study shows that APOBEC3B is required for these breaks, by deaminating cytosines within R-loops at oestrogen receptor-regulated enhancers. 
 Oestrogen receptor (ER) activation leads to the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), promoting genomic instability and tumour heterogeneity. The single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) serves as a co-activator of ER and is implicated in inducing DSBs at transcriptional enhancers regulated by ER. Using whole-genome sequencing in an engineered cell model lacking base excision repair (BER) function, we demonstrate that A3B preferentially targets transcriptionally active regulatory regions in an R-loop-dependent manner. Strand-specific DNA:RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (ssDRIP-seq) and ssDNA-associated protein immunoprecipitation sequencing (SPI-seq) confirm that A3B binds to and deaminates ssDNA within R-loops, a process facilitated by ER transactivation. Furthermore, BER-mediated processing of A3B-induced uracil bases contributes to the formation of R-loop-associated DSBs, which are essential for ER-regulated gene activation. These findings establish a role for A3B in R-loop homeostasis and transcriptional regulation, with implications for understanding ER-driven genomic instability and potential therapeutic targeting of A3B. Oestrogen receptor activation generates DNA breaks at regulatory elements that control gene expression. This study shows that APOBEC3B is required for these breaks, by deaminating cytosines within R-loops at oestrogen receptor-regulated enhancers."

This study creates a uranium–graphdiyne material that promotes nitrogen adsorption and ammonia release, boosting ammonia yield. 
 The sustainable synthesis on ammonia at mild thermal conditions is a pivotal goal in catalysis, yet finding efficient alternatives to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process remains a great challenge. Here we show that a composite material comprising uranium and few-layer graphdiyne (U/GDY) catalyzes ammonia production with high efficiency at low temperature and pressure. We synthesize few-layer GDY in supercritical CO2 to create a stable scaffold that hosts uranium in specific valency and cluster states. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique electronic interplay between the 5 f electrons of uranium and the conjugated structure of GDY optimizes the adsorption and activation of nitrogen. This synergism facilitates a favorable reaction pathway involving specific nitrogen recognition and efficient product release. Our findings demonstrate the potential of uranium-based composites in catalysis and offer a strategy for designing actinide-carbon hybrid materials in challenging chemical transformations.

Here, the authors instead show that robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise from equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology. 
 Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing integer quantum Hall states. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle and hole-like integer quantum Hall edges. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.

 The deployment of green hydrogen in the global transition towards sustainable energy systems relies heavily on cost-effective renewables. Regions rich in renewable energy are usually along a seashore, although the direct electrolysis of seawater is still technically challenging. Moreover, the scarcity of freshwater poses significant costs for hydrogen production. Here we describe an electrolysis process with built-in seawater desalination in a porous-solid-electrolyte reactor. A three-chamber cell with bipolar membranes synergizes the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction, the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction and electrodialysis desalination processes. The use of a porous solid electrolyte in the cell facilitates reliable electrochemical equilibrium, resulting in a coupling factor of approximately 100% for electrolysis and desalination, which maintains the high kinetic current of the coupled electrochemical processes for a lower energy penalty. For seawater electrolysis, the optimized catalyst is robust against anodic Cl− corrosion and serves to enhance device reliability. Long-term cell operation with real seawater experienced negligible device degradation over 360 h. The current system can produce approximately 2.1 t of freshwater meeting potable standards for every kilogram of hydrogen generated, thus offering a feasible pathway to harnessing seawater for both clean water and green hydrogen. Taking advantage of the abundant renewable energy sources along seashores, this work describes a three-chamber electrolyser that combines electrolysis and desalination to produce both freshwater and green hydrogen."

 In 1976, the Motagua Fault along the North American-Caribbean plate boundary ruptured in a devastating M 7.5 earthquake. Despite its considerable scientific importance and its potential for catastrophic societal impact, very little is known about the seismic history of this major fault. Here, we show direct on-fault paleoseismic evidence for five ground-rupturing earthquakes on the Motagua Fault in the last 1,300 years that led to cultural and architectural adaptations. Radiocarbon ages of fault scarp-derived colluvial wedges, along with damage and repair at Maya and Colonial sites, provide constraints for three earthquakes during the 8th–13th centuries and two during the 18th-20th centuries, separated by a six-century interval of seismic quiescence. The research presented here provides new insight into the seismic character of the Motagua Fault and illustrates that earthquake recurrence on the fault is variable, allowing for improved estimation of current and future seismic risk in Guatemala.

 Ocean climatologies are essential for understanding the mean state and variability of marine systems, providing reference conditions for detecting anomalies, assessing ecosystem functioning and identifying long-term trends. In this study, we present the first high-resolution, four-dimensional temperature climatology for Northern Chilean Patagonia, a region characterised by the presence of a complex network of fjords and channels. The climatology was generated from approximately three million in situ observations collected over the past 75 years from multiple datasets. Using the Data Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVAnd) tool, temperature fields were reconstructed with a horizontal resolution of about 900 m and over 32 vertical levels, producing monthly fields from the surface to 400 m depth. The resulting climatology accurately reproduces the main spatial and seasonal temperature patterns reported in previous studies. Surface temperatures show strong summer gradients between the open Pacific and Northern Patagonia, while enclosed regions such as Reloncaví Sound, Comau and Puyuhuapi Fjords exhibit pronounced seasonal amplitude compared with the more stable Corcovado Gulf. Below surface, temperature gradients become smoother and the thermocline deepens in summer, typically ranging between 10 and 50 m. At 100 m depth, temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, but spatial variations are still observed, with Ancud Gulf and Reloncaví Sound being slightly warmer. This climatology provides a refined and physically consistent representation of the oceanographic structure of Northern Patagonia, offering an essential baseline for future modelling, monitoring and climate-change assessments in a region where satellite observations are limited by persistent cloud cover and complex topography.

This study applies a “lock-in” analytical framework to examine how various interacting social, economic, political, and technological factors prevent the effective implementation of concepts such as “benign by design” in drug development. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including analysis of US and European clinical trial records, we identify two critical lock-ins: (1) misaligned timing of resources and expertise among key actors that prevents early integration of environmental safety and sustainability considerations in drug design, and (2) incentive structures that promote new drug development over the redesign of existing pharmaceuticals. Notably, this analysis identifies barriers to greening both future and existing drugs on the market. Building on Meadows’ framework for effective interventions in complex systems, we propose a strategic approach for breaking lock-ins and present specific recommendations for key stakeholder groups including policymakers, academia, small biotech, big pharma, and financial institutions. Addressing these lock-ins is essential to unlocking the full potential of green innovation in pharmaceutical development, while providing for patient access to essential medicines."

Herein, we report a series of imidazolium-based mesoporous PILs for the removal of PFASs through multiple interaction mechanisms. Among them, PDB-F, synthesized via free-radical copolymerization of divinylbenzene (DVB) and 3-(4,4,4-trifluorobutyl)-1-vinyl-1H-3-imidazolium bromide (F-VBIm) at a 1:1 mol ratio, exhibited an exceptional adsorption capacity (2471.7 mg/g at 25 °C) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranking it among the most effective polymer-based adsorbents to date. Comprehensive structural characterization and performance studies revealed that the outstanding PFASs adsorption by PDB-F arises from the synergistic effects of electrostatic, hydrophobic, pore filling, and fluorophilic (F–F) interactions. Moreover, PDB-F demonstrated high efficacy in removing trace-level PFOA across different water matrices along with versatility for several common PFASs. Besides, PDB-F displayed good regeneration and remarkable reusability. This work offers valuable insights into the role of synergistic interactions in PFASs adsorption and lays the foundation for the rational design of high-performance adsorbents in the future."

However, its geochemical behavior in the presence of mackinawite (FeS), a ubiquitous mineral in reducing environments, remains poorly constrained. Here, we compared Re(VII) sequestration via coprecipitation and adsorption with FeS and elucidated the distinct reduction mechanisms involved. In the coprecipitation system, Re(VII) was reduced by S(-II) to form both ReS2 and ReO2, while in the adsorption system, Fe(II) served as the primary reductant, yielding ReO2 as the dominant product. These results demonstrate that Re redox transformation is highly dependent on the FeS formation pathway and the nature of available reductants. The H2S concentration threshold (∼10–11 M) above which ReS2 becomes the dominant phase was further defined, offering a predictive basis for Re sequestration under sulfidic conditions. This work enhances our understanding of Re fate in anoxic environments, informs its application as a paleoredox proxy, and contributes to Re recovery strategies in environmental and resource systems."

Peano curves, based on fractal geometry, are utilized to create unique patterns for positioning the anode and cathode, maximizing the electric field intensity and reactive species on the membrane surface. Applying a platinum-coated BPCPM prototype with an optimized fractal configuration, we have achieved a highly efficient cogeneration of HClO and H2O2 in dual-pulse flow-through electrofiltration operation with minimal energy consumption (0.17 kWh per m3 permeate). The BPCPM delivers 100% surface retention of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, facilitating a greater than 5-log reduction in bacterial viability and representing effective antibacterial activity. A scaled-up BPCPM reactor was evaluated for practical aquaculture wastewater reuse in crop irrigation. Over a 14 day period of operation, the modularized reactor exhibited a robust water flux and long-term biofouling resistance, demonstrating excellent BPCPM durability and scalability. The efficient removal of hazardous antibiotics and pathogens generated a nontoxic permeate, while also effectively supporting plant growth by enhancing nitrogen availability.

Major metabolites (oxalate, acetate, CO2) indicated complete hydrolytic dechlorination accompanied by fermentation and mineralization. Isotope labeling and chemical probe studies confirmed the simultaneous occurrence of TCAA dechlorination and nitrogen fixation under fixed nitrogen-limited conditions. Integrated metagenomic, metabolomic, and transcriptional analyses demonstrated nitrogen-regulated metabolic reconfiguration.

The conditions for this phenomenon remain poorly understood: while rupture complexity is often attributed to fault heterogeneity, back‐propagating fronts have also been reported on simple faults. Here, we employ earthquake simulations with slip‐rate and state‐dependent friction to reveal that back‐propagating fronts arise spontaneously during unilateral rupture propagation on frictionally homogeneous faults, when the rupture exceeds a critical length about 100 times larger than the nucleation dimension. We propose simple theoretical arguments suggesting that back‐propagating fronts are an intrinsic feature of unilateral ruptures under velocity‐weakening friction. These conditions preclude self‐similar crack‐like solutions with constant stress drop; instead, ruptures alternate between pulse and crack‐like modes, with back propagation generated at pulse‐to‐crack transitions. The crack‐to‐pulse transition is driven by restrengthening and happens when the local slip rate decreases below a specified threshold. An analytical criterion for the extent of back propagation shows that they are enhanced by low rupture velocities and stress drops, and observational examples of back propagation on simple faults are consistent with these requirements. Our study presents a simple, fundamental model for back‐propagating earthquakes, suggesting that they may be more prevalent than previously recognized."

Here, we present unique UV images of lightning, including interaction between positive and negative streamers, leading to new inferences on lightning propagation and attachment. We observed an abrupt change in the lightning propagation path to ground, which resulted in an aborted attachment process and a different ground connection point, 200 m away from the expected one. This change was likely due to the self‐choking effect of large negative space charge that was suddenly introduced by the intense streamer burst ahead of the lower end of the descending negatively‐charged channel.

The best agreement with the observed δ13C ${\delta }^{13}C$ anomalies is achieved with large ice volume loss, by reducing ice sheet basal friction. In our model, the freshwater discharges from the LIS need to be amplified to better represent the observed δ13C ${\delta }^{13}C$ changes.

The Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau, dominated by alpine grasslands, is subjected to extensive grazing by livestock. Apart from some control experiments, the regional impact of livestock species on alpine grassland has been overlooked, mostly due to the spatial mismatch between statistical livestock data and grassland biomass data. Using cross‐scale feature extraction and random forest models, we developed a 1 km × 1 km gridded long‐term grazing intensity data set distinguishing between herbivore types between cattle and sheep from 2000 to 2019. We used the propensity score matching method to identify the impact of grazing intensity and herbivore types on aboveground biomass on the Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau. The data set demonstrated strong spatio‐temporal consistency with county‐level statistics, with R2 values above 0.9 and Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) ranging from 0.93 to 0.98. The interannual trends of sheep (mainly Tibetan sheep) and cattle (mainly yaks) were largely opposite, with a significant decline in the sheep‐to‐cattle ratio in 42% of areas. At high grazing intensity, the aboveground biomass increase rate was slower, and aboveground biomass decreased more rapidly with an increasing sheep‐to‐cattle ratio. These findings advance our understanding of the spatio‐temporal dynamics of grazing intensity on the Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau and provide new insights into how grazing intensity and herbivore composition jointly shape alpine grassland productivity at the landscape scale."

 Cross-coupling of aryl boronic esters forms a cornerstone of how chemists make molecules. More recently, enantiomerically enriched boronic esters have shown great promise in modular synthesis as versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of diverse molecules. A significant challenge in this area is to employ boronic esters for the catalytic construction of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds, especially those where the reaction site is a stereogenic carbon center. Addressing this challenge would not only expand the utility of boronic esters in the modular synthesis of organic frameworks, but also prove more broadly beneficial in the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules.1 In this connection, we have developed a stereospecific C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling reaction catalyzed by a copper acetylide complex. This reaction operates with four-coordinate boron “ate” complexes while remaining inert to simple functional groups including boronic esters, and thereby enables efficient strategies for modular synthesis of complex molecules.

 Dielectric polymers used in electrical energy storage require a combination of key metrics, including a high dielectric constant (K), low loss and high breakdown strength (Eb), all while being capable of operating at high temperatures1–6. Decades of research into polymer–inorganic composites have achieved only limited success in reaching these goals5,7,8. Here we introduce high-temperature immiscible blends of two dipolar polymers that, through nanophase separation, self-assemble into three-dimensional all-polymer nanocomposites. The resulting nanostructures induce coiled-chain morphology and large conformation changes, which, combined with relatively low rotational barrier and high dipole moments of both polymers, yield ultrahigh dielectric responses (K > 13) while maintaining a low loss (tanδ approximately 0.002) across a wide temperature range. Simultaneously, the nanostructured interfaces act as barriers for mobile charges, markedly reducing conduction losses at high fields and temperatures. The all-polymer three-dimensional nanocomposites with concurrently high K, high Eb and low loss deliver unprecedented discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures (18.7 J cm−3, 15.1 J cm−3 and 8.6 J cm−3 at 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively). The approach is applicable to other immiscible dipolar blends, demonstrating its universality and tunability.

 The three-dimensional architecture of natural habitats is a key determinant of species biodiversity, harvestable biomass and resilience to disturbance1,2. Indeed, some species, including trees, corals and oysters, alter resource availability and modify biotic and abiotic pressures through their own three-dimensional structures—thereby enhancing their own survival3,4. However, which aspects of the three-dimensional architecture of these ecosystem engineers shape ecosystem dynamics and species survival are rarely examined by empirical studies, leaving much of the broader ecological and conservation impact of ecosystem engineering underexplored4–6. Here we show that oyster reefs have combinations of geometric variables that maximize recruit survival, which is a key factor influencing oyster reef growth and persistence. Using three-dimensional habitat designs that capture the full spectrum of natural oyster reef architectures, as well as a geometric theory7 that links habitat surface area, fractal dimension and height, we show that oyster settlement and survival are greatest at particular combinations of fractal dimension and height that minimize predation. Our study provides a template for understanding optimal three-dimensional habitat configurations for habitat restoration projects that are proliferating globally, without targeting key architectural features of habitat space that maximize restoration success8,9.

 Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (collectively IDRs) are found across all kingdoms of life and have critical roles in virtually every eukaryotic cellular process1. IDRs exist in a broad ensemble of structurally distinct conformations. This structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function2–4. Here we combine advances in physics-based force fields with the power of multi-modal generative deep learning to develop STARLING, a framework for rapid generation of accurate IDR ensembles and ensemble-aware representations from sequence. STARLING supports environmental conditioning across ionic strengths and demonstrates proof of concept for the interpolative ability of generative models beyond their training domain. Moreover, we enable ensemble refinement under experimental constraints using a Bayesian maximum-entropy reweighting scheme. Beyond ensemble characterization, STARLING sequence representations can be used in multiple ways. We showcase two examples: first, STARLING lets us perform ensemble-based search for ‘biophysical look-alikes’. Second, we demonstrate how these latent representations can be used to accelerate ensemble-first sequence design from weeks or hours per candidate to seconds, enabling library-scale designs. Together, STARLING dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties, complementing bioinformatic protein sequence analysis. We evaluate the accuracy of STARLING against extant experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function and aid the interpretation of experimental data.

However, the practical use of organic batteries has been severely hindered by the intrinsic insulation and dissolution of organic electrode materials9,10. Here we report practical organic batteries using an n-type conducting polymer cathode, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), which exhibits excellent mixed ionic and electronic transport and low solubility. The PBFDO cathode maintains its n-doped state throughout the electrochemical processes and exhibits stable and reversible redox characteristics, high electrical conductivities and significant lithium-ion diffusion coefficients, without the need for additional conductive additives. Consequently, ultrahigh-mass-loading polymer cathodes, with mass loadings up to 206 mg cm−2, are realized, delivering a high areal capacity of 42 mAh cm−2 and demonstrating robust cycling stability. Furthermore, practical 2.5 Ah lithium–organic pouch cells were fabricated, achieving an impressive energy density of 255 Wh kg−1.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is frequently associated with metastatic relapse, even at an early stage1. Here we assessed an individualized neoantigen mRNA vaccine in 14 patients with TNBC following surgery and after neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. In peripheral blood of nearly all patients, high-magnitude, vaccine-induced, mostly de novo T cell responses to multiple neoantigens were detected that remained functional for several years. Characterization of individual patients revealed that a large proportion of these T cells developed into two subsets: a late-differentiated phenotype with markers indicative of ‘ready-to-act’ cytotoxic effector T cells, and T cells with a stem cell-like memory phenotype. Eleven patients remained relapse-free for up to six years post-vaccination. Recurrence occurred in three patients: the individual with the weakest vaccine-induced T cell response relapsed, but achieved complete remission on subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy; another patient had a tumour with low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression with MHC class I-deficient cells growing out under vaccination; and the third patient was BRCA-positive and had a recurrence from a genetically distinct primary tumour. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of individualized RNA vaccines in TNBC, document persistence of vaccine-induced, functional neoantigen-specific T cells and provide insights into possible immune escape mechanisms that will guide future approaches. In a phase 1 trial, personalized mRNA vaccines tailored to individual tumour mutations in triple-negative breast cancer induced robust, long-lasting T cell responses and improved prognosis."

 The severity of malaria varies substantially between individuals, but the mechanisms that underlie these differences remain unclear. Because erythrocytes have a key role in malaria biology, genetic variants associated with the development of these cells could inform the mechanisms that determine disease severity. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis of the association of the variant rs112233623-T with erythrocyte properties, and examine its role in modulating malaria severity. This variant is associated with increased levels of haemoglobin A2, increased erythrocyte size and reduced erythrocyte number1,2. It is found in an erythroid enhancer of CCND3, which encodes cyclin D3—a cell-division activator that enhances the pentose phosphate pathway and thereby helps to counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS)3. We show that rs112233623-T disrupts a binding site for the transcription factor SMAD3, weakens enhancer activity and, in erythrocyte precursors (erythroblasts), is associated with reduced CCND3 expression and inhibition of the G1–S cell-cycle transition, concomitant with a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and an increase in their size. Using population genetic methods, we observe signatures of positive selection for rs112233623-T in the genetic history of Sardinia, a region in which malaria was once prevalent. Furthermore, we show that parasite growth is impaired in cultured Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes from rs112233623-T carriers, and that this impairment correlates with ROS levels. This mirrors our observations in erythrocytes from individuals who are deficient in the pentose-phosphate-pathway enzyme G6PD—a trait associated with protection against malaria in some settings—and highlights a common ROS-based mechanism of malaria resistance. Our results suggest that a reduction in CCND3 in erythroblasts constitutes a mechanism of resistance to malaria, and could enable therapeutic interventions. Population-level analyses and in vitro experiments show that a specific genetic variant of cyclin D3 inhibits the growth of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes, and suggest that its high frequency in Sardinia was driven by past endemic malaria."

 The brain displays the richest repertoire of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating mRNA translation1–11. Among these, alternative splicing has been shown to drive cell-type specificity and, when disrupted, is strongly linked to neurological disorders12–17. However, genome-wide measurements of mRNA translation with isoform sensitivity at single-cell resolution have not been achieved. To address this, we deployed Surveying Ribosomal Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling (Ribo-STAMP) coupled with short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing in the brain18. We generated the first isoform-sensitive single-cell translatomes of the mouse hippocampus at postnatal day 25, discovering cell-type-specific translation of 3,857 alternative transcripts across 1,641 genes and identifying isoforms of the same genes undergoing differential translation within and across 8 different cell types. We defined high and low translational states in CA1 and CA3 neurons, with synaptic and metabolic genes enriched in high states. We found that CA3 exhibited higher basal translation compared with CA1, as confirmed by metabolic labelling of newly synthesized proteins and immunohistochemistry of translational machinery components. This accessible platform will expand our understanding of how cell-type-specific and isoform-specific translation drives brain physiology and disease.

 Cytoplasmic dynein-1, a microtubule (MT)-based motor protein, requires dynactin and a coiled-coil adaptor to form the processive dynein–dynactin–adaptor (DDA) complex1,2. The roles of MTs and dynein regulator lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) in DDA assembly have remained elusive. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structural basis of MT- and LIS1-mediated DDA assembly. We show that an adaptor-independent dynein–dynactin complex spontaneously forms on MTs with an intrinsic 2:1 stoichiometry in a highly efficient manner, driven by parallel alignment of dynein tails upon MT binding. Adaptors can wedge into and exchange within the assembled MT-bound dynein–dynactin complex; these processes are enabled by relative rotations between dynein and dynactin and facilitated by the dynein light-intermediate chains that assist the adaptor ‘search’ mechanism. Although LIS1 is dispensable for efficient DD(A)–MT assembly, its presence expands the conformational landscape of DD(A) assemblies on MTs. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that LIS1 bridges dynactin p150glued and dynein in both the closed Phi-like and open prepowerstroke states, stabilizing low-MT-affinity intermediates that tether dynein molecules in proximity to MTs and prime them for subsequent DD(A) assembly through alternative pathways. These findings demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the dynein transport machinery and the coordinated roles of MTs and LIS1 in DDA assembly. Cryo-electron microscopy suggests a model in which microtubules, rather than adaptors in the cytoplasm, act as the primary platform for dynein–dynactin assembly, while LIS1 stabilizes low-microtubule-affinity intermediates near the pre-assembled complexes."

 Neurodevelopmental disorders that arise from de novo mutations in chromatin-remodelling genes lack targeted treatments. Snijders Blok–Campeau syndrome (SNIBCPS)1, which is caused by pathogenic variants in CHD3, manifests with intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviours and motor deficits2. Whether somatic gene correction can reverse such phenotypes in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that modelling the recurrent CHD3 variant p.R1025W in a humanized mouse model (Chd3hR1025W/+) recapitulates key features of SNIBCPS, including reduced CHD3 protein levels and abnormalities in social communication, cognition and motor coordination. We engineered a TadA-embedded adenine base editor (TeABE) and delivered it brain-wide using a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) system and achieved efficient on-target A•T-to-G•C correction across multiple cortical and hippocampal regions with minimal bystander activity. This intervention restored CHD3 levels and ameliorated behavioural abnormalities in vivo. Furthermore, intrathecal dual AAV delivery in nonhuman primates resulted in widespread neuronal transduction and efficient TeABE reconstitution, a result that supports its translational feasibility. These findings establish in vivo base editing as a viable therapeutic approach for CHD3-related neurodevelopmental disease. More broadly, they demonstrate that precise single-base correction in the postnatal brain can restore protein dosage and function, thereby offering a framework for the treatment of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders.

 The prevalence of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is rising globally, yet effective treatments remain limited1. Here we found that systemic or hepatocyte-specific ablation of the gene encoding glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (Gpnmb)—a top upregulated gene in MASH—protected mice from diet-induced MASH. Notably, MASH progression was driven specifically by the secreted GPNMB ectodomain (G-ECD), rather than full-length GPNMB. Serum G-ECD levels showed a strong positive correlation with MASH severity in human patients. Using an unbiased screen of a cell-surface-displayed transmembrane protein library, we identified related to receptor tyrosine kinase (RYK) as a functional receptor for G-ECD. Hepatocyte-specific Ryk ablation protected mice against MASH and abolished the pathogenic effects of G-ECD. Mechanistically, G-ECD binding to RYK activated ERK1/2 signaling, resulting in transcriptional activation of PPARγ-CD36 and SREBP1C pathways that promote hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis. Multiple therapeutic strategies targeting the GPNMB–RYK axis—including vaccination, short hairpin RNA, neutralizing antibody and N-acetylgalactosamine small interfering RNA—effectively prevented and treated MASH in preclinical models. Our findings identify the GPNMB–RYK axis as a new pathogenic ligand–receptor pathway and a promising therapeutic target for MASH.

 The central nervous system is surrounded by three interconnected membranes referred to as the meninges, which host a diverse immune network1–3. Within the skull-interfacing dura mater are venous sinuses, large veins that are traditionally viewed as passive blood drains for the brain and skull4,5. However, these structures also constitute an important neuroimmune interface6–8. Here we used intravital microscopy to gain mechanistic insight into this interface and reveal that dural sinuses and their endothelial cells form a highly dynamic surface that continually restructures to regulate blood flow, fluid movement and immune surveillance. We show that sinuses are not passive conduits, but instead undergo RAMP1-dependent constriction and dilation mediated by smooth muscle, resembling arterial behaviour. Moreover, the superior sagittal sinus in mice is bifurcated into upper and lower chambers that contribute to intracranial pressure regulation. Both chambers are lined by specialized, highly fenestrated sinus endothelial cells (SECs) that permit movement of fluids, macromolecules and microorganisms between the sinus lumen and leukocyte-rich perisinus space. To safeguard this permeable interface, SECs dynamically open and close intercellular boundaries in a RAMP2-dependent manner. Transcranial RAMP2 antagonism impaired SEC boundary dynamics and reduced immune cell trafficking along the sinus wall during homeostasis and systemic viral infection. Disruption of SEC dynamics during infection compromised local antiviral immunity and promoted pathogen entry into the meninges. Together, these findings establish dural sinuses as dynamic venous structures that regulate fluid exchange and support immune surveillance and antiviral defence. Microscopic imaging and biochemical studies show that sinuses in mouse and human form a highly dynamic surface that regulates fluid movement and immune cell surveillance via RAMP1-dependent regulation of smooth muscle contraction and RAMP2-dependent regulation of the sinus endothelial barrier."

 Long-term preservation of digital information is vital for safeguarding the knowledge of humanity for future generations. Existing archival storage solutions, such as magnetic tapes and hard disk drives, suffer from limited media lifespans that render them unsuitable for long-term data retention1–3. Optical storage approaches, particularly laser writing in robust media such as glass, have emerged as promising alternatives with the potential for increased longevity. Previous work4–16 has predominantly optimized individual aspects such as data density but has not demonstrated an end-to-end system, including writing, storing and retrieving information. Here we report an optical archival storage technology based on femtosecond laser direct writing in glass that addresses the practical demands of archival storage, which we call Silica. We achieve a data density of 1.59 Gbit mm−3 in 301 layers for a capacity of 4.8 TB in a 120 mm square, 2 mm thick piece of glass. The demonstrated write regimes enable a write throughput of 25.6 Mbit s−1 per beam, limited by the laser repetition rate, with an energy efficiency of 10.1 nJ per bit. Moreover, we extend the storage ability to borosilicate glass, offering a lower-cost medium and reduced writing and reading complexity. Accelerated ageing tests on written voxels in borosilicate suggest data lifetimes exceeding 10,000 years.

 Telecommunication systems are evolving towards ultrawide bandwidth and low latency, supporting wired and wireless links and their non-blocking interconnection1. However, a long-standing bandwidth mismatch between fibre communication and its wireless counterpart arises from fundamental disparities in signal architectures and hardware constraints2,3, which prevent high-speed and compatible transmission across the two domains. This challenge further complicates unified system design and hinders the realization of high-throughput-density, congestion-free fibre–wireless links under wideband-access scenarios4. Here we present an ultra-wideband (UWB) integrated photonics scheme that facilitates fibre–wireless communication over a shared-bandwidth infrastructure. Built on electro–optic (EO) and optic–electro (OE) conversions featuring 3-dB operational bandwidths exceeding 250 GHz and cross-architecture adaptability, our system demonstrates unprecedented data transmission capabilities in both wired and wireless links. Using the same set of devices and powered by the proposed complex bidirectional gated recurrent unit (complex-biGRU) algorithm, ultrahigh single-lane data rates of 512 Gbps for short-reach fibre and, for the first time to the authors’ knowledge, 400-Gbps high-speed wireless transmission have been achieved. Furthermore, high-density access is enabled by an all-optically assisted ultra-broadband wireless scheme. Real-time multichannel 8K video transmission is successfully demonstrated across 86 channels, seamlessly using a spectral range from 138 to 223 GHz.

 Cytopathology, often abbreviated as cytology, has a central role in the early detection of cancer, such as cervical, lung and bladder cancers, owing to its speed, simplicity and minimally invasive nature1–9. However, its effectiveness is limited by variability in diagnostic accuracy stemming from subjective visual interpretation10–21. Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems have been proposed to improve consistency22–26, none have achieved fully autonomous, clinical-grade performance.

 The question of whether large language models (LLMs) can exhibit moral capabilities is of growing interest and urgency, as these systems are deployed in sensitive roles such as companionship and medical advising, and will increasingly be tasked with making decisions and taking actions on behalf of humans. These trends require moving beyond evaluating for mere moral performance, the ability to produce morally appropriate outputs, to evaluating for moral competence, the ability to produce morally appropriate outputs based on morally relevant considerations. Assessing moral competence is critical for predicting future model behaviour, establishing appropriate public trust and justifying moral attributions. However, both the unique architectures of LLMs and the complexity of morality itself introduce fundamental challenges. Here we identify three such challenges: the facsimile problem, whereby models may imitate reasoning without genuine understanding; moral multidimensionality, whereby moral decisions are influenced by a range of context-sensitive relevant moral and non-moral considerations; and moral pluralism, which demands a new standard for globally deployed artificial intelligence. We provide a roadmap for tackling these challenges, advocating for a suite of adversarial and confirmatory evaluations that will enable us to work towards a more scientifically grounded understanding and, in turn, a more responsible attribution of moral competence to LLMs. This Perspective offers a roadmap for tackling the challenges of the facsimile problem, moral multidimensionality and moral pluralism in large language models."

 The cellular nucleotide pool is a major focal point of the host immune response to viral infection. Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool enable animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness1–5. Here we identify Clover, a bacterial anti-phage defence system that overcomes this trade-off by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of phage restriction by Clover in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal, p3diT (5′-triphosphothymidyl-3′5′-thymidine), that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defence and immune-mediated toxicity.

 Centromeres ensure accurate chromosome segregation, yet their DNA evolves rapidly across eukaryotes leaving the origins of new centromere architectures unclear1–4. The brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exemplifies this long-standing puzzle. Its centromeres shifted ancestrally from large, repeat-rich, epigenetically specified forms to the compact, genetically defined ‘point’ centromeres1,5. How this transition occurred has remained unresolved6. Here we identify evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres that provide a resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres. Proto-point centromeres contain a single centromeric nucleosome positioned over an AT-rich core, accompanied by relaxed organization and sequence variability of flanking cis-elements. In two species, these proto-point centromeres lie within retrotransposon-derived repeat clusters, linking ancestral repeat-rich centromeres to genetically encoded ones. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate that proto-point and point centromeres evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres. These results identify long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons, specifically Ty5 sequences, as the genetic substrate for point-centromere evolution and provide a mechanistic route by which an epigenetic centromere can become genetically specified. More broadly, they show how selfish elements can be co-opted to perform essential chromosomal functions. Evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres providing resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres are identified in yeast, and comparison shows they evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres and that long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons are the genetic substrate."

 Paternal care is rare among mammals and the neural mechanisms governing its emergence are poorly understood1. We leveraged the natural paternal behaviour of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)2,3, and integrated brain-wide cFos mapping, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, virally mediated gene perturbation and environmental manipulation to dissect the neural basis of natural variation in male parenting. Here we find that socio-environmental conditions drive individual variation in male alloparenting such that postweaning social isolation increases paternal care whereas social living in higher density groups increases infanticide. This natural variation in care corresponds to neural activity in the medial preoptic area and changes in correlated activity across brain regions. Within the medial preoptic area, expression of agouti signalling protein (Agouti) in neurons is increased by group housing and is negatively associated with care, and overexpression of Agouti reduces care and enhances infanticide in previously tolerant mice. Naturalistic manipulations further reveal that Agouti integrates long-term housing conditions rather than food availability or hunger. Our findings reveal that variation in male paternal care reflects context-dependent regulation of conserved hypothalamic and melanocortin signalling mechanisms rather than the presence or absence of paternal capacity. Expression of agouti signalling protein in neurons in the medial preoptic area is increased by group housing and negatively associated with care, and overexpression of Agouti reduces care and enhances infanticide in previously tolerant mice."

 Asgard archaea were pivotal in the origin of complex cellular life1. Heimdallarchaeia (a class within the phylum Asgardarchaeota) are inferred to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. Limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution2,3, including their role in eukaryogenesis. Here we use massive DNA sequencing of marine sediments to obtain 404 Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia and several novel lineages. Analyses of their global distribution revealed they are widespread in marine environments, and many are enriched in variably oxygenated coastal sediments. Detailed metabolic reconstructions and structural predictions suggest that Heimdallarchaeia form metabolic guilds that are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmark proteins of an aerobic lifestyle, including electron transport chain complex (IV), haem biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species detoxification. Heimdallarchaeia also encode novel clades of respiratory membrane-bound hydrogenases with additional Complex I-like subunits, which potentially increase proton-motive force generation and ATP synthesis. Thus, we propose an updated Heimdallarchaeia-centric model of eukaryogenesis in which hydrogen production and aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. This expanded catalogue of Asgard archaeal genomic diversity suggests that bioenergetic factors influenced eukaryogenesis and constitutes a valuable resource for investigations into the origins and evolution of cellular complexity.

 HIV-1 integrase (IN) promotes encapsulation of viral genomic RNA into mature viral cores, and this function is a target for ongoing antiretroviral drug development efforts1–3. Here we determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a primate lentiviral IN in a complex with RNA, revealing a linear filament made of IN octamer repeat units, each comprising a pair of asymmetric homotetramers. The assembly is stabilized through IN–RNA interactions involving mainly the IN C-terminal domains and RNA backbone. The spacing and orientation of the IN filament repeat units closely matched those of consecutive capsid (CA) hexamers within the mature CA lattice. Using cryo-EM images of native purified HIV-1 cores, we refined the structure of the IN filament as it propagates along the luminal side of the CA lattice. Each IN tetramer within the filament nestled in a CA hexamer, engaging closely with the major homology regions. Substitutions of residues involved in IN–CA contacts yielded eccentric virions with RNA nucleoids located outside of the cores. Collectively, our results establish the structural basis for the HIV-1 IN–RNA interaction and reveal that IN forms an RNA-binding module on the luminal side of the mature CA lattice.

 Feed algorithms are widely suspected to influence political attitudes. However, previous evidence from switching off the algorithm on Meta platforms found no political effects1. Here we present results from a 2023 field experiment on Elon Musk’s platform X shedding light on this puzzle. We assigned active US-based users randomly to either an algorithmic or a chronological feed for 7 weeks, measuring political attitudes and online behaviour. Switching from a chronological to an algorithmic feed increased engagement and shifted political opinion towards more conservative positions, particularly regarding policy priorities, perceptions of criminal investigations into Donald Trump and views on the war in Ukraine. In contrast, switching from the algorithmic to the chronological feed had no comparable effects. Neither switching the algorithm on nor switching it off significantly affected affective polarization or self-reported partisanship. To investigate the mechanism, we analysed users’ feed content and behaviour. We found that the algorithm promotes conservative content and demotes posts by traditional media. Exposure to algorithmic content leads users to follow conservative political activist accounts, which they continue to follow even after switching off the algorithm, helping explain the asymmetry in effects. These results suggest that initial exposure to X’s algorithm has persistent effects on users’ current political attitudes and account-following behaviour, even in the absence of a detectable effect on partisanship. Among users initially on a chronological feed, 7 weeks of exposure to X’s algorithmic feed in 2023 shifted political attitudes and account-following behaviour in a more conservative direction compared with those remaining on a chronological feed, whereas switching the feed setting in the opposite direction, from algorithmic to chronological, had no effect."

 Rare diseases affect more than 300 million people worldwide1–3, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains an urgent challenge1,3–5. Patients often endure a prolonged ‘diagnostic odyssey’ exceeding 5 years, marked by repeated referrals, misdiagnoses and unnecessary interventions, leading to delayed treatment and substantial emotional and economic burden4,5. Here we present DeepRare—a multi-agent system for rare disease differential diagnosis decision support6–8 powered by large language models, integrating more than 40 specialized tools and up-to-date knowledge sources. DeepRare processes heterogeneous clinical inputs, including free-text descriptions, structured human phenotype ontology terms and genetic testing results to generate ranked diagnostic hypotheses with transparent reasoning linked to verifiable medical evidence. Evaluated across nine datasets from literature, case reports and clinical centres across Asia, North America and Europe spanning 14 medical specialties, DeepRare demonstrates exceptional performance on 2,919 diseases. In human-phenotype-ontology-based tasks, it achieves an average Recall@1 of 57.18%, outperforming the next best method by 23.79%; in multi-modal tests, it reaches 69.1% compared with Exomiser’s 55.9% on 168 cases.

 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of healthcare- and antibiotic-associated infection and has a 30% recurrence rate1–5. Previous vaccine strategies against CDI failed to reduce pathogen burden, a prerequisite for preventing C. difficile transmission and recurrence6–11. These vaccines were administered parenterally, which induced a systemic immune response, rather than a mucosal response in the colon, the site of infection. Here we compare protection and colonization burden between mucosal (rectal) and parenteral (intraperitoneal) administration routes of a multivalent, adjuvanted vaccine combining inactivated C. difficile toxins and novel surface antigens. We found that mucosal immunization, but not parenteral, clears C. difficile from the host. Unique correlates of decolonization included faecal IgG responses to vegetative surface antigens and a colonic, T helper type 17 (TH17)-skewed tissue-resident memory T cell response against spore antigen. Importantly, mucosal vaccination protected against morbidity, mortality, tissue damage and recurrence. Our results demarcate notable differences in correlates of protection and pathogen clearance between vaccine administration routes and highlight a mucosal immunization regimen that elicits sterilizing immunity against CDI.

 Acral melanoma, which is not ultraviolet-associated, is the type of melanoma reported most commonly in several non-European-descent populations1–3, including in Mexican people4. Latin American samples are substantially under-represented in global cancer genomics studies5, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures6–8. To address this, we characterized the genome and transcriptome of 123 acral melanoma tumours from 92 Mexican patients—a population notable because of its genetic admixture9. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. Although most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations. The tumours with activating BRAF mutations had a transcriptional profile more similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, indicating that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared with other tumours arising in these locations. Transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with recurrence-free and overall survival. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.

 In the past decade, moiré materials have revolutionized how we engineer and control quantum phases of matter1,2. They are versatile platforms for strongly correlated electronic phenomena3,4 and support new ferroelectric5,6, magnetic7 and superconducting states8. Among incommensurate materials9, moiré materials are aperiodic composite crystals10,11 whose long-wavelength superlattices enable tunable properties without chemically modifying their layers. So far, nearly all reports of moiré materials have investigated van der Waals heterostructures assembled far from thermodynamic equilibrium (T < 150 °C)1,2. Here we introduce a conceptually new approach to synthesizing high-mobility moiré materials in thermodynamic equilibrium. We report a new family of foliated superlattice materials (Sr6TaS8)1+δ(TaS2)8 that are exfoliatable, incommensurate-lattice, van der Waals crystals. Lattice mismatches between alternating layers generate moiré superlattices, analogous to 2D moiré heterobilayer superlattices, which are coherent throughout these crystals and tunable through synthesis conditions without altering their chemical composition. Quantum oscillation measurements map the complex Fermiology of these moiré metals12–14, showing that the Fermi surface of the structurally simplest moiré metal comprises more than 40 distinct cross-sectional areas. This is naturally understood by proposing that these bulk moiré metals encode electronic properties of higher-dimensional superspace crystals in ways paralleling well-established crystallographic methods for incommensurate lattices15,16. More broadly, our work demonstrates a scalable synthesis approach potentially capable of producing large-area moiré materials for electronics applications and evidences a new material design concept for accessing phenomena proposed in higher dimensions17–21.

 Colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PeNC) has long been synthesized using the hot-injection method and room-temperature ligand-assisted reprecipitation as the prominent techniques1,2. However, both methods have challenges for industrial-scale production3–5: the hot-injection method requires high temperatures, an inert gas environment and rapid cooling, which raise safety concerns, whereas ligand-assisted reprecipitation can exhibit limited productivity on scale-up. Here we present a cold-injection method based on pseudo-emulsion, enabling scalable synthesis of PeNCs with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, ~100%) and enhanced stability by injecting precursor solution below 4 °C. In the cold-injection method, PeNCs grow through the assembly of fully coordinated plumbates out of the pseudo-emulsion with the assistance of a demulsifier. We discovered that slow assembly of polybromide plumbates, assisted by cold temperature, is essential for defect suppression, resulting in reproducible, stable and pure-green-emitting PeNCs with near-unity PLQY. Furthermore, this method enables efficient large-scale production, achieving 20-l-scale synthesis with remarkable batch weight while maintaining near-unity PLQY. Our findings represent a substantial advancement in synthesis of high-quality PeNCs, offering potential for broad applications in display and lighting industries.

 Cancer cells activate the integrated stress response (ISR) to adapt to stress and resist therapy1. ISR signals converge on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which controls cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs that are involved in metabolic adaptation, survival and growth2,3. However, whether the ISR–ATF4 axis influences anti-tumour immune responses remains mostly unknown. Here we show that loss of ATF4 decreases tumour progression considerably in immunocompetent mice, but not in immunocompromised ones, by enhancing T cell-dependent anti-cancer immune responses. An unbiased genetic screen of ATF4-regulated genes identifies lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as the principal ATF4-dependent effector that impairs anti-tumour immunity by favouring infiltration with immunosuppressive interstitial macrophages. Furthermore, we find that LCN2 promotes T cell exclusion and immune evasion in preclinical mouse models, and correlates with decreased T cell infiltration in patients with lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Anti-LCN2 antibodies promote robust anti-tumour T cell responses in mouse models of aggressive solid tumours. Our study shows that the ATF4–LCN2 axis has a cell-extrinsic role in suppressing anti-cancer immunity, and could pave the way for an immunotherapy approach that targets LCN2. The transcription factor ATF4 and its effector lipocalin 2 (LCN2) have a key role in immune evasion and tumour progression, and targeting the ATF4–LCN2 axis might provide a way to treat several types of solid tumour by increasing anti-cancer immunity."

Here, the authors use intravital imaging to show that pyrimidinergic calcium signaling links tubular injury to fibroblast activation, and that blocking this pathway reduces fibrosis 
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem, with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. Fibrosis is the final common pathway of organ damage in CKD, so understanding how this arises during kidney injury is critical for building a holistic picture of the pathogenesis. Here, using gene expression data, intravital microscopy in mice and realistic cell models, we uncover evidence of a signaling pathway linking tubular pyrimidine metabolism and injury-evoked extracellular uridine diphosphate (UDP) release to activation of the P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6R) in surrounding fibroblasts. We show that P2Y6R activation triggers intracellular calcium rises, which stimulate fibroblast proliferation, migration, and conversion towards a myofibroblast phenotype. Conversely, genetic knockout or pharmacological blockade of the P2Y6R reduces fibrosis in mice with CKD. Thus, we reveal that pyrimidinergic calcium signaling couples fibroblast responses to changes in tubular metabolism in disease states, and represents a potential new target for therapeutic intervention.

The authors trap its ceramide-bound and drugbound states, revealing the catalytic and drug-inhibition mechanisms, providing basis for antifungal drug development. 
 Fungal inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase is an essential enzyme complex that catalyzes a critical step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. It is the molecular target of potent antifungal aureobasidin A (AbA). Despite its therapeutic relevance, the lack of structural and mechanistic insights into IPC synthase function and inhibition has impeded rational antifungal drug development. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IPC synthase in two distinct functional states: a ceramide-bound form and an AbA-inhibited complex. Our study reveals a conserved heterodimeric architecture formed by Aur1 and Kei1, stabilized through extensive protein-protein and lipid-mediated interactions. Within catalytic Aur1, we identify a membrane-embedded reaction chamber harboring a conserved H-H-D catalytic triad (H255, H294, and D298) essential for IPC synthesis. Structural comparisons illuminate the mechanism of ceramide recognition and reveal how AbA acts as a competitive inhibitor by occupying the substrate-binding pocket. Further analyses identify key residues involved in AbA binding and explain the molecular basis of drug resistance. Together, these findings advance the mechanistic understanding of fungal IPC biosynthesis and inhibition, and establish a foundation for developing new antifungal drugs targeting IPC synthase.

 The compact CRISPR-Cas12f system is promising for AAV-delivered gene therapy, but its application has been constrained by restrictive PAM recognition (e.g., TTTR) and suboptimal editing efficiency. Through bacterial library screening and mammalian cell validation, we engineer evoCas12f, an optimized variant incorporating five key mutations, that dramatically expands PAM recognition to NTNR/NYTR. This advancement reduces median distance between two neighbouring PAM sites to 2 nucleotides in the human genome. It also demonstrates 1.4-fold enhanced activity at TTTR sites compared to wild-type Un1Cas12f1, achieving up to 91% editing efficiency. Remarkably, evoCas12f enables efficient generation of homozygous mutations in F0 generation mice, even at non-canonical PAM sites. We further adapt this system for robust transcriptional activation and precise base editing with a well-defined editing window. As a compact yet highly efficient platform, evoCas12f represents a significant advance in CRISPR technology, enabling multiplexed editing for high-resolution targeting applications and expanding possibilities for therapeutic genome engineering.

 The physics of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has long been a subject of significant research interest. Long-range magnetic order in the strict two-dimensional limit, whose discovery circumvented the Mermin-Wagner theorem, has rapidly emerged as a research focus. However, the demonstration of a non-trivial topological spin textures in two-dimensional limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the out-of-plane electric field breaks inversion symmetry while simultaneously modulating the electronic band structure, enabling electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction for creation and manipulation of topological spin textures in monolayer CrI3. The realization of ideal two-dimensional topological spin textures may offer not only an experimental testbed for probing the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless mechanism, but also potential insights into unresolved quantum phenomena including superconductivity and superfluidity. Moreover, voltage-controlled spin-orbit interaction offers a novel pathway to engineer two-dimensional spin textures with tailored symmetries and topologies, while opening avenues for skyrmion-based next-generation information technologies.

 We have recently demonstrated the ability of using self-driving laboratories for AI-driven searches of organic emitters for solid-state lasing devices. Our past workflow featured solubility challenges for such large molecular moieties. In this next-generation study, we return to the drawing board to explore a family of compounds that are much solution processable and composed of a set of electronic cores that provide a broader color response. Out of 252 potential candidates, and with guidance from DFT calculations, we selectively perform a comprehensive study exploring 51 fluorene-based A-B-A-type organic laser oligomers, armed with our self-driving lab. The candidates range from simple hydrocarbon molecules to complex heteroatom-mixed molecules. As a result of this study, we highlight diketopyrrolopyrrole and benzodiazole derivatives for their largely red-shifted emissions. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of color change arising from heteroatom permutation, fluorine addition, thiophene coupling, and a combination of fluorine addition and thiophene coupling. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) measurements in the solid state further corroborate the lasing potential of selected candidates, reinforcing their suitability for future device applications. The computational study with density functional theory confirms the experimental results. Organic lasers, known for their colour purity, are emerging as next-generation light emitters.

 Classical electromagnetism forms the foundation of modern technology. In condensed matter systems, the Berry phase acquired by conduction electrons acts as an emergent electromagnetic field, facilitating phenomena analogous to classical electromagnetism, such as the Lorentz force and electromagnetic induction, and paving the way for next-generation spintronics. Magnetic skyrmions, spin vortices with non-trivial topology, serve as a key platform for such devices. For example, non-trivial transport responses are recognised as being induced by the emergent Lorentz force and the emergent electromagnetic induction. Despite remarkable progress in skyrmion physics, emergent reactance, in which the phase of an applied AC current is modified by emergent electromagnetism, has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report emergent reactance in a micro-fabricated device of the prototypical skyrmion-hosting material, MnSi. Our findings reveal that the internal deformation degrees of freedom in skyrmions are an important factor for efficient generation of the emergent reactance. From lock-in transport measurements of a skyrmion lattice in MnSi, the authors find a delay in the voltage response of the Hall effect and resistivity, arguing that its deformation leads to inertial skyrmion lattice dynamics and emergent reactance."

 The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is a computationally challenging decision problem central to many industrial applications. For SAT problems in cryptanalysis, circuit design, and telecommunication, solutions can often be found more efficiently by representing them with a combination of exclusive OR (XOR) and conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses. We propose a hardware accelerator architecture that natively embeds and solves such hybrid XOR–CNF problems using in-memory computing hardware. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm and demonstrate, both experimentally and through simulations, how it can be efficiently implemented with memristor crossbar arrays. Compared to the conventional approaches that translate XOR–CNF problems to pure CNF problems, our simulations show that the accelerator improves computation speed, energy efficiency, and chip area utilization of in-memory accelerators by  ~ 10 × for a set of hard cryptographic benchmarking problems. Moreover, the accelerator achieves a  ~ 10 × speedup and a  ~ 1000 × gain in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art SAT solvers running on CPUs.

 Phyllosphere microbiomes are crucial for maintaining plant growth and health, but their responses to global change remain largely unclear. Based on a precipitation gradient and N addition experiment in a semiarid grassland on the Mongolian Plateau, this study explored phyllosphere microbial diversity and stability. Across the two host plant species (Artemisia frigida, Leymus chinensis), decreased precipitation altered phyllosphere microbial community composition only. Increased precipitation reduced bacterial diversity and affected bacterial and fungal community composition. However, N addition significantly decreased bacterial, fungal, and protistan diversity, altered their community composition, and weakened phyllosphere microbiome network complexity and stability in both host plant species, suggesting that N addition had a stronger influence on phyllosphere microbial communities than changing precipitation. Our findings of strong sensitivity of phyllosphere microbial diversity and stability to N enrichment provide mechanistic understanding of changes in phyllosphere microbiomes and consequent plant growth and productivity under future global change scenarios.

 A view that tidewater glacier fronts are important feeding grounds for marine predators is becoming widespread, although there is little direct evidence of their foraging activities and diet in these areas. Here, we conducted a spatial analysis of the stomach contents of ringed seals to investigate their diet and its relationship with glacier fronts, making the most of the unique opportunity provided by Inuit hunting, which allows obtaining stomachs with hunted locations. Our results showed that seals captured near glacier fronts consumed more prey than those captured farther away, particularly feeding on polar cod. Furthermore, the prey composition varied among capture locations, suggesting varied foraging strategies reflecting prey availability. Our study indicates that seals feed intensively at glacier fronts, emphasizing the potential for recent climate-induced glacier retreat to deprive seals of key foraging grounds, leading to changes in their behavior, diet, and habitat use.

Here, we identify an electrically responsive yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)/phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3)/neuropilin-1 (NRP1) signaling axis in sensory neurons. Electrical stimulation enhances YAP1-pSTAT3 interaction, promotes pSTAT3 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, and up-regulates NRP1 to support growth of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)–positive sensory fibers. Guided by these findings, we engineered a bifunctional piezoelectric patch composed of poly(vinylidene difluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] and regenerated silk fibroin@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (RSF@P:P), coupling mechanically induced electrical cues with dynamic lubrication. Under ultrasound activation, the P(VDF-TrFE) layer generates localized electrical signals that facilitate sensory-nerve and vascular ingrowth, while the RSF@P:P layer undergoes piezoelectric-triggered gel-sol transition to form a low-friction interface and reduce adhesion.

Certain tumors remain addicted to aneuploidy. Paradoxically, artificially induced aneuploidy in normal cells elicits cellular stresses and decreases cell fitness. How aneuploidy initially emerges during tumorigenesis is thus unclear. Using human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a model, we show that aneuploid ESCs form immature teratomas with an enrichment of mesenchymal tissues. Specifically, chromosome 8 (chr8) gain, a prevalent form of aneuploidy in human cancers, promotes the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in teratomas and MSC proliferation in vitro. We further show that human embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, tumors of mesenchymal origin, lack dominant driver mutations but frequently harbor chr8 gain. Our study suggests a plausible mechanism for aneuploidy emergence during tumorigenesis, links specific aneuploidy to the mesenchymal lineage, and paves the way for identifying vulnerabilities of aneuploid MSCs, which may have important roles in tumorigenesis."

Unfortunately, two-dimensional (2D) histopathology—the gold standard for pathological understanding of many liver diseases—can misrepresent or leave gaps in our understanding of complex 3D structural features. Here, we used immunostaining, tissue clearing, microscopy, and computational software to create 3D multilobular reconstructions of both nonfibrotic and cirrhotic human liver tissue. We found that spatial architecture in human cirrhotic liver samples with varying etiologies had sinusoid zonal dysregulation, reduction in glutamine synthetase–expressing pericentral hepatocytes, regression of central vein networks, disruption of hepatic arterial networks, and fragmentation of biliary networks, which together suggest a pro-portalization/decentralization phenotype in cirrhotic tissue. Further implementation of 3D pathological analyses may provide a deeper understanding of cirrhotic pathobiology and inspire treatments for liver disease."

In walled organisms like plants, division plane orientation irreversibly defines tissue topology and is tightly regulated. While divisions often follow the shortest path enclosing cell volume, certain cells deviate, dividing perpendicular to the growth axis. Tissue-scale mechanical stress has been proposed to guide such orientation, but how these cues are integrated remains unclear. Here, we reexamine the role of the actin cytoskeleton in orienting cell division inArabidopsisroot epidermis. Combining cell biology, genetics, pharmacological treatments, 3D segmentation, and modeling, we show that actin is a central molecular actor required to establish cell division orientation against the geometrical rules, highlighting its role in integrating spatial information."

Here, we identify an exonuclease REXO4, which collaborates with RNaseH1 endonuclease to degrade R-loops in an “endo/exo-cleavage coupling” manner. Specifically, REXO4 directly degrades the RNA strand in R-loops from the end or internal nick through its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and stimulates RNaseH1 endonuclease activity. The genome-wide R-loop regions regulated by REXO4 highly overlap with those regulated by RNaseH1, and REXO4 overexpression counteracts genome-wide R-loop accumulation caused by RNaseH1 deficiency. Furthermore, REXO4-deficient tumors display elevated R-loop mutation burden, and tumor patient-derived mutations in REXO4 enzymatic region all impair R-loop cleavage activity. Besides, we identify a compound 17 (named REXO4-IN-17) capable of inhibiting REXO4 nuclease activity. Interfering with REXO4 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating and G4 stabilizing chemotherapeutic drugs and activates cGAS-mediated antitumor immunity. Therefore, our study proposes an endo/exo-cleavage coupling the R-loop processing model, which provides additional insights into the link between R-loop–associated genome instability, antitumor immunity, and tumors."

Existing solutions use active and multiple mechanisms for environmental interaction; however, such designs face sealing challenges at small scales and are often complex and unreliable. Here, we present an inertia-driven actuation strategy combining a variable-output voice coil motor (VCM) with a fully sealed rigid shell. By modulating the VCM output, the robot achieves jumping, full-stroke vibration for terrestrial locomotion and small-stroke vibration for aquatic propulsion. Terrestrial tests demonstrate rapid motion on granular media, continuous jumping, and load carrying. The robot also uses passive tilted fins that convert reciprocating motion into steerable aquatic thrust, realizing an inertia-driven multidirectional propulsion mechanism. Thrust generation and frequency-dependent propulsion were analyzed through aquatic experiments, high-speed particle image velocimetry, and simulations.

In this study, we generated region-specific brain organoids (cortical, striatal, and midbrain), each integrated with human microglia, to fill this critical gap. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABABreceptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism. Using chemogenetics to activate this midbrain-striatal circuit, we observed increased calcium signaling in microglia involving GABABreceptors. Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring anSCN2Anonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Microglia displayed heightened calcium responses toSCN2Amutation–mediated neuronal hyperactivity and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed not only by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABABreceptors but also by knockout of theGABBR1gene in microglia. Collectively, our findings establish an advanced platform that can be used to dissect human neuroimmune interactions in subcortical regions and to evaluate previously undiscovered therapies, highlighting the important role of microglia in shaping critical circuitry related to neuropsychiatric disorders."

Here, we demonstrate that scanning tunneling microscopy–induced luminescence enables real-space reconstruction of amplitude and phase of delocalized excitonic states in molecular chains. Through subnanometer-resolved photon imaging of linear molecular chains, coherent purely excitonic (0–0) emission patterns reveal the wave function’s relative phases, while incoherent vibronic (0–1) emission maps the squared wave function amplitudes. This near-field technique enables the reconstruction of wave functions for both bright superradiant states and optically dark subradiant states inaccessible by conventional far-field optics. Furthermore, the submolecular resolution of the vibronic maps allows for the contributions of different vibrational symmetries, namely, Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller modes, to be distinguished. Our findings establish a unique approach for the excitonic wave function reconstruction and open a route for exploring exciton dynamics and interactions in molecular systems."

Here, we used computed tomography imaging to quantify the dimensions and distribution of liquefaction structures in ≤17.5–thousand-year-old tephra layers in 18 lakes scattered across the poorly expressed Hamilton Basin fault system in northern New Zealand. These “tephra seismites,” embedded in unconsolidated, organic-bearing lake sediment, increase in occurrence and dimensions toward known faults and indicate the occurrence of a local hidden fault segment. Through incorporating peak ground acceleration modeling, we found that the spatial distribution of tephra seismites directly relates to the ground shaking induced by near-field fault ruptures. We used the variability in tephra seismites within the stratigraphic record and tephrochronology to better constrain the recurrence intervals and magnitudes of paleoearthquakes from both the Hamilton Basin and adjacent Hauraki Basin fault systems. Our methodology is globally applicable in volcanic and tectonic regions where liquefaction structures are preserved among (hidden) faults."

Yet, several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock in. Here, we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the “marginal majority effect”: a discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of a marginal majority effect in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in."

Despite its central role, basal complex biogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we use expansion microscopy and DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography to investigate three transmembrane basal complex proteins inPlasmodium falciparum—basal complex transmembrane protein 1 (BTP1), BTP2, and basolateral expansion boundary (BLEB). Parasites lacking BTP2 are still enveloped by membranes but fail to separate from each other, resulting in multiorganellar mutants. We isolate the defect to a specific step during basal complex development and demonstrate that the contractile ability remains intact. By revisiting BLEB, we identify a distinct plasma membrane region that is excluded from daughter cells and associated with the basal complex. Integrating these findings, we propose a three-step model for basal complex biogenesis that highlights the specific role of BTP2 and suggests a role for the BLEB-associated membrane. This study offers a mechanistic framework for how multiple daughter cells are formed simultaneously and highlights the importance of transmembrane proteins for cell division."

Reduced optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein levels were noted inOpa1V291D/+mice, accompanied by decreased protein stability. Moreover, mitochondrial function was compromised, as indicated by reduced Complex I activity, increased oxidative stress, and diminished adenosine triphosphate production in the retinas ofOpa1V291D/+mice. Spatial metabolomics revealed energy deficits in the inner retina and heightened glycolysis in the outer retina. Immunostaining showed decreased expression of glycolytic proteins in the ganglion cell layer. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing disclosed significant down-regulation of energy-production genes in RGCs, while other retinal cell types remained unaffected. These findings emphasize the specific vulnerability of RGCs to bioenergetic crises, connecting disrupted energy homeostasis to their degeneration. By increasing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/reduced form of NAD+(NADH) redox ratio through the overexpression of mitochondrial-targetedLactobacillus brevisNADH oxidase (MitoLbNOX) in RGCs, we demonstrated improved RGC function and survival through enhanced energy metabolism and reduced oxidative stress.

How these shifts combine to alter higher-level ecological processes within food webs can have important implications for entire ecosystems.

We combine long-term data from ~15,000 freshwater and marine fish communities (1949–2019) with information about their size, diets, and trophic status to evaluate how food webs change through time at local spatial scale. We found that selective species turnover driven by body size reductions is associated with widespread alteration to fish food web topology and function, including increased connectance and generalism, leading to higher predation pressure and increased prey vulnerability. Food webs were also less modular. These changes extend across food web trophic structures, causing a cascading shift in the proportion of species across trophic levels.

By encoding conformational signals within polythymidine loops (0 to 40 nucleotides), this system executes loop-dependent logic operations with expanded signaling ranges. Moreover, catalytic allosteric hairpin assemblies achieve ~30-fold signal amplification with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Concurrently, allosteric DNA neural networks discriminate conformational signals based on loop lengths (7 to 15 nucleotides) at two-nucleotide resolution.

It was collected over a period of 3.5 years and facilitated by a camera-based approach. This open-access resource assists scientists in evaluating and refining existing models, improving process understanding, and training artificial intelligence. 
 Although process-based soil erosion models are valuable tools for predicting and managing soil erosion, their limitations arise from constraints in integrating novel data possibilities, uncertainties in parameterisation, and the difficulties in integrating different process scales and their transitions. This study presents a unpresented approach to enhance soil erosion modelling through the utilisation of nested high-resolution spatio-temporal data obtained through structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. This technique permits comprehensive observation of soil surface elevation changes during precipitation events, encompassing data acquisition at diverse scales, from plot to slope to micro-catchment. The study presents a unique dataset (Epple et al., 2026, https://doi.org/10.25532/OPARA-1038)  that integrates high-resolution time-lapse photogrammetry, field measurements, and UAV (uncrewed aerial vehicle) photogrammetric data, collected over nearly four years. This dataset is intended to enhance the understanding of soil erosion processes and serve as a valuable resource for model evaluation and calibration. The authors encourage the broader scientific community to utilise and expand this dataset, which is expected to contribute to the development of more accurate soil erosion models, thereby improving predictions and management strategies."

This study provides a laboratory dataset describing the performance of tipping-bucket rain gauges using manual and automated calibration methods. The openly available data support comparison of calibration approaches and improvement of rainfall observations. 
 Reliable calibration data are essential for ensuring the accuracy and traceability of precipitation measurements obtained from tipping-bucket rain gauges (TBRGs), which are widely used in hydrological and meteorological monitoring networks. Although manual burette-based calibration remains the most commonly applied approach, its reproducibility is often limited by operator dependency and changes in discharge conditions during experiments. Automated calibration devices have been developed to address these limitations, yet publicly available benchmark datasets that allow transparent comparison between manual and automated calibration methods remain scarce."

However, comparisons between species are complicated by varying testing conditions, which can limit the application to derivation of environmental quality guidelines. Furthermore, few studies have reported 6PPDQ tissue concentrations in fish with known exposure concentrations. Using standard methods with flow-through exposures to provide stable 6PPDQ concentrations, we compared time courses of mortality in three sensitive salmonid species (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss), evaluated the potential for latent (delayed) mortality, and measured tissue concentrations in both fish that died during exposure and those that survived an additional 7 days in clean water. Further experiments documented insensitivity in two centrarchids (smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and largemouth bass Micropterus nigricans). Our study provided evidence for two mortality time courses: one in which nearly all mortality occurs in the first 24 h and one in which mortalities continue to accumulate throughout the exposure, and 96-h and 24-h LC50s are quite different. We did not observe evidence for the delayed onset of mortality due to 6PPDQ exposure. Most fish that survived exposure had undetectable 6PPDQ concentrations after 1 week in clean water, potentially informing biomonitoring strategies for wild populations."

However, their response mechanisms to environmental heterogeneity remain unclear, as traditional experiments or models typically overlook the complexity of cross-kingdom microbial networks. To address this, we established a cross-scale framework that integrates controlled mesocosm experiments with field lake surveys across trophic gradients. Using multilevel network analysis, we found that increased environmental heterogeneity promoted stochastic assembly and niche differentiation within phyllosphere communities. This enhanced the functional metabolic complementarity of algal–bacterial networks, thereby strengthening the ecosystem resilience. These findings challenge the traditional view that homogeneous environments favor microbial functional redundancy. Notably, machine learning models trained on experimental data showed high predictive accuracy but exhibited systematic biases when applied to natural lakes, highlighting the scale-dependent complexity of in situ microbial networks. Our study identifies heterogeneity-driven microbial insurance as a critical stabilizing mechanism and advocates for incorporating this ecological complexity into cross-scale restoration strategies."

The triboelectric effect, a ubiquitous phenomenon resulting from interfacial charge transfer during contact-separation of materials, is hypothesized to efficiently convert mechanical energy into electricity. Here, we demonstrate that liquid–solid friction can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, thereby supporting autotrophic microbial growth and metabolism without relying on conventional sunlight or chemical energy inputs. Using electroactive Rhodopseudomonas palustris and dielectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a model biohybrid system, we found that mechanical vibration primarily induces triboelectric charge transfer at the water-PVDF interface, leading to free electron accumulation on the PVDF surface. These electrons are subsequently taken up by R. palustris for carbon fixation and denitrification, resulting in an increase in biomass from ca. 2.79 ± 0.25 to 6.27 ± 0.31 mg of protein/L over 30 days. This phenomenon was further observed across various dielectric materials and electroactive bacterial strains, suggesting a potentially universal mechanical-force-driven process for microbial communities. Our findings reveal a novel role of mechanical force via the triboelectric effect as an energy source for driving microbial growth and metabolism, which enhances our understanding of the interactions between mechanical forces and biological systems."

However, their relative contributions to shaping the antibiotic resistome in treatment systems remain unclear. In this study, we simulated an aerobic activated sludge process treating livestock wastewater containing enrofloxacin and heavy metals (Cu2+ and Zn2+) to evaluate the development of antibiotic resistance using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. We observed a diverse and transcriptionally active resistome with over half of the detected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) showing expression. ARG profiles under coexposure to enrofloxacin and heavy metals more closely resembled those under heavy metal exposure alone than those under enrofloxacin exposure alone. Zn2+ exposure resulted in the highest absolute ARG abundance, nearly double that of the control group. Both enrofloxacin and heavy metals significantly altered the abundance and phylogenetic composition of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). The exposure to Zn2+ enhanced the relative abundance and expression level of both metal resistance genes (MRGs)-carrying ARB and the ARGs-carrying plasmids. Phylogenetic analysis of ARG flanking sequences revealed high homology across various genetic contexts. Among mobile genetic elements, plasmids had a greater influence on ARG profiles than did phages or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Transcriptional profiles of microbial physiological adaptations suggested that modulation of cell membrane permeability, promotion of conjugative transfer, and formation of biofilm might play roles in enhancing antibiotic resistance. These findings suggest at environmentally relevant concentrations, heavy metals such as Zn2+ may present a stronger selective pressure than enrofloxacin for the propagation of antibiotic resistance in aerobic activated sludge process treating livestock wastewater."

However, their physicochemical diversity complicates the prediction of environmental fate and toxicity. To elucidate the main drivers of their toxicity in aquatic organisms, we investigated ten structurally diverse monomeric acrylamides and methacrylamides in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) (ZFE). Acute toxicity varied over 2 orders of magnitude (0.16–33 mM) and showed a moderate correlation with hydrophobicity (logKlipw, R2 = 0.87) and intrinsic electrophilic reactivity (logkGSH). Measured bioconcentration factors of highly polar, reactive compounds (e.g., NMBA) for ZFE deviated up to 16-fold from model predictions, indicating limited uptake or significant biotransformation. This indicates an impact of toxicokinetics on their in vivo toxicity. UPLC-HRMS-based nontarget screening revealed 90 transformation products across the ten compounds. Glutathione conjugation and mercapturic acid formation were dominant pathways, with mercapturic acid-taurine conjugates observed for eight compounds, suggesting a previously undescribed detoxification mechanism for (meth)acrylamides in the ZFE. Our results highlight the need to integrate toxicokinetic data into hazard assessment of electrophilic compounds, as in vitro assays may overestimate risks. The ZFE provides a mechanistically informative in vivo model to reduce misclassifications, especially for polar and reactive chemicals."

However, insufficient analysis of influent toxicity and its city-level socioeconomic drivers has limited the development of effective wastewater management and treatment strategies. Here, we hypothesize that city-level socioeconomic conditions influence whole wastewater toxicity through specific molecular mediators, and we test this hypothesis using large-scale data from 100 WWTPs across China. The results indicated that cities with higher gross domestic product, greater population density, and more intensive industrial activity tend to produce influent with significantly higher toxicity (p < 0.05, generalized additive models). Mechanistically, this elevated toxicity was mediated by distinct molecular features, as CHO-class specific toxic precursors (R2 = 0.84), particularly unsaturated hydrocarbon–, condensed hydrocarbon–, and amino sugar–like compounds, were identified as the dominant molecular contributors to this toxicity based on ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mediation pathway linking socioeconomic development to whole wastewater toxicity, highlighting the need for precision toxicity control strategies that prioritize economically developed cities, wherein WWTPs should target specific CHO-class toxic precursors."

However, little is known about their placental transfer and associated toxicity. Herein, we developed an approach integrating human biomonitoring, uterine perfusion experiments in pregnant rats, computational modeling, and in vitro placental cell bioassays. Nine of 30 PAAs including 8 PAAs with a monobenzene ring (e.g., aniline, ANI; ortho-toluidine, o-TD; para-toluidine, p-TD; ortho-anisidine, o-ANSD; 4-ethylaniline, 4-EA; 4-chloroaniline, 4-CA; and 3-chloroaniline, 3-CA) and 1 PAA with bis-benzene ring (2-naphthylamine, 2-NA), were widely detected (detection rate >50%) in 47 paired maternal and cord serum samples with median Σ9PAAs concentrations of 11.2 and 11.7 ng/mL, respectively. Transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PAAs were notably high, with median values ranging from 0.91 (p-CD) to 1.60 (2-NA), indicating efficient placental transfer. Excluding 2-NA, both biomonitoring data and rat uterine perfusion experiments revealed a significant negative correlation between log Kow and TTEs (or PAA concentrations in fetal rat), supporting passive diffusion as a mechanism involved in placental transfer of monoaromatic PAAs. Crucially, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that 2-NA forms dynamically stable complexes with specific solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, suggesting a transporter-mediated active transport process. Cytotoxicity assays further indicated that 2-NA exhibited the highest toxicity among all PAAs. Moreover, in syncytialized BeWo cells, 2-NA exposure significantly compromised placental barrier integrity and function. The widespread presence of PAAs in maternal and fetal serum underscores the need for regulatory measures to reduce exposure, particularly among pregnant women and fetuses."

Here, we investigated the developmental neurotoxicity of IMI and its TPs. Zebrafish were exposed to IMI, DNIMI, IMIOL, DNIMIOL, and 5OHIMI (0.005–500 μg/L) for 120 h postfertilization (hpf). DNIMI and IMIOL showed greater developmental and behavioral toxicity than IMI and other TPs and were therefore selected (0.05–500 μg/L) for further toxicokinetic and recovery investigations. Although IMI, IMIOL, and DNIMI accumulated to comparable levels by 72 hpf, DNIMI and IMIOL were cleared substantially more slowly than IMI, which resulted in higher internal residues after the depuration period. Consistent with their prolonged internal exposure, zebrafish exposed to DNIMI and IMIOL exhibited sustained hypoactivity postdepuration, accompanied by significantly reduced glutamate (GLU) levels and alternated transcription of GLU-related genes. The partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) identified GLU as a pivotal role (variable importance projection scores ≥1, p < 0.05). DNIMI and IMIOL downregulated genes involved in GLU synthesis and metabolism, concurrently decreasing glutamate decarboxylase and glutaminase levels while increasing glutamine synthetase levels. Exogenous GLU coexposure alleviated the locomotor activity, neurotransmitter alternations, and transcriptional perturbations, confirming disrupted GLU signaling contributes to the neurotoxicity of DNIMI and IMIOL. Overall, IMI-TPs induced stronger developmental neurotoxicity than IMI in zebrafish via GLU pathway disruption, highlighting their enhanced neurotoxic risks in aquatic environments."

We show that the spread in PI across GCMs is primarily driven by differences in outflow temperature, a consequence of different upper atmospheric temperatures. To explore the impacts of these biases on TC activity, we conduct several idealized experiments with altered temperature profiles. In these experiments, global TC frequency and accumulated cyclone energy change by ∼35% and hurricane frequency by ∼80%. There are smaller but still significant impacts on lifetime maximum intensity. These findings highlight an underappreciated role of upper atmospheric model biases in modulating TC activity in GCMs, how future changes in TC activity may be influenced by responses of upper atmospheric temperature to anthropogenic emissions, and that TCs are more directly influenced by PI than SST alone."

The third waves drive oceanic energy cascade, yet under what conditions these waves are generated remain poorly quantified. This study employs an integrated approach combining multi‐mooring observations, causality analysis, and high‐resolution regional simulations (i.e., 2 km, 60 levels) in the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) to address this knowledge gap. Both field observations and numerical simulations reveal that at stations near the tropical cyclone (TC) track, third‐wave kinetic energy doubled after TC passage, while vertical penetration depths dramatically shoaled. Causality analysis demonstrates that NIWs dominate third‐wave generation at these sites, exceeding IT contributions by a factor of 9.4. In contrast, tide‐dominated stations farther from TC path showed slight energy increases with balanced NIW‐IT contributions. This study provides the first three‐dimensional, causality‐constrained perspective on how TC and ITs selectively control third‐wave generation through nonlinear interactions."

 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects ≈90-95% of the global population1,2 and persists in B cells as a life-long infection3. Prior EBV-infection is associated with autoimmune and neoplastic disease4. Still, the biological basis of host control during EBV persistence remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of non-genetic and genetic factors that are associated with EBV control during persistent infection. Using blood-based genome sequence (GS) data from 486,315 UK Biobank and 336,123 All of Us participants, we identified short read-pairs mapping to the EBV genome in 16.2% and 21.8% of individuals, respectively. EBV-read detection (EBVread+) reflects increased viral load in blood cells, as shown by orthogonal measurements, and was associated with HIV infection, immunosuppressive drug intake, and current smoking. Genome-wide analyses of EBVread+ identified strong associations at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), including 54 independent HLA-alleles of MHC class I and II, and at 27 genomic regions outside MHC. Epistasis with distinct HLA-alleles of MHC class I was observed at the ERAP2 locus. Analysis of individuals with EBV-associated diseases4 revealed a higher polygenic burden of EBVread+ for HLA-alleles at MHC class I in multiple sclerosis (driven by HLA-A*02:01), and at MHC class II in rheumatoid arthritis. Phenome-wide analyses identified a polygenic overlap of EBVread+ with inflammatory bowel disease, hypothyroidism, and type 1 diabetes. Our study establishes by-products of human GS as a surrogate marker of EBV viral load. This will facilitate investigation and treatment for EBV and other persistent viral infections."

 Well-being is linked to income. However, lower well-being among lower-income individuals may reflect either economic relative deprivation or the lower social status associated with a lower income rank. Here, using Gallup World Poll data from 109 countries and over 90,000 individuals, we test a general model that includes both relative income deprivation and income rank as special cases. In 80% of countries, subjective well-being is more strongly associated with within-nation rank of income than with absolute income or relative income deprivation. Income rank coefficients are over three times larger in the most materialistic countries, but smaller in countries with higher social capital: In countries with the highest civic engagement, the association between income rank and well-being is about 80% smaller. Results replicated in multiple survey years and are consistent with a link between income-related social status and subjective well-being that is stronger when social capital is low. Higher incomes are associated with higher well-being.

 RNA design aims to find a sequence that can fold into a target secondary structure. It can create artificial RNA molecules for specific functions, with wide applications in medicine. It is computationally challenging due to two levels of combinatorial explosion: the exponentially large design space and the exponentially many competing structures per design. Popular methods such as local search cannot keep up with these combinatorial explosions. We instead employ two techniques from machine learning, continuous optimization and Monte-Carlo sampling. We start from a distribution over all valid sequences, and use gradient descent to improve the expectation of an arbitrary objective function. We define novel coupled-variable distributions to model the correlation between nucleotides. We then use sampling to approximate the objective, estimate the gradient, and select the final candidate. Our work consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics including Boltzmann probability and ensemble defect, especially on long and hard-to-design structures.

 Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with limited treatment options and poor patient survival, driven in part by cellular diversity within tumors. While individual cell types have been catalogued, how malignant, vascular, and immune cells are spatially organized inside human tumors remains incompletely understood. Here we show a spatially resolved, multi-modal atlas of human glioblastoma that integrates gene expression profiling across tissue sections with matched single-cell and protein measurements at subcellular resolution. Using a targeted 348 gene panel enriched for vascular and stromal markers, we identify less well-characterized endothelial, perivascular, and fibroblast-like cell states and define their spatial associations with malignant and immune compartments. We further identify a distinct oligodendrocyte population restricted to tumor core and perivascular regions that exhibits gene expression patterns associated with tumor recurrence and poor clinical outcome. This publicly accessible atlas provides a high-resolution framework for studying the spatial organization of glioblastoma and highlights region-specific cellular interactions that may represent therapeutically actionable vulnerabilities.

 C-prenylated flavonoids possess notable pharmaceutical potential, but their production is hindered by the challenging selective prenylation of their unstable polyphenolic cores. Natural prenyltransferases offer a direct route but suffer from low activity and incomplete mechanistic understanding. Here, we report a directed evolution strategy to reshape the active pocket of the prenyltransferase AtaPT, uncovering an aromatic cage that governs both regioselectivity and donor specificity. By tuning cage occupancy, we engineer three mutants with high chemo- and regioselectivity toward dimethylallyl diphosphate or geranyl pyrophosphate. Structural analysis and molecular simulations validate the role of the cage in guiding flavonoid prenylation. Notably, the aromatic cage mechanism observed in AtaPT is not unique and can be recapitulated in homologous enzymes. Introduction of the aromatic cage consistently enhances both activity and selectivity, confirming its crucial role. AtaPT mutants enable the efficient and scalable synthesis of 27 C-prenylated flavonoids, including 8 previously unreported compounds. With an integrated donor regeneration system, preparative-scale biotransformations achieve product titers up to 400 mg/L. This study establishes a selective and scalable biocatalytic platform for flavonoid prenylation and offers mechanistic insights for enzyme engineering.

Here, the authors assess effects of >7000 mutations in a model PDZ domain, to quantify how two small extensions to a protein domain reshape its energetic and allosteric landscape. 
 Many functions of proteins are performed by independently folding structural units called domains. These domains are structurally conserved but not identical in different proteins. Here, to understand the consequences for regulation and evolvability of domain extensions, we quantify the energetic effects of two extensions in a model protein domain. Quantifying abundance and ligand binding for >190,000 protein variants allows us to measure the free energy changes for mutations throughout a PDZ domain and ~7000 energetic couplings between these mutations and two domain extensions. Both a structured extension and a more dynamic extension substantially but specifically re-shape the energy landscape. In particular, deleting an ɑ-helix alters the energetic consequences of >400 mutations in >50 sites on fold stability or binding energy, and the effects of >300 allosteric mutations, including at solvent-accessible surface sites. Extending or pruning the domain therefore reshapes its energetic and allosteric landscape, adding and removing opportunities for the allosteric control of protein function. Independently folding domains can be seen as the functional and evolutionary structural units of proteins.

 Since 2005, the Campi Flegrei nested caldera volcano, located about 10 km west of Naples, Italy, has experienced accelerating uplift accompanied by increased seismicity, raising concerns in this densely populated area. This ongoing uplift is part of a millennium-long history of inflation-deflation cycles, in which seismicity correlates with uplift phases, albeit nonlinearly. Here, we show that the combination of stress shadowing and loading with frictional fault behavior reproduces the observed long-term seismicity trend. However, in the short term, earthquake clustering occurs, which we demonstrate is at least partly related to earthquake interactions and can be effectively modeled by overlapping aftershock sequences. Merging the long- and short-term approaches yields a combined model that effectively replicates the observed seismicity patterns. A pseudo-prospective test shows that the model can also provide probabilistic short-term forecasts of earthquake rates and maximum magnitudes on weekly to monthly time horizons. The complex seismicity at Campi Flegrei caldera can be reliably simulated and forecasted using a model that combines rate-and-state frictional response with epidemic-type aftershock sequence modeling."

As a precocial species, chicks can be tested shortly after hatching, allowing us to control their pretest experiences.

We found that in some mammalian cells, including neurons, stress also resulted in the formation of inactive ribosome-ribosome clusters (disomes). We used cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize ribosomes in situ and observed that this ribosome dimerization was mediated by a homotypic interaction of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expansion segment ES31Lb. ES31Lb interactions were both necessary and sufficient for disome formation and conferred a growth advantage and stress resistance to brain cells. ES31Lb is predicted to homodimerize in ~20% of chordates, including variants in both chicken and human. Cryo-ET analysis of chicken tetrasomes revealed an interaction between ES31Lb and ES9La. Thus, in animal cells, translation regulation can use a flexible component of the protein synthesis machinery—rRNA expansion segments."

The benefit of these signaling pathways depends on their reversibility. The integrated stress response (ISR) is elicited by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, which traps and inhibits rate-limiting translation factor eIF2B, thereby attenuating translation initiation. Termination of this pathway thus requires relieving eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition. Here, we found that eIF2 phosphatase subunits PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (R15B) bound P-eIF2 in complex with eIF2B. Biochemical investigations guided by cryo–electron microscopy structures of native eIF2-eIF2B and P-eIF2-eIF2B complexes bound to R15B demonstrated that R15B enabled dephosphorylation of otherwise dephosphorylation-incompetent P-eIF2 on eIF2B.

Hayes,Bacteria deliver a microtubule-binding protein into mammalian cells to promote colonization,"PathogenicBordetellabacteria use protein adhesins to infect the ciliated respiratory epithelia of vertebrate hosts. In this work, we show that the filamentous hemagglutinin FhaB adhesin ofBordetellacarries a C-terminal microtubule-binding domain (FhaB-CT), which is translocated into host cells to promote colonization. FhaB-CT delivery is required to occupy a niche at the base of cilia in airway epithelia, and mutant bacteria lacking this domain are defective for nasal colonization. These observations suggest that FhaB-CT is transferred into motile respiratory cilia to interact with core axonemal microtubules. We propose thatBordetellaadheres initially to the tips of cilia and then deploys multiple FhaB adhesins to migrate to the base of the cilia forest, where the bacteria resist removal by the mucociliary “escalator” that normally clears the respiratory tract of microbes."

However, upstream circuit mechanisms modulating these oscillations and the extent of the oscillations’ role in empathy-related behaviors remain elusive. We found that in mice, ACC theta oscillations are involved in empathy-driven prosocial allogrooming. Moreover, orexinergic neurons are selectively activated in the ACC during observational fear and prosocial allogrooming, but only when the animals had prior fear experience. Real-time, gaze-dependent optogenetic inhibition of lateral hypothalamic orexinergic inputs to ACC suppressed theta power and reduced both behaviors. These findings show that hypothalamic orexinergic inputs drive ACC theta oscillations to modulate observational fear and prosocial behaviors, providing circuit-level insight into how affective empathy translates into prosocial action."

We implanted tissue-like, stretchable electronics during organogenesis of human pancreatic organoids, enabling months-long, single cell–resolved electrophysiology. Longitudinal single-cell tracking suggested that improved hormone responsiveness reflects increasing activity of SC-α and -β cells with low and high basal firing, linked to induction of energy and hormone metabolism genes. Daily metabolic entrainment showed that circadian hormone secretion rhythms reflect daily oscillation of SC-α and -β electrical characteristics, tied to induction of cell-cell communication and exocytic gene networks, revealing circadian coordination of cell-level, stimulus-coupled responses. Lastly, we showed that electrical stimulation, via implanted actuators, enhances SC-α and -β glucose responsiveness.

Like 1952, the 2025 event nucleated at the northeastern end of the rupture, preceded by intense foreshock activity. Joint inversion of teleseismic and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for the space-time slip distribution, with validation by means of forward modeling of deep-water tsunami recordings, revealed a southwestward elongated large-slip patch on the curved plate boundary. A slip of up to 14 meters was located offshore southern Kamchatka and Paramushir Island. The 1952 earthquake generated stronger tsunami signals in Hawaii, indicating a different slip distribution. Peak slip in 2025 exceeded the maximum slip deficit accumulated since 1952.

Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that integrates frequency-tunable infrared excitation with scanning tunneling microscopy to characterize vibration-mediated nuclear motions of single molecules. We first validated the technique by monitoring the infrared-induced rotation of the ethynyl radical and then applied it to mapping pyrrolidine’s conformational dynamics. The resulting broadband spectra captured fundamental vibrational modes together with rich overtone and combination bands inaccessible by conventional methods, which we confirmed with isotopic substitutions. Density functional theory calculations showed that delocalized modes coupled with pyrrolidine ring puckering drive the structural transition, revealing altered selection rules compared with traditional infrared spectroscopy.

Building on advances in feature learning, we developed an approach for extracting linear representations of semantic notions or concepts in AI models. We showed how these representations enabled model steering, through which we exposed vulnerabilities and improved model capabilities. We demonstrated that concept representations were transferable across languages and enabled multiconcept steering. Across hundreds of concepts, we found that larger models were more steerable and that steering improved model capabilities beyond prompting. We showed that concept representations were more effective for monitoring misaligned content than for using judge models.

Proofreading is typically assumed to evolve when selection for fidelity outweighs costs in energy and the speed of replication. We show that when stalling after misincorporations is accounted for, proofreading can instead speed up replication. Consistent with data on polymerase mutagenesis, our results suggest that proofreading can evolve under selection for speed alone. We generalize to multicomponent self-assembly and show that analogous error-correcting processes, such as dynamic instability, can likewise emerge purely from selection for rapid assembly. Thus, nonequilibrium error correction can evolve from selection for speed, even without direct fidelity advantages. We discuss implications for mutation-rate evolution, molecular assembly processes, and models of early life."

These rocks consist of coarse-grained olivine, magnesium and iron carbonates, silica, and phyllosilicates, including some of the oldest materials exposed within Jezero. We infer that these rocks formed by olivine accumulation in an igneous system of layered intrusions, followed by exposure to water and carbon dioxide, which caused extensive carbonation of the silicate minerals.

They can facilitate or impede collective action. Although simulation models help to explore norm dynamics, modeling approaches remain scattered and lack synthesis specific to social-ecological systems. This systematic review aims to map existing computational approaches to modeling social norms within social-ecological systems, identifying trends, gaps and implications for research and policy. We conducted a systematic search of Web of Science and Scopus (search date: 15 November 2024), screened abstracts using validated large language models, and selected 153 relevant studies for analysis. Key aspects analyzed included publication trends, thematic focus, modeling methods, spatial scale, empirical data used behavioral theory incorporation and norm representation. Publications increased over 25 years, with most studies originating from Europe and North America. Two dominant themes emerged: common-pool resource management and individual consumption behavior. Agent-based and evolutionary game-theoretic models prevail, but many omit explicit behavioral theories beyond rational choice theory. Models are mostly local or regional in scale and theoretical in nature and often lack empirical data for the quantification of the social norm modeled. Norms are generally modeled on an observation base, meaning that the majority of models include norms based on what others do. Interactions between norm types and dynamic norm signaling remain under-explored. To strengthen social-ecological modeling and its policy relevance, future work should enhance geographic diversity, integrate behavioral theories more deeply and develop models that capture dynamically signaled norms in order to advance our understanding of human–environment interactions and sustainability transitions."

Efforts to counter anthropogenic pressures on Amazonian ecosystems have largely excluded freshwater ecosystems despite their central role in supporting biodiversity and human communities. Nature based solutions (NbS) are garnering attention as a holistic strategy that address ecological and human dimensions of resilience, offering a promising approach to couple freshwater biodiversity conservation and equitable adaptation in the Amazon. The extent to which NbS projects in the Amazon are incorporating freshwater biodiversity objectives and aligning with principles of equitable adaptation is unresolved. Synthesizing across existing NbS cases is key to distilling lessons learned and identifying remaining gaps to inform current and future project implementation. We evaluate four cases of implemented NbS projects in the lowland Amazonian basin to assess three themes: freshwater biodiversity impacts, equity considerations, and guiding policies of each case. Freshwater biodiversity outcomes are evaluated by assessing against Couto (Couto et al 2024 Conserv. Sci. Pract.6 e13241)’ five themes for freshwater biodiversity conservation; equity implications evaluated by comparing project documents to the Stockholm Environment Institute’s Principles for Just and Equitable NbS; and the degree to which freshwater biodiversity is prioritized by relevant policies is assessed through a search for keywords. The case studies demonstrate alignment with principles of equitable and just NbS in the Amazon basin, but links to freshwater biodiversity are minimal, suggesting an oversight of the importance of sustaining and protecting freshwater biodiversity, particularly among vulnerable local communities. We provide recommendations to expand freshwater NbS-A project implementation, monitoring and data sharing, and policy in the region with the aim of safeguarding freshwater ecosystems and local communities in the face of environmental change."

Previous research has mainly emphasized physical form and single outcomes, neglecting functional dimensions and potential ecological trade-offs due to the lack of fine-grained data. Here, we introduce a multi-source data fusion-based urban functional compactness (UFC) indicator and integrate it with urban physical compactness (UPC) into a form-function coupling framework. Using structural equation modeling across 176 Chinese cities, we reveal dual impacts: stronger UFC enhances land use efficiency and public transport performance but is associated with reduced green space provision and weaker waste treatment. A 1% increase in UFC raises infrastructure utilization efficiency by about 2% while also indirectly elevating environmental pollution by 0.74%.

These findings challenge the assumption that compactness is inherently green, demonstrating instead that form–function coupling produces divergent pathways: efficiency gains coexisting with amplified ecological risks."

This study demonstrates a quantitative environmental, social, and governance framework using data from India’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting to evaluate the environmental performance of corporations using novel intensity measures. Key findings show that cement industry exhibits some of the highest purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted emissions at nearly 0.89 tCO₂e/₹ crore (tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per rupee crore or per 10 million Indian Rupees) or nearly 7.5 tCO₂e/ million US$ revenue. Mining operations in water-stressed regions show a 19%–37% excess over basin recharge capacity. Additionally, 88% of the companies do not report Scope 3 emissions, leaving behind critical lacunae in value chain accountability. Data validation shows the existence of a 72% accuracy in the emission reporting and 68% accuracy in water metrics. The equations in the framework that factor in regional PPP factors and aquifer stress percentages give the model a replicable methodology for quantifying corporate environmental impacts in data-scarce regions with potential for adaptation across developing nations with similar industrialisation-environment trade-offs."

Because future responses will have to build on the legacy of past trajectories, addressing this challenge requires a sound, fine-grained understanding of those trajectories. In the present study, we address this challenge by compiling a dataset (1990–2019) quantifying nitrogen flows across the agri-food systems of 120 European territories. Using this dataset, we apply the generalized representation of agri-food systems framework to classify agri-food systems into six types representing different degrees of specialization. Our results show that agricultural systems became increasingly specialized, rising from 22% of specialized territories in 1990 to 36% in 2019, indicating a growing reliance on external feed and fertilizer inputs. Most of these transitions occurred in eastern Europe, predominantly toward stockless cropping systems. Although these evolutions unfolded within broader processes of market liberalization, transition patterns also displayed clear path-dependency effects rooted in the material configuration of agri-food systems. This is evidenced by the analysis of transition frequencies, which shows that some transitions occurred repeatedly while others never occurred, pointing to the influence of initial system configurations on subsequent trajectories. By contrast, changes in agro-environmental performance were only weakly linked to system transitions. The increases in nitrogen use efficiency (from 0.57 to 0.70) and declines in nitrogen surplus (from 68 to 49 kg N ha−1) rather coincided with higher yields and increased nitrogen input application rates, pointing to the dominant role of factors not explicitly captured here, such as shifts in agronomic practices and pedo-climatic conditions. Taken together, these findings provide both a critical dataset and a robust understanding of recent territorial agri-food trajectories, thereby offering a solid empirical basis for anticipating future transitions and developing scenario-based analyses."

We demonstrate that variation in soil warming with depth is driven largely by warming methodology, while soil moisture changes due to warming differ by ecosystem. This work serves a foundation for future syntheses with SWEDDIE. 
 Field-warming experiments offer insight into the response of ecosystems to rising temperatures, but cross-site comparison is needed to determine both the general tendencies of warming responses and the context dependencies of deviations from those norms. These responses are not limited to the direct effects of temperature but also their indirect effects on soil moisture, a critical factor controlling ecosystem productivity and carbon fluxes. Here we introduce SWEDDIE: the first database to characterize the whole soil profile warming response across 26 distinct soil warming experiments, encompassing forest, grassland, cropland, tundra, and wetland ecosystems. SWEDDIE is needed because prior databases and syntheses of warming effects on ecosystems were dominated by aboveground warming studies, many of which warmed soil modestly or negligibly during much of the growing season and reported only growing season averages."

The advantage of our approach is that it keeps existing data as they are without requiring any reformatting. The idea is to reduce the amount of data read from the NetCDF file by creating sub-chunks that allow extracting smaller portions of compressed data without reading the entire chunk. 
 NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a self-describing, portable and platform-independent format for array-oriented scientific data which has become a community standard for sharing measurements and analysis results in the fields of oceanography, meteorology, and space domain.The volume of scientific data is continuously increasing at a very fast rate and poses challenges for efficient storage and sharing of these data. The object storage paradigm that appeared with cloud infrastructures, can help with data storage and parallel access issues.The availability of ample network bandwidth within cloud infrastructures allows for the utilization of large amounts of data. Processing data where the data is located is preferable as it can result in substantial resource savings. However, for some use cases downloading data from the cloud is required and results still have to be fetched once processing tasks have been executed on the cloud.However, networks bandwidth and quality can exhibit significant variations depending on the available resources in different use cases: networks can range from fiber-optic and copper connections to satellite connections with poor reception in degraded conditions on boats, among other scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial for formats and software libraries to be specifically designed to optimize access to data by minimizing the transfer to only what is strictly necessary.By design, the NetCDF data format offers such capabilities. A netCDF file is composed of a pool of chunks. Each chunk is a small unit of data that is independent and may be compressed. These units of data are read or written in a single I/O operation. In this article, we reuse the notion of sub-chunk introduced in the kerchunk library (Sterzinger et al., 2021): we refer to a sub-chunk as a sub-part of a chunk.The sub-chunking strategies help reducing the amount of data transferred by splitting netCDF chunks in even smaller unit of data. Kerchunk limits the sub-chunking capability to uncompressed chunks. Our approach goes further: it allows the sub-chunking of compressed chunks by indexing their content. In this context, a new approach has emerged in the form of a library that indexes the content of netCDF-4. This indexing enables the retrieval of sub-chunks without the need to read and decompress the entire chunk. This approach targets access patterns such as time series in netCDF-4 datasets formatted with large chunks and it has the advantage of not requiring the entire file to be reformatted.This report provides a performance assessment of netCDF-4 datasets for various use cases and conditions: POSIX (see POSIX) and S3 local filesystems, as well as a simulated degraded network connection. The results of this assessment may provide guidance on the most suitable and most efficient library for reading netCDF data in different situations.Another outcome of this study is the impact of the libraries used to access the data: while extensive existing literature compares different file formats performance (open, read and write), the impact of specific standard libraries remains poorly studied. This study evaluates the performance of four Python libraries (netcdf4-python, xarray, h5py, and a custom chunk-indexing library) for reading parts of the datasets through fsspec or s3fs. To complete the study, a comparison with the cloud-oriented formats Zarr and ncZarr is conducted. Results show that the h5py library provides high efficiency for accessing netCDF-4 formatted files and performance close to Zarr on a S3 server. These results suggest that it may not be necessary to convert netCDF-4 datasets to Zarr when moving to the cloud. This would avoid reformatting petabytes of data and costly adaptation of scientific software."

Traditional codes represent the systems of equation by setting up the associated matrix. However, at the scales we want to operate, even forming this matrix is hardly possible. Thus, we use the matrix-free framework HyTeG to create the geophysical model and verify it with numerical experiments while assessing the scalability of the framework and laying out the difficulties involved. 
 High-resolution geodynamic simulations of mantle convection are essential to quantitatively assess the complex physical mechanisms driving the large-scale tectonic processes that shape Earth's surface. Accurately capturing small-scale features such as unstable thermal boundary layers requires global resolution on the order of 1 km. This renders traditional sparse matrix methods impractical due to their prohibitively high memory demands and low arithmetic intensity. Matrix-free methods offer a scalable alternative, enabling the solution of large-scale linear systems efficiently. In this work, we leverage the matrix-free Finite Element framework HyTeG to conduct large-scale geodynamic simulations that incorporate realistic physical models. We validate the framework through a combination of convergence studies of the Finite Element approximations against analytical solutions and through geophysical community benchmarks. The latter include test cases with temperature-dependent and nonlinear rheologies. Our scalability studies demonstrate excellent performance, scaling up to problems with about 100 billion (1011) unknowns in the Stokes system."

Using a three-dimensional human skin equivalent (3D-HSE), we quantified percutaneous penetration for benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs), dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs), and alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (ATMACs) with C8–C18 chains. Shorter-chain (C8–C10) BACs and ATMACs showed rapid uptake (>50% at 24 h; >70% at 48 h), whereas long-chain homologues (C16–C18) exhibited minimal permeation (<15%) and greater retention within the skin. The correlation between the octanol–water partition coefficient (log Kow) and molecular weight (MW), combined with molecular docking analysis, revealed that both passive and active transport were involved in the skin exposure of QACs. By integrating sweat leaching and 3D-HSE data, estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of total QACs were 1.82 ng/kg bw/d for dry clothing, increasing to 96.9 ng/kg bw/d for sweaty clothing, while these values reached 51.3 and 1960 ng/kg bw/d in the high-exposure scenario, respectively. Finally, transcriptomics and lipidomics showed downregulation of keratinization and epidermal genes and broad depletion of structural and signaling lipids, consistent with impaired skin integrity and immune activation. These results identify textiles as a significant sweat-mediated exposure source and demonstrate chain-length-dependent dermal kinetics and toxicity of QACs."

However, existing research primarily focuses on their acute toxicity using high doses, overlooking chronic low-dose exposure scenarios (more relevant to real environments) and the potential indirect effects mediated by gut microbiota (GM). Here, we compared the acute and chronic effects of AgNPs on Daphnia magna, examining survival, reproduction, GM alterations, and metabolic profiles. We found that acute exposure led to immediate mortality and metabolic disruptions, primarily affecting lipid and amino acid metabolism, whereas chronic exposure caused more severe reproduction failure and broader metabolic alterations, including changes in amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, energy production, and neural function. Both exposures disrupted GM composition, increasing Proteobacteria and decreasing Bacteroidetes, with chronic exposure causing more severe and lasting dysbiosis. Multiomics correlation analysis revealed that the GM plays a critical role in mediating AgNP-induced metabolic disturbances. Overall, our study highlights the differential toxicological effects of acute versus chronic AgNP exposure and underscores the importance of considering both the direct effects of nanoparticles on the host and the indirect effects mediated through the GM when assessing nanoparticle health risks. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of AgNP toxicity and emphasize the need for integrated approaches in environmental risk assessment."

However, current research has largely centered on polystyrene NPs (PS NPs), which constitute only a minor portion of total NPs in freshwater environments. In this study, we applied a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) modeling framework to comparatively assess the accumulation, elimination, and toxicity of four polymer types of NPs (PS, polyvinyl chloride [PVC], poly(methyl methacrylate) [PMMA], and polycarbonate [PC]; all ∼ 80 nm) in Daphnia magna. Aggregation-induced-emission fluorogen labeling enabled precise tracking of NPs. Our findings revealed clear polymer-type-dependent differences: D. magna accumulated and eliminated PMMA and PC NPs more efficiently than PS and PVC NPs. Toxicity followed the order: PS > PVC > PMMA > PC. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that NPs disrupt nutrient digestion, oxidative stress responses, and nervous system function. Using TK-TD modeling, we further predicted the time-dependent median lethal concentrations (LC50) and no-effect concentrations (NEC) for the NPs. The 48-h LC50 values for PS, PVC, PMMA, and PC NPs were 15.0, 43.1, 66.5, and 389.7 mg L–1, respectively, while the corresponding NECs were 4.5, 7.0, 13.5, and 60.0 mg L–1.

 Viewing urban spatial structure from a three-dimensional (3D) perspective provides important insights for environmental sustainability. While existing studies mainly examine 3D built-up volume, the spatial distribution of vertical growth remains insufficiently understood. This study investigates centrality and intensity of vertical expansion in newly urbanized areas. Using multi-source remote sensing data, we develop a Centrality Index (CI) and an Intensity Index (II) to characterize 3D urban expansion and compare it with conventional two-dimensional (2D) measures. Results show that: (1) 3D expansion is generally more centralized than 2D expansion. (2) Vertical growth is stronger in the Global South; however, Global South cities outside China, especially in Africa, often demonstrate low 3D centrality. (3) 3D expansion patterns are closely associated with natural and socioeconomic conditions and display strong path dependency. As urbanization shifts toward Africa and South Asia, prevalent low-centrality patterns may improve land-use efficiency but increase commuting-related carbon emissions.

 Prostate cancer lineage plasticity is associated with changes in DNA methylation and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) activity. How these epigenetic programs functionally interact to modulate transcriptional reprogramming in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that hypomethylated regions of DNA preferentially accumulate the repressive mark, H3K27me3. We established an NEPC mouse model with deletion of Ezh2 in the background of Pten and Rb1 loss plus human MYCN overexpression. Deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in NEPC murine or patient-derived models leads to a genome-wide rewiring of DNA methylation, characterized by hypomethylation and upregulation of neuroendocrine-lineage genes along with hypermethylation and repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets. On the other hand, deletion of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) results in significant changes in H3K27me3 distribution, particularly affecting bivalent promoters bearing both H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 marks. In NEPC models, neuroendocrine-lineage genes are repressed upon DNMT1 deletion associated with increased H3K27me3. Conversely, in prostate adenocarcinoma models, DNMT1 deletion leads to de-repression of neuroendocrine lineage genes with a loss of H3K27me3 marks. Our findings reveal a functional interplay between two repressive epigenetic machineries that mediates lineage plasticity in prostate cancer. In this study, the authors identify a collaboration between the epigenetic regulators, EZH2 and DNA methyltransferase that contributes to prostate cancer lineage reprogramming."

Here the authors genetically engineer an optoswitch that enables photo-induced complementation of an albino mutant restoring transcription and chloroplast biogenesis on demand. 
 Photosynthesis genes in plant chloroplasts are transcribed by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase called PEP. Consequently, PEP-deficient mutants cannot generate a photosynthetic apparatus and develop non-viable albino seedlings. Inducible complementation of such mutants thus could provide interesting insights in PEP action and chloroplast biogenesis. Here we show the effects of photo-inducible complementation in the albino Arabidopsis mutant pap7-1 using a red/blue optoswitch with monochromatic LEDs. Expression of a blue-light-induced PAP7 construct that is silent under red light reconstitutes PEP at any time point of pap7-1 development resulting in proper chloroplast biogenesis that rescues the non-viable mutant. Induction of chloroplast biogenesis, however, can only occur in very young leaf tissues indicating the existence of a cell-autonomous, biogenic coupling between cell and organelle development. We further uncover that initial PEP formation and function is independent of photosynthesis. The optoswitch termed blue-light valved biogenesis opens experimental avenues to study non-viable plant mutants. Plants require the plastid encoded RNA polymerase PEP to generate viable photosynthetic apparatus. Here the authors genetically engineer an optoswitch that enables photo-induced complementation of an albino mutant restoring transcription and chloroplast biogenesis on demand."

 Although most patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) receiving CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy achieve remission, loss of CAR T cell functionality and subsequent relapse remains an unmet therapeutic need. Herein, we apply an integrative approach to study the immunometabolism of pre- and post-infusion CD19-CAR T cells of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. Pre-infusion CAR T cells of long-term responders (LTR) have increased oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and pentose phosphate pathway activities, higher mitochondrial mass, tighter cristae, and lower mTOR expression compared to products of short-term responders. Post-infusion CAR T cells in bone marrow (BM) of LTR have high immunometabolic plasticity and mTOR-pS6 expression supported by the BM microenvironment. Transient inhibition of mTOR during manufacture induces metabolic reprogramming and enhances anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells. Our findings provide insight into immunometabolic determinants of long-term response and suggest a therapeutic strategy to improve long-term remission.

Here the authors quantify this change and combine it with our understanding of known Antarctic mineral occurrences, showing that substantial mineral deposits may become accessible over the next few centuries in Antarctica. 
 The extent of ice-free land across Antarctica will increase in a warming world, driven by ice sheet retreat and sea-level change. Here we project an up to ~120,000 km2 (~550%) increase in the extent of Antarctic ice-free land over the next three centuries, using a state-of-the-art sea level model combined with ice sheet melt predictions for a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios. New ice-free land is projected to emerge in all regions with existing territorial claims as well as in the unclaimed sector in West Antarctica. The geologic setting and distribution of known mineral occurrences indicate that ice-free land emergence will expose new mineral deposits in these regions. With the likely rise in the economic viability of Antarctic mineral resources over the coming centuries, the environmental impacts of mineral resource extraction activities will be weighed against societal pressure for sustainable resource development.

 Microbial-driven processes, particularly denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), convert inorganic nitrogen (N) in soils into gaseous forms, causing substantial N losses. However, their responses to global change across ecosystem types remain unclear. Here, we synthesized global data on denitrification and anammox from experiments examining major global change factors (GCFs), including elevated CO2, N addition, warming, and altered precipitation. Our analysis shows that N addition markedly stimulated both processes, and warming enhanced denitrification. On average, multiple GCFs exerted stronger effects on N-loss processes than single or two GCFs. These effects are ecosystem dependent, with croplands being the most affected, particularly under N addition. Furthermore, the sensitivity of N-loss processes to each GCF varies greatly among ecosystems and is largely explained by local climate and soil conditions. Our findings reveal accelerated soil N losses under multifactor global change and offer insights for improving future N-cycle predictions and sustainable N management.

 Predicting fine-grained population distribution is crucial for effective urban planning. However, existing models widely ignore Region-Distinctive Geographical Factors (RDGF) in regional population modeling. This omission may compromise prediction accuracy, particularly in coastal zones where over 50% of the global population. To address this gap, we proposed an RDGF-incorporated approach for fine-grained population prediction, using the coastal Pearl River Delta as a case study. Leveraging multi-source geospatial data, based on generalized geographical factors (GGF) (e.g., topography, POI density, nighttime light intensity, etc.), we supplemented multi-dimensional RDGF including ecology, agriculture and transportation, etc. derived from unique regional environments (e.g., distance to shoreline, aquaculture, ports, etc.). We employed an interpretable machine learning framework (Random Forest + SHAP) to model and explain factor contribution. Results demonstrate: (1) incorporating RDGF substantially improves prediction accuracy in both model performance (with the average R2 increasing by 6% under spatial cross-validation) and output (The relative error in densely populated areas can be reduced by up to 40%), thereby providing opportunity for more effective infrastructure planning and disaster risk management. (2) GGF still make the primary contribution to the model; however, RDGF are able to reveal local spatial heterogeneity and geographic decay patterns in population distribution, demonstrating greater potential for reducing prediction errors.

A broad range of aromatic compounds, including benzene, were successfully transformed into their corresponding aromatic nitriles. Both experimental and computational evidence suggested that the reaction proceeds primarily via the in situ generation of •CN radicals from N2and CH4within the plasma zone. Subsequent radical addition to aromatic rings allowed the one-pot formation of aryl nitriles.

We find that the rhombohedral/tetragonal mixtures deliver the best results in most cases, mainly due to their low switching barriers and substantial local inhomogeneity. These results offer a detailed view of improved energy storage in relaxor ferroelectrics and provide theoretical guidance for designing high-performance capacitors."

Although the basal forebrain (BF) is known to modulate cortical activity and support attention, it remains unclear whether BF activity directly conveys an attention signal. Here, we show that selective attention to auditory and visual stimuli converges onto a shared population of noncholinergic BF neurons. Using a cross-modal task where rats rapidly switched attention between modalities, we found that these neurons responded strongly to attended targets but weakly to the same stimuli when ignored, regardless of modality. These effects closely tracked both task-driven and spontaneous attention shifts on a single-trial basis. Moreover, BF responses reflected the linear summation of attended and ignored inputs, suggesting that sensory streams are filtered in parallel before converging in the BF. These findings suggest that the BF may serve as a subcortical hub integrating attention signals across modalities to guide adaptive behavior."

Application to mouse liver identified 260 Kacac sites across 125 proteins, revealing notable enrichment in metabolic pathways. Concurrently, we established a genetic code expansion system enabling site-specific Kacac incorporation. Using this approach, we demonstrated that K310acac in HMGCS2 substantially attenuates catalytic activity through impaired substrate binding.

Helicases emerged as the most commonly mutated cancer driver enzyme family, altered in two-thirds of all cancers. Functional screens and genomic analyses revealed that helicase dysfunctions contribute to genomic instability and faulty DNA repair.

Although the role of RAD51 paralogs is well established in homologous recombination (HR)–mediated DNA repair, little is known about their role during replication stress responses. Here, we report that the RAD51C-XRCC3 (CX3) complex of RAD51 paralogs participates in the FA pathway of R-loop tolerance mechanism. CX3 complex suppresses R-loops, transcription-replication collisions (TRCs), and associated genome instability under physiological and replication stress conditions. Mechanistically, the CX3 complex physically interacts with FANCM and facilitates its recruitment to the R-loop sites to promote its resolution. Notably, cells expressing the RAD51C R258H pathological mutant exhibit defective interaction with FANCM and display inefficient R-loop processing. The CX3 complex–mediated R-loop resolution is independent of its fork maintenance function.

Chemosensation plays an essential role in larval settlement preferences. However, the mechanisms for sensing chemical cues underlying these preferences remain unknown. Using urochordate ascidian larvae, the prominent marine fouling organisms affecting coastal ecosystems, we explored the mechanism of larval chemosensation and its role in settlement preference. Here, we identified taurine, a specific sulfur-containing amino acid secreted from marine adult animals, as a chemical attractant for ascidian larvae to locate salubrious environments for metamorphosis. Taurine stimulates primary sensory neurons within larval papillae, and this neuronal excitation is integrated in the simple brain (also known as sensory vesicle) to elicit chemoattraction and attachment of swimming larvae. We discuss the implications of this study in the emerging field of marine Eco-Evo-Devo research by establishing a model system for understanding developmental mechanisms in the context of marine ecosystems and aquaculture. Of interest is the potential development of antifouling strategies by targeting taurine chemosensation."

Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are critical for this defense, and their developmental progression and subset balance are essential for effective immune function. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor Nur77 helps control NKp46+ILC3 development in newborn mice. Mice lacking Nur77 have fewer ILC3s and failed to convert one ILC3 subtype (NKp46−) into a more protective form (NKp46+), reducing their ability to fightSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium infection. We found that 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE), a natural lipid found in the intestine, binds to Nur77 and boosts the expression of transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), promoting the shift to NKp46+ILC3s and increasing the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a key immune molecule. This response is dependent on Nur77. Further analyses have revealed that Nur77 directly regulates a gene calledImpdh1, which supports this immune transition. Our findings uncover a Nur77-driven pathway that helps shape gut immunity in early life."

Using CRISPR guide RNA–tagged glioma sEVs and bioluminescent/fluorescent green-enhanced nano-lantern (GeNL)–tagged lung and pancreatic cancer sEVs, we tracked their journey from tumors to urine in multiple mouse models. In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed endocytic uptake and transcytotic release by glomerular cells, accompanied by changes in sEV size and surface composition. GeNL-tagged sEVs consistently showed higher signals in urine than plasma, indicating selective excretion.

Here, we generated single-cell ATAC-seq profiles from patients with RCC and integrated them with three previously published datasets to identify chromatin programs in tumor cells. We identified an interferon response program enriched inBAP1-mutant tumors, and, in bulk ATAC-seq cohorts with linked clinical data, this program was associated with poor prognosis. Mechanistic analyses in isogenic models suggested thatBAP1loss induces a tumor-intrinsic interferon response, with dysregulated endogenous retroviruses as a potential upstream trigger. We further characterized theBAP1mutation–associated tumor microenvironment across single-cell, bulk, and multiplex immunofluorescence data, identifying features of both inflammation and immune evasion. Together, our findings nominate tumor-intrinsic interferon signaling as a candidate driver ofBAP1-associated aggressiveness in RCC and highlight immune evasion pathways as potential therapeutic targets."

This study presents a breakthrough in dual-range and precise pore size modulation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through a ligand functionalization strategy. By tailoring steric configurations and spatial orientations of light-responsive azobenzene groups, we achieved broad-range pore tuning (0.41 to 0.68 nanometers) via functional group length variation, coupled with subnanometer precision through reversible trans-to-cis photoisomerization. Four representative branched alkanes were selected to validate the MOF’s high selectivity. Results showed its capacity to generate a constant carbon-atom-count–dependent permeation gradient, realizing a four-step sequential separation that increased C6H14purity from 25 to 92.2%. This synergistic approach uniquely combines large-scale pore adjustment with dynamic fine-tuning, decoupling separation efficiency from energy-intensive processes. The membranes’ structural stability and reversible light responsiveness further highlight their potential for sustainable hydrocarbon processing. By integrating molecular design with stimuli-responsive control, this work advances MOF-based membranes as a transformative solution for energy-efficient petroleum fractionation and precise molecular sieving."

Here, we demonstrate the strategic repurposing of these nonidealities as functional resources for advanced stochastic analog computing. We leverage two underutilized phenomena—deep-level channel trap-induced generation-recombination (G-R) noise and impact ionization–induced negative differential resistance (NDR) in body current—which have received limited attention compared to the extensively studied 1/fnoise and monotonic drain current behavior in logic-centric transistors. By exploiting G-R noise with controllable temporal correlation and NDR with an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (2.78 × 104) within fully depleted silicon-on-insulator transistors fabricated in industry silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, we achieve multifunctional analog computation at the single-device level. Our transistor seamlessly performs stochastic encryption, deterministic signal readout, and analog inversion simply through reconfiguration of applied bias conditions, thereby eliminating the need for peripheral random-number generators, dedicated analog inverters, or amplifiers. This approach not only reveals the previously unrecognized computational potential embedded in mature CMOS technologies but also presents a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to architecture based on exotic materials, laying the foundation for next-generation analog computing systems."

A portion of 1q, rather than the entire 1q arm, was gained in 75 (14.0%) PDACs, allowing us to pinpoint two ~3-megabase regions of 1q that were nearly always gained. These two regions containedNCSTNandPSEN2, genes that code two subunits of the γ-secretase complex. Evaluation of 267 precancerous lesions revealed that extra copies ofNCSTNandPSEN2were common (49%) in noninvasive neoplasms (high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms), which are at relatively high risk for progression to PDACs, but uncommon (6%) in low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, which have low malignant potential.

The Fe-TiOX/titanium paper electrocatalyst achieves a faradaic efficiency of 74.3% with >60% GC selectivity at industrially relevant current densities (~100 milliamperes per square centimeter), stable for ~60 hours, which is a record high in electrochemical conversion of OX to GC.

While the signaling lipid leukotriene B4 (LTB4) reinforces cellular polarity, how mechanical cues regulate its production remains unclear. We now show that cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), which is essential for the synthesis of LTB4, functions as a nuclear curvosensor. cPLA2α responds to nuclear squeezing by localizing to ceramide-rich inner nuclear membrane microdomains and incorporating onto the exofacial surface of nuclear envelope–derived exosomes. This unique topology enables localized LTB4synthesis, which synchronizes calcium spikes, promotes myosin light chain II phosphorylation, and sustains polarity and directional persistence after constriction. In neutrophils passing through tight spaces, cPLA2α activity drives the chemotactic response to nuclear squeezing by promoting exosomal LTB4production and persistence after constriction. These findings uncover a cPLA2α-dependent mechanochemical axis linking nuclear architecture to chemotactic efficiency and offer alternative strategies to modulate inflammatory responses."

However, these water-soluble steroid drugs are rapidly cleared from the desired sites of action in the body, necessitating multiple doses. Therefore, the development of particle-based steroid medications that offer elongated therapeutic activity is of paramount medical importance. Accordingly, steroid microparticles were developed via three fabrication processes in this work, where a metal or an organic acid facilitates steroid microparticle formation. Particles fabricated using these methods exhibit consistent shape, size, and crystallinity. Furthermore, results from our coarse-grained computational model show that hydrogen bonding dictates steroid monomer-monomer interactions that determine overall particle shape and size. In addition, we demonstrate the ability to induce steroid particle formation and tune the morphology of steroid drug particles by replacing the C21 side group (tail) with chemical analogs.

We introduce a framework combining degree-days (D°) and chemical activity to disentangle physiological and chemical drivers of toxicity. This approach was tested using Daphnia magna exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Two exposure designs were compared: (1) fixed duration (72 h) at 20 and 25 °C, and (2) D°-standardized exposure corresponding to 60 D° (72 h at 20 °C; 58 h at 25 °C). Chemical activity, a thermodynamic measure of bioavailable dose, was used as the exposure metric, with the median lethal activity (La50) as the primary endpoint. To provide a more nuanced view of the metabolism, sublethal responses (δ13C, C/N ratio, protein content) were also evaluated. In fixed-time exposures, La50 values were lower at 25 °C, indicating  greater apparent toxicity at elevated temperature. This difference disappeared under D° normalization, showing that increased mortality reflected faster physiological aging rather than altered PAH behavior. Metabolic indicators supported this interpretation, revealing PAH-driven, temperature-independent energy depletion. By aligning exposure with cumulative thermal experience and quantifying dose as chemical activity, this framework enables temperature-normalized toxicity assessment and supports climate-aware ecological risk evaluation for HOCs."

Recent ERW literature has highlighted potential co-benefits from cropland ERW application, including reduced fertilizer requirements and soil N2O emissions. However, contributions of co-benefits to life cycle environmental impacts remain poorly understood, and methodologies for integrating them into environmental and cost assessments are lacking. We address these research gaps by integrating co-benefits into a coupled life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis to quantify environmental impacts and costs of ERW with and without co-benefits. We assess both waste and virgin rock sourcing and transportation pathways in the United States. Our results show that cradle-to-farm-gate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of ERW, with long-range transport allowing nationwide deployment, range from 44 to 371 kg CO2eq/t CO2eq removal, and costs vary between US$123 and US$926/net t CO2eq removal, depending on rock type, sourcing, and transport mix. Fertilizer and N2O co-benefits can reduce GHG emissions of ERW deployment by 10.4–55.7%, costs by 3.2–7.6%, and other environmental impacts by 1–147%. The contributions of co-benefits are region-dependent, demonstrated by our spatial analysis of croplands across the United States.

Anderson,Ion-Specific Precipitation of Extractants Enables Rare-Earth Separation and Wastewater Remediation from Solvent Extraction of Critical Elements,"The increasing demand for rare-earth elements (REEs) necessitates sustainable recovery strategies, particularly from secondary sources, such as electronic waste. Solvent extraction is the primary industrial method for REE separation; however, the unintentional dissolution of extractants into wastewater poses serious environmental risks, leading to organic contamination and process inefficiencies. Existing wastewater treatment methods struggle to remove these persistent pollutants, underscoring the need for innovative recovery approaches. Herein, we present a ligand-mediated precipitation strategy that simultaneously recovers REEs and removes dissolved extractants from solvent extraction wastewater. We show that residual extractants in the aqueous phase can selectively bind REEs, inducing their precipitation while leaving transition metals in solution. By integrating FTIR spectroscopy, EDS, XPS, EXAFS, and SAXS, we elucidate the mechanism of ion-specific precipitation and the local coordination environment of metal ions in the precipitate. Importantly, we demonstrate that the precipitated extractants can be efficiently recovered and reused, providing a closed-loop solution that enhances sustainability. Applying this method to leachates from samarium–cobalt (Sm–Co) and neodymium–iron–boron (NdFeB) mixed magnets, we achieve highly selective REE precipitation under mild conditions, demonstrating a scalable and cost-effective pathway for REE recovery, wastewater purification, and extractant recycling.

To address this issue, we developed an advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) system featuring a novel bifunctional Co3O4/g-C3N4 (Co/CN) cathode that synergistically couples oxidative and reductive pathways to minimize chlorinated byproducts. The cathode simultaneously enables rapid H*-mediated dechlorination and the generation of H2O2, which then reacts with anodic free chlorine to form 1O2, reducing chlorinated byproducts significantly. The developed Chlorination-Dechlorination-Mineralization (PEC/Cl/H2O2–CDM) system demonstrated a 1.86- to 2.38-fold enhancement in TOC removal efficiency, a 46.3–58.0% reduction in energy consumption, and a substantial decrease in acute toxicity relative to conventional PEC systems. Theoretical calculations further revealed that reductive dechlorination effectively lowers the energy barrier, making the dechlorinated intermediates more susceptible to radical attacks. Moreover, this system demonstrated a broad-spectrum degradation capability and was cost-effective for landfill leachate treatment to meet discharge standards. Guided by mechanistic insights, this study develops an advanced PEC process that enables the efficient and greener mineralization of hypersaline organic wastewater."

However, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant doses of TCDF on adipose tissues and obesity remain elusive. This study revealed that adult mice exposed to 0.3 or 3 μg/kg of TCDF for 16 weeks developed mild adiposity under normal chow diets in a dose-dependent manner, which was evidenced by significant accumulation of epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) and inguinal white adipose tissues (iWAT). Interestingly, the obesogenic effects of TCDF were dose-independent under western diets; low-dose TCDF exposure caused a more pronounced obesogenic effect and associated metabolic disorders. Consistent with the obesogenic effect, TCDF was further revealed to interfere with adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and thermogenesis in eWAT or iWAT. Moreover, our results pointed out that TCDF plays roles in obesity through AhR-dependent and AhR-independent manners. Taken together, these results showed the obesogenic effect of environmentally relevant doses of TCDF and elucidated that TCDF caused dysfunction of adipose tissues, which strongly supports that TCDF is an environmental obesogen and that more attention should be paid to the health risks of TCDF regarding obesity."

The resolution of global ocean models is, however, often restricted to O(1/4°) $\mathcal{O}(1/4{}^{\circ})$; this is too coarse to adequately resolve mixed‐layer processes, and we depend on parametrizations. One of such parametrizations is the mixed‐layer eddy (MLE) parametrization. Here, we compare the performance of two MLE parametrizations [Fox‐Kemper et al. (2011, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.09.002 hereon BFF11) and Bodner et al. (2023, https://doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-21-0297.1 hereon BOD23)], and document their impact in three global ocean simulations. Upon tuning, and diagnosing submesoscale‐permitting truth simulations, the MLE efficiency coefficient in BOD23 ranges between the values of 0.003–0.038, while 0.06 to 0.07 for BFF11. We find that the spatial distribution of mixed‐layer depth and ventilation of the abyssal ocean, using the ideal‐age tracer and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation as its proxy, are sensitive to the interaction between MLE parametrizations and ocean surface boundary‐layer mixing schemes."

This study investigates salt precipitation and the clogging phenomenon in fractured micromodels under various injection conditions. Results indicate that precipitated salt may clog the gas injection channel and decrease the effective permeability. Pore‐scale observations reveal the correlation between salt forms and their impacts on injectivity. Aggregated salt grows toward the direction of gas inflow and exhibits negative impacts on injectivity, while bulk salt grows within residual brine and shows little impact on relative permeability. An increase in gas injection rate weakens the negative impacts of precipitated salt on injectivity due to the suppression of brine backflow and salt creeping along the wall surface of the channel. Results deepen the understanding of salt‐induced injectivity impairment in saline formations."

We focused on biogeochemical cycles to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of EMF in China and determine the impact of environmental factors on EMF. Our findings indicate that climate and topography are the primary drivers of EMF. More importantly, over 66% of the study area is expected to experience a decline in EMF by the end of the twenty‐first century across various future climate scenarios. Under high‐emission scenarios in particular, EMF could be on an unsustainable trajectory, putting increased pressure on terrestrial ecosystems and exacerbating their degradation. These results highlight that more robust policies need to be designed to mitigate ecosystem degradation triggered by climate change."

Here, the authors demonstrate a new method for creating liquid photonic-molecule microlasers that combine low lasing threshold and enhanced sensitivity, achieving biomolecular detection limit down to attoMolar level. 
 Droplet microlasers, as promising tools for biophotonics and biomedical sciences, have witnessed rapid advances due to their flexible reconfigurability, high sensitivity to stimuli, and label-free biosensing ability. However, designing these biosensors with simultaneously critical properties of low lasing threshold, high spectral purity, and ultimate sensitivity remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile strategy to build liquid photonic molecules (LPMs) that combine all these features in a single device. We find that through tailoring the spectral Vernier overlap in size-mismatched droplets, this device enables single-mode lasing with a low threshold of ~610 nJ mm−2. The LPM lasers are engineered for dynamic tunability using a molecular isomerization strategy, which induces spectral mode hopping and thus yields a nearly ten-fold enhancement in spectral sensitivity over single droplets. Moreover, by leveraging the self-referenced intensity response of the LPM lasing modes, we demonstrate a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in biomolecular sensing, with a detection limit of 30 aM and a dynamic range spanning nine orders of magnitude. Our work offers exciting prospects for bio-integrated liquid sensors in diverse applications. Droplet microlasers are emerging as powerful tools for label-free biosensing.

Here, the authors show that orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) protects cartilage by suppressing IKKβ dependent NF κB signaling, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target. 
 Osteoarthritis (OA), characterised by cartilage destruction, is the most common degenerative joint disease. However, no effective disease-modifying OA therapy is currently available. Herein, we report orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) as a novel catabolic regulator of OA pathogenesis. NR0B2 expression was markedly downregulated in cartilage from patients with OA. Global or chondrocyte-specific Nr0b2 deletion in male mice exacerbated OA-related pain and structural changes following surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus, accompanied by increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13 expression in chondrocytes. Conversely, adeno-associated virus-mediated Nr0b2 overexpression in knee joints of male mice protected against accelerated knee OA caused by Nr0b2 deficiency. Mechanistically, NR0B2 inhibited IKKβ kinase activity via IKK complex interaction, downregulating NF-κB signalling. Our results demonstrate that NR0B2 has a chondroprotective role in OA progression by regulating matrix-degrading enzymes in an IKKβ/NF-κB-dependent manner, and gene therapy targeting Nr0b2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for OA.

 Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource for generating nonlinearity in quantum circuits and creating high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. Here, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. In this work, we study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the devices, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap. High kinetic inductance materials are widely used in superconducting circuits, yet their loss mechanisms are not fully understood.

 The automated discovery of chemical and catalytic reactions remains a major challenge in computational chemistry, particularly in complex systems where conventional methods struggle to identify optimal searching directions. Here, we propose Loxodynamics, a machine-learning-driven approach for reaction exploration via biased molecular dynamics. By leveraging the skewness of local probability distributions, Loxodynamics dynamically determines low-energy barrier directions, efficiently guiding the system toward metastable states. The core of our framework is Skewencoder, an Autoencoder augmented with a skewness-based loss function that extracts reaction coordinates from minimal sampling data. Through iterative sample-and-search cycles, the system adaptively maps the free energy surface, capturing finite-temperature effects critical to complex reactive environments. We validate our method across model potentials, gas-phase reactions (SN 2 and Diels-Alder), and catalytic alcohol dehydration in acidic chabazite under operando conditions. Loxodynamics provides a systematic framework for reaction discovery that addresses key limitations of conventional techniques, notably by allowing acceleration without elevated temperatures or a priori knowledge of collective variables.

 Unveiling interfaces at sub-nanometer scales is essential for advancing the understanding of complex chemical transformations. However, characterizing solid-liquid interfaces with high dimensional sensitivity and temporal resolution remains challenging, due to their dynamic nature and inaccessibility by conventional probes. Here we present an approach, Pattern-enhanced Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering, to overcome the challenges. Rooted in a “sample-as-optics” philosophy, this technique utilizes precisely engineered line-grating nanopatterns to modulate near-field X-ray illumination, coherently enhancing scattering signals from the line-gratings. We implement the method using Ni line-grating nanopatterns in electrochemical water oxidation. The periodic nanostructures serve as diffractive optical elements to reveal the Ni oxidation gradients and structural dynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. Finite-element simulations corroborate the observed trends by modeling variations in compositions and structures during electrocatalysis. Through integrating advanced sample design with coherent wave nature of soft X-rays, our approach opens accessible pathways to operando exploring chemical evolution and sub-nanometer dimensional variations simultaneously in electrochemical systems. This non-destructive method is efficient and element-specific, making it valuable for probing chemical and dimensional dynamics with appropriate modeling.

 The rapid growth of AI systems has been fueled by large-scale human data, intensifying concerns over the unauthorized use of intellectual property and privacy-sensitive content during model training. Auditing such misuse is particularly challenging since mainstream AI services operate as black boxes, exposing only generated outputs while concealing their training and inference processes. In this work, inspired by chemical isotope tracing, we introduce the concept of information isotopes to trace training data within opaque AI systems. We propose an information-isotope tracing framework that selectively marks target data elements and detects their propagation in model outputs, providing concrete evidence of data utilization under black-box access. Experiments on thirteen AI models across six datasets demonstrate that our method distinguishes training from non-training data with up to 99% accuracy and strong statistical significance (p < 0.01) using approximately 4,000 words of evidence.

This strategy not only addresses the long-standing challenge of harsh reaction conditions in conventional COFs synthesis methods, but also enables the integration of four different types of monomers in a one-pot process to create structurally diverse COFs.

 Paleoclimate records provide a critical long-term perspective on natural climate variability, essential for understanding contemporary climate variations. However, existing paleoclimate proxies lack sufficient spatial-temporal coverage for studying high-impact weather extremes like tropical cyclones (TCs). Here we introduce a multi-source framework that contextualizes the contemporary TC landfalls in East Asia against a multi-century baseline (1368–1911) reconstructed from historical documents. Leveraging pre-industrial and contemporary-era data, the analysis reveals that the relatively small shift toward earlier landfalls in the contemporary era (1946–2020) falls well within the range of fluctuations documented historically (1651–1900). Rather than indicating detectable anthropogenic changes, these results suggest the dominance of natural variability in modulating landfall timing. Our work also suggests consistent natural controls of TC timing in contemporary and pre-industrial eras. This consistency lends credibility to pre-industrial observational datasets and climate simulations, providing a robust template for assessing changes in the seasonality of high-impact extremes."

 Satellite-derived shoreline mapping is a common technique for quantifying geomorphic shoreline change. However, shoreline positions derived using moderate-resolution data have questionable accuracy, are influenced by metocean conditions, and are typically based on the boundary of a binarized spectral index rather than a visible geomorphic indicator, such as the high-water line (HWL). PlanetScope (PS) can visualize the location of the HWL by detecting the spectral reflectance differences between wet and dry sediment along a sandy beach surface due to its improved spatial resolution of 3 m/pixel. The accuracy of nine HWL proxy shoreline positions is assessed by comparison to a contemporaneous mean high water (MHW) shoreline delineated across Moro Beach, CA, using a digital elevation model created from RTK GPS-corrected Unmanned Aircraft System imagery. The offset between the PS-derived HWL and UAS-derived MHW positions (Δd) was measured every 10 m in the alongshore direction using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System for each HWL dataset. A significant exponential relationship was observed between Δd and the tide height at the time of PS image acquisition, whereby the HWL shoreline was located further landward (seaward) during higher (lower) tides. The HWL shoreline, when acquired at or near low tide, was spatially coincident with the MHW shoreline, the most reliable yet cost-prohibitive shoreline proxy. PlanetScope’s advancement in spatiotemporal resolution introduces a new approach to satellite-derived shoreline mapping, one that is based on a geomorphic proxy position and a minimized influence of tide heights."

 Human-landscape interactions in mountainous terrains are complex and multi-faceted. Settlements tend to focus on relatively gently undulating terrains, which are often found in areas where ground conditions are weak and thus substantial ground movements prevail. Interventions in these precarious landscapes, such as progressive expansion of interconnecting transport infrastructure, affect the stress balance and hydrology of already critical slopes, potentially enhancing their sensitivity to changes. The mountainous Bailong River Corridor (BRC) in Northwest China is dominated by large slow-moving landslides, where any transport infrastructure expansion has to transit through. A complex interplay of human, precipitation, and seismic factors determines the triggering dynamics of these large movements. This study integrates displacement time series, precipitation, and road distribution to quantify the impact of road emplacement on the sensitivity of large slow-moving landslides to precipitation regionally using panel regression analysis. It is shown that road disturbance significantly amplifies the sensitivity of landslide displacements to precipitation, and paved roads on the large slow-moving landslides increase their sensitivity to precipitation by 40%. Roads (both paved and unpaved) also reduce the threshold of antecedent cumulative precipitation required to trigger significant displacement, shortening the typical period from 132 days to only 120 days. The enhanced response frequency increases large reactivated landslide risk, and impacts road operation and management. This better understanding of the precipitation signature in the dynamics of large slow-moving landslides transited by roads contributes to improving future road planning, enhancing landslide risk mitigation, and strengthening urban resilience in vulnerable alpine environments."

 Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have limited effectiveness in geospatial question answering because text-based similarity retrieval cannot adequately represent spatial semantics such as topology and spatial context. To overcome this limitation, we propose GeoAgentic-RAG, a multi-agent framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform autonomous geospatial reasoning. The framework integrates natural language query parsing, semantic-spatial retrieval, and executable geospatial analysis within a unified, agent-based workflow. Multiple specialized agents collaboratively interpret user queries, retrieve relevant vector and raster datasets from a unified geospatial database, decompose analytical tasks, generate valid spatial logic, and produce interpretable analytical results. We evaluate GeoAgentic-RAG using a benchmark of geospatial retrieval, feature characterization, and spatial relational reasoning tasks in Nanjing and Guangzhou. The proposed framework achieves a pass rate of 85.3% and an answer correctness of 88.3%, outperforming conventional RAG methods and representative code-generation baselines. These results demonstrate that agent-based integration of retrieval and spatial analysis substantially improves the reliability of geospatial question answering and provides a practical framework for the next-generation intelligent GIS applications."

In this study, a ligand-mediated synergistic strategy for crystal facet and morphology regulation was employed to construct Co3O4 catalysts exposing distinct facets, including {001}, {011}, {111}, and {110}, and the catalytic activity of these catalysts was evaluated for the oxidation of toluene. Catalytic tests revealed that Co3O4–S achieved a T90 (temperature for 90% toluene conversion) of 259 °C, with the activity order being dodecahedron Co3O4–S {110} > flower-like Co3O4–H {011} > disciform Co3O4–Y {111} > cube-type Co3O4-L {001}. The superior catalytic activity of Co3O4–S is attributed to its exposed {110} crystal facets, which feature abundant oxygen vacancies, a higher concentration of Co3+ active sites, and a larger specific surface area. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the {110} crystal plane of Co3O4–S features the lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO {110} = 4.41 eV), the optimal O2 adsorption energy (Eads {110} = −1.88 eV), and toluene adsorption energy (Eads {110} = −2.38 eV), indicating strong ability for oxygen activation.

Enhanced organic substrate bioavailability upregulated microbial glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) pathways, resulting in a 2.5- to 5.3-fold increase in CO2 flux rate during oxic phases. However, Fe mineral crystallization and SOM transformation (e.g., lignin accumulation and labile organic substrate depletion) downregulated microbial energy metabolism (glycolysis, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation) compared to the static anoxic condition. The weakening of electron-donating capability decreased Fe reduction efficiency from 91.7% to 28.5%, thereby suppressing organic carbon release and •OH yields. Collectively, the effects of redox oscillations on the SOM transformation gradually diminished with cycle numbers. This study elucidated Fe mineral-microbe-SOM mechanistic linkages during redox oscillations, advancing theoretical frameworks for riparian ecosystem management."

We conducted fully hydro‐mechanically coupled triaxial tests on preserved fault material from scaly clay sections of the Opalinus Clay formation. The faulted rock exhibits no post‐peak weakening and maintains distributed strain accommodation through the reactivation of multiple, sub‐parallel tectonic micro‐shears. The hydro‐mechanical response is stress‐dependent, transitioning from dilative shearing at lower effective consolidation stresses to constant volumetric shearing at higher effective consolidation stresses, eventually resulting in critical state conditions. Shear strength analysis revealed the absence of cohesion in the scaly clay fabric, which reduces the rock's shear strength to below the residual strength of the intact rock. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for distributed, steady‐state shearing in naturally faulted clay shale and highlight the need to incorporate fabric‐dependent behavior into models of fault mechanics."

Our understanding of the interactions underlying these feedbacks at different spatial and temporal scales and the extent to which feedbacks affect Earth system functioning remains limited. Climate change and other anthropogenic pressures are already negatively affecting ecological processes in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. These will most likely be amplified in the coming decades under our current warming and socioeconomic pathways. The knock‐on impacts on ecological feedbacks have the potential to cause rapid perturbations to the Earth system, and may significantly impact the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Yet, the role of our planet's diverse ecological feedbacks in Earth system processes and the impacts of perturbations are major knowledge gaps. Here we review and synthesize current understanding of ecological feedbacks and how they affect physical and chemical processes. We then consider the implications of ecological feedbacks for analyses of anthropogenically‐driven change, development of scientific understanding and models, and provision of scientific advice for policymakers. Finally, we identify three priority future research areas for the rapid assessment and integration of ecological feedbacks in Earth system science: (a) including ecological feedbacks in assessments of global change and Earth system models, (b) incorporating ecological feedbacks across scales, and (c) producing projections suitable for policy advice. Overall, this review presents an urgent call to the scientific community for the rapid development of understanding of ecological feedbacks and integrated ecosystem—Earth system research."

However, past studies have not effectively separated the influences of anthropogenic management practices (AMP) from climate factors, leaving the actual temporal effects of climate change on crop phenology unclear. This study developed a novel framework that isolates AMP interference and quantifies real temporal effects to address this critical challenge. Focusing on China's major corn zones during 1990–2020, we applied the Hodrick‐Prescott (HP) filter to separate AMP influences and employed gray correlation analysis to quantify both cumulative and lagged temporal effects on two key phenological stages (the three‐leaf stage and maturity) of corn. Our results demonstrate that the HP filter effectively isolates AMP effects, revealing that raw data underestimate climate impacts by 25 ± 10%. AMP modulates temporal responses by extending cumulative time by 3–29 days while reducing lagged time by 2–11 days. Lagged effects dominating by 0.06 ± 0.02 compared to cumulative effects nationwide. Spatial analysis further uncovers significant heterogeneity: in the arid northwest, lagged time to temperature and solar radiation exceed cumulative time by 12–18 days, whereas in the northern plains, cumulative time prevails. Notably, the “Qinling‐Huaihe Line” emerges as a key demarcation, with northern zones exhibiting longer cumulative and shorter lagged time relative to the south. These findings advance our understanding of climate‐induced phenological shifts and offer actionable insights for precision agriculture and global food security."

 Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) involves complex and heterogeneous alterations in brain functional organization. A possible explanation is the disruption of individualized brain maturation during adolescence, which typically transitions from lower-order sensory to higher-order association regions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI data using advanced matrix decomposition techniques to extract organizational gradients, temporal dynamics, and information flow. Clustering sensory–association gradient features in our main sample (NMDD = 302 and NControls = 207; ages 11-17) revealed two subtypes. Subtype 1 showed bottom‑up (sensory‑to‑association) flow, reduced synergy but heightened redundancy in sensory cortices, and a highly modular yet globally inefficient network—patterns consistent with aberrant sensory processing and impaired integration. Subtype 2 instead displayed a top‑down (association‑to‑sensory) flow, reduced synergy in association areas, elevated redundancy in sensory regions, and network efficiency between subtype 1 and healthy controls, suggesting compensatory higher‑order engagement. Subtypes also differed in age-related changes, clinical profiles, and neurobiological processing. These patterns were largely replicated in an independent sample (NMDD = 73 and NControls = 28). Overall, the sensory-association axis distinguishes MDD subtypes, integrating functional heterogeneity, cortical dynamics, developmental trajectories, and genetic influences, offering new insights for pathophysiology and precision psychiatry. In this study, the authors identify two biologically distinct subtypes of adolescent major depressive disorder by analyzing interactions between sensory and higher-order association brain regions, offering new insights for the development of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

 Effectively combating soil erosion under intensifying extreme precipitation requires moving beyond broad-scale assessments to precision-targeted interventions. Current approaches often fail to capture the differentiated erosion responses across diverse landscapes, limiting the efficacy of conservation investments. Here, we introduce a novel framework that combines modeling (RUSLE) with Explainable artificial intelligence (LightGBM model with SHAP method) and multi-criteria decision analysis to prioritize soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts. Applied to 20 SWC zones in the ecologically critical Yunnan Province, China, our analysis reveals that maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5) is the paramount driver of erosion, superseding other precipitation metrics. We uncover distinct regional response mechanisms: erosion in northwestern cold alpine zones is governed by cumulative rainfall, while erosion in temperate and tropical zones is triggered by short-duration, high-intensity events. This mechanistic understanding enabled the robust identification of the Northwest Alpine Gorge and Western Broad Valley zones as highest-priority areas demanding urgent action. By systematically diagnosing the primary climatic drivers and identifying the most vulnerable regions, our framework provides a powerful, replicable blueprint for optimizing conservation resources and enhancing climate resilience in mountainous ecosystems globally."

In the German Baltic Sea, three main dump sites with munition piles exist close to Kiel and Lübeck. This paper presents the first dataset of its kind. It contains information on the munitions and demonstrates that the piles vary significantly among sites. Various maritime uses operate close to the munitions, particularly marine protected areas and sediment dumping. The paper shows that several piles require attention by the authorities. 
 For the first time, this paper presents two datasets that detail the distribution of piles of dumped munitions in the German Baltic Sea (Lübeck Bay and north of Kiel Fjord). Multibeam echosounder data and photomosaics were collected between 2017 and 2024. Dataset A contains basic information on 484 known and potential munition piles and their geographic context, with a focus on maritime activities in their surroundings. Dataset B is a subset of the former, where visual investigation enabled the detailed assessment of 39 munition piles by experts, so that a greater level of detail on the properties of the munitions was collected. The paper contextualises the data in terms of the munitions' properties and their geospatial surroundings. It identifies a ""typical"" munition pile to be inhomogeneous, most likely layered, with partially buried objects and munition casings that are weakly corroded. Munition pile properties were found to differ between dump sites—particularly in terms of the number and size of objects on a pile. Based on the information in datasets A and B, it was possible to extrapolate the number of objects on all (potential) munition piles across Lübeck Bay. The assessment demonstrates that survey data do not match historic recordings in archival documents. Distance measurements reveal that munition piles are located close to protected areas and sediment deposit sites, while subsea cables are located furthest away. The paper identifies six clusters of munition piles, two of which are located in areas with very high traffic density (> 2,000 vessels annually). These data are presented to encourage scientific debate on holistic management strategies, clearance approaches, cost estimates, policy relevance, and prioritisation of remediation activities. The findings show that several munition piles require attention by the respective authorities."

Thirty-one PFAS congeners were analyzed, and PFAS exposure profiles differed across matrices. Significant positive dose–response relationships were observed for long-chain perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) between hair and serum. Specifically, each unit increase in PFSAs concentrations in the three hair segments was associated with 74 (95% CI: 36.6–121.5), 14.9 (95% CI: 4.3–26.6), and 11.5% (95% CI: 3.1–20.6) higher average serum PFSAs concentrations corresponding to 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9 months prior to sampling, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the potential toxicity of 13 prevalent PHCZs utilizing a network toxicology approach, which revealed shared molecular targets associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Molecular docking simulations assessed the binding affinities of these PHCZs for eight key PD-related targets, identifying monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) as a critical target. Among the dihalogenated PHCZs, 2,7-dibromocarbazole (2,7-BCZ) exhibited the highest binding affinity to MAOB. Comparative molecular docking and dynamics simulations suggest that the inhibition of MAOB activity by 2,7-BCZ is a potential initiating event in PHCZ-induced neurological disorders. In vivo experiments confirmed that 2,7-BCZ exposure highly correlates with α-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD pathology. Transcriptomic sequencing of 2,7-BCZ-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, combined with analysis of public PD microarray data, identified shared transcriptional alterations in genes including CLSTN2, CBLN1, AGTR1, DLK1, and DDC. By integrating pathways from PD-related targets of PHCZs, differentially expressed genes in 2,7-BCZ-exposed cells, and public PD data sets, we further elucidated key biological pathways through which 2,7-BCZ may contribute to PD pathogenesis, particularly dopaminergic synapse function and neurodevelopmental regulation. Collectively, this study not only highlights the potential role of PHCZs in PD, elucidating the potential biological mechanisms by which PHCZs may exacerbate PD, but also exemplifies an innovative, animal-sparing approach using New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) to assess environmental pollutants’ risks in neurodegenerative adverse outcomes."

In this work, we systematically investigate electrode design and operational parameters governing the performance of EIP desalination using both experiments and modeling. We first evaluated the effect of carbon and polymer fractions on ionic and electronic transport within the cation-shuttling electrodes, demonstrating that optimal performance requires balancing ion mobility through the polymer phase and the electronic conductivity and ion storage capacity provided by the carbon phase. We then assessed the impact of electrode capacity and conductivity on EIP performance by varying the ratio of activated carbon and carbon black, showing that desalination performance is relatively stable over a wide range of capacity and is only undermined at extremely low capacity. Finally, we analyze the role of cycle time and show that EIP has similar specific energy consumption with very different cycle times as long as electrolysis is prevented. Overall, these results establish guiding principles for rational electrode design and operation to achieve optimal EIP performance."

This study investigates DA production and trophic transfer in the Pearl River Estuary, combining chemotaxonomy, morphological identification, ITS1 metabarcoding, and HPLC–MS/MS analysis. We revealed strong seasonal and spatial heterogeneity in Pseudonitzschia assemblages, identifying Pseudonitzschia cuspidata Clade III as a dominant DA producer with an estimated in situ cellular quota of 0.1–0.8 pg cell–1 for the community. DA was ubiquitously detected across trophic levels, with summer maxima in phytoplankton to zooplankton, crustaceans, and mollusks, exceeding safety thresholds with 24.1 mg kg–1 in scallops. Baseline DA contamination persisted year-round, with this chronic risk amplified by increased summer diatom biomass. Crucially, DA production was governed by optimal salinity and temperature and linked to nutrient stoichiometry rather than absolute nutrient concentration; chronic high nutrient levels showed a negative correlation with DA production. These environmental drivers also influenced DA transfer efficiency, with summer conditions amplifying contamination despite sub-bloom cell densities. These findings reveal underestimated risks in subtropical estuaries, providing a critical framework for monitoring and managing DA contamination under climate variability."

Here, we identify the hidden key membrane properties governing perchlorate rejection by using four commercial NF membranes in natural and synthetic waters. Perchlorate rejection was generally low, as it is intrinsically disadvantaged in inevitable co-ion competition with dominant anions, particularly sulfate and chloride, owing to its low hydration energy and typically much lower concentration. Mitigating such co-ion competition is therefore central to enhancing perchlorate rejection. Reducing membrane negative charge density partially alleviated co-ion competition, as evidenced by an increase in perchlorate rejection from ∼20% to ∼48% for the small-pore DK membrane when natural water pH decreased from 8.8 to 6.4. Beyond pore and charge effects, however, ion–membrane interactions were found to be comparably decisive. Specifically, the highly rigid and weakly hydrophilic active layer of the DK membrane impeded perchlorate adsorption, suppressing competitive permeation of monovalent anions and thereby enhancing perchlorate rejection. These findings indicate that attenuating ion–membrane interactions through enhancing structural rigidity offers a viable strategy for achieving higher removal of perchlorate and other weakly hydrated anions, providing new mechanistic insights for NF membrane design."

Herein, we developed a colorimetric sensor array based on gold nanoparticles (nano-Au) that utilizes UV–vis spectral shifts induced by interactions with phosphorus species. Four molecular modifiers, i.e., cysteamine (CS), neodymium (Nd), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and tributylhexadecylphosphonium bromide (THPB), were strategically incorporated into the nano-Au receptors to generate distinct response patterns via coordination, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic attractions. These optical “fingerprints” were deciphered using pattern recognition techniques. The sensor array successfully differentiated 11 phosphorus species (including organophosphonic acids, organophosphate esters, and inorganic phosphates, with 100% classification accuracy for the 11 target species within the tested training set) at concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 50 mg/L, both individually and in mixtures; it exhibits high sensitivity, with detection limits ranging from 0.17 to 0.94 mg/L for the 11 phosphorus species. The sensor array demonstrated robust anti-interference capability, achieving recoveries between 90%–96% in both simulated and real water matrices.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are critical industrial chemicals with superior functionalities but proven hazards. Trade-offs between functionalities and hazards constitute the challenge in PFAS green substitution, known as multiparameter optimization. The essential goal of multiparameter optimization is discerning chemicals for which enhancements in one property invariably lead to degradations of others. In statistical parlance, the chemicals constitute the Pareto optimal frontiers (POFs). Based on generative machine learning algorithms, this study developed a method named ParetoGen for propelling POFs of multiobjective optimization issues in green alternative designs. Results demonstrate the ParetoGen stably and significantly pushed the POFs of functionality-hazard trade-offs in the design of green alternatives to PFASs. Compared with existing PFAS alternatives, structures generated by the ParetoGen exhibit lower hazards and enhanced functionalities. By introducing the Pareto optimization theory into the molecular design of green alternatives, this study establishes a universal theoretical foundation and evaluation methodology for green chemical substitution. The findings reveal valuable insights into the chemical structural design of PFASs, and the developed method can be employed in general chemical structural design tasks."

Our previous study was the first to discover that PM2.5 induces a decrease in microtubule dynamics and promotes the formation of multinucleated cells in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). To elucidate the intrinsic mechanism by which PM2.5 causes multinucleation in bronchial epithelial cells, we conducted in vivo experiments using C57BL/6J mice exposed to PM2.5 via intratracheal instillation, as well as in vitro mechanistic studies using BEAS-2B cells. To verify the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, we employed PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and GSK-3β-overexpressing BEAS-2B cells. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, an increase in multinucleated cells was observed following PM2.5 treatment. Additionally, PM2.5 directly led to a higher proportion of polymerized microtubules and abnormal microtubule aggregation. In the mechanistic studies, we mainly investigated the impact of PM2.5 on the microtubule dynamics. The results demonstrated that PM2.5 activated the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, which inhibited the deacetylase enzyme HDAC6, resulting in excessive microtubule acetylation. Simultaneously, PM2.5 induced the dissociation of microtubule-associated protein MAP1B from the microtubules. Both processes contributed to the overstabilization of microtubule proteins. However, mitosis requires highly dynamic microtubules, characterized by rapid switching between growth and shrinkage. Therefore, the overstabilization of microtubule proteins induced by PM2.5 reduced the microtubule dynamics and disrupted spindle function during mitosis, ultimately leading to mitotic failure and the formation of multinucleated cells."

Experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a new elementary step for main group catalysis wherein a phosphine radical cation activates the alkene to nucleophilic amination by the azole, a step otherwise associated with transition metals.

This highlights the need for revised economic strategies to improve nitrogen management. 
 Nitrogen, serving as both a vital nutrient and a potent pollutant, has an important role in the pursuit of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the comprehensive impact of nitrogen on SDG achievement remains relatively unclear. Here we utilize the Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) model to build a framework for assessing the influence of nitrogen on SDGs in China during 2020. Our analysis reveals that nitrogen use and loss in China affect 11 out of the 17 SDGs, with notable regional disparities. In general, regions with higher economic development perform better in the nitrogen-related SDG (SDG-N) scores within the economy dimension, but score lower in the society and environment dimensions. Our simulations indicate that comprehensive nitrogen management is crucial to foster synergy among SDGs, which could enhance SDG-N index scores in China by 8–26%, resulting in substantial national benefits, including US$162 billion (US$98–208 billion) in savings on fertilizer and food imports, increased agricultural yields, improved public health, enhanced ecosystem resilience and climate mitigation. Importantly, these benefits can be achieved with a modest net implementation cost of only US$34 billion (US$27–41 billion), making it a cost-effective and sustainable solution for advancing China’s SDG agenda.

Disruption of this pathway impairs male fertility, and pathogenic ASB9 variants are found in infertile men. 
 The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) represents an evolutionarily conserved machinery governing proteostasis through spatiotemporal regulation of protein degradation. While spermatogenesis involves multilayered regulatory mechanisms spanning translation to dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs), the identity of UPS-associated E3 ligases orchestrating germ cell-specific protein turnover remains elusive. Here, we identify a testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising elongin B/C, Cullin-2 (CUL2), RING-box protein-1 (RBX1), and SOCS box protein ASB9, designated ECSASB9. Genetic ablation of ECSASB9 in mice via ubiquitous Asb9 knockout (KO) or spermatid-specific elongin B/C conditional KO disrupts spermiogenesis and compromises fertility. Mechanistic studies reveal that ECSASB9 engages tubulin beta 4 A (TUBB4A) through substrate recognition, catalyzing K48-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 379 (K379) to promote proteasomal degradation. Notably, Tubb4aK379R knock-in (KI) mice phenocopy the spermiogenesis defects observed upon ECSASB9 deficiency. Clinically, we identify three hemizygous missense variants in X-linked ASB9 among Chinese males with idiopathic infertility. Male mice bearing orthologous ASB9 variant exhibit oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and subfertility, mirroring human phenotypes. Taken together, our findings establish ECSASB9 as an important regulator of spermatogenic proteostasis and provide mechanistic insights into UPS-mediated tissue-specific degradation, while implicating ASB9 variants in male infertility pathogenesis. A testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, ECSASB9, governs spermiogenesis by promoting TUBB4A degradation.

Here, the authors use data on locations frequented by people who inject drugs in New Delhi, India to model different service prioritisation strategies. 
 People who inject drugs (PWID) in India continue to experience high HIV incidence while coverage of HIV and harm reduction services within this population remains suboptimal in many settings, highlighting the need to identify novel service delivery points. To evaluate the effectiveness of spatially focused upscaling of interventions at observed venues where PWID injected drugs together, we developed an individual-based dynamic transmission model of HIV informed by detailed injection network, service engagement, and injection venue attendance data collected in a sociometric study of PWID (n = 2512) in New Delhi, India. HIV incidence was simulated for different spatial targeting strategies and with increasing service coverage at injection venues according to UNAIDS/UNODC goals. We identified significant decreases in predicted HIV incidence when deploying interventions at frequently visited injection venues (from 6.8 cases/100 person-years to 2.7/100PY for full service coverage at the most-visited venue, and further down to 1.3/100PY for 12 most-visited venues). Prioritizing the most visited venues stratified by spatial clusters provided services to a larger number of individuals versus prioritizing the overall most visited venues, suggesting that service expansion at venues that are spatially distinct with minimal population overlap has a slightly larger impact on reducing HIV incidence. Spatial targeting of HIV services may improve their effectiveness. Here, the authors use data on locations frequented by people who inject drugs in New Delhi, India to model different service prioritisation strategies."

Here, the authors characterize a cross-sectional delineation of microbiota changes across normal, polyp, and colorectal cancer tissues. 
 Emerging evidence suggests that tissue-resident microbiota (TRM) is associated with tumor biology; however, their distribution and compositional characteristics across different colorectal tissue types remain incompletely defined. Here, we conducted a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis of TRM distribution and abundance across 1134 clinical specimens, including normal mucosa, precancerous polyps, and colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Our results reveal distinct microbial profiles among these diagnostic groups, with consistent differences in community composition between normal, polyps, and CRC samples. Integrative analyses further identified microbial signatures capable of distinguishing tissue categories and reflected differences in the local tumor microenvironment. In contrast, intratumoral microbiota composition showed subtle variation across established tumor stages and was not associated with clinical outcomes. These findings define diagnostic group-associated patterns of TRM in colorectal tissues and establish a foundation for future mechanistic investigations into the biological roles of TRM in colorectal cancer.

 Altermagnetic multiferroics, hosting coexisting spin-splitting bands and ferroelectric polarization, offer a promising route to magnetoelectric coupling beyond conventional relativistic spin–orbit mechanism. However, the lack of a unified principle connecting ferroelectric switching symmetry to spin-band topology has impeded rational material design. Here, we establish a universal symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin–ferroelectric couplings in altermagnets into three fundamental types: decoupling, pseudo-time-reversal coupling, and asymmetric momentum mapping. This classification stems directly from the relation between ferroelectric switching operators and the spin Laue group, creating a decisive symmetry-to-function paradigm. First-principles calculations on bilayer MnPS3 confirm the framework, showing that distinct ferroelectric switching paths produce characteristic spin-band reconstructions and discriminable electrical transport signatures. The universality of the framework is further validated in BiFeO3. Our work provides a predictive design principle for voltage-programmable spintronics, effectively transforming ferroelectric symmetry from a structural descriptor into a dynamic functional control knob for altermagnetic spin states. The authors establish a universal symmetry framework that classifies spin–ferroelectric couplings in altermagnetic multiferroics into three fundamental types: decoupling, pseudo-time-reversal coupling, and asymmetric momentum mapping."

 The demand for bio-inspired neuromorphic systems drives research on artificial neuronal devices with dual excitatory/inhibitory capabilities. Although perovskite memristors show promise, interfacial barriers and rapid ion migration hinder modulation. This study addresses these challenges through atomic-scale cathode engineering, developing perovskite-based memristor (Au/Ni1-rGO/MAPbI3/ITO) with nickel single-atom modified reduced graphene oxide (Ni1-rGO) cathode. The Ni–O configuration of Ni1-rGO with a single Ni atom anchored on rGO, modulates the electronic properties of rGO, reducing Schottky barrier via energy band alignment for bipolar current symmetry and spatially confining iodide ion migration through a high diffusion energy barrier (2.912 eV), conferring 780 ms relaxation. The device achieves 1,000 distinct conductance states and emulates interlayer connections and bidirectional signal transmission in feedback neuronal networks. We demonstrate neuromorphic functionalities: unsupervised competitive learning exceeds 50% clustering accuracy, while cooperative learning solves NP-hard problem 6× faster than simulated annealing, establishing an atomic-engineered approach for high-efficiency neuromorphic hardware.

However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the costs of bio-jet including but not limited to costs of feedstock, transformation costs and the competition with co-products of bio-jet that may be demanded elsewhere in the transportation or energy sectors. This study models alternative trajectories of bio-jet adoption in the US aviation industry by 2050 through the use of a global integrated multi sector dynamics model. Three bio-jet production and consumption pathways are presented- soybean oil to jet, corn ethanol to jet (ETJ) and Fisher–Tropsch-based bio-jet, with each pathway explicitly considering the co-production of renewable diesel and renewable gasoline alongside the bio-jet. Without explicit actions or technology changes to offset the technology cost of bio-jet, scenarios where bio-jet displaces refined liquids result in higher aviation fuel prices (ranging from a 25% increase to 120% increase by mid-century) and lower demand (ranging from −14% to −43%). Corn ethanol will play an important role in the US if large scale amounts of bio-jet are to be produced with smaller effects on demand and prices. While scenarios with high levels of bio-jet availability without the availability of ETJ in the US can significantly reduce emissions in the aviation sector, these reductions are achieved more through the reduction in overall aviation fuel demand rather than technology adoption."

The current study explored the potential of deploying a coupled modelling framework for the estimation and forecasting of this parameter. The framework showed promising potential in addressing the challenge of estimating and forecasting the under-ice discharge. 
 Year-round river discharge estimation and forecasting is a critical component of sustainable water resource management. In cold-climate regions such as Canada, this task is complicated by dynamic river-ice conditions which alter channel hydraulics and render open-water rating curves invalid. Some methods such as backwater-adjusted rating curves and ice thickness-based rating curves have been developed. However, these methods are site specific and subjective to human judgement. It is therefore an active field of research and development. The current study develops and assesses the performance of a river ice forecasting system for the Chaudière River in Quebec based on coupled hydrologic-hydraulic modelling approach within the Delft Flood Early Warning System (Delft-FEWS) platform. The current configuration of the system integrates (i) meteorological products such as the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS); (ii) a hydrological module implemented through the HydrOlOgical Prediction LAboratory (HOOPLA), a multi-model based hydrological modelling framework; and (iii) hydraulic module implemented through a 1D steady and unsteady HEC-RAS river ice models. The system produces ensemble forecasts for discharge and water level and provides flexibility to modify various dynamic parameters such as discharge timeseries, and ice properties.  Performance of the coupled modelling approach was assessed against “Perfect Forecast” for selected winter events between 2020 and 2023 using the root mean square error (RMSE) and percent bias (PBias) metrics. The hydrologic module of the system consistently underestimated the under-ice discharges.  This can be explained by the inherent uncertainty in the under-ice discharge estimates used as observations as well as uncertainty in the model states.  The hydraulic module had an RMSE between 0.1–0.5 m. The higher error in RMSE can be attributed to the uncertainty in the ice thickness estimates at one of the stations. The PBias analysis of the hydraulic module also confirmed that the forecasted discharges were under-estimated by the hydrologic module."

Secondary effluent-constructed wetlands (SECWs) offer a sustainable solution for advanced nitrogen removal from this low-ammonia effluent, yet the functional role of comammox bacteria remains largely unexplored in such habitats. This study investigated the abundance, activity, kinetics, and ecological adaptations of comammox in typical SECWs. Quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing revealed that comammox Nitrospira ubiquitously presented across all samples, even numerically dominated over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria/archaea (AOB/AOA). Consistent results from double-inhibition assays and DNA-stable isotope probing microcosm experiments indicated that comammox actively participated in nitrification, contributing 2.03–3.89 times those of canonical nitrifiers. Substrate kinetic and metagenomic analyses identified the Nitrospira nitrosa cluster as the sole active comammox population in SECWs, which exhibited relatively lower ammonia affinity (Km(app) = 0.055 ± 0.007 mg N/L) than other comammox species and distinct genomic adaptations to SECW-specific stressors, potentially explaining its dominance. Compared to AOB, comammox combines high substrate affinity with environmental resilience, aligning with K-strategist traits that enable it to outperform r-strategist AOB in SECWs. Overall, it is within this niche differentiation among comammox species and nitrifiers that the N. nitrosa cluster numerically and functionally dominated the nitrification process in SECWs, positioning comammox Nitrospira as pivotal biocatalysts for advanced nitrogen removal in engineered ecosystems."

Generally, the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels manifest as sharp oscillations or gradual variations depending on the mass transfer rate. Unlike sharp DO oscillations, the impact of gradual DO variations remains unclear. This study demonstrated that gradual DO variations (47.3%) enhanced 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) attenuation in iron-rich soils compared with sharp DO oscillations (31.2%). Hydroxyl radicals (•OH) derived from surface-bound Fe(II) oxygenation were the primary oxidants in both systems. However, the gradual DO variation promoted surface-bound Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycling, favoring steady hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation and its selective decomposition to •OH in kinetics, while the sharp DO oscillations showed declined H2O2 generation and increased termination reactions producing nonradical species (e.g., Fe(IV)). Thermodynamic calculations confirmed that Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycling sustained the surface-bound Fe(II) reduction capacity by suppressing amorphous Fe(III) oxide formation under gradual DO variations, thereby providing an efficient thermodynamic force to maintain favorable reaction kinetics for •OH generation. These findings broaden the scope of natural contaminant attenuation, extending its relevance beyond narrow, sharp redox oscillation zones to wider regions governed by gradual DO fluctuations in the subsurface soils."

We investigated these mechanisms using synthetic birnessite, a natural analogue of hexagonal layered Mn oxides, in controlled laboratory experiments in seawater under three scenarios reflecting different OAE deployment strategies: direct olivine-birnessite contact, exposure to simulated olivine leachate, and repeated alkaline inputs. Results revealed a dual role for birnessite. It accelerated olivine dissolution through proton-releasing cation exchange and surface-mediated Fe(II) oxidation. However, this proton generation consumed alkalinity, diminishing carbon sequestration efficiency. Regarding trace metals, birnessite efficiently scavenged Ni (>50%) and Co (>99%) but markedly enhanced Cr mobility (reaching ∼0.05 μmol kg–1), likely via oxidation to more toxic Cr(VI). Crucially, sustained Fe(II) supply mitigated this risk by reducing >50% of Cr(VI) back to Cr(III). Birnessite maintained structural stability throughout. While natural sediment systems are expected to introduce additional complexities, our findings underscore potential environmental trade-offs: Cr(VI) accumulation could exceed ecological thresholds in poorly flushed environments. This study provides foundational mechanistic insights into olivine-sediment interactions, establishing key parameters for modeling OAE safety in complex marine environments."

Laszakovits;Silvan Arn;Ralf Kägi;Silvan Liechti;Flora Wille;Kristopher McNeill;Michael Sander,Temperature Dependence of Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) Biodegradation in Agricultural Soils,"Biodegradable polyesters are increasingly used in agricultural applications with soil biodegradation as the targeted postapplication end-of-life. Soil biodegradability is typically established in laboratory soil incubations at constant temperatures exceeding those in many field soils, highlighting the need for robust temperature-biodegradability relationships to transfer laboratory-determined biodegradation rates to field conditions. This work systematically assesses the temperature dependence of the biodegradation of three poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) variants, containing differing molar amounts of 3-hydroxyhexanoate (where x = 5, 9, and 12%) in three agricultural soils. Scanning electron microscopy images of PHBHH9 films incubated for 18 days showed increasing film surface colonization by fungi and/or filamentous bacteria from 5 to 15, 25, and 35 °C, with dense hyphal networks and film disintegration at the higher tested temperatures. Soil biodegradation of PHBHHx powders over the same temperature range was followed by extracting and quantifying residual PHBHHx mass over time by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fitting of these residual masses with a shoulder-log linear kinetic model yielded PHBHHx-variant-independent initial lag phases and biodegradation rate constants. Increasing the temperature shortened the initial lag phase and increased the subsequent rate of PHBHHx biodegradation. Arrhenius rate law analysis revealed soil-specific activation energies that correspond to approximately 2- to 5-fold changes in biodegradation rates per 10 °C. This work establishes temperature as a key abiotic factor controlling polyester biodegradation rates in soils and guides more accurate extrapolation of laboratory-determined biodegradation rates at elevated temperatures to field conditions."

Franca,The Shapes and Sizes of Macroplastics and Other Litter in Rivers,"Limited data exist on the physical and geometric properties of river macrolitter. To resolve this, we reveal the physical–structural relationships of river macrolitter using two of the most comprehensive data sets generated to date. First, we dissect the properties of river litter using a detailed data set of 14,052 riverbank items, for which their dimensions (longest L1, intermediate L2, shortest L3) and physical characteristics (mass, volume, density) are determined. These properties are mapped onto a data set of 239,290 River-OSPAR items collected from 22 river and riverbank sites across four continents, using multivariate statistics and database density estimates. We then identify the most persistent River-OSPAR litter categories, together with kernel density estimations of their principal dimensions and geometries. Results show that only 25 River-OSPAR categories account for 80% of all river and riverbank litter, with soft plastic pieces/films and candy, snack, and crisp packaging being the most abundant. Flat, 2D-shaped macrolitter are the most persistent litter items, with 48% of the top 25 items sharing similar geometric properties: L1 between 1–10 cm, and a flatness ratio (L3/L2) of <0.4. In practice, these are flat objects with two larger dimensions and a third that is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller. This large, physically based data set enables the prioritization of which shapes, sizes, and densities should be targeted by future plastic transport models, informing what plastics may be missing in current monitoring protocols and the design of river cleanup technologies."

Here, we investigated the association between BDE 47 and MASLD using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and explored the potential mechanisms through network toxicology and multiomics analyses. Individuals with higher serum BDE 47 levels showed positive associations with MASLD and advanced fibrosis. Network toxicology predicted that BDE 47 perturbed lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby contributing to malignant progression. In vitro, integrated lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that BDE 47 disrupted lysosome, sphingolipid, and cholesterol metabolism, leading to lipid accumulation. Additionally, BDE 47 exposure enhanced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and the development of immunosuppressive environment, which may facilitate MASLD-to-HCC progression. Pharmacological experiments further demonstrated that increased sphingolipid synthesis and impaired cholesterol efflux played important roles in BDE 47-induced lipid accumulation. Notably, only the parent BDE 47 compound was detected in exposed cells. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic evidence of the carcinogenic potential of BDE 47 and its role in liver disease progression."

A systematic evaluation of the NCD burden attributable to e-cigarettes is critically needed to inform policy. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the burden of major NCDs attributable to e-cigarette use between 2010 and 2021 and project future trends through 2050. This study used deidentified 2010–2021 NCD data from GBD 2021. We applied a comparative risk assessment framework to estimate the burden of NCDs attributable to e-cigarette use and used a generalized additive model to project future trends. We found that between 2010 and 2021, global prevalence of current e-cigarette use increased from 0.90% (95% CI, 0.46–1.48) to 8.73% (95% CI, 5.24–12.99). During this period, prevalent cases and DALYs for major NCDs showed consistent upward trends worldwide. Notably, NCD DALYs attributable to e-cigarette use increased from 2010 to 2021. Projections indicate that this concerning trend will continue, with marked increases in e-cigarette-attributable NCD burden anticipated through 2050. This study demonstrates the urgent need to incorporate electronic cigarette control measures into NCD prevention strategies, particularly targeting adolescent populations where usage rates are rising most rapidly."

Dysregulated lipid metabolism in activated microglia contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PM0.1-induced lipid metabolic disruption remain poorly understood. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging regulators of lipid metabolism, prompting us to investigate their role in PM0.1-exposed microglia. In vitro models of PM0.1-treated microglia (HMC3 and BV2) were established. We identified circDNAJC5, a lipid metabolism–associated circRNA, as significantly downregulated during PM0.1-induced lipid metabolic disruption. circDNAJC5 silencing aggravated lipid dysregulation, whereas its overexpression mitigated PM0.1-induced metabolic alterations. circDNAJC5 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-98–5p, thereby regulating sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), a key enzyme in the sphingolipid signaling pathway. circDNAJC5 downregulation and lipid metabolic abnormalities were further validated in the brains of PM-exposed mice and AD mouse models, as well as in the blood of elderly individuals with cognitive impairment and hyperlipidemia. These findings highlight an epigenetic mechanism linking environmental exposure to microglial lipid metabolism and suggest circDNAJC5 as a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders."

We estimate geomagnetic reversal frequency from 0 to 155 Ma using adaptive‐bandwidth kernel density estimation (AKDE) to evaluate data sparseness and to assess how reversal frequency changes when recently identified geomagnetic reversals are incorporated into the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) data set. AKDE is a two‐stage procedure that uses an initial density estimator based on an initial (pilot) bandwidth. We found that the pilot bandwidth determined using cross‐validation is stable with respect to data set length. The AKDE results obtained based on the cross‐validated pilot bandwidth reveal four troughs after the Cretaceous Normal Superchron, spaced 13.5–15.0 Myr apart and corresponding to relatively long chrons (>0.8 Myr). One trough near 32 Ma becomes less distinct after the four recently identified reversals are added to the data set. This sensitivity suggests that troughs in the frequency curve may indicate missing geomagnetic reversals."

In the mid‐latitude Northeast Pacific (NEP), persistent sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) have attracted wide attention in recent decades and have been linked to tropical variability. Considering their important climate impacts and potential linkages, this study investigates the non‐stationary relationship between SSTAs in the NEP (SSTANEP) and ENSO using correlation decomposition and Linear Inverse Modeling. Our analysis reveals notable shifts in the SSTANEP‐ENSO linkage during 1961–2022. Before 1980, SSTANEP exhibited minimal influence on ENSO evolution. Conversely, during 1981–2000, SSTANEP substantially contributed to ENSO development, primarily via the North Pacific Meridional Mode. However, after 2000, this relationship has weakened again, suggesting a complex interplay between SSTANEP and ENSO. Understanding these relationship shifts is essential for advancing ENSO predictability and thereby enhancing the reliability of seasonal‐to‐decadal climate prediction."

However, uncertainties in hydrological models and a lack of consideration for HWLM in climate models have limited the estimation and attribution of the changes in global‐scale flood risks. Based on a multi‐model ensemble of daily discharge simulations and projections from the latest Inter‐Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP 3), our estimation shows that flood risks significantly increased (slightly decreased) in the north (south) of 50°N during 1971–2019 when considering the combined effects of ACC and HWLM. Under continuing global warming (from 1.5°C to 3°C), 59.6%–69.4% of the global land area would witness an increasing flood risk, with 71.9%–87.5% of basin‐level risks attributable to anthropogenic activities, particularly in arid/tropical zones. Meanwhile, the flood risk in 38.8% of the global land area shows the anthropogenic signals before 2065. This increase is enlarged by greater flood magnitude and variability in the future, with flood magnitude being the dominant factor in most regions. We suggest that hydrological services and policymakers should implement adaptive strategies that consider anthropogenic increases in flood magnitude and variability, utilizing detected signals to guide global flood‐risk mitigation."

 Clonally expanded CD4+ T-cells harboring rebound-competent HIV persist lifelong during ART1-5. Latency is considered the principal barrier to viral eradication and has resisted pharmacological reversal6,7, yet sustained immune pressure appears to erode reservoirs8-15. Recent advances have yielded glimpses into exceptionally rare reservoir-harboring cells, implicating pro-survival properties in persistence16-18. Here, we isolate and characterize authentic reservoir clones (ARCs) that robustly proliferate and accumulate while producing infectious virus, without overtly succumbing to cytopathicity. At any moment, only small fractions of ARCs expressed HIV proteins, a state associated with conserved host transcriptional programs but remarkably refractory to potent T-cell stimulation. Nevertheless, sustained co-culture with a CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone substantially culled proliferating ARCs, revealing time-integrated vulnerability to immune pressure. The corresponding ex vivo CD8+ T-cell response was poorly cytotoxic and in vivo erosion of ARCs occurred only slowly. A regulatory T-cell ARC displayed pronounced cell-intrinsic resistance to CTL—a longstanding hypothesis now directly demonstrated—linked to low oxidative stress and reversed with deferoxamine19, a hypoxic stress inducer and FDA-approved therapeutic. Overall, we provide novel insights into the vulnerabilities of reservoir clones to potent, sustained CTL pressure and highlight intrinsic resistance pathways as actionable therapeutic targets, opening opportunities for advancing immune-based HIV cure strategies."

 Mott materials are archetypal quantum systems actively explored as next-generation electronic and photonic platforms, with potential applications spanning non-Von Neumann computing, robotics, energy storage, and microwave technologies. Among these, vanadium dioxide (VO2) has emerged as one of the most intensively studied compounds, owing to its sharp, near-room-temperature insulator-to-metal phase transition. VO2 also serves as a benchmark system for testing cutting-edge theories and experimental techniques. Here, we directly visualize the electrically driven transition dynamics in VO2 using a microwave-driven, frequency-tunable pulsed transmission electron microscope that combines nanometer spatial and picosecond temporal resolution. Under high-frequency (MHz–GHz) excitation, we capture the ultrafast nucleation, propagation, and dissolution of metallic domains within an operating device over millions of reversible cycles. We observe the ultrafast formation of consistent metallic nuclei beneath the electrodes, followed by the propagation of a structural phase front at 4.54 nm/ns. Our experiments show that phonon-mediated structural recovery ultimately limits reversible switching of VO2 at GHz frequencies, and that a tunable regime for reversible operation spans from kHz to GHz through device engineering. Beyond VO2, our approach provides a powerful framework for probing non-equilibrium structural transformations in correlated and functional materials under realistic electrical stimuli. Ultrafast electron microscopy reveals how conductive paths in VO₂ form and dissolve under rapid electrical pulses, uncovering switching mechanisms relevant for brain-inspired and next generation electronics."

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow and is closely associated with systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL), a disease triggered by the amyloid aggregation of antibody light chain (LC). High-resolution structures of amyloid LC fibrils from MM patients remain largely unexplored. Here, we extracted LC amyloid fibrils directly from abdominal fat biopsies of two living MM patients. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we further determined the structures of three distinct LC fibril morphologies, which differ significantly from previously reported fibril structures derived from AL amyloidosis patients. Structural comparisons and computational analyses suggested distinct LC fibrillation mechanisms in MM compared to AL amyloidosis, highlighting a potential role of elevated protein concentration in driving LC aggregation in MM. These findings provide essential molecular insights into LC fibril formation in MM and offer a structural foundation for biological diagnosis of living MM patients based on accessible abdominal fat biopsy samples.

Here, the authors identify DNA-PK as a key kinase mediating STAT6 phosphorylation in murine and human macrophages and show that this post-translational modification is required to prevent macrophage senescence and protects animals from senescence-driven lung fibrosis and aging. 
 Macrophage senescence drives inflammaging, a chronic, age-related inflammation. To date, the protective mechanisms against inflammaging are poorly defined. Here, we identify DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of murine STAT6 at serine 807 (Ser807) as a crucial post-translational modification for preventing macrophage senescence. Ser807 phosphorylation blocks STAT6 ubiquitination-mediated degradation and promotes STAT6 partnering with PU.1 to activate DNA repair genes. Macrophages lacking Ser807 phosphorylation exhibit DNA repair defects, undergo senescence, and fuel inflammaging. In vivo, the phosphor-null STAT6 mutant (STAT6(S807A)) accelerates macrophage senescence, tissue fibrosis, and systemic aging. Adoptive transfer of phosphomimetic STAT6(S807E)-expressing macrophages rescues accelerated aging. Importantly, phosphorylation of human STAT6 at the homologous residue (Ser817) is significantly reduced in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), correlating with increased DNA damage and senescence. Thus, our findings reveal a DNA-PK-STAT6 axis enacting a non-canonical type 2 immunity via DNA repair to prevent macrophage senescence, presenting a therapeutic target for healthy aging. STAT6 mitigates cellular aging and senescence by regulating the expression of DNA repair genes. However, the upstream signals driving the activation of this non-canonical STAT6 function have not been identified.

Zhu and colleagues show that the transcription factor Foxl1 impacts key events during the epithelial transition of the fetal mammalian gut. 
 The primitive gut tube of mammals initially forms as a simple cylinder consisting of the endoderm-derived, pseudostratified epithelium and the mesoderm-derived surrounding mesenchyme. During mid-gestation, a dramatic transformation occurs in which the epithelium is both restructured into its final cuboidal form and simultaneously folded and refolded to create intestinal villi and intervillus regions. Here, we show that the mesenchymal winged helix transcription factor Foxl1, itself induced by epithelial hedgehog signaling, controls villification by activating BMP and PDGFRα and the planar cell polarity factor Fat4 in epithelial-adjacent telocyte progenitors either directly or indirectly. In the absence of Foxl1-dependent mesenchymal signaling, villus formation and the separation of epithelial cells into mitotic intervillus and postmitotic villus are delayed, and the differentiation of secretory progenitors temporarily blocked. Thus, Foxl1 orchestrates key events during the epithelial transition of the fetal mammalian gut. The mammalian gut undergoes a dramatic transformation during mid-gestation to create intestinal villi.

Here, the authors show that vibronic interactions survive at room temperature in disordered light-harvesting aggregates, challenging the view that disorder inhibits energy transport. 
 Photosynthesis relies on a network of chlorophyll-like molecules which together lead to efficient long-range energy transfer. Evidence at cryogenic temperatures suggests that mechanistic details of energy/charge transfer must invoke coupled vibrational-electronic (vibronic) states. Whether these survive at physiological temperature in large photosynthetic aggregates is an open question. Parallel research on artificial templates has relied on cyanines which are unlike chlorophylls. Here we report time-resolved optical spectra of porphyrin nanotubes where we selectively probe coupled Qx − Qy states through polarization control. Early time cross peaks between electronic states, their rapid broadening and survival of quantum beats with anisotropic beating amplitude conclusively demonstrate that overlapping vibrational-electronic bands of photosynthetic aggregates indeed host functional vibronic couplings at room temperature. Calculations reveal that disorder is the vital ingredient that dramatically enhances intraband vibronic couplings across the entire Q band. The parameter regime where energetic disorder is of the order of dense Raman-active vibrations with weak reorganization energies may be the key design principle.

 Pathogenic CD4+ memory T cells (Tm) sustain chronic inflammation, but mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we identify four donor-type CD4+ Tm subsets in the target tissues of autoimmune-like chronic graft-versus-host disease in mice: Ly108+CD69− stem-like memory T cells (Tsm), Ly108+CD69+ resident memory progenitor T cells (Trmp), Ly108−CD69+ terminally differentiated tissue-resident T cells (Trm), and Ly108−CD69− intermediate T cells (Tint). Trm are terminally differentiated but not exhausted and show highly biased clonotypes with high proinflammatory cytokine expression. Tsm cells require TCR-MHCII interactions for their maintenance and expansion and show greater capacity than Trmp cells in self-renewal/expansion, generation of Trm, and pathogenicity in adoptive recipients. The transcription factors TCF1/BCL6 and BHLHE40 differentially regulate the stemness and differentiation of Tsm into Trm, respectively, and their selective targeting reduces the number of Trm in tissues and ameliorates inflammation. Thus, our findings indicate that targeting the Tsm subset, involved in the maintenance of the pathogenic Tm pool, offers an attractive approach to treat T cell-mediated chronic inflammation.

 Sticky-ended cohesion has been the driving force for DNA self-assembly and has enabled model and design programmability in DNA nanotechnology for over 40 years.

This study examines how protest repression shapes climate activism and indicates distinct effects across collective action types and repression experience, with emotions as mediators. 
 As climate activism has expanded, governments have increasingly repressed disruptive but non-violent protests. Yet evidence remains mixed regarding whether repression inhibits or galvanizes activism. In this study, we examine how anticipated and experienced repression predict intentions to engage in normative (rule-conforming) and non-normative (rule-violating) collective climate action, over and above past activism and core psychological antecedents. Survey data from Extinction Rebellion UK mailing list subscribers (n = 1,375) showed that experienced repression positively predicted non-normative action intentions and showed a positive indirect predictive effect on non-normative action via reduced fear. Although anticipated repression was not directly associated with either action type, it had positive indirect predictive effects on both action types via anger/outrage and on non-normative action via contempt. Conversely, it also had a negative indirect predictive effect on non-normative action through heightened fear. These findings predominantly reflect a galvanizing effect of repression on disruptive collective climate action among committed activists.

 Integrated assessment models produce large ensembles of socioeconomic scenarios that are used profusely in climate change research. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), non-governmental organizations or national climate committees often rely on ensemble statistics to identify mitigation strategies and set climate targets. A limitation of such evidence is the opportunistic nature of scenario ensembles: they are an unstructured, serendipitous collection of evidence. Drawing on concepts from physical climate science and ensemble analysis, we present an approach for the flexible, multidimensional weighting of emission scenario data that accounts for relevance, quality and diversity. Our illustrative application to the latest IPCC scenario database demonstrates a reduction in dominance of highly represented models and studies, and sees net-zero emission milestones differ to those originally reported. Our framework formalizes decisions otherwise made in an ad hoc manner, providing a tool contributing to the broader challenge of assessing ensembles of opportunity.

This work proposes a ‘multi-zonal anammox’ concept that can be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment plants. 
 Biological nitrogen removal is a main contributor to the carbon footprint of municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs). Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is key to decarbonizing MWWTPs. However, anammox technology has long been developed following the ‘hotspot’ concept, which spatially confines anammox to specific zones in MWWTPs, leaving its potential underexploited in mainstream treatment. Here we propose a ‘multi-zonal anammox’ concept to expand the anammox process throughout the whole MWWTP mainstream. It allows the implementation of anammox in existing MWWTPs with minimal reconstruction requirements. We evaluated the feasibility of this concept in an anaerobic–anoxic–oxic (A2O) biosystem, which is one of the most widely used processes in MWWTPs. During a 2-year-long operation, anammox bacteria highly self-enriched and contributed to nitrogen removal throughout the mainstream, with relative abundances reaching 4.8%, 5.7–10.0% and 0.2–1.0% in anaerobic, anoxic and oxic zones, respectively. The multi-zonal anammox enhanced nitrogen removal efficiency by 20%, reduced aerating electricity input by 20%, mitigated nitrous oxide emissions by 66% and eliminated the need for supplemental organic carbon. Overall, this work opens a promising avenue for implementing the anammox process, paving the way towards sustainable wastewater management.

 Bromine (Br), mostly extracted from nature, plays an essential role in the form of organobromides in various goods, including electronics, vehicles and furniture. At the same time, Br is continuously released into the environment in the form of persistent brominated pollutants upon the retirement of those goods, causing severe environmental consequences and loss of resources. Here we propose a catalytic strategy that enables the selective and mild-condition conversion of all organobromides present in wastes into renewed bromides for Br recycling. It employs Ullmann-type reactions enabled by inexpensive Cu(I), simple ligands and hydroxides in DMSO–H2O solvent. This strategy achieved >95% bromide yields at a temperature ≤120 °C for complex real-world Br-laden wastes. It can produce bromide-rich solution amenable to Br2 production, as demonstrated by the inorganicization–evaporation–oxidation process, and recoverable debrominated solids with preserved chemical states. Mechanistic studies revealed a full debromination framework encompassing diverse activated pathways. This work provides a viable approach for Br recycling and potentially facilitates a circular and sustainable anthropogenic Br flow.

This work presents a water-soluble binder that enables the fast separation of active materials from current collectors in aqueous solutions for sustainable recycling of electrode materials. 
 The substantial growth in the market for lithium-ion batteries has created a huge challenge for their end-of-life management and demands sustainable solutions. Direct recycling is a promising choice due to its superior energy efficiency and environmental benefits, particularly the advantage in preserving the original chemistry and structure of the target materials. However, binders hold the active electrode materials and the current collectors tightly together, and their separation usually involves energy-intensive thermal treatment and environmentally hazardous chemicals. Here we present a water-soluble binder by crosslinking natural sericin protein with sulfuric acid through supramolecular interactions. The as-fabricated binder demonstrates comparable electrochemical performance with the most common polyvinylidene fluoride formulation, when applied to a typical LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) cathode. A 1.3-Ah pouch cell retained 85.0% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles. Equally importantly, after being soaked in water at 50 °C for less than 1 min, the NCM111 and graphite can be completely detached from the current collectors for recycling. By integrating the circular economy into the battery design, this work paves the way for the development of next-generation battery chemistries with enhanced sustainability.

 Many European lakes have suffered oxygen declines from recent eutrophication raising the question as to which conditions are representative of their pre-impact state. Here we present a palaeoecological record revealing that deepwater oxygen in small lakes can be variable over long timescales and subject to human influence for millennia. Remains of chironomids and other invertebrates indicate that Bichelsee (Switzerland) shifted from a stable, oxygen-rich to a dynamic, oxygen-poor state before major human activity. Initially, increased human activity and clearcutting coincided with improved oxygen conditions for deepwater midge larvae. However, from the Roman Age onwards, similar disturbances were associated with low oxygen and reduced deepwater invertebrate populations. These results demonstrate that small European lakes can have multiple, contrasting pre-impact reference states, and that ecological effects of human activity, even their directionality, may shift over time. Furthermore, repeated cycles of impact and recovery can occur over millennia, complicating assumptions about their baseline conditions. Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity and clearcutting improved conditions for deepwater invertebrates in Lake Bichelsee, Switzerland, but from the Roman Age onward similar disturbances caused severe hypoxia and declining deepwater invertebrates as shown by a millennia-long palaeoecological record."

 The formation mechanism of arc mafic rocks with heavy iron isotope signature remains enigmatic. Here we report Fe-Mo-Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data of arc rocks from Northeast China. The studied arc rocks have δ56Fe values (0.08‰ to 0.23‰) comparable to or higher than those of mid-oceanic-ridge basalts, and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions. Combined with the published data of global arc mafic rocks, we find there is a correlation between the δ56Fe values and radiogenic Sr-Nd isotopes, indicating that sediment recycling may have affected the iron isotope of arc rocks. Notably, the positive correlation between the δ56Fe and δ98Mo values further suggests that the metasomatism of mantle wedge peridotite by anoxic sediment-derived melts may be the first-order control for the heavy iron isotopes of arc mafic rocks. Therefore, the arc rocks with heavy iron isotopes can be explained by the addition of anoxic sediments to their mantle sources. The recycled anoxic sediments play an important role in determining the heavy iron isotope composition of arc magmas, according to Fe-Mo-Sr-Nd-Hf isotope analyses of Northeast China arc rocks and global data correlations."

 Accurate representation of terrestrial water storage is essential for water resource management and climate adaptation, yet model‑observation inconsistencies hinder global water cycle assessment. Here we show, using a unified multi‑scale framework, that seven model products with diverse modeling strategies and varying structural completeness exhibit scale‑dependent performance against Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment observations across global, climate-zone, and basin scales. Globally, hydrological models show the highest temporal correlation (0.94) but underperform spatially (0.32), whereas the assimilation system balances both dimensions with higher spatial agreement (0.73). Across climate zones, the assimilation system maintains robust performance, while physical models degrade in polar regions (−0.40). From large to small basin scales, hydrological model performance deteriorates systematically, whereas the assimilation system retains higher consistency and directional accuracy. These findings demonstrate that satellite observation-constrained assimilation substantially reduces inconsistencies relative to model‑driven products, offering essential guidance for climate adaptation and water management strategies.

 Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions drive ocean acidification. Trichodesmium, a key marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, displays contrasting growth responses to ocean acidification across morphotypes: negative in filamentous free trichomes but neutral or positive in colonies. However, lacking mechanistic understanding for these discrepancies has impaired our ability to predict Trichodesmium’s ecophysiological response. Here, we develop ecophysiological models to underpin mechanisms behind these divergent responses. For free trichomes, ocean acidification reduces nitrogen-fixing enzyme activity and photosynthetic energy production. In colonies, however, it alleviates copper and ammonia toxicity within the microenvironment—likely synergizing with enhanced iron acquisition—thereby outweighing minor benefit from relieved inorganic carbon limitation in the colony center. Projections suggest that globally, ocean acidification will reduce nitrogen fixation of trichomes by 16 ± 6% but increase that of colonies by 19 ± 24% within this century. By resolving morphotype-specific mechanisms, our study clarifies Trichodesmium’s adaptive strategies for sustaining its competitiveness and biogeochemical impacts in the changing ocean.

 Sedimentary nitrogen loss is a major sink for nitrogen in marine systems mitigating excess nitrogen inputs, with anammox representing a critical pathway. Conventional understanding holds that anammox bacteria exclusively mediate ammonium oxidation, while their capacity for anaerobic urea oxidation (AUO) has remained largely overlooked. Here we present the direct measurements of AUO rates and contributions across China’s marginal sea sediments, using a revised 15N isotope pairing technique. AUO exhibited a lower rate, accounting for 15 ± 10% of anammox. Moreover, porewater ammonium concentration emerged as a key regulator of AUO contribution due to substrate competition. Extrapolation to a global scale suggests that AUO accounts for ~7% of total sedimentary nitrogen loss, with a disproportionately high contribution in deep-sea sediments. These findings identify AUO as a previously overlooked but globally relevant nitrogen loss pathway, underscoring the need to incorporate AUO and other anaerobic dissolved organic nitrogen transformations into marine nitrogen budgets.

 Flood risk in mountainous regions is expected to intensify under the compounding effects of climate change, population growth, and land cover changes. However, there is limited understanding of how these interacting factors will shape future flood risk, particularly in the transboundary and ecologically sensitive Kabul River Basin (KRB). The present study addresses this critical gap by assessing the spatiotemporal patterns of projected flood susceptibility in the KRB from 2020 to 2100 under different future scenarios. Future flood susceptibility was predicted using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model with three dynamic and nine static predictors. The findings indicate a significant shift in flood susceptibility over time. Specifically, the areas classified as “Very Highly” susceptible increased from 11.78% in 2020 to 12.17% in 2040, 14.44% in 2060, 13.32% in 2080, and 13.51% by 2100, while the areas classified as “Very Low” susceptibility steadily declined from 66.17% in 2020 to 56.43% by 2100. The XGBoost model showed strong predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.961–0.962) and high cross-temporal consistency across future scenarios (Correlation: 0.75–0.85), confirming its suitability for flood susceptibility assessment. Bootstrap uncertainty analysis further supported its robustness, with mean AUCs of 0.9817–0.9834, very low standard errors (0.0003), and narrow confidence intervals (0.9719–0.9887). These results underscore the need to integrate dynamic environmental and demographic changes into flood management strategies in KRB. The research offers a transferable outline for flood assessment in climate-sensitive mountainous regions. It provides actionable insights for land use planning and climate adaptation policy aimed at reducing future flood impacts."

 Urban commuting flow prediction is crucial for optimizing public transportation and improving efficiency, yet traditional models often focus on geographic adjacency, overlooking the complex cross-regional interactions within transportation networks. To address this, we propose a Geography-Aware Graph Neural Network (GAGNN) model for commuting flow prediction. The model first jointly encodes the geographic adjacency matrix and semantic adjacency from public transportation networks, developing a comprehensive attention mechanism to fuse regional proximity with cross-regional semantic connectivity. Subsequently, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) is employed to embed the multiple adjacency relations and multi-source geographic knowledge. Finally, graph embeddings are combined with spatial factors into multidimensional feature vectors, fed into an MLP for commuting flow prediction. The model was validated with Fuzhou workday mobile phone data from January to February 2023, assessing the impact of semantic adjacency from different transportation networks on performance. The results show that: (1) We proposed the GAGNN outperforms both traditional models and advanced graph neural network models (e.g., GSGNN), reducing MAE by 14.9% and improving CPC by 2.1%; (2) The type of semantic adjacency significantly impacts model prediction accuracy. Road-based semantic connections perform best, especially for long-distance commuting flows, followed by metro and bus semantic connections, while the absence of semantic connections yields the worst performance. (3) Spatial scale significantly affects model prediction performance. Under road-based semantic adjacency, accuracy slightly declines with increasing scale, whereas metro, bus, and non-semantic connections, prediction accuracy improves. These findings offer effective support for accurate regional commuting flow modeling and public transportation networks optimization."

 As part of the new Fisheries Act, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has made it a priority to disseminate its data publicly. The project proposed here is to create an open-access data product that includes most of the historical temperature and salinity profiles collected in Northwest Atlantic Ocean and its Arctic gateways.

The Canadian Atlantic Shelf Temperature-Salinity (CASTS) data product consists of 853 748 individual casts (as of 22 August 2025) collected in a geographical zone corresponding to [35–80° N] and [42–100° W] since 1873. The data sources used to make this product were gathered from multiple sources, including DFO regional archives at the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute (MLI), the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO), and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Center (NAFC). Other sources of data include the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University, data from international ships of opportunity archived by the Marine Environmental Data Services (MEDS), and the Polar Data Catalog. This data product also offers new opportunities to review the changes in the ocean climate of Atlantic Canada, another priority of the Government of Canada. The analysis of these data collected over more than a century also reveals the profound changes undergone by the Northwest (NW) Atlantic Ocean during that period. Climate highlights include large decadal fluctuations of temperature and salinity throughout the entire zone, as well as sustained warming trends on the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy since the early 1990s, coinciding with an important freshening on the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelf during the same period.

Johnson;Chaolun Li,Copepod Grazing and Prokaryotic Decomposition Amplify the Effect of Diatom-Dinoflagellate Regime Change on Biological Carbon Pump Efficiency,"Copepod fecal pellets (FPs) are an important but highly variable component of the global Biological Carbon Pump (BCP). This study decoupled and quantified how copepod grazing and prokaryotic activities affect BCP efficiency under different phytoplankton dietary regimes. With a diet of diatoms, copepod FP production rates double, FP sinking rates triple, and FP decomposition rates are significantly lower relative to those with dinoflagellate diets. When dinoflagellates are the primary producers, inefficient grazing and enhanced prokaryotic activity synergistically decrease the efficiency of FP exports to the deep ocean. This finding confirms previous observations. Opportunistic particle-attached (PA) prokaryotes are crucial for FP decomposition. Metagenomic analyses revealed that CAZymes and lysosomal enzyme abundances highly correlated with FP decomposition rates, representing important bioindicators of FP decomposition. These functional enzymes targeting phytoplankton- and copepod-intestine-derived macromolecules from the PA prokaryotic communities were key to FP decomposition. Genomic properties of the Planctomycetota revealed that strong motile ability, detoxification systems, and macromolecule degradation enzymes enabled the success of these opportunistic PA prokaryotes. Elevated temperatures amplified FP decomposition rates by enhancing enzyme abundances and especially accelerated the decomposition of FPs composed of dinoflagellates. This reduced BCP efficiency, as rapidly recycled organic materials remain in surface waters. Our findings highlight the synergistic biological activities amplifying the effects of phytoplankton composition changes on BCP efficiency. This underscores the importance of considering grazing regimes in combination with microbial dynamics in assessing ocean carbon cycling."

However, conventional rapid sand filters exhibit slow biological maturation for Mn(II) removal, limiting their performance in engineered Mn(II) removal. This study examined the effectiveness of partially replacing sand with natural manganese ore (NMO) to enhance Mn(II) removal and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that replacing only 1/8 of sand with NMO enabled consistently effective Mn(II) removal (residual <5 μg/L) from start-up through long-term operation, even under stressful conditions; its performance was comparable to columns packed with 100% NMO. In 1/8 NMO columns, early Mn(II) removal driven by MnOx-mediated chemical processes rapidly diminished, after which MnOx-enhanced biological processes promptly took over. Compared with sand columns, 1/8 NMO columns biologically matured nearly 100 days earlier, and biomass on the rough, porous MnOx surface was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that on sand. Although NMO partly altered microbial communities, the relative abundance of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria did not increase; the larger absolute biofilm biomass primarily drove sustained efficient Mn(II) removal. These findings highlighted the important but previously overlooked role of MnOx in promoting biofilm accumulation and accelerating the maturation of biological Mn(II) removal systems and provided a practical and cost-effective upgrade for conventional sand filtration."

Here, we report the first structurally distinct ZnSnGa ternary layered double hydroxide (ZnSnGa LDH), where Ga3+ serves as a framework cation rather than a dopant. This unique lattice configuration weakens Ga−OH bonds and enables light-driven hydroxyl reconstruction. The resulting detach−vacancy−replenishment cycle continuously generates surface hydroxyl vacancies, exposing unsaturated Ga sites that promote p−p orbital hybridization with O2. Consequently, O2 is selectively activated into singlet oxygen (1O2), while dissociative hydroxyls are oxidized into •OH. In situ spectroscopy, radical trapping, and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that 1O2 preferentially attacks benzylic C−H bonds to trigger ring opening, whereas •OH accelerates intermediate oxidation. This complementary ROS synergy enables nearly complete toluene degradation (≈100%) with 99.8% mineralization efficiency, high stability (10 cycles), and, critically for practical application, broad humidity tolerance (0−100% RH). Beyond VOC abatement, this work establishes light-driven hydroxyl reconstruction as an intrinsic property of the ternary LDH lattice, offering a generalizable defect-engineering strategy for selective ROS regulation. These findings broaden the LDH compositional space and provide a framework for next-generation photocatalysts for robust environmental remediation."

Using a zebrafish model, we discovered that chronic exposure (80 days) to thermally aged bottle-derived PET MPs (retained for 7 days at 60 °C) at realistic concentrations (10 and 100 μg/L) caused substantial hepatic histopathological damage and steatosis, whereas pristine PET MPs stored at 25 °C did not. Integrative analyses suggested that thermal aging induced PET fragmentation, surface roughening, and enhancement of bioadhesion, intensifying gut MP retention (maximally 6.524 μg/g tissues), barrier integrity damage, and microbiota dysbiosis. Biochemical analyses, transcriptomics, and blocking experiments validated that intestinal homeostasis disruption stimulated lipopolysaccharide oversecretion and induced intestinal inflammation through activating the LPS/TLR4/NF-kB pathway, which further contributed to systemic and hepatic inflammations, insulin resistance, and de novo lipogenesis, culminating in steatosis. Intervention with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and sodium butyrate reduced MP-driven hepatic steatosis by restoring gut microbiota and barrier functions. Our findings clarified the mechanisms by which thermally aged PET exacerbated progression to steatosis through the gut-liver axis and proposed the intestine-targeted mitigation strategies against hepatic disorders, advocating concerns on long-term exposure risks of bottle-derived MPs under improper storage conditions."

During stable operation, the system achieved a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 84.5 ± 4.8%, with the upstream zone accounting for 61.3 ± 10.1% of total removal. Along the decreasing nutrient gradient, community composition shifted markedly, and metatranscriptomes indicated spatially differentiated nitrogen-cycling transcription, with anammox-related transcripts enriched upstream. A 3-day DO shock (>0.5 mg/L) reduced the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) from 0.16 ± 0.03 to 0.07 ± 0.04 kg N/(m3·d). Although NRR recovered to baseline within three months, community structure and total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies did not return to preshock levels, indicating a decoupling between microbiome and functional recovery. Across zones, higher bacterial diversity and nitrogen cycling functional redundancy were positively associated with faster recovery trends, and upstream microbiome stability was most representable of whole-system resilience.

However, the timing and associated mechanisms of red clay to loess‐paleosol shift remain debated. Here we present new magnetostratigraphic and environmental magnetic results from the Baode section, northeastern CLP. Magnetostratigraphic result demonstrates that this section spans from the upper Gilbert to lower Matuyama Chrons (3.6–2.0 Ma). Red clay shifted to loess‐paleosol sequence at ∼2.7 Ma, synchronous with the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG). Rock magnetic data indicate dominance of fine pedogenic magnetic grains, with higher concentrations in red clay. The continuous magnetic susceptibility record suggests decreases in pedogenic magnetic population and precipitation at ∼2.7 Ma. We propose that ice‐sheet expansion across the iNHG, coupled with declining CO2, triggered the onset of loess‐paleosol accumulation on the CLP by suppressing Asian summer monsoon while enhancing winter monsoon circulation and inland aridity."

 Is it feasible to alter the ground-state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions1–12, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge13–19. Here we devised and implemented a new platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement20–24. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br (κ-ET). The frequencies of infrared hyperbolic modes (HMs) of hBN (refs. 25,26) match the infrared-active carbon–carbon (C=C) stretching molecular resonance of κ-ET implicated in superconductivity27. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the C=C stretching mode in κ-ET. Meissner-effect measurements using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/κ-ET interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl3/κ-ET and hBN/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (BSCCO), do not show the pronounced superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/κ-ET realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. Our work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of complex quantum materials.

 A powerful approach to understand the computations carried out by the visual cortex is to build models that predict neural responses to any arbitrary image. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the leading predictive models1,2, yet their underlying computations remain buried beneath millions of parameters. Here we challenge the need for models at this scale by seeking predictive and parsimonious DNN models of the primate visual cortex. We first built a highly predictive DNN model of neural responses in macaque visual area V4 by alternating data collection and model training in adaptive closed-loop experiments. We then compressed this large, black-box DNN model, which comprised 60 million parameters, to identify compact models with 5,000 times fewer parameters yet comparable accuracy. This dramatic compression enabled us to investigate the inner workings of the compact models. We discovered a salient computational motif: compact models share similar filters in early processing, but individual models then specialize their feature selectivity by ‘consolidating’ this shared high-dimensional representation in distinct ways. We examined this consolidation step in a dot-detecting model neuron, revealing a computational mechanism that leads to a testable circuit hypothesis for dot-selective V4 neurons. Beyond V4, we found strong model compression for macaque visual areas V1 and IT (inferior temporal cortex), revealing a general computational principle of the visual cortex. Overall, our work challenges the notion that large DNNs are necessary to predict individual neurons and establishes a modelling framework that balances prediction and parsimony. Parsimonious deep neural network models can be used for prediction of visual neuron responses."

 Cellular solids ubiquitously exist in natural systems and are crucial for living organisms1,2. Their unique smooth branch and node morphologies are often seen as adaptations for enhanced mechanical performance3,4. Exploring alternative evolutionary functions can enrich the understanding of cellular solids, but it is frequently neglected. Here we show that the biomineralized cellular solids in echinoderm stereom (for example, sea urchin spine) have unexpected mechanoelectrical perception with response potential and response time, both of which are one to three orders of magnitude greater than those of echinoderm vision5. This exceptional perception originates from the gradient cellular solids (with varying void- or solid-phase diameters) along the [001] spine axis, generating a differential charge density across the stereom surface during liquid flow. Inspired by this natural wisdom, we create artificial spine-like structures using three-dimensional printing technology that exhibit three-fold higher voltage output and eight-fold greater amplitude differential than gradient-free samples, as well as a nature-inspired metamaterial mechanoreceptor capable of time-resolved self-monitoring information underwater. Our findings advance the understanding of load-sensitive biomimetic cellular solids (such as wood, sponge and trabecular bone), with the potential to develop functional gradient cellular materials towards underwater spatiotemporal sensing and water resource utilization.

Laub,A membrane-bound nuclease directly cleaves phage DNA during genome injection,"A widespread bacterial defence system called SNIPE is shown to localize to the cell membrane, where it identifies and cleaves the DNA of infecting phage as it is injected into the bacterial cell. 
 From mammals to bacteria, the direct recognition and cleavage of viral nucleic acids is a potent defence strategy against viral infection, but it requires mechanisms for distinguishing self from non-self1,2. In bacteria, CRISPR–Cas and restriction-modification systems achieve this discrimination by recognizing specific DNA sequences or DNA modifications, respectively. Alternative mechanisms probably remain to be discovered. Here, we characterize SNIPE, an anti-bacteriophage defence system that constitutively localizes to the bacterial cell membrane in Escherichia coli to block phage λ infection. Using radiolabelled phage DNA and time-lapse microscopy to track phage genomes, we demonstrate that SNIPE directly cleaves phage DNA during genome injection. Based on proximity labelling, we find that SNIPE associates with host proteins essential for λ genome entry and with the λ tape measure protein, which facilitates λ genome injection across the inner membrane. SNIPE also defends against diverse siphoviruses, probably through direct interactions with their tape measure proteins. Our findings establish SNIPE as a widespread bacterial defence system that exploits the spatial organization of phage genome injection to specifically target viral DNA, representing a previously unknown strategy for distinguishing self from non-self in prokaryotic immune systems. A widespread bacterial defence system called SNIPE is shown to localize to the cell membrane, where it identifies and cleaves the DNA of infecting phage as it is injected into the bacterial cell."

 Vectorization of teaching signals is a key element of almost all modern machine learning algorithms, including backpropagation, target propagation and reinforcement learning. Vectorization allows a scalable and computationally efficient solution to the credit assignment problem by tailoring instructive signals to individual neurons. Recent theoretical models have suggested that neural circuits could implement single-phase vectorized learning at the cellular level by processing feedforward and feedback information streams in separate dendritic compartments1–5. This presents a compelling, but untested, hypothesis for how cortical circuits could solve credit assignment in the brain. Here we used a neurofeedback brain–computer interface task with an experimenter-defined reward function to test for vectorized instructive signals in dendrites. We trained mice to modulate the activity of two spatially intermingled populations (four or five neurons each) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the retrosplenial cortex to rotate a visual grating towards a target orientation while we recorded GCaMP activity from somas and corresponding distal apical dendrites. We observed that the relative magnitudes of somatic and dendritic signals could be predicted using the activity of the surrounding network and contained information about task-related variables that could serve as instructive signals, including reward and error. The signs of these putative teaching signals depended on the causal role of individual neurons in the task and predicted changes in overall activity over the course of learning. Furthermore, targeted optogenetic perturbation of these signals disrupted learning. These results demonstrate a vectorized instructive signal in the brain, implemented via semi-independent computation in cortical dendrites, unveiling a potential mechanism for solving credit assignment in the brain. Mice learning a neurofeedback brain–computer interface task show neuron-specific teaching signals in cortical dendrites, consistent with a vectorized solution for credit assignment in the brain."

 Atopic diseases associated with allergens, as well as allergic diseases, frequently arise early in life; however, the age-dependent mechanisms governing immune responses to allergens remain poorly understood1. Here we find that in early life, exposure to common allergens triggers a distinct bifurcated immune response, simultaneously triggering type 17 inflammation in the skin and initiating canonical T helper 2 sensitization in the lymph nodes. This early-life γδ type 17-mediated dermatitis primes the exaggerated allergic lung inflammation upon secondary allergen exposure. Mechanistically, we find dendritic cell (DC)-mediated type 17 activation directly in the skin without requiring migration to lymph nodes; we term this state ‘peripheral immune inducer’ (pii) DC. CD301b+ conventional type 2 DCs acquire allergen, adopt the pii-DC state, produce IL-23 and activate local γδ type 17 cells independently of lymph-node engagement. The pii-DC state is enabled by the immature hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and physiologically low systemic glucocorticoids characteristic of early life2,3; DC-specific deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor recapitulates the pii-DC phenotype. These findings define a developmental checkpoint, set by neuroendocrine maturation, that enables in situ DC activation and immune induction, thereby shaping age-dependent responses to allergens. Early-life exposure to allergens triggers a distinct local mode of dendritic cell activation in neonatal skin without requiring migration to lymph nodes, which shapes responses to allergens in later life."

 Achieving pancreatic-targeted delivery marks a breakthrough in treating pancreatic diseases, yet precise delivery remains challenging1. Here we identify an explicit and universal principle for pancreatic-selective delivery and propose a pancreatic-targeted lipid nanoparticle (AH-LNP) for mRNA delivery. AH-LNP exhibits size enlargement after assembly with proteins, facilitating capsule-filter-mediated pancreas-selective accumulation and receptor-mediated endocytosis, thereby boosting the pancreatic-targeted ability. Benefiting from this, AH-LNP enables precise and efficient genome editing in the pancreas through the delivery of Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA), exhibiting promising potential in the treatment of autoimmune pancreatic diseases. Furthermore, pancreatic-targeted delivery of mRNA encoding therapeutic cytokines through AH-LNP demonstrates superior antitumour efficacy when combined with a cancer vaccine or chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in multiple pancreatic cancer models. The safety and pancreatic mRNA delivery of AH-LNP were verified in multiple animal models, including non-human primates, demonstrating great promise for clinical translation. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of this pancreatic-targeted mechanism and the derived LNP platform, opening avenues for developing precision therapeutics against diverse pancreatic diseases.

 Squeaking is a constant companion in various aspects of our daily lives, whether we slide rubber-soled shoes across hardwood floors1, scrape chalk on a blackboard2, engage the brakes on a bicycle3 or walk with a hip replacement4,5. When two rigid bodies slide over each other, squeaking is widely understood to result from self-excited stick–slip oscillations, triggered by a decrease in the friction coefficient with increasing slip velocity6–10. However, sliding of extended interfaces can involve crack or slip-pulse propagation11–21. This distinction is amplified when a soft body slides on a rigid one, in which large deformations and material mismatch can cause detachment by opening slip pulses22–27. Previous studies focused mainly on slow sliding17,26,28–34, in which pulses are slow and squeaking is absent. Although squeaking at soft–rigid interfaces has been linked to stick–slip oscillations35–37, the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we experimentally investigate soft–rigid interfaces sliding at velocities that produce squeaking. High-speed imaging and acoustic analysis show that opening pulses propagate at approximately the shear wave speed of the soft material, mediating local slip across diverse materials. In flat samples, these pulses are irregular and generate broadband acoustic emissions. Introducing thin surface ridges confines pulse propagation, yielding a consistent repetition frequency matching the first shear mode of the sliding block and squeaking at that frequency. These findings show a structure-driven mechanism that stabilizes rupture in bimaterial friction. Geometric confinement suppresses competing modes, transforming irregular two-dimensional dynamics into coherent one-dimensional pulse trains, offering new insights into frictional rupture from engineered surfaces to geological faults. High-speed imaging reveals that the squeak of soft–rigid frictional interfaces, like sneakers sliding on a basketball court, arises from intersonic opening slip pulses—analogous to earthquake ruptures—that thin ridges on the rubber confine to repeat at a musical frequency."

 Biological machines use targeted deformations that can be actuated by Brownian fluctuations. However, although synthetic micromachines can similarly make use of targeted deformations, they are too stiff to be driven by thermal fluctuations and require strong forcing1–3. Furthermore, systems that are able to change their conformation by thermal fluctuations do so uncontrollably4,5 or require external control6. Here we use DNA-based sliding contacts7–9 to create colloidal pivots, rigid anisotropic objects that freely fluctuate around their pivot point and use a hierarchical strategy to assemble these into Brownian metamaterials with targeted deformation modes. We realize the archetypical rotating diamond and rotating triangle, or kagome, geometries and quantitatively show how thermal fluctuations drive their predicted auxetic deformations10–15.

 Multicellularity evolved independently multiple times in eukaryotes1–4. Two distinct mechanisms underpin multicellularity5: clonality (serial cell division without sister-cell separation) and aggregation (whereby independent cells assemble into a multicellular entity). Clonal and aggregative multicellularity are traditionally considered to be mutually exclusive1,6–8, with rare exceptions9, and evolutionary hypotheses have addressed why multicellularity might diverge towards one or the other extreme3,4. Both animals and their sister group, the choanoflagellates, are currently known to acquire multicellularity only clonally4,10,11. Here we show that the choanoflagellate Choanoeca flexa12 forms motile and contractile cell monolayers (sheets) through multiple mechanisms—C. flexa sheets can form purely clonally, purely aggregatively or through a combination of both processes. We characterize the life history of C. flexa in its natural environment—ephemeral splash pools on the island of Curaçao—and show that C. flexa undergoes reversible transitions between unicellularity and multicellularity during evaporation–refilling cycles. Different splash pools house genetically distinct strains of C. flexa and kin recognition constrains aggregation between them. We show that clonal-aggregative multicellularity is a versatile strategy for the robust establishment of multicellularity in this variable and fast-fluctuating environment. Our findings challenge former generalizations about choanoflagellates and expand the option space of choanozoan multicellularity.

 Antimicrobial drug resistance poses a global health challenge that necessitates the identification of new druggable targets1–3.

The only known inhibitors of Gram-negative (diderm) MurJ are the single-gene lysis proteins (Sgls) from the lytic single-strand RNA phages M (SglM) and PP7 (SglPP7)8,9. SglM and SglPP7 have distinct evolutionary origins and share no sequence similarity. Here we describe a common mechanism of MurJ inhibition by these phage-encoded Sgls. We determined the structures of MurJ-bound SglM and SglPP7 and discovered a third distinct MurJ-targeting Sgl from the predicted phage Changjiang3 (SglCJ3) that we also characterized structurally. Our findings demonstrate that all three Sgls evolved convergently to trap MurJ in a periplasm-open conformation through a common MurJ interface, revealing a pathway for drug design.

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-natural killer (NK) cell therapies hold promise for solid tumours but remain limited because of poor tumour infiltration, persistence and resistance in the tumour microenvironment1–4. Here, to identify gain-of-function targets that enhance CAR-NK cell efficacy, we performed an unbiased in vivo CRISPR activation screen followed by a barcoded targeted in vivo open reading frame screen in primary human CAR-NK cells. We identified and comprehensively validated OR7A10, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as the top candidate. Engineering CAR-NK cells with OR7A10 cDNA (a CRISPR-independent method with a simple manufacturing strategy) enhanced their proliferation, activation, degranulation, cytokine production, death ligand expression, chemokine receptor expression, cytotoxicity, persistence, metabolic fitness and tumour microenvironment resistance. Moreover, exhaustion in primary human NK cells derived from multiple peripheral blood and cord blood donors was reduced. OR7A10 gain-of-function CAR-NK cells displayed strong in vivo efficacy across multiple solid tumour models. For example, 100% complete response with long-term tumour control and survival benefit in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model were achieved.

 Oncogenes such as KRAS display marked tissue specificity in their oncogenic potential, genetic interactions and phenotypic effects, but the underlying determinants remain largely unresolved1–5. Here, to address these questions, we developed the Mouse Cancer Cell line Atlas, a broad-utility resource of 590 comprehensively characterized models across a wide range of entities (
              www.mcca.tum.de
              
            ). Comparative and functional studies using this platform, human cohorts and mice identified core principles underlying tissue-specific evolution of KRAS-initiated cancers. First, we show that mutant KRAS dosage gain through allelic imbalance exerts cell-type-specific effects, defining its timing across entities, as exemplified by dosage-sensitive developmental reprogramming during pancreatic cancer initiation. Second, we highlight how tissue- and stage-specific evolutionary requirements, such as block of differentiation in the intestine, select for KRAS-collaborating alterations. Third, we identified context-dependent epistatic KRAS–tumour suppressor interactions and show that reciprocal dosage sensitivities dictate the entity-specific patterns of cancer gene alterations, explaining their frequency, zygosity and acquisition chronology. These findings highlight how intrinsic and acquired determinants instruct cancer evolution in different tissues, with predictable molecular patterns, temporal dynamics and phenotypic outcomes.

 Cold stress restricts plant growth and inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake, reducing yield and increasing fertilizer demand1–3. Enhancing both cold tolerance and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) is crucial for sustainable crop productivity. Here we identify the SPX-domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase NITROGEN LIMITATION ADAPTATION (NLA) as a central regulator that links cold signalling to Pi homeostasis in maize (Zea mays L.). Under cold conditions, NLA promotes the degradation of the transcriptional repressor JAZ11, activating jasmonate signalling to enhance cold tolerance; however, NLA also simultaneously represses Pi uptake, through inositol polyphosphate (InsP)-dependent ubiquitination of the Pi transporter PT4. A ubiquitinome-informed genome-wide association study identified a natural PT4(K267A) (lysine-to-alanine substitution) variant that attenuates NLA-mediated degradation and increases Pi uptake in cold conditions. To overcome this nutrient–stress trade-off, we combined artificial-intelligence-guided structural modelling and ligand docking with genome editing to generate the nlaΔ12 allele, which encodes an NLA variant in which binding to InsP is impaired but JAZ11 targeting is retained. The Δ12 modification selectively redirects the activity of NLA towards jasmonate signalling, resulting in improved cold resilience, higher PUE and increased yield in multi-site field trials. These findings reveal a tunable SPX regulatory module that integrates environmental and nutrient signals, and provide a molecular framework for engineering climate-resilient, nutrient-efficient crops. The E3 ubiquitin ligase NLA postively regulates cold tolerance and negatively regulates phosphate uptake in maize, and a genetically engineered variant of this enzyme leads to improved cold tolerance and enhanced phosphate uptake, improving yield in field trials."

 Chiral antiferromagnets1,2 host octupole order3,4 and combine the advantages of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets. Despite the development of numerous switching strategies5–9, the field-free full switching remains unknown, posing an important obstacle to their practical application in memory technology. Here we prepared a homo-junction constituted of Mn3Sn(0001) bottom layer and polycrystalline Mn3Sn top layer. The tilted Kagomé geometry in polycrystalline Mn3Sn divides the out-of-plane spin polarization from Mn3Sn(0001) layer10,11 into the out-of-Kagomé-plane and in-Kagomé-plane components, generating the symmetric (antiferromagnet-type) and asymmetric (ferromagnet-type) driving forces, respectively. The former accelerates octupole rotation, whereas the latter determines switching chirality. Field-free full switching is realized in the unconventional protocol that integrates the advantages of both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic switching. It goes beyond the conventional full-switching framework requiring perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy7,12. An unprecedented switching efficiency is achieved, with both current density and power consumption an order of magnitude lower than in previous configurations, by virtue of the highly efficient driving forces due to spin-torque characteristics of octupole order and the ultralow energy barrier arising from easy-plane anisotropy, overcoming their trade-off in conventional protocols. The zero-field switching also shows the advantages of octupole-programmable chirality and robustness to external magnetic field. An Mn3Sn homo-junction enables efficient field-free full switching of chiral antiferromagnets with greatly reduced power consumption, advancing their potential for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices with advantages of ultradense integration and ultrafast speed."

 Alvarezsauroids are an enigmatic clade of predominantly small-bodied theropod dinosaurs that are known mainly from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods of Asia and South America1–3. Late Cretaceous alvarezsauroids possess specialized forelimbs adapted for digging4,5, minute supernumerary teeth and heightened sensory capacities6, and are interpreted as myrmecophagous. They are hypothesized to exhibit evolutionary miniaturization coupled to their dietary specialization2. Fragmentary South American taxa are traditionally arrayed as a paraphyletic grade with respect to the Late Cretaceous Asian subclade Parvicursorinae2,3, invoking dispersal to explain their disjunct distributions. Here we describe a skeleton of the alvarezsauroid Alnashetri cerropoliciensis7 representing to our knowledge the most complete and smallest South American taxon to date. We also recognize two alvarezsauroids among historic taxa from the Northern Hemisphere. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Alnashetri among basal non-alvarezsaurids, rendering South American taxa polyphyletic. Combined with the new taxa recognized here, our biogeographical analyses infer a Pangaean ancestral distribution for Alvarezsauroidea, with vicariance dominating the early history of the clade. The early branching position of Alnashetri among larger-bodied relatives revises best-fit models of body size evolution in alvarezsauroids—we find no support for evolutionary miniaturization but, rather, find support for repeated evolution within a narrow body size range. A skeleton of the alvarezsauroid Alnashetri cerropoliciensis—representing a highly complete alvarezsauroid skeleton from South America—provides evidence on the evolution of the peculiar anatomy and miniaturization within this unusual theropod dinosaur clade."

 Coral reefs are marine biodiversity hotspots that provide a wide range of ecosystem services1. They are reservoirs of bioactive metabolites, many produced by microorganisms associated with reef invertebrate hosts2. However, for the keystone species of coral reefs—the reef-building corals—we still lack a systematic assessment of their microbially encoded biosynthetic potential and the molecular resources at stake due to the alarming decline in reef biodiversity. Here we analysed microbial genomes reconstructed from 820 reef-building coral samples of three representative coral genera collected at 99 reefs across 32 islands throughout the Pacific Ocean (Tara Pacific expedition)3. By contextualizing our analyses with the microbiomes of other reef species, we found that only 10% of the 4,224 microbial species and less than 1% of the 645 species exclusively identified in Tara Pacific samples had genomic information available. Furthermore, the biosynthetic potential of reef-building coral microbiomes rivalled or surpassed that of traditional natural product sources such as sponges. Among the biosynthetically rich bacteria in the reef microbiome, we identified new groups of Acidobacteriota that encode previously unknown enzymology, in turn opening promising avenues for functional protein engineering. Together, this study underscores the importance of conserving coral reefs as vital reservoirs of molecular diversity.

 Imbalances in lipid storage and secretion lead to hepatic steatosis, the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes1,2. Our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the channelling of neutral lipids in hepatocytes towards cytosolic lipid droplets or secreted lipoproteins remains incomplete3,4. Here we performed a series of CRISPR–Cas9 screens under different metabolic states that led to the identification of CLCC1 as a critical regulator of neutral lipid storage and secretion in hepatocytes. Loss of CLCC1 resulted in the buildup of large lipid droplets in hepatoma cells and Clcc1 knockout in mice caused liver steatosis. Lipid droplets were present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of the Clcc1-knockout hepatocytes and exhibited properties of lipoproteins, indicating a profound shift in neutral lipid flux. The loss of CLCC1 also led to the accumulation of nuclear membrane herniations accompanied by a reduction in nuclear pores. Remote homology searches identified a domain in CLCC1 that is homologous to yeast Brl1 and Brr6, factors that promote nuclear envelope fusion during nuclear pore complex assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis studies support a model in which CLCC1 mediates membrane bending and fusion. We propose that CLCC1 mediates membrane fusion to promote hepatic neutral lipid flux and nuclear pore complex assembly.

 Orchestration of lipid production, storage and mobilization is vital for cellular and systemic homeostasis1,2. Dysfunctional plasma lipid control represents the major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases—the leading cause of human mortality3,4. Within the cellular landscape, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the central hub of lipid synthesis and secretion, particularly in metabolically active hepatocytes in the liver or enterocytes in the gut5,6. Initially assembled in the ER lumen, lipid-ferrying lipoproteins necessitate the cross-membrane transfer of both neutral and phospholipids onto the lumenal apolipoprotein B (APOB), in a poorly defined process7–10. Here we show that the ER protein CLCC1 regulates cellular lipid partition and, consequently, systemic lipid homeostasis by participating in trans-bilayer equilibration of phospholipids. CLCC1 partners with the phospholipid scramblase TMEM41B11,12 to recognize imbalanced bilayers and promote lipid scrambling, thereby supporting lipoprotein biogenesis and the subsequent bulk lipid transport. Loss of CLCC1 or TMEM41B leads to the emergence of giant lumenal lipid droplets enclosed by imbalanced ER bilayers and, consequently, accelerated pathogenesis of metabolic-dysfunction-associated liver steatohepatitis. The results reveal that phospholipid scrambling at the ER is essential for establishing a dynamic equilibrium. Considering the requirement of trans-bilayer phospholipid equilibration in numerous biological processes, ranging from catabolic autophagy to viral infection13–16, we anticipate that future work will elucidate a homeostatic control mechanism intrinsic to ER function in lipid biogenesis and distribution. Phospholipid scrambling at the endoplasmic reticulum is essential for establishing a dynamic equilibrium to maintain cellular homeostasis."

 Identifying the causal variants and mechanisms that drive complex traits and diseases remains a core problem in human genetics1–5. Most of these variants individually have weak effects6 and lie in non-coding gene-regulatory elements7–10, for which we lack a complete understanding of how single-nucleotide alterations modulate transcriptional processes to affect human phenotypes5,11–15. To address this problem, we measured the activity of 221,412 fine-mapped trait-associated variants using a massively parallel reporter assay16–20 in 5 diverse cell types. We show that this assay effectively discriminates between likely causal variants and controls, and identified 13,121 regulatory variants with high precision. Although the effects of these variants largely agree with orthogonal measures of function, only 69% of them can plausibly be explained by the disruption of a known transcription factor binding motif. We investigated the mechanisms of 136 variants using saturation mutagenesis and assigned affected transcription factors for 91% of variants without a clear canonical mechanism. Finally, we detected regulatory epistasis at 11% of tested regulatory variants in close proximity and identified multiple functional variants on the same haplotype at a small, but important, subset of trait-associated loci. Overall, our study provides a systematic functional characterization of likely causal common variants that underlie complex and molecular human traits, enabling new insights into the regulatory grammar underlying disease risk.

 The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogues of the high-temperature cuprates1–6. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high critical temperatures (Tc) under pressure came as a surprise7–13. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. Apart from the practical challenges posed by working in a high-pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous ‘filamentary’ superconducting states7,9,14–17. Here we perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as-grown La3Ni2O7 samples in situ, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell18–23. These maps confirm marked inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few μm scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged in situ, and stoichiometric composition, we show the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behaviour and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure–function correlations observed at the sub-μm pixel scale.

 The existence of human hippocampal neurogenesis has long been disputed1–12 and its relevance in cognition remains unknown. Recent studies have established the presence of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons and a reduction in the latter in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)11,13. However, their origin and the molecular networks that regulate neurogenesis and function are poorly understood. Here we studied human post-mortem hippocampi obtained from different cohorts: young adults with intact memory, aged adults with no cognitive impairments, aged adults with extraordinary memory capacity (SuperAgers)14,15, adults with preclinical intermediate pathology or adults with AD. Using multiomic single-cell sequencing (single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing), we analysed the profiles of 355,997 nuclei isolated from the hippocampus samples and identified neural stem cells, neuroblasts and immature granule neurons. Dysregulated neurogenesis was largely associated with changes in chromatin accessibility. Analyses of transcription factors and target gene signatures that distinguished each of the groups revealed early alterations in chromatin accessibility of neurogenic cells from individuals with preclinical AD, and such changes were even more evident in samples from individuals with AD. We identified a distinct profile of neurogenesis in SuperAgers that may reflect a ‘resilience signature’. Finally, alterations in the profile of astrocytes and CA1 neurons govern cognitive function in the ageing hippocampus. Together, our study points to a multiomic molecular signature of the hippocampus that distinguishes cognitive resilience and deterioration with ageing. Mapping of neurogenesis in human hippocampi across ages and different cognitive abilities using multiomic single-cell sequencing reveals distinct signatures between cognitive preservation and decline."

 Signaling pathways are useful models for interpreting molecular data, but their coverage has long been constrained by classic biochemistry methods. The growing corpus of kinase-substrate interactions, coupled to phosphoproteomics improvements, pave the way to revisit classic signaling pathways. In this study, we explore context-specific signaling pathway inference from phosphoproteomics and kinase-substrate networks. Focusing on epidermal growth factor (EGF), we conduct a meta-analysis and generate three datasets representing the most comprehensive characterization of the EGF response to date. We infer kinase-kinase pathways and compare them to different ground truth sets. Literature-curated networks consistently yield the highest recovery of ground-truth interactions, with modest gains from network propagation methods. Up to 90% of interactions are absent from current ground truth sets, indicating many unexplored interactions supported by data and knowledge. Our results demonstrate the limitations of traditional views on signaling pathways and point to opportunities for generating better mechanistic hypotheses.

 Effective thermal management is critical for power electronics in AI and robotics, highlighting the need for dynamic, reversible thermal switches. Achieving a high switching ratio remains challenging. Here, we present a bistable origami-inspired thermal switch that switch rapidly between distinct thermal conduction states without external energy or sensory input. Fabricated from a thin film through precise cut-and-fold, it achieves thermal switching ratios of 13,984 in vacuum and 1360 in ambient air, significantly higher than existing approaches. Switching is driven by snap-through instability, actuated by a combination of shape-memory alloy and elastic springs. The energy landscape can be tuned through geometric variations to adjust triggering temperature and switching ratio. We demonstrate stable, repeatable thermal regulation across multiple scenarios, offering a pathway toward passive, programmable thermal management.

Here, the authors employ a small-molecule compound screening to identify elesclomol, a potent copper ionophore, to overcome PARPi-resistance in BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer cells by suppressing the activation of the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage response pathway. 
 Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) as monotherapy or in combination with other DNA-damaging agents exhibit promising clinical efficacy, the therapeutic responses are usually transient, with subsequent development of acquired resistance posing a significant challenge. Here, through a small-molecule compound screening, we identify elesclomol, a potent copper ionophore, which sensitizes BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer cells to PARPi by inhibiting activation of the ATR-CHK1 pathway. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that copper directly binds to ATRIP, a critical cofactor of ATR activation, disrupting the ATR-ATRIP interaction, further impairing ATR-mediated DNA damage repair signaling and potentiating PARPi sensitivity. Importantly, we reveal a secondary metabolic vulnerability in PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer associated with de novo pyrimidine synthesis, suggesting that targeting this pathway as an effective strategy to eradicate drug-adaptive residual tumors and resistant patient-derived xenograft models following ATR and PARP co-inhibition. These findings propose de novo pyrimidine synthesis as an adaptive metabolic vulnerability that can be therapeutically targeted to overcome PARPi resistance in BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer.

Here, the authors show that this volume-regulated anion channel, a key osmo-sensitive ion channel, protects against colitis by balancing nutrient absorption and antimicrobial defense. 
 Enterocytes mediate both nutrient absorption and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) secretion while constantly exposed to osmotic fluctuations. However, the role of volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), a key osmo-sensitive ion channel, in enterocytes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific knockout of LRRC8A, the essential VRAC subunit, exacerbates colitis and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. VRAC deficiency specifically disrupts enterocyte maturation and zonation, expanding AMP-producing enterocytes while reducing enterocytes responsible for nutrient absorption. Retinoic acid metabolism emerges as the most affected nutrient pathway in VRAC-deficient IECs, with reduced Adh1, Aldh1a2 expression and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Supplementation with retinoic acid reversed inflammation caused by VRAC deficiency. Conversely, VRAC deficiency induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, while administration of Lactobacillus species effectively restored microbial balance and alleviated inflammation. This study delineates the role of VRAC in balancing nutrient absorption and antimicrobial defense in enterocytes to safeguard gut homeostasis.

 Axially chiral arylpyrroles are a promising class of compounds with broad applications in catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. Herein, we report a copper-catalysed dynamic kinetic asymmetric (4 + 1) cyclization for the atroposelective synthesis of arylpyrroles bearing a single stereogenic axis or 1,2-diaxes from 1,3-enynes and amines. This dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation employs a chiral Cu/Pybox complex, with air as the oxidant and DABCO serving as both a base and a proton shuttle. A key feature is the reversibility of the aza-Michael addition, which enables the dynamic formation/cleavage of distal C–N bonds. The 5-endo-dig cyclization serves as both the rate-determining and stereodetermining step, ensuring precise stereocontrol of the proximal stereocenters by the catalyst. This strategy overcomes long-standing challenges in the stereocontrol of distal C–N bond formation and enables the synthesis of atropisomeric DMAP catalysts with two stereogenic axes. DFT calculations provide insights into the mechanism of stereocontrol. Axially chiral arylpyrroles hold significant promise in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science.

 Autoimmunity increases the risk of developing B lymphoma in humans; however, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this link remain(s) unexplained. Here, we develop a mouse model to dissect the contribution of Id-driven T-B collaboration and show that chronic interaction between B cells and CD4+ T cells first leads to autoimmunity and later to the development of B (and T) cell lymphomas. We find that serum autoantibodies and lymphoma B cell receptor (BCR) are related and have the same specificity for ubiquitous self-antigens (histone and nucleosome) (Signal 1). Self-reactive B lymphoma cells are helped by CD4+ T cells that recognize a lymphoma neoantigen, an MHC class II-presented Idiotypic (Id) peptide (Signal 2). The mechanism, called Id-driven T-B collaboration, results in relentless mutual stimulation of B and T cells with germinal center markers, autoimmunity, and finally, malignant transformation of either B or T cells. Our results thus indicate Id-driven T-B collaboration as a potential mechanism linking autoimmunity and the development of lymphomas.

Here analysis of German television programmes and audience perceptions shows that climate change coverage is concentrated in news formats and engages climate supporters, but misses climate-distant audiences drawn to entertainment. 
 Television is a widely used medium for climate information worldwide, yet its role in public engagement remains underexplored. Here we examine both the representation of climate change on television and the audience engagement with it. We analysed 23,478 hours of programming across 20 German television channels over 61 days in 2022 and further assessed audience engagement with climate content through a representative survey (n = 1,445). In the beginning of the polycrisis context of autumn 2022—including war, inflation and energy insecurity—2.2% of broadcast hours addressed climate topics. Climate coverage was concentrated in news formats, reaching mostly to the climate-engaged majority, but remained largely invisible for climate-distant groups who prefer entertainment programmes. In addition, the results reveal unequal gender representation in television programmes and a perceived over-representation of politicians. Taken together, these findings suggest that strengthening inclusive storytelling, diversifying representation and innovating formats may enhance the reach and inclusivity of televised climate communication.

 Wind patterns are a crucial factor for migratory insect pests. However, the impact of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones (TCs), on migratory pest dynamics remains unclear. Here, we combined long-term trapping data with climatic variables and hydrogen stable isotope analysis to investigate how TCs influence the population dynamics of a globally invasive moth pest, fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), across the Gulf of America, formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico. TCs significantly increased fall armyworm moth abundance, shifting their peak activity across years. Most moths originated from southeastern Florida and the Caribbean, resulting in a 54% increase in migratory moths during the TC season. These findings reveal a previously unquantified link between extreme weather events (TCs) and migratory pest outbreaks. As TCs intensify, fall armyworm migration patterns may become increasingly unpredictable, posing greater challenges for pest management and agricultural sustainability.

 Population spatialization serves as a pivotal technique for delineating the geographical distribution patterns of human populations, which is essential for urban planning and the optimal allocation of public resources. Most existing studies rely on the density of points of interest (POI) but often overlook the attraction heterogeneity among similar POI categories. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a population spatialization method that integrates POI features with accumulable street view imagery (SVI) features. We extract dynamic object counts from SVIs to enhance spatial heterogeneity and introduce a virtual street combination-based data augmentation (VSCDA) strategy to boost model generalization across multi-scale grids. Finally, a random forest model is employed to estimate the grid-scale population distribution. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved an R2 of 0.92 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10,059 at a 100 m grid scale, significantly outperforming benchmark products such as WorldPop and GHS-POP. Ablation experiments further confirm that the VSCDA strategy reduces the MAE by over 2% at fine-to-medium scales. This integration of accumulable visual features and data augmentation provides a robust technical paradigm for advancing fine-scale population spatialization research."

The experimental search for this halt of diffusive transport in three-dimensional (3D) disordered systems, which is still very actively pursued for classical waves (light or sound), has never been demonstrated for the fundamental case of scalar waves. Inspired by recent advances in 3D metamaterials, we show that a locally resonant ultrasonic metafluid consisting of a suspension of soft metallic beads is the innovation needed for 3D Anderson localization of scalar acoustic waves to be definitively observed. By reporting two independent sets of time- and position-resolved ultrasonic experiments, we present clear evidence of Anderson transitions between diffusion and localization, accurately determining the mobility edges and the localization phase diagram."

During helminth infection, interleukin-13 (IL-13) or IL-4 drive a 10-fold expansion of tuft cells to promote helminth clearance. While IL-4/13 signaling in epithelial cells is required for tuft cell hyperplasia, few signals that support this process have been identified. Here, we show that tuft cells across all tissues express the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and that IL-4/13 is necessary and sufficient to up-regulate KIT on small intestinal (SI) tuft cells. Although epithelial KIT is dispensable for homeostatic turnover, KIT deletion from tuft cells during helminth infection reduces tuft cell hyperplasia and delays helminth clearance. Mechanistically, KIT signaling supports the generation of new tuft cells in SI crypts. These findings thus identify a unique tuft cell-specific function for KIT in type 2 immunity."

Brabec,Ink-state preaggregation control enables scalable and automated fabrication of highly efficient and stable organic photovoltaics,"Scalability and automation are critical for advancing organic solar cells (OSCs) toward high-throughput production, yet both remain notable challenges. Here, we report a simple yet effective strategy using Tz6T as a multifunctional additive to regulate ink-state preaggregation to address both concerns. Tz6T interacts with both donor and acceptor molecules in ink, enabling improved and more ordered preaggregation. This facilitates uniform film formation and significantly reduces bimolecular recombination, enables 16.4% efficiency large-area green solvent–processed OSC modules (19.3 cm2), ranking it among the best reported values to date. Furthermore, the preagggregated ink mitigates the morphology drift caused by time delays in preprogrammed robotic fabrication, yielding device efficiency exceeding 16%, highlighting strong potential for high-throughput production. Beyond efficiency, Tz6T also enhances long-term stability and exhibits compatibility across diverse material systems, underscoring its broad applicability. This work offers a promising pathway for accelerating the translation toward sustainable, scalable, and automated fabricable high-performance and stable OSCs, paving the way for their industrialization."

However, the mechanisms by which such minute melt fractions migrate through largely solid rocks and generate large-scale geophysical anomalies have remained unclear. Here, our high-pressure experiments demonstrate that, in the presence of H2O and NaCl, carbonate-rich melts act as super-spreaders, completely wetting and coating the surfaces of surrounding mantle minerals. This perfect wetting enables even trace amounts of melt (0.02 to 0.08 vol%) to form fully interconnected networks. Such connectivity facilitates efficient melt migration and chemical exchange, driving global material recycling between the surface and planetary interior."

While trans-regulatory mechanisms governingRorcexpression are well characterized, cis-regulatory mechanisms, particularly in innate lymphocytes, remain partially understood. Here, we identify CNS11 as an essential cis-regulatory element ofRorc. In TH17 cells, CNS11 was dispensable for induction but critical for maintaining RORγt expression. In contrast, CNS11 deletion blocked ILC3 progenitor induction, abolishing secondary lymphoid organ formation. CNS11 deletion also abolished the development of RORγt+Treg, RORγt+γδT, and RORγt+antigen-presenting cells. Mechanistically, CNS11 functioned through a RORγt-dependent feed-forward loop with cell type–specific cofactors: cooperating with RORγt and runt-related transcription factor 3 to direct ILC3 development and with RORγt and/or c-MAF to sustain RORγt expression in TH17, RORγt+Treg, and RORγt+γδT cells.

In particular, the nonradiative relaxation paths from the excited triplet states to the ground state, especially those involving a shelving intermediate state (IS), remain largely hypothetical, and the rate constants have yet to be directly measured. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the IS in the optical pumping cycle in a broad temperature range. We measure a 24.0(3)-nanosecond relaxation time from IS to the ground state at room temperature, which approximately doubles at low temperatures. Simulations reveal how spin populations and ground-state polarization evolve with varying excitation rates. Accordingly, we optimize optically detected magnetic resonance pulse sequences to account for the effects of IS relaxation. This considerably enhances spin manipulation efficiency, allowing substantial optimization of the quantum sensor’s sensitivity based on boron vacancies."

Identification of the best hapten is an essential step in the development of third-generationHaemophilus influenzaetype b (Hib) conjugate vaccines. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Hib oligosaccharide chain length and immunological activities remains elusive. A series of Hib capsular polysaccharide (CPS) oligosaccharide derivatives of different lengths were synthesized to establish carbohydrate structure-function relationships. Glycan microarray screening and immunological evaluation of oligosaccharides revealed that tetramer4, comprising four repeated disaccharide units, is the key immunogenic epitope of CPS. The investigation into the influence of carrier proteins, adjuvants, and vaccination dose on immunogenicity demonstrated that an equivalent dose of glycoconjugate4-TT without adjuvant can induce a similar immune response as a licensed Hib vaccine (MINHAI Hib). Adjuvant-free4-TT glycoconjugates can induce both a humoral and a cellular immune response as efficiently as licensed Hib vaccine. This formulation exhibited protective efficacy in a mouse septic infection model through effective pathogen clearance from the circulation to the liver-resident macrophage Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells in a mouse septic infection model. In conclusion, a well-defined semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccine candidate4-TT was developed with a more straightforward and adaptable manufacturing process and demonstrated excellent efficacy comparable to licensed Hib vaccine, providing a rationale for further evaluation in clinical trials."

However, its impact on circadian metabolic regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how chronic IH reshapes 24-hour hepatic and systemic metabolic programs in a mouse model mimicking OSA-associated chronic hypoxia. Through integrated circadian transcriptomic, metabolomic, and physiological 24-hour profiling, we show that 4 weeks of rest phase–restricted IH reprograms hepatic and systemic metabolism in a time-specific manner. This reorganization involves the coordinated circadian regulation of glucose, lipid, and redox pathways, with a shift away from oxidative metabolism toward oxygen-sparing processes such as gluconeogenesis, glycogen turnover, and lipid mobilization. These changes align with the hypoxic phase exposure and coincide with reshaped hepatic metabolite oscillations and systemic autonomic rhythms, supporting a functional adaptation to intermittent oxygen availability. Mechanistically, we identify the cAMP-CREB1 pathway as a driver of circadian transcriptional remodeling in the liver and a central integrator of IH-dependent adrenergic stress. Our findings establish chronic IH as a potent metabolic zeitgeber that rewires hepatic transcriptional and metabolic programs, revealing a circadian dimension to the metabolic consequences of sleep-disordered breathing."

We presented combinations of visual-only features, as found in natural flowers: colors of varying discriminability, paired with shapes or patterns. We found that the bees relied exclusively on colors when these were easy to discriminate, and did not learn pattern or shape features simultaneously. With harder to discriminate colors, the bees learned both color and shape or pattern features. Our results demonstrate that bumblebees flexibly adjust their learning strategies when presented with visual features of varying discriminability, to balance the investment in learning time and accuracy during multicue learning and decision making. A difference in learning dynamics suggests that blocking could serve as a mechanism to implement this strategy switch."

However, it is unknown whether the influence of social responsibility on decision-making acts primarily or directly on risk, loss, and ambiguity attitudes versus more general aspects of cognition. We report a series of experiments on objective magnitude judgments that demonstrate that the influences of responsibility on cognition and behavior extend beyond risk or ambiguity and act at the metacognitive level. Specifically, responsibility for others changes metacognitive biases, leading to a decrease in decision confidence without affecting choice accuracy. Last, we propose and empirically test a normative computational framework based on decision confidence that can explain decisions to assume or delegate responsibility for others without needing to assume changes in risk preferences."

However, the timing of their delivery to terrestrial planets remains unclear. Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are volatiles, but also siderophile elements. Their abundances in Earth’s mantle can be used to determine whether volatile elements were delivered to Earth during or after the segregation of the core. Here, we experimentally measured their partition coefficients between core-forming metal and mantle silicate under pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity conditions relevant to a deep magma ocean. Our results show that these elements exhibit similar partitioning behaviors, indicating that core-mantle equilibrium preserves their chondritic relative abundances. If a volatile-rich late veneer has been delivered to Earth after core segregation, it must have been limited in mass, making up a maximum of 0.1% Earth’s mass. This suggests that volatile elements, including water, were accreted continuously during Earth’s growth rather than being delivered predominantly by a late veneer of volatile-rich material such as carbonaceous chondrites."

Here, we show that metabolic rates across flatfish species are largely invariant from poles to the equator, which points to an explanation for interspecific thermal sensitivity based on ecology and evolution rather than thermodynamic constraints. The explanation proposed here is that warm water provides a thermodynamic opportunity, not a mandate, for metabolic rate escalation when required for predator-prey interactions. Flatfish do not require metabolic escalation because of their reliance on camouflage that mitigates the greater predation intensity in tropical waters. These findings have strong implications for models attempting to diagnose the response of organisms to climate change and for macroecological patterns more generally."

BoNTs induce a flaccid paralysis by blocking neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic neurons via solubleN-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) cleavage. The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls antimicrobial defense reactions within the intestine through neuron-released mediators. Here, we show that subclinical doses of BoNT/A and BoNT/B, which are not sufficient to cause botulism when released in the intestinal lumen, paralyze ENS neurons favoring infection by prototypic bacterial pathogens such asSalmonella entericaandShigella flexneri. The BoNTs reduce the release of mucin, decreasing the protective barrier against bacterial infection. These findings disclose previously unrecognized functions of BoNTs and roles in intestinal infections. Moreover, they indicate that BoNTs are valuable tools for investigating the ENS neuron involvement in the intestinal defense reactions."

Multiomic and functional analyses identified that these four carriers are crucial for mitochondrial translation, biogenesis and function of the oxidative phosphorylation system, as well as mitochondrial morphology. Thermostability screens showed that SLC25A48 is specifically stabilized by choline, and changes in the mitochondrial metabolome and lipidome indicated defects in choline biosynthetic pathways and remodeling of mitochondrial membranes, both consistent with SLC25A48 being a choline transporter.

KI mice of Ampkα2, but not Ampkα1, demonstrated phenotypic changes with increased fat-to-lean mass, impaired endurance exercise capacity, and diminished mitochondrial maximal respiration and conductance in skeletal muscle. Integrated temporal multiomics analysis (proteomics/phosphoproteomics/metabolomics) in skeletal muscle at rest and during exercise establishes a pleiotropic yet imperative role of Ampkα2 T172 activation for glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and contractile function. There is a substantial overlap of skeletal muscle proteomic changes in Ampkα2 T172A KI mice with that of patients with type 2 diabetes.

They profoundly reshape soil landscapes and influence the carbon cycle, yet the extent and drivers of their impact remain highly uncertain. By integrating field observations from 14 well-drained terrace landforms across a climatic-geochemical gradient with a data synthesis, we show that changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after terracing are governed by two coupled C turnover-geomorphic processes: replacement of lost topsoil C at eroding positions and stabilization of buried SOC at depositional positions. Climate strongly modulates these processes by shaping soil geochemistry and plant productivity, which in turn control SOC replacement and stabilization within terraces. Thus, terracing effects on SOC stocks shift from consistently positive in humid regions to mixed (positive and negative) outcomes in dry regions. This study establishes a framework for elucidating SOC dynamics in well-drained terrace systems and provides a scientific basis for targeted management strategies to enhance C sequestration in agricultural terraces globally."

Nanotechnology holds promise for improved drug delivery to the brain, yet the efficacy of nanomaterials crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is quite limited, and long-term intracranial retention of nanomaterials may provoke neurotoxicity. Leveraging the anti-inflammatory, BBB-crossing, and biosafe properties of hydrogen (H2), we develop an inflamed vessel–targeted/anchored H2–producing system by modifying ZrSi2nanoparticles with a P-selectin–binding peptide (ZSNP), mimicking P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand–mediated innate immune recruitment. Rather than relying on nanoparticle penetration into the brain parenchyma, this design enables ZSNP to anchor at the BBB vasculature, where it locally and continuously generates H2via hydrolysis. The released H2traverses the BBB, exerting cytoprotection through antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms that coordinate multicellular recovery processes. Furthermore, ZSNP promotes microglia-mediated angiogenesis and neurogenesis, guides axonal projections along neovascular trajectories, and facilitates microglia-neuron interaction via the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway. This reconstruction of the neurovascular network supports the reintegration of functional neural circuits, leading to structural and functional recovery that surpasses the effects of edaravone. By enabling sustained H2release at the BBB interface without requiring nanoparticle intracranial accumulation, this strategy represents a promising and low-burden neuroprotective approach for ischemic stroke."

We develop a deep learning architecture inspired from the Evoformer model of Alphafold and traditional architectures for secondary structure prediction. This model, eFold, was trained on our newly generated database and more than 300,000 secondary structures across multiple sources. We benchmark eFold on two challenging test sets of long and diverse RNA structures and show that our dataset and architecture contribute to increasing the prediction performance, compared to similar state-of-the-art methods. Together, our results reveal that merely expanding the database size is insufficient for generalization across families, whereas incorporating a greater diversity and complexity of RNA structures allows for enhanced model performance."

Specifically, the pore edge–hosted FeF3O2sites enable a favorable electronic structure to generate*OOH intermediates and simultaneously promote the interfacial transport of hydroxide for enhanced OER kinetics. The F ligands in FeF3O2sites interact with interfacial water strongly via H-bonding to promote H-bond network connectivity, thus encouraging the temporally concerted proton transfer during hydroxide diffusion. Consequently, FeF3O2sites realize the 331.5-fold enhancement in turnover frequency for alkaline OER over the NiOOH and efficient water electrolyzers (1.663 voltage at 1.0 amperes per square centimeter at 60°C, durably operating at 1.0 amperes per square centimeter > 1200 hours)."

According to a long-standing clinical and scientific paradigm, if the application of DES to a given brain region does not result in performance errors, that site is considered to be uninvolved in the task. Here, we show that both error rates and performance speed on correct trials are parametrically modulated by when DES starts and stops relative to the timeline of task-driven processing in stimulated brain areas and networks. We propose a framework, causal parametric mapping, which moves beyond the classic approach of binarizing the effects of DES on behavior into “positive” and “negative” mapping trials. Causal parametric mapping offers a method to functionally dissect separable processing stages in the human brain, in real time, with reversible causal evidence during invasive neurosurgical procedures."

Because some Wnt proteins can induce PCP in vertebrates, it has been proposed that Wnt concentration gradients provide spatial cues for polarization. However, here, we present evidence that Wnt11 can regulate PCP in a gradient-independent manner. In the neural plate ofXenopusembryos, endogenous Wnt11 does not form an obvious gradient in the direction of PCP, but is polarized at cell boundaries together with core PCP components. Wnt11 polarization is dependent on core PCP components, while polarization of core PCP components can also be induced by Wnt11, indicating a mutual amplification loop between Wnt11 and core PCP components in PCP formation. Furthermore, Wnt11 and core PCP components compose an intercellular loop to coordinate the direction of polarity. Thus, we propose that local and reciprocal interactions between Wnt11 and core PCP components can generate PCP."

This means that fluidic manipulation and actuation of passive objects can be enabled and influenced by the individual spin rate of microscale robots, the number of microrobots, and their positions relative to the objects. We explore these parameter spaces and find that the fluidic torque generated by a magnetic microrobot collective can be exploited to apply bidirectional torque to concentric ring structures and demonstrate this through physical experiments and numerical simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate how the fluidic torque of the microrobots can be exploited to actuate gear trains, rotate comparatively large three-dimensional objects, dynamically self-assemble internally driven ring structures, and absorb and expel large numbers of circular objects. Last, we show emergent behaviors where the microrobot collective’s morphology and method of locomotion changes as a function of the spin rate of the microrobots and the size and shape of the surrounding objects."

These functions are increasingly threatened by soil degradation, especially in climate-vulnerable regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where unstable soils are prone to severe erosion. As soils continue to degrade, farmers face multiple challenges; they cannot afford accurate tests to assess soil, their livelihoods are constrained by demand for food, fuel and water, and competition for valuable resources hampers farming. Hence, there is a pressing need for accessible tools to assess soil health and methods to provide tailored advice on resilient, climate-smart agricultural management and optimal use of resources. This narrative review offers a comprehensive overview of key issues and potential solutions. We highlight tools and approaches that can support farmers to improve soil and secure livelihoods. Practical indicators and field-ready tests are evaluated, with examples from Ethiopia, but tailored to support farmers and advisors across sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries. A wide range of tests are reviewed, including physical, biological, chemical, function and service-related tests, drawing on scientific and farmers knowledge. Science-based tests require expertise, equipment and incur costs, while locally-derived tests are affordable and seamlessly applicable. We also review Nature-based Solutions for improving soil quality, and assess them against factors such as labour, costs, and crop production. There is no single universally applicable practice; suitability depends on farmers’ priorities and circumstances. Therefore, we explore predictive methods—mechanistic, process-based soil models, data- and knowledge-driven Artificial Intelligence and systems models—to simulate the impact of practices on soil and farm dynamics. Promising approaches include hybrid approaches assimilating data, physics and knowledge through digital soil mapping. Overall, this review emphasizes the need to empower farmers with accessible tools and methods to harness Nature-based Solutions, build climate resilience and secure sustainable futures for generations ahead."

Although existing research has focused on objective and physical trade-offs, the politics around energy technologies like Alpine photovoltaics (PVs), wind energy, and nuclear energy are not least shaped by how trade-offs are perceived by the people (first-order beliefs about trade-offs), including how respondents believe others in society view them (second-order beliefs about trade-offs). However, these remain insufficiently understood. Here, we conduct a population-representative survey experiment among 1,899 Swiss residents. We find that most participants perceive biodiversity conservation and landscape protection to be synergetic rather than a null-sum trade-off. Furthermore, most participants underestimate others’ preferences for emission reductions over landscape protection. Rural residents—who typically report lower trust in science and are more conservative—are more likely to expect that others favor landscape protection over emission reductions, even though 62% of Swiss residents prefer emission reductions. Strikingly, our survey experiment showing respondents information about the true societal preferences reveals that people are reluctant to revise their own preferences when seeing information about others’ trade-off preferences (social influence) or their acceptance of energy projects, like Alpine PV, wind parks, sustaining nuclear stations, and new nuclear power plants. Non-experimental results show that people’s own trade-off beliefs and perceptions of synergies with landscape protection and biodiversity conservation are more important for energy technology acceptance than second-order beliefs about how others in society view these trade-offs. Thus, people are unlikely to give way to peer pressure. This suggests that political debates may strategically emphasize trade-offs to advance particular agendas. Where renewable energy preferences are polarized, or political awareness is high, as in Switzerland, preferences may remain stable even when individuals learn that others hold different views."

 Here, we present a compilation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from the Southwest Atlantic during the Common Era. We aim to highlight the challenges and opportunities in advancing our understanding of regional ocean variability and allow to understand the reasons behind the notable scarcity of such records and explore how we can improve mechanisms to prevent misinterpretation and ensure that these efforts effectively support future research. About 24 records indicated that SST anomalies fluctuated throughout the entire Common Era, with values between (-5.84 to 0.62). The limited availability of high-resolution SST records constrains our ability to fully grasp regional climate dynamics and their broader implications for the global climate system. To address this, it is essential to prioritize acquiring records that minimize coastal influences, thereby providing clearer insights into large-scale oceanic and climatic patterns. Enhancing the representation of currently under-sampled regions is crucial for constructing a more comprehensive picture of Earth’s climate history. However, addressing these gaps involves more than data collection alone. It requires a concerted effort to produce and disseminate SST reconstructions spanning the Common Era, while also raising awareness of their value to the scientific community. Ultimately, such initiatives will enhance our ability to anticipate and respond to future climate change, equipping policymakers and communities with the knowledge necessary to build resilience and adapt to an increasingly dynamic climate system."

Global trends are robust across methodological configurations. Most of the spread comes from the choice of temperature dataset, while other methodological impacts remain small. Our results show that both research and operational indicators consistently track global ocean warming, supporting their reliability and traceability for climate monitoring and Earth energy budget assessments. 
 The Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI), defined as the difference between the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing terrestrial radiation at the top of the atmosphere, provides a fundamental measure of anthropogenic climate change. Today, this imbalance is positive, indicating that the Earth system is accumulating heat, of which more than 90 % is stored in the ocean. The evolution of Global Ocean Heat Content (GOHC) thus constitutes a critical indicator of planetary warming and underpins the Earth Heat Inventory, currently the only approach capable of quantifying the observed absolute value of the EEI. Yet, the lack of standardized calculation protocols and the diversity of methodological choices across studies hinder the comparability of GOHC estimates and obscure the traceability of associated uncertainties. Here, we present a comprehensive, transparent assessment of GOHC trends and uncertainties based on an ensemble of 13 gridded in situ ocean temperature products spanning 1960–2024. Building on prior community efforts, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of GOHC trends to key methodological choices, including (i) the temperature product, (ii) the definition of the temperature variable, (iii) the treatment of seawater density and heat capacity, (iv) the ocean domain used for integration, and (v) the method used for trend estimation. Our results demonstrate that GOHC trends are remarkably robust across methodological configurations. Variations associated with the temperature variable definition, thermodynamic parameters, ocean domain, or trend estimation method remain below 0.1 W m⁻², well within the ensemble-mean uncertainty range of 0.21 W m⁻², across both recent decades and multi-decadal timescales. We further show that the substantial spread among published EEI estimates reflects pronounced temporal variability in ocean heat uptake rates. This variability renders EEI estimates highly sensitive to the selected averaging period, underscoring that present-day absolute EEI values can only be meaningfully interpreted in a long-term context. We demonstrate that the ensemble spread provides a practical and comprehensive proxy for GOHC uncertainty, consistent with product-specific uncertainty estimates. By consolidating international assessment practices, this study delivers a transparent characterization of the state of ocean warming and provides a fully documented, openly available framework for constructing a GOHC indicator. Together, these advances strengthen the Earth Heat Inventory estimate, establish a reliable benchmark for monitoring ocean warming and EEI, facilitate intercomparison across studies, and reinforce international climate assessments at the science and policy interface."

However, the dominant Cd species released in this process remain incompletely understood, particularly under different pH conditions. Herein, we investigated dynamic Cd speciation during the anaerobic reduction of Cd-bearing birnessite by Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA), revealing a progressive dominance of colloidal Cd throughout the experiment. This trend was amplified at higher pH, as evidenced by its ultimate contributions of 36.6%, 57.8%, and 77.1% to total dissolved Cd at pH 4.5, 6.0, and 8.0, respectively. Moreover, two distinct colloidal Cd fractions were identified by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The first fraction (1 kDa to 50 nm) carried 27.7–45.6% dissolved Cd via complexation with SRFA derivatives, exhibiting a lower oxidation state, higher susceptibility to reoxidation, and increased Cd release risk. The second fraction (200–450 nm) carried 8.9–31.6% dissolved Cd and evolved from organic aggregates into MnOx-OM colloids. These composite colloids could enhance colloidal Cd stability and potential mobility, especially under pH 6.0 and 8.0, due to stable crystalline manganite/hausmannite formation and enriched oxidized OM. We highlight that the released colloidal Cd during MnOx reductive dissolution under varying pH could exhibit variable mobility, reactivity, and environmental risk."

Marr,Influence of Carbon Dioxide and pH on Influenza Virus in Sessile Saliva Droplets,"Upon exhalation, virus-laden respiratory droplets experience rapid changes in environmental conditions that lead to chemical and physical alterations that can affect virus infectivity. By manipulating the concentration of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) surrounding sessile saliva droplets, we altered their chemistry and then assessed the impacts of these changes on the infectivity of influenza A virus at relative humidities of 30, 50, and 80%. For virus exposed to low CO2 (<0.005% CO2 in N2) vs high CO2 (4.3–5% CO2 in N2), differences in inactivation were small except at 80% RH, where the virus decayed less (i.e., maintained greater infectivity) in low CO2 than in high CO2. The difference exceeded 1log10 at 2 h. For comparison, virus inactivation in ambient air (0.04% CO2) varied across conditions, sometimes exceeding and sometimes falling below that observed under high- and low-CO2 atmospheres. Collectively, these results suggest that the driving factors for virus inactivation vary with RH. We measured droplet pH using gold nanoprobes in combination with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and found that pH increased in low CO2 and decreased in high CO2 at 80% RH by ∼1 pH unit in both cases. Results were consistent with chemical equilibrium modeling, which indicated that both carbonate and phosphate buffering were important. Changes in pH were smaller or insignificant at 30 and 55% RH. At these low and medium RHs, rapid evaporation of water from the droplets and the resulting increase in viscosity may limit changes in pH. Measured changes in pH did not appear to be sufficient to drive virus inactivation under any tested condition. This finding suggests that pH likely does not impact influenza transmission by fomites."

Herein, we establish a metal-free catalytic framework for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) by synergistically integrating vacancy-defect engineering with a mild electrothermal coupling strategy (<100 °C). The defective carbon nanotubes (d-CNTs) create localized electron-rich pockets that optimize the adsorption of NOx intermediates and facilitate proton-coupled electron transfer. Under electrothermal coupling at 50 °C, the d-CNTs achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 64.4% and an NH3 yield rate of 2.54 mg h–1 cm–2 at a nitrate concentration of 10 mM. A combination of in situ spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations unravels a dual-channel acceleration mechanism: defect-induced electronic redistribution enhances NO3– activation, while thermally promoted atomic hydrogen (H*) mediates the sequential hydrogenation steps. This synergy not only suppresses the competing hydrogen evolution but also enables remarkable stability over 20 cycles in simulated wastewater. Beyond the laboratory performance, we demonstrate a practical product recovery route via gas stripping and acid absorption, and a comparative life-cycle assessment confirms a >90% reduction in carbon footprint relative to conventional industrial routes. The significance of this work lies in the conceptual integration of defect engineering and electrothermal operation within a metal-free NO3RR system, offering a generalizable strategy for low-carbon nitrate remediation and nitrogen valorization."

This study investigated the effects of sucralose (SUC) and UV-aged poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) MPs using an in vivo model of Caenorhabditis elegans. Exposure to SUC and/or MPs (1–100 μg/L) induced significant obesity phenotypes, including increased body width and volume alongside elevated lipid accumulation and lipid droplet levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Critically, coexposure produced stronger obesogenic effects than predicted additive values from single exposures, demonstrating a synergistic interaction. Behavioral analyses revealed that coexposure concurrently increased pharyngeal pumping rates but decreased crawling locomotion, with obesogenic parameters positively correlating with feeding activity and negatively with locomotor capacity. Molecular analysis confirmed the corresponding dysregulation of genes governing feeding behavior (mgl-1), energy sensing (aak-2), and lipid metabolism (daf-16, sbp-1), supporting the hyperphagia-hypolocomotion phenotype. Metabolomics analysis demonstrated exposure-specific disruption of nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolism and glutamate-mediated biosynthesis pathways, which collectively accelerated lipid accumulation. These results suggest that MPs can act not merely as obesogens but also synergistically amplify SUC’s obesogenic toxicity associated with altered locomotion and metabolism.

A common belief is that the sorption of hydrophobic EDCs is key to their rejection, while high sorption often leads to low rejection. However, this study reported distinct sorption–rejection behavior of EDCs by various chlorinated polyamide membranes. Specifically, the chlorinated NF90 membrane exhibited significantly reduced sorption and, thus, enhanced rejection for EDCs. This is primarily attributed to the enhanced hydrophilic carboxyl groups through chlorination-induced hydrolysis, which can suppress the hydrophobic interactions between the membrane and the EDCs. More interestingly, the chlorinated VNF1 membrane demonstrated higher sorption but also higher rejection of EDCs than that of the virgin membrane. The high sorption can be attributed to the strong hydrophobic interaction between EDCs and the hydrophobic chlorine attached to the membrane. Meanwhile, the large size of chlorine also strengthened membrane size exclusion, thereby enhancing its rejection of EDCs. Such enhanced size exclusion overperformed the impact of increased sorption, thus leading to enhanced rejection. These findings elaborate the existing membrane sorption–rejection framework and offer valuable insights for the rational design of advanced NF membranes aiming for the effective elimination of EDCs in water and wastewater treatment."

By systematically replacing mineral salt medium components, we demonstrate that a modified HEPES/Cl–-rich medium allows colorimetric F– quantification (20–200 μM) during biodefluorination of 1-fluorodecane (FD), 4,5,5-trifluoropent-4-enoic acid (TFEA), and 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl) crotonic acid (SFCA). Applied in a deep 96-well microtiter plate format, this approach explored the biodefluorination of these compounds in growing axenic cultures, resting cell incubations, and mixed environmental cultures. Sphingopyxis sp. strain NJF-3 and Rhodococcus sp. strain NJF-7 exhibited differential defluorination of TFEA and SFCA. Resting cells exhibited limited defluorination activity to TFEA and SFCA, but strain NJF-7 displayed higher TFEA defluorination (219 μM F–) than strain NJF-3 (39.1 μM F–), indicating a greater growth-independent defluorination capacity. Defluorination by environmentally sourced microbial communities varied, potentially reflecting differences in sample origin (water vs soil). Correlation analysis of intermediates measured in different SFCA-defluorinating cultures indicated that abiotic and biotic reactions contribute to SFCA transformation, with a β-oxidation-type pathway inferred for the biotransformation. The refined approach expands the tool box for investigating biodefluorination in microbial enrichment and pure culture studies."

Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of predicting fault permeability using cumulative seismic moments of MEQs quantitatively. To understand the underlying physical processes, we conduct fault reactivation experiments using Utah FORGE granitoid and analyze acoustic emission (AE) signals generated during stepwise increases in fluid injection pressure. Frequency analysis of thousands of calibrated AE signals reveals that fault reactivation produces multiple AE source patches with millimeter‐scale radii—smaller than the sample fault radius. The cumulative area of the reactivated patches covers the fault multiple times over (∼10x–50x area) for each pressure step. These findings provide mechanistic insight that measured permeability enhancement is not driven by a single large slip event, but by the sequential and interacting activation of multiple slip patches that create a continuous flow pathway."

While these drivers independently alter grassland structure, their interactive effects on the critical diversity‐productivity relationship remain poorly understood, particularly under contrasting precipitation regimes. Through a 3‐year split‐plot experiment (four grazing intensities × N addition) in a Loess Plateau steppe, we examined how interannual precipitation variability modulates the effects of grazing and N on the coupling strength between diversity (species richness, SR) and productivity (peak aboveground biomass, ANPP). Three key findings emerged: First, SR–ANPP coupling was strongly precipitation‐dependent: low grazing with N enhanced their synergy in wet years, whereas drought combined with heavy grazing triggered severe decoupling. Second, functional group asynchrony drove these dynamics: ephemeral forbs amplified SR responses to wet years, whereas drought‐tolerant grasses stabilized ANPP but accelerated SR collapse in dry years. Third, soil pathways mediated the coupling dynamics: precipitation and soil C‐N pools facilitated coordination, while grazing‐induced increases in bulk density exerted counteracting effects. Our CDS (Climate‐Disturbance‐Soil feedback) framework demonstrates that moderate grazing optimizes precipitation responsiveness when combined with strategic N inputs, offering actionable thresholds for maintaining coupled ecosystem functions under climate extremes."

 Growing concerns about plastic pollution and climate change worldwide are driving research into the effects of microplastics on carbon cycling. Although the impacts of microplastics on soil organic carbon (SOC) levels and carbon emissions have been demonstrated, their role in SOC sequestration remains understudied. Here we discuss how interactions between microplastics and organic matter may affect SOC sequestration through biological, geochemical and physical processes. Microplastics and co-occurring contaminants alter SOC content and quality by leaching dissolved organic matter (DOM) and affecting native SOC mineralization. These changes may influence the efficacy of the microbial carbon pump and mineral-associated organic carbon formation. Furthermore, microplastic surfaces adsorb DOM for long-term preservation and form hotspots for mineral–organic matter interactions, thereby altering carbon storage within soil aggregates. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the role of microplastics in soil carbon dynamics, from local to global scales, is essential to address both microplastic pollution and carbon neutrality.

Here, the authors show that weakly localized electrons enhance the electronic coherence in fluorine-functionalized covalent organic frameworks strengthening charge separation and promoting directional electron transport to boost the photocatalytic uranium removal from nuclear wastewater. 
 Photocatalytic uranium removal from nuclear wastewater is a promising strategy for radionuclide mitigation, yet its practical deployment is greatly hampered by inefficient charge separation of electron-hole pairs in photocatalytic systems, which critically limits the generation of reactive oxygen species essential for uranium precipitation. Herein, we propose a approach that leverages weakly localized electrons to enhance electronic coherence in fluorine-functionalized covalent organic frameworks, thereby strengthening charge separation and promoting directional electron transport for greatly boosting photocatalytic uranium removal from nuclear wastewater. We demonstrate that the partial fluorination in covalent organic frameworks induce weak electron localization and strong electronic coherence, which delivers a record-high solar-to-chemicals conversion efficiency of 1.52% and achieves 100% uranium removal efficiency within the pH range of 3-6, outperforming non-fluorinated (0.31%) and over-fluorinated (0.85%) counterparts. More importantly, a self-designed flow-type reactor achieves 99% uranium removal efficiency and superior U processing capacity of 281.3 g m-2 day-1 under natural sunlight, significantly surpassing reported photocatalytic systems and meeting World Health Organization discharge limits. Mechanism investigation reveal that the partial fluorination enhanced electronic coherence improves photogenerated carrier transport and reparation for accelerating reactive oxygen species synthesis, thereby promoting uranium removal from nuclear wastewater.

 Substrate specificity is a defining feature of enzyme function, but its molecular underpinnings remain difficult to decode and engineer. Here, we leverage enzyme proximity sequencing (EP-Seq) to systematically map how single-point and combinatorial mutations reshape the substrate preferences of D-amino acid oxidase (DAOx) from Rhodotorula gracilis, a model promiscuous enzyme. We generate ~40,000 sequence–phenotype pairs, enabling us to profile the activities of ~6,500 unique DAOx variants against five D-amino acid substrates with distinct physicochemical properties. Our analysis reveals that substrate-specific mutations are distributed throughout the enzyme structure. Mutations near the active site drive strong specificity shifts but also incur catalytic penalties, while distal mutations subtly rewire intramolecular contacts in order to modulate specificity with minimal loss of activity. We identify and validate positional hotspots that act allosterically to influence specificity, and characterize key variants that acquire exclusive substrate specificity or exhibit up to 230-fold changes in substrate preference. Combining mutations with complementary effects further sharpens substrate discrimination, enabling rational design of highly selective biocatalysts. This work establishes a powerful framework for decoding enzyme specificity and provides foundational datasets to advance AI-guided enzyme engineering.

Here, we show that PKD1, an 11-transmembrane protein with a noncanonical transient receptor potential (TRP) channel architecture, functions as a GPCR with unique biochemical properties. PKD1 acts as a WNT-activated receptor, directly coupling to heterotrimeric Gαi1-3 subunits to inhibit cellular cAMP accumulation. While PKD1 contains both ligand-binding and G protein recruitment sites, PKD2, an associating TRP channel subunit, chaperones PKD1 to the plasma membrane to operate as a GPCR. This represents a striking departure from classical GPCR architecture and expands the functional repertoire of the TRP channel family. Given that mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 are linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, a multisystemic disorder marked by elevated cAMP levels, our results provide molecular insights into disease pathogenesis and highlight potential new therapeutic avenues for this debilitating and costly condition.

 The COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread school closures and a swift transition to distance learning, raising concerns about consequences for student success. This study explores academic outcomes in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) courses during COVID-induced distance learning using student-course records at an U.S. public university. We particularly focus on students from underserved populations and who have below average academic outcomes. Employing an expected shortfall regression strategy, we examine outcomes in the bottom quintile and compare differences between students whose household income were in the lowest bracket or without a parent holding a four-year college degree and peers for whom this was not the case, in distance and in-person learning. We show that during distance learning, students in disadvantaged populations in the lowest quintile had average grade differences of 0.11 and 0.06 points, respectively. We also find that targeted instructional changes in an introductory physics course were associated with narrower achievement gaps. These results suggest that while distance learning posed challenges for underserved students, deliberate strategies to increase interaction may potentially support greater equity in STEM education.

This study identifies a CD19+ macrophage subset in hepatocellular carcinoma and evaluates strategies to target them for improved immunotherapy. 
 Tumor-associated macrophages are a key component that contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment in human cancers. However, therapeutic targeting of macrophages has been a challenge in clinic due to the limited understanding of their heterogeneous subpopulations and distinct functions. Here, we identify a clinically relevant CD19+ subpopulation of macrophages that is enriched in many types of cancer, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CD19+ macrophages exhibit increased levels of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CD73, enhanced mitochondrial oxidation, and compromised phagocytosis, indicating their immunosuppressive functions. Targeting CD19+ macrophages with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells inhibited HCC tumor growth. We identify Paired Box 5 (PAX5) as a primary driver of up-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis in CD19+ macrophages, which depletes cytoplasmic Ca2+, leading to lysosomal deficiency and consequent accumulation of CD73 and PD-L1. Inhibiting CD73 or mitochondrial oxidation enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in treating HCC, suggesting great promise for CD19+ macrophage-targeting therapeutics.

Here, authors introduce a model with critical mass dynamics that explains how rumors spread and fade in online groups, uncovering tipping points and showing agreement with real message cascades on social media platform. 
 The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. The dynamics has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, in the set of parameters we analysed, we found continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs. This finding aligns with the literature suggesting that real-world rumor propagation occurs near criticality. Finally, we validated our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, which provides additional evidence and possible explanations for this criticality claim. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems. Rumors often spread through collective exposure rather than simple pairwise contacts. Here, authors introduce a model with critical mass dynamics that explains how rumors spread and fade in online groups, uncovering tipping points and showing agreement with real message cascades on social media platform."

 A past 3-million-year transient simulation with Community Earth System Model version 1.2 reveals precessional dominance in El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability intensity and spatial structure. Under boreal winter-solstice perihelion (like late Holocene), basin-scale ENSO variability intensifies through strengthened thermocline and zonal advective feedbacks, driven by a broad El Niño-like mean surface warming and enhanced tropical Pacific rainbands. Under boreal vernal-equinox perihelion, central-Pacific ENSO variability shifts eastward moderately, primarily due to intensified zonal advective feedback, following a strengthened background South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and interhemispherically opposing rainband changes. ENSO responses under boreal summer-solstice and autumn-equinox perihelion are contrastingly weaker. Consequently, both ENSO characteristics coevolve with the precession’s magnitude set by orbital eccentricity. Precessional modulation of ENSO progressively strengthened toward the present, mediated by a gradually intensified background SPCZ under greenhouse gas and ice-sheet forcings. We suggest that sea surface warming patterns and associated tropical rainbands are paramount in past ENSO changes."

 Tornadoes are common atmospheric phenomena worldwide; however, the mechanisms governing non-supercell tornadoes, particularly anticyclonic ones, remain less well understood, especially in regions with complex terrain. In Mexico, a considerable number of non-supercell tornadoes exhibit clockwise rotation, and some studies suggest a potential link between topography and these phenomena. In this context, this study investigates two anticyclonic non-supercell tornadoes that occurred in central Mexico: one in Tlaxcala (2016) and another in Querétaro (2017) states, both within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Using high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model, complemented by satellite and reanalysis data, we analyze the environments that favored the development of these events. Both cases occurred under moderate instability, with weak to moderate wind shear and marked moisture flux convergence, modulated by orographic features. Results of model simulations show that mountain-induced perturbations generated alternating cyclonic and anticyclonic vertical vorticity fields along low-level convergence lines. The advection of negative vertical vorticity, coupled with vertical motion associated with convective updrafts, favored the initiation of anticyclonic rotation. Therefore, a schematic conceptual model is proposed to describe this process, emphasizing the key role of wind-orography interactions in producing surface vertical vorticity dipoles that may later evolve into non-supercell tornadoes. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for topographic influences in evaluating tornadic potential in complex terrains, providing a framework for understanding the relatively high frequency of anticyclonic vortices in regions with complex orography."

Among these NSGs,growth arrest and DNA damage–inducible protein 34(GADD34) was crucial for IAV restriction.

We investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms in hummingbirds, parrots, honeyeaters, and sunbirds by generating nine new genomes and 90 tissue-specific transcriptomes. Comparative screens revealed an excess of repeated selection in both protein-coding and regulatory sequences in sugar-feeding birds, suggesting reuse of genetic elements. Sequence or expression changes in sugar-feeders affect genes involved in blood pressure regulation and lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, with experiments showing functional changes in honeyeater hexokinase 3.MLXIPL, a key regulator of sugar and lipid homeostasis, showed convergent sequence and regulatory changes across all sugar-feeding clades; experiments revealed enhanced sugar-induced transcriptional activity of hummingbirdMLXIPL, highlighting its adaptive role in high-sugar diets."

Mammalian transition to daytime activity accelerated after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We identified a conserved cell-intrinsic, thermodynamic mechanism that likely facilitated this shift. In cells from diurnal mammals, protein synthesis, phosphorylation, and circadian timing were less sensitive to temperature changes than were cells from nocturnal mammals. Comparative genomics revealed accelerated evolution within essential signaling pathways, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), that increase the robustness of diurnal cellular clocks to thermal and osmotic perturbation. In nocturnal mice, mTOR inhibition shifted cells, tissues, and behavior toward diurnal activity. These findings uncover a genetic and biochemical basis for nocturnal-diurnal switching, emphasizing how cellular signaling networks can encode complex phenotypes such as temporal niche selection."

Mechanisms by which the first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) becomes a stably inserted duplex, including requirements for junction formation at the cDNA 3′ end and second-strand synthesis, are unknown. We screened for cellular factors that influence site-specific transgene synthesis into the human genome by an R2 retrotransposon protein. We discovered that insertion lengths and junction signatures differ based on alternative repair processes involving ATR-dependent polymerase θ end joining, 53BP1-directed shieldin and CST–polymerase α–primase fill-in synthesis, or limited strand annealing dependent on CtIP-MRN. These insights shed light on how genome-primed cDNA synthesis by a non-LTR retrotransposon protein can support stable new gene insertion, with major implications for native retrotransposon mobility and genome engineering."

The reconstitution recapitulated the sex-determination process, yielding cell types that formed seminiferous tubules and adjacent interstitial tissues. The reconstituted testicular tissue incorporated pluripotent stem cell–derived primordial germ cells and supported their differentiation into spermatogonial stem cells.

We used atomic layer deposition to deposit hafnium oxide (HfOx) interlayers to stabilize these molecular interfaces under operational stress. At the NiOx/self-assembled monolayer (SAM) interface, a hydroxyl-rich, Lewis-acidic n-HfOxlayer (n denotes negative fixed-charge polarity) promoted tridentate phosphonic acid coordination and enhanced SAM retention and thermal durability.

By observing a 62% relative excess of AMH ancestry in Neanderthal X chromosomes, we characterized the interbreeding between the two groups as predominantly male Neanderthals with female AMHs. Analytic and numerical modeling presents mate preference as a more parsimonious cause of the sex bias than purely demographic processes with differential patterns of male and female migration."

Understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing this developmental plasticity could help improve crop performance while reducing fertilizer application. We identified OsWRI1a (WRINKLED1a) as a regulatory hub coordinating rice root and shoot growth in response to external N supply, thereby stabilizing the root-to-shoot ratio. In roots, OsWRI1a enhances N-responsive development by promoting auxin accumulation. Meanwhile, shoot OsWRI1a stimulates tiller development and therefore shoot growth. We identified an eliteOsWRI1ahaplotype that minimizes root-to-shoot ratio fluctuation under N deficiency, improving N-use efficiency and grain yield.

We overcome this barrier by placing a polycrystalline lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic in a temperature and electric-field control module so that it operates at a quadruple phase point (QP). This QP ceramic exhibited ad33of ~6850 pC/N, which surpasses that of commercial PZT ceramics by 10 to 30 times and commercial lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate single crystals by ~4 times. This exceptional property arises from the tricritical nature of the QP, a thermodynamic singularity that produces an ultrasoft lattice and enables complete polarization alignment in polycrystals.

The method utilizes a bifunctional peptide catalyst to template the terminal functional groups of the linear precursor, thereby favoring intra- over intermolecular reaction and enabling exquisite control over the stereochemistry of the emerging stereogenic centers. Diverse 12- to 18‐membered macrocyclic lactones and lactams were obtained from achiral linear precursors. The organocatalyst even dictates the stereochemical outcome upon cyclizing a chiral linear precursor. This catalyst-controlled stereoselective head-to-tail macrocyclization provides a practical route to chiral macrocycles with predictable stereochemical outcomes.

Cellular states from broadly distributed lineages displayed synchronized dynamics with age, indicating systemic signals that coordinate these changes. Molecular analyses identified both intrinsic regulators (chromatin peaks, transcription factor activity) and extrinsic factors (cytokine programs) underlying these shifts. Moreover, ~40% of aging-associated population dynamics were sex-dependent, with tens of thousands of peaks altered exclusively in one sex. Together, these findings present a comprehensive framework for how aging reshapes the chromatin landscape and cellular composition across diverse tissues."

Existing biomarkers of dysbiosis fail to capture the ecological mechanisms that differentiate healthy from diseased microbiomes. We have developed a metric, the ecological network balance index (ENBI), that quantifies the balance between positive and negative microbial interactions. This metric was inspired by the phenomenology observed in a model for gut microbiome dynamics that we introduce in this work, which revealed alternative stable states with distinct emergent microbial communities: a healthy state dominated by negative interactions and a dysbiotic state dominated by positive interactions. The ENBI robustly differentiates these states in both simulated and empirical datasets spanning multiple diseases and correlates with disease progression in conditions such as colorectal cancer, which underscores its potential as a diagnostic tool."

CD70 is a promising candidate, physiologically confined to immune cell subsets and aberrantly expressed in many cancers. We show that heterogeneous CD70 expression in tumors is epigenetically regulated, ranging from high to very low in individual cells, appearing negative by conventional detection methods. Using a highly sensitive CD70 receptor, HLA-independent T cell (HIT) receptor coexpressing CD80 and 4-1BBL for costimulation, we efficiently eliminated CD70-heterogeneous tumors that evade prototypic CAR T cells.

We show an average continent-wide decline of abundance of all birds per local route, with hotspots of decline in southern and warm parts of North America and hotspots of accelerating decline in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and California, matching patterns of agricultural intensity. Overall, 122 species (47%) exhibit significant declines, of which 63 also show acceleration of this decline, and 67 show declining per-capita growth rate, raising concerns for a large part of North American bird populations. These findings suggest that bird abundance decline is mostly accelerating, with spatial patterns of this acceleration indicating that agricultural intensity may be a driver of this trend."

Here, we report a culture method for generating fetal testicular somatic cell–like cells (fTeSLCs) from embryonic stem cells. These fTeSLCs exhibit a transcriptomic profile closely resembling that of their in vivo counterparts, including distinct cell populations corresponding to Sertoli cells and interstitial cells. For functional assessment, interstitial cell–like cells (ICLCs) and Sertoli-like cells (SerLCs) were isolated from fTeSLCs. ICLCs differentiated into Leydig cells when cocultured with testes lacking endogenous Leydig cells, thereby restoring androgenic support. SerLCs reconstituted the seminiferous epithelium following selective ablation of endogenous Sertoli cells. Both cell types supported spermatogenesis and generated spermatids reaching the elongating stage. Notably, round spermatids derived from these reconstructed systems produced viable offspring by round spermatid injection. These findings demonstrate that fTeSLCs can generate functional testicular somatic cells, providing a valuable platform for studying testis development and spermatogenesis."

Environment90m is a new dataset, which aggregates 104 environmental variables across the 726 million sub-catchments of the Hydrography90m river network. It includes present and future climate, land cover, soils, topography, hydrographic and streamflow information. Environment90m provides an array of opportunities for research and applications in freshwater science. 
 The current loss of freshwater biodiversity calls for immediate action, including the mobilisation of existing data and tools to support long-term conservation. Yet, establishing a global baseline for the spatial distribution of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they host remains difficult. Such task would require standardized, high-resolution environmental information to characterise freshwater habitats anywhere in the world. To address this challenge, we present the Environment90m dataset, which aggregates a large number of environmental layers into each of the 726 million sub-catchments of the Hydrography90m dataset, corresponding to single stream segments. Specifically, Environment90m includes 45 variables related to topography and hydrography, 19 climate variables for the observation period of 1981–2010, as well as projections for 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1.26, 3.70 and 5.85, and three global circulation models (UKESM1-0-LL, MPI-ESM1-2-HR and IPSL-CM6A-LR). Moreover, Environment90m includes 22 land cover categories for the annual time-series data from 1992–2020. In addition, we provide 15 soil variables and information on aridity and modelled streamflow. Summary statistics (i.e., mean, min, max, range, sd) are provided for all continuous variables, while for categorical data, the proportion of each category is calculated within each of the sub-catchments. The data is available at https://hydrography.org/environment90m (last access: 4 February 2026). To facilitate data download and processing, we provide dedicated functions within the hydrographr R-package, and extend these also to new functions for processing upstream data of lakes. For all underlying calculations, we used the open-source tools GDAL/OGR, GRASS-GIS and AWK, so that custom data can be easily generated using the hydrographr R-package. Environment90m, along with the tools, provides an array of opportunities for research and application in spatial freshwater biodiversity science, specifically biogeographic analyses and conservation exercises in freshwater ecosystems. The metadata of the Environment90m dataset is stored at https://doi.org/10.18728/igb-fred-995.0 (García Márquez et al., 2025a)."

Using data from more than five hundred sites, we measured Fe, Mn, Zn, and V in surface soils and found strong regional differences mainly shaped by rock weathering, with added effects of climate and landscape. Our high-resolution maps and uncertainty estimates support sustainable land management and improved predictions under climate change. 
 Soil micronutrient supply sustains critical ecological functions but exhibit poorly quantified distribution patterns in high-altitude ecosystems. This study bridges this knowledge gap through a large-scale investigation across the Tibetan Plateau, a cold-arid region where cryogenic weathering, aridity, and suppressed pedogenesis interact to govern micronutrient cycling. We assembled a plateau-wide dataset from 526 sites with triplicate surface soils (0–10 cm) per site (n = 1660). Four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, and V) were measured by laboratory X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for all samples and calibrated and validated against inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for a subset of samples.Four micronutrients were paired with multi-source predictors (climate, vegetation, soil covariates, topography, grazing disturbance, and weathering proxy). Elemental contents span broad ranges, with site-level summaries (mean ± SD, mg kg−1) of Fe 22 864.30 ± 7589.01, Mn 576.74 ± 206.44, Zn 27.24 ± 8.55, and V 56.99 ± 19.33. Random Forest model was employed to quantify controls and generate high-resolution spatial maps. Key results reveal that pronounced regional heterogeneity is driven primarily by weathering intensity with secondary modulation from climate and topography covariates. Element-specific spatial patterns were observed, with Fe enrichment in southeastern/southern plateau, Mn gradients increasing southeastward. Zn hotspots in central-eastern and western marginal zones, and V exhibits a moderate spatial gradient, with higher contents in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and relatively lower values in the northwest. We provide 1 km maps of all four micronutrients together with pixel-wise uncertainty layers to support benchmarking of process-based micronutrient cycling models and to inform sustainable ecosystem management under climate change. Predictions for major elements are robust, whereas trace-level elements, particularly Zn, exhibit comparatively higher methodological uncertainty despite calibration. Accordingly, users should interpret absolute Zn contents with caution and refer to the accompanying uncertainty diagnostics when applications require high-precision estimates. The dataset is openly available at TPDC (https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.303242, Huo et al., 2026)."

Cytotoxicity assays revealed that the presence of precursors such as L-tyrosine (Tyr), L-tryptophan (Trp) and tannic acid during the NH2Cl–O3 process contributed to this increase in nitrogenous and halogenated DBPs and resulted in elevated overall toxicity. Nontargeted ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry identified diverse halogenated DBPs, with NH2Cl–O3 yielding up to 5-fold more structures and higher abundances than NH2Cl or O3 alone. Taking Tyr as an example, proposed DBP (4-bromophenol, 4-hydroxyphenylacetamide, etc.) formation pathways, involving haloamine-mediated N-halogenation, O3-driven oxidation, decarboxylation, and deamination, were supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirming both thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Matrix-dependent quantitative validation in Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and wastewater effluents showed that concentrations of some identified DBPs reached tens of μg/L, dominated by aromatic halo-phenolics and brominated derivatives. In silico quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models and cytotoxicity assays indicated that these aromatic halo-DBPs exhibited comparable toxicities to conventional DBPs (e.g., dichloroacetonitrile, N-nitrosodimethylamine), but had a higher toxicity index than BrO3–. These findings highlight trade-offs in water disinfection, underscoring the need for optimized strategies to co-control BrO3– and toxic organic DBPs."

However, the underlying reaction network governing these advantages remains unclear. To address this, a multiscale analysis was employed to unravel the enhancement mechanisms. This integrated approach combined macro-scale observation using coupled thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS), mesoscale validation via targeted experiments with model aromatics and pyrolytic char, and microscale elucidation through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results reveal that molten hydroxides simultaneously lower the biomass decomposition temperature, suppress tar formation, and activate three distinct hydrogen production pathways: organic catalytic cracking (200–450 °C), deep aromatic volatiles reforming (>500 °C), and char alkalization (>550 °C). Aromatics reforming involves both condensation and ring cleavage. Ring cleavage proceeds via OH– nucleophilic addition and C–H bond heterolysis, with deprotonation as the rate-determining step and the energy barrier governed by the molecular geometry of aromatics. Char alkalization follows fundamental steps with lighter aromatics but encounters higher energy barriers due to its more condensed structure. This work establishes a multiscale mechanistic framework for hydrogen production, paving the way for the rational design of efficient and low-carbon biomass-to-hydrogen technologies based on molten salts."

Using over 14 million nitrate and phosphate measurements collected between 1925 and 2025, we quantify long‐term trends in nutrient concentrations across ocean biomes and depths. We find that surface waters in oligotrophic and mesotrophic regions show significant declines in phosphate, whereas nitrate is also slightly decreasing in oligotrophic but increasing in mesotrophic regions. Many coastal areas exhibit nutrient enrichment. Subsurface waters reveal widespread nitrate accumulation, suggesting an imbalance driven by biological nitrogen fixation and reduced vertical mixing. Comparison with Earth system models indicates that current simulations underestimate the pace of nutrient shifts. Our results highlight a large‐scale biogeochemical reorganization of ocean nutrient distributions that may intensify under future climate warming."

Prior studies primarily attribute the ITF decline to changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and Indo‐Pacific winds, but these two processes account for only a fraction of the simulated ITF weakening (50%–100% across models). Here we show that Southern Ocean surface warming and freshening explain this missing fraction. Enhanced dense‐to‐light water mass transformation in the Southern Ocean produces upper‐ocean volume convergence that propagates globally via wave dynamics, slowing the ITF in a manner analogous to the AMOC‐driven impacts. We further quantified the combined AMOC and Southern Ocean contributions and find that these bipolar processes explain, on average, 89% of the projected ITF decline in climate models. Our results reveal critical linkages between high‐latitude climate change and low‐latitude circulation, positioning the ITF as an indicator of global overturning adjustments."

This weakening is localized within narrow principal slip zones (PSZs) that commonly contain nanoparticles in both natural and experimental faults. Although weakening is dominated by thermally activated mechanisms, the thermal and mechanical effects of extreme grain‐size reduction in PSZs remain poorly constrained. We examine the melting behavior of dry granitoid fault rocks ball‐milled to mean grain sizes from 150 μm to 300 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals a decrease in melting temperature, from 1,270°C to 1,090°C, with decreasing grain size. Our results demonstrate that extreme grain‐size reduction lowers the temperatures required for dynamic weakening via melting. Comparisons with previous studies suggest PSZs are enriched in ultrafine, mechanically weak mineral phases that can influence frictional melt composition. In natural faults, this effect is likely amplified by complex mineralogy, high pressure–temperature conditions, and fluids."

In particular, future decreases in glacier runoff are hypothesized to reduce the stability of hydro‐biogeochemical export. We test this hypothesis using a decade of discharge, dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus data from four Alaskan watersheds spanning a gradient in glacier cover. We demonstrate that glacier decline leads to lower and more variable runoff across years, with 2.6–4.3 times greater interannual variability in lightly‐glacierized compared to glacier‐dominated watersheds. Biogeochemical export also became more stochastic with retreat, with up to a five‐fold increase in interannual variability. However, the responses of riverine concentrations and yields to changes in glacier cover varied widely between constituents. Such shifts in the magnitude and stochasticity of hydro‐biogeochemical yields have important implications for the ecological stability of downstream ecosystems."

Ocean‐bottom seismometers (OBS) deployed on the Congo Canyon–Channel levees captured the structure and turbulence of overspill during an exceptionally large canyon‐flushing event in 2020. Overspill persisted for 3 weeks and comprised numerous short (20‐min to 2‐hr) pulses focused at outer bends. Spectra during overspill show well‐resolved turbulence inertial subranges, yielding event‐average dissipation rates of 10−6–10−5 m2 s−3, comparable to energetic internal‐tide breaking. Abyssal overspill can therefore be long‐lasting and highly pulsed, providing an episodic but locally important source of deep‐ocean mixing. This new view of levee overspill has important implications for building levees and the interpretation of ancient turbidites. Individual levee deposits may be formed incrementally by many pulses of dilute and fine‐grained flow from a single turbidity current."

This discrepancy has been attributed to changes in marine environments or to insufficient thermal maturity required for dolomite formation. We measured carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotope compositions of carbonate rocks from the Albian Nahal Me'arot reef complex (north Israel), where dolomite is confined to back‐reef lagoon facies and associated with reflux‐brine dolomitization, a process thought responsible for large volumes of dolomite in Phanerozoic rocks. Results show a negative trend between TΔ47 (29–54°C) and δ18Odolomite (−3.25 to −1.35 ‰VPDB), consistent with burial alteration, and support a two‐stage process: (a) proto‐dolomite formation near the lagoon floor, and (b) recrystallization during burial.

We use receiver functions generated from long‐term seismic stations and a temporary array to image the subsurface at this section boundary. Using velocity inversion and common conversion point stacking, we find there are distinct crustal structures on either side of the fault trace. The subvertical fault likely extends northeastward past the section boundary and two fault structures may co‐exist beyond the section boundary. This geometry is consistent with microseismicity and previous tectonic studies, and helps to explain through‐going fault ruptures."

We show that conventional elastic dislocation models yield slip rates and locking depths that conflict with seismic and geologic constraints. In contrast, models incorporating a viscoelastic rheology for the lower crust yield geologically consistent slip rates, with the Zemuhe fault slipping 7 mm/yr and the Daliangshan fault slipping 2 mm/yr, and locking depths more consistent with microseismicity (17–20 km). In contrast with major strike‐slip faults worldwide, deformation in this immature system appears distributed over a broad lower‐crustal region.

 Direct oxidation of methane to methanol is valuable, but reactive oxygen species over oxidize methane and lower selectivity. Here we report a Rh-Cu heteronuclear dual atom catalyst on nitrogen doped graphite that separates sites and restrains oxygen intermediates, enabling methanol through oxygen insertion into C-H bonds. An encapsulated pyrolysis strategy yields an Rh-Cu-N6 motif with a Rh-Cu distance of 2.42 Å. Electronic coupling between Rh and Cu induces charge polarization and improves reactant activation. Cu captures active oxygen species, suppressing excessive oxygen insertion and deep oxidation. The catalyst achieves up to 81% methanol selectivity and about threefold higher activity than a single atom Rh catalyst. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal stable oxygen bridged intermediates, Rh-O-O-Cu and Rh-O-Cu. Rh stabilizes methyl intermediates, while Cu restrains nearby oxygen reactivity and directs oxygen insertion into C-H bonds to form methanol.

Tracking cargo flows uncovers annual cycles with 16% swings-insights that could optimize costs and emissions. 
 The global oil tanker shipping network emerges from individual ship and fleet decisions driven by economic, environmental, and operational factors. However, most existing shipping network analysis rely on static, time-aggregated representations, overlooking critical temporality connecting individual vessel routing strategies with both operational efficiency and global cargo flows. To address this gap, we introduce a dual-scale framework complementing sequential motif analysis—capturing recurrent patterns in vessel movement sequences—with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), extracting temporal dynamics from vessel trajectories to global cargo flows. Using tanker movement data across four vessel classes, we demonstrate that vessels exhibiting diverse regional exploration patterns spend up to 50% more time transporting rather than seeking cargo, indicating greater economic and environmental efficiency. At the system scale, DMD analysis reveals distinct seasonality with an average peak-to-trough amplitude of 16%. Major import regions show synchronous annual demand cycles, while export regions exhibit anti-synchronicity. These temporal patterns, invisible to static analysis, reveal performance differences that enable route optimization for both economic and environmental benefits.

 Multi-scale Digital Twins (DTs) of the built environment provide valuable spatial and semantic insights into city assets, supporting urban management, sustainability, and mobility. However, aligning semantic building models with large-scale digital city models remains a significant challenge due to discrepancies in geospatial alignment, spatial resolution, and heterogeneity of data sources. This paper proposes a novel pipeline for the automatic alignment of semantic indoor building models with digital city models. The pipeline comprises two main steps: first, multi-level semantic segmentation of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, and second, point cloud registration using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, which estimates the transformation parameters required to align the corresponding models. The results of testing the proposed pipeline on real-world data from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in aligning semantic digital models across multiple scales."

 Climate change and anthropogenic activities are intensifying drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) events in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), threatening water security and ecological resilience. Using the Multi-scale Standardized DFAA Index (MSDFAI), we identify DFAA events from 1962 to 2022 and integrate Mann-Kendall trend tests, continuous wavelet transform, XGBoost-SHAP interpretable machine learning, Generalized Additive Models, and teleconnection analysis to unravel spatiotemporal dynamics and nonlinear drivers. Results show that drought-to-flood (DTF) events have shifted from weakening to strengthening, while flood-to-drought (FTD) events rose then declined; both exhibit persistent hotspots in northern and central-eastern PLB. FTD dominates 6–32-year cycles, whereas DTF is confined to 6–24 years. Soil moisture and precipitation are primary climatic drivers, with topography modulating hydrological responses. Impervious surface area and cropland proportion exhibit multi-threshold effects, with DFAA risk surging beyond critical urbanization levels. MSDFAI correlates negatively with ENSO indices (SOI, NINO3.4) and positively with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), confirming their role as dominant teleconnection controls. This study establishes an integrated analytical framework that combines DFAA detection, extreme sequence analysis, and interpretable machine learning to uncover nonlinear response patterns and threshold-dependent mechanisms underlying drought–flood abrupt alternation dynamics in the PLB. This approach advances mechanistic understanding of compound hydroclimatic extremes in monsoon regions and provides a robust basis for adaptive management."

We present an IL-induced self-assembly strategy enabling the rapid formation of ultrathin polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) ionogel films. Upon contact with ILs, PVA chains spontaneously organize into a robust, noncovalently cross-linked network, achieving ultrafast conversion (<5 s) of viscous precursors into films with tunable thickness (13 to 103 μm). The resulting ionogel films combine high tensile strength (9.69 MPa), toughness (35.93 MJ m−3), good ionic conductivity (0.2 S m−1), and excellent environmental stability. This approach allows in situ formation of conformal ionogel coatings on complex, nonplanar surfaces, yielding seamless skin-device interfaces that retain stable functionality under repetitive deformation. Ionogel-based bioelectrodes capture diverse electrophysiological signals with high fidelity while serving as stretchable substrates for printed circuits and electrode arrays. Compatibility with diverse ILs highlights the versatility of this rapid, scalable approach for fabricating ultrathin ionogels with broadly tunable properties."

In two-dimensional (2D) materials, applied stress often induces out-of-plane deformation, resulting in a more intricate three-dimensional (3D) topography, where mapping the strain remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional characterization techniques. In this work, we introduce BRIGHT (Bragg-Rod Informed, Gradient-based Height-mapping Technique), an integrated method for reconstructing both the topography and planar strain profile of 3D-structured 2D materials using nanobeam four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). We apply BRIGHT to a MoS2-MoSe2transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) lateral heterojunctions exhibiting built-in strain and out-of-plane ripples and show that varying heterojunction widths lead to distinct surface morphologies and corresponding changes in the planar strain distribution. These results establish a foundation for more effective strain engineering in 2D materials by accounting for out-of-plane structural features, thereby enabling more precise control of strain-dependent properties."

Here, we show that human reach vigor dynamically tracks canonical dopaminergic learning signals not only at movement onset but also during ongoing motion. Using a reaching task with probabilistic rewards (0, 33, 66, and 100%), we observed that peak velocity scaled with expected value. Crucially, following feedback, reach velocity was transiently invigorated or enervated in proportion to the sign and magnitude of the reward prediction error. Trial-by-trial changes in kinematics reflected value updating, consistent with dopaminergic phasic learning signals. These results demonstrate that movement vigor is modulated by reward-learning signals on rapid timescales, revealing a real-time behavioral readout of motivational computation in the brain."

Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs before strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model’s assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model, the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the nonequilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2 to 3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario.

Here, we established a systematic CRISPR-based protein-tagging approach that enables direct, unambiguous comparison of nuclear localization and genome-wide binding profiles of endogenous ZAD-ZnFs in developingDrosophilaembryos. Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development. Integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and Micro-C analyses reveal that many ZAD-ZnFs colocalize with core insulator proteins such as CCCTC-binding factor and Centrosomal protein 190 kD to control the formation of topological boundaries. We suggest that the diverse molecular functions of ZAD-ZnFs have evolutionarily arisen from their ancestral role as insulator-binding proteins."

Threat is also theorized as a universal experience—affecting potentially anyone, across any of their identities.

However, therapeutically targetable mediators of innate immune bacterial killing remain elusive. We hypothesized that immune-adaptive pathogen evolution could provide an informative perspective on this problem. We examined the interaction of a genetically diverging hypervirulentStreptococcus pneumoniae(pneumococcus) serotype with macrophages, identifying closely phylogenetically related isolates with differential susceptibility to intracellular killing. We reasoned that macrophage genes relatively suppressed during pathogen escape from killing were likely to encode mediators normally promoting bacterial killing. This led to the validation of ACOD1 and its product itaconate, NAMPT, and P2RX7 as host defense factors against pneumococci and related gram-positive pathogens. Last, we repurposed the antihistamine clemastine to augment phagolysosomal bacterial killing, via P2RX7, as a candidate host-directed therapy against pneumococci and vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium. Overall, we show that pathogen-centric host screening can aid identification of microbicidal responses as targets for host-directed therapies."

This challenge is particularly pronounced for untethered miniature robots, as they often lack the capacities to generate sufficient force outputs or to implement strategies that reduce resistance from the surrounding medium. Here, we propose an impact-driven magnetic untethered miniature robot (RoboIMP) capable of delivering repeatable high-force outputs of up to 3 N, surpassing the theoretical force limits of conventional magnetic robots at the same characteristic length. RoboIMP uses reciprocal oscillation to fluidize the surrounding medium, thereby reducing the resistance from the medium by up to 13-fold.

By scaling up, a 3-by-3 OLCO is constructed for an OLCNN to achieve four-class classification on the MNIST dataset with an average test accuracy of 95.1%. By synergizing optical logic devices with neural networks, this work pioneers a logic-driven paradigm for high-speed, energy-efficient optical hardware in artificial intelligence."

We used a multilayered approach combining clinical data from Malawian pregnant women (n= 711) in the REVAMP trial, a genetic mouse model [Tmprss6-knockout (KO)], and in vitroPlasmodium falciparumcultures to clarify iron-malaria associations. Iron deficiency was associated with 50% reducedP. falciparumparasitemia in pregnant women [95% CI (30 to 64%),P< 0.0001], while iron-deficient mice exhibited improved survival againstP. berghei(median 15.5 days versus 7.0 days for WT mice) and protection from cerebral malaria (83% versus 17% survival). Iron chelation substantially changed the transcriptomic and proteomic profile of culturedP. falciparumparasites. Intravenous iron supplementation did not increase parasitemia when coupled with malaria prevention. These findings demonstrate that iron deficiency protects againstPlasmodiuminfection and support World Health Organization recommendations for iron supplementation in malaria-endemic regions when combined with adequate malaria prevention strategies in place."

The cytoprotective role of RTAs has been increasingly recognized as essential in regulating ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. However, current ferroptosis inhibitors primarily rely on phenolic or aromatic amine scaffolds, which were found through high-throughput screening or derived from historically known RTAs. We introduce hydrazine-derived tetrahydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazin-3-ones (THTZOs) as a class of nonclassical RTAs. THTZOs operate via a unique mechanism involving hydrazyl and verdazyl radical intermediates that is independent of aromatic stabilization. These compounds demonstrate broad reactivity against autoxidation in both simple hydrocarbons and membrane phospholipids, effectively suppressing ferroptosis induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) or erastin in multiple cell lines. Our findings revitalize the application of hydrazine derivatives in RTA chemistry and establish a foundation for the rational design of RTAs as potent ferroptosis inhibitors, offering previously unidentified antioxidant therapeutic candidates."

While cytosolic DNA accumulation represents a superior endogenous strategy for STING activation, DNA repair machinery substantially constrains its immunogenic potential. Here, we propose a promising therapeutic strategy that leverages proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC)–mediated degradation of PARP1 [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1] and BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) to induce synthetic lethality, thereby disrupting DNA repair machinery that drives nuclear-to-cytosolic DNA leakage, surpassing the STING activation threshold to ignite cGAS-STING–mediated innate immunity. Our strategy demonstrates superior antitumor efficacy across multiple tumor models, eliciting robust CD8+T cell– and NK cell–mediated immunity while suppressing pulmonary metastasis progression. This strategic integration of synthetic lethality with an immunogenic stress response establishes a previously unidentified paradigm for expanding broad applications by cGAS-STING–mediated innate immunity."

Previous attempts to observe this unique collective mode yielded inconclusive results. We microfabricated acoustic cavities with a micrometer-scale path length that is suitable for direct detection of this sound mode and used the interference fringes from our acoustic Fabry-Pérot cavities to determine both real and imaginary parts of the acoustic impedance. No interference was observed. Either transverse sound does not exist or its attenuation must be very high, well above 2000 per centimeter. We discuss a theoretical framework for such high attenuation."

We performed regulatory network analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from six patient tumors, revealing disrupted myogenesis and actionable master regulator (MR) dependencies across three coexisting tumor cell states, also conserved in patient-derived xenografts: (i) a MYOD1-enriched progenitor-like state, (ii) a proliferative transition state, and (iii) a partially differentiated state with reduced MYOD1 activity. Ligand-receptor analysis uncovered paracrine insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling from progenitor to transition/differentiated states, whose inhibition demonstrated therapeutic potential in ex vivo drug screens, and significantly improved disease control in a patient-derived xenograft model. Oncogenic MRs were recapitulated in 24 bulk RNA profiles, while 20 DNA profiles revealed recurrent IGF2/PI3K/AKT alterations, reinforcing shared transcriptional vulnerabilities. These findings characterize aberrant, mutant MYOD1–driven myogenesis sustained by IGF2 and nominate IGF1R-PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors for therapeutic translation inMYOD1L122R-mutant SRMS, underscoring the utility of single-cell regulatory network analysis for uncovering actionable dependencies in rare, transcriptionally complex cancers."

In this study, we investigated the immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying sleep deprivation (SD)–induced ovarian damage and the effects on follicular development. We found that SD disrupted follicular development and compromised early embryonic developmental potential in female mice. Notably, the use of the anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen can effectively alleviate the adverse effect. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of ovarian tissues revealed a notable up-regulation of neutrophil-associated genes, includingS100a8,S100a9, the macrophage M1 polarization gene set, and pyroptosis-related genes in granulosa, immune, and mesothelial cells. Further experiments conducted both in vivo and in vitro verified that S100A8/A9 activates the TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB pathway, which induces the polarization of M1 macrophages and leads to pyroptosis of granulosa cells. Collectively, this study provides molecular insight into strategies for fertility preservation in individuals experiencing sleep deprivation, including those with occupational circadian rhythm disruptions."

Notably, children raised on traditional farms show reduced allergies and asthma prevalence. Here, we investigated how a beneficial environment, using farm dust (FD) extract, influenced lung immune function in ovalbumin-induced allergic inflammation. FD exposure reduced allergic lung inflammation and increased monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) recruitment. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that FD-exposed MDMs had altered gene expression, including dampenedCcl8and major histocompatibility complex class II expression, impairing eosinophil recruitment and antigen presentation. RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing confirmed FD-induced epigenetic reprogramming ex vivo, on bone marrow–derived macrophages. This modulation, seen in both human and murine cells, relied on histone deacetylase activity sustained by peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ signaling. These findings suggest that beneficial environmental exposures can reprogram immune cells and may offer a previously unidentified strategy for asthma prevention."

Reeves,Global maps of transcription factor properties reveal threshold-based formation of DNA-bound and mobile clusters,"The relationship between bulk transcription factor concentration and DNA binding has been a central question in gene regulation for decades. Recent studies propose that DNA-bound transcription factor hubs, or clusters, aid in fast and precise transcriptional interpretation. Using live imaging techniques, we quantify the concentration, binding, and mobility of the morphogen Dorsal (Dl), both in bulk and in clusters, inDrosophilablastoderm embryo. Our experiments encompass multiple length and timescales, allowing us to obtain a nucleus-wide view of the mechanism connecting hub formation to bulk Dl concentration. Our results show that previously unobserved, slowly moving clusters of Dl are present, in addition to the expected populations of freely mobile and DNA-bound Dl. Furthermore, both mobile clusters and DNA-bound Dl appear only once a threshold concentration in the nucleus is surpassed, a behavior consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation. Thus, our work elucidates how bulk transcription factor concentration dictates the formation and spatiotemporal changes of different populations needed for gene regulation."

Sperm motility is the key to conception. However, the immunological mechanism for environmental stress–induced sperm motility reduction remains unknown. Our experiments find that three classical environmental stressors, including lead, cadmium, and mercury, are the key heavy metals reducing sperm motility. We reveal that environmental stress induces epididymal macrophage senescence, whereas the clearance of above cells significantly alleviates environmental stress–reduced sperm motility. In vivo and in vitro experiments further demonstrate that environmental stress induces macrophage senescence via down-regulatingFoxo3expression. Mechanistically, environmental stress increases the epididymalFoxo3 N6-methyladenosine level and inhibits the FTO. Overexpression ofFtoin vitro andS-adenosylhomocysteine supplementation in vivo alleviates environmental stress–induced macrophage senescence. Together, these results suggest that epididymal macrophage senescence contributes to sperm motility decrease upon environmental stress. Clearing senescent epididymal macrophages will provide a previously unknown strategy for preventing male infertility."

Now, research on fieldwork safety and resulting recommendations are largely siloed by scientific discipline, limiting the spread of data and discussion that could yield rapid change for field research. This review synthesizes literature on fieldwork safety across scientific disciplines, highlighting four facets of safety for leaders and researchers to address: physical, social, financial, and psychological. Literature and real-life events demonstrate that the four facets of safety are interconnected and should be considered together. The review concludes with a synthesis of recommendations for each facet of safety. This review provides principal investigators with accessible, data-driven resources and propose a framework for future research on field safety that will enable cross-disciplinary sharing."
