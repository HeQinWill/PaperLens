Results show that the polar stratospheric temperature increased from 1992 to 2000, contrary to the expectation of stratospheric cooling due to rising CO2. The study concluded that changes in ozone and CO2 drive the meridional eddy heat transport, dictating polar stratospheric temperature behavior. 
 To predict the future state of the Earth system on multiyear timescales, it is crucial to understand the response to changing external radiative forcing  (CO2 and Ozone). Analyzing the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter stratospheric polar vortex temperature, we found a general temperature decrease in the reanalysis data (1982–2020), the expected trend with increasing CO2, except for a sharp warming during the period 1992–2000. Results from 1° GEOS-MITgcm coupled general circulation model simulations of past decades show a similar increase in the NH polar stratospheric temperature during 1992–2000 and a decrease during 2000–2020. To isolate the influence of external forcing, we conducted a series of 30-year-long “perpetual” time-slice experiments in which the external forcing for a particular year is held fixed at its values for 1992, 2000, and 2020. Each simulated year of these perpetual experiments is forced with the CO2, Ozone, anthropogenic aerosol emissions, and trace gases of that year, but none of the simulations include any explosive volcanic forcing. The increasing and then decreasing temperature trend is also manifest in the CMIP6 historical simulations performed with models that include a well-resolved stratosphere. The configuration of the perpetual experiments rules out a direct response to volcanic emissions or a change in the phase of decadal modes of variability as explanations for the warming rather than the expected cooling behavior. Analysis of the temperature budget showed (only significant terms are discussed) that the polar stratospheric temperature behavior is dictated by meridional eddy transport of heat resulting from changes in CO2 and Ozone over the past decades."

Guenther;Nan Wang,Deciphering isoprene variability across dozen of Chinese and overseas cities using deep transfer learning,"We studied the invisible gas isoprene, which trees and vehicles release into the air and which can worsen urban smog. Using advanced computer learning trained on measurements from many cities, we uncovered how temperature, sunlight, and city greening shape isoprene levels. Comparing Hong Kong and London, we found climate warming boosts isoprene and future ozone pollution, but strong cuts in anthropogenic emission could limit this impact. 
 Isoprene, the globally most abundant volatile organic compound, significantly impacts air quality. Determining isoprene concentration variations and their drivers is a persistent challenge. Here, we developed a robust machine learning framework to simulate isoprene concentrations, without requiring localized emission inventories and explicit chemistry. Temperature, radiation, and surface pressure were the primary drivers of short-term isoprene variations across Chinese cities. On climatic timescales, urban greenspace expansion and climate warming drove isoprene increases by 341 pptv in Hong Kong during 1990–2023, but traffic emission reductions in London counteracted the isoprene rise that climate warming would have otherwise caused (−755 pptv vs. +31 pptv). Driven by rising temperatures and isoprene levels, ozone would increase by up to 1.7-fold by 2100 under the high-emission scenario. However, ambitious reduction in nitrogen oxides would alleviate this growth to 1.2-fold. The study has the potential to inform air quality management in a warming climate."

Laughner;Susan S. Kulawik;Vivienne H. Payne,An algorithm to retrieve peroxyacetyl nitrate from AIRS,"We developed an algorithm to infer peroxyacyl nitrates from an instrument that has been in space for over 20 years. These nitrates can transport pollution significant distances downwind, thus having a long term record of their concentrations can help understand how transport of pollution changed over time. We were able to develop a product for this instrument that produces results compatible with a more recent instrument, allowing them to work together in future analyses. 
 Herein, we describe an approach to retrieve free tropospheric columns of peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) from radiances observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). AIRS has provided daily global coverage since its launch in 2002, making the AIRS data a valuable long term record. Although the instrument is very radiometrically stable, the radiance noise level is large enough to present a challenge when retrieving a weak absorber such as PAN. To address this, spectral windows were selected to minimize interference from other species as much as possible and a set of filters was developed to predict whether a PAN value retrieved from AIRS is within 0.2 ppb or 50 % of what would be retrieved from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and to remove spurious signals caused by specific surface features or clouds. We show that AIRS is capable of retrieving PAN plumes with very high concentrations of PAN (such as those from significant wildfires) that have similar spatial extent as seen by CrIS and that PAN retrieved from AIRS has good correlation with CrIS given sufficient averaging. We conclude with recommendations for users to help ensure that these data are used appropriately."

We developed a new satellite-based method to generate hourly water vapor data at 0.02-degree resolution from 2016 to 2022, now available at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301518, which improves accuracy and reveals fine-scale moisture transport critical for understanding rainfall and extreme weather. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the “Asian Water Tower”, plays a critical role in the regulation of the water cycle in the region. Obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution, and all-weather total precipitable water (TPW) data is essential for understanding water vapor transport mechanisms, improving precipitation forecasting, and managing regional water resources over the TP. However, existing single-sensor remote sensing techniques cannot provide high spatiotemporal resolution TPW data under cloudy conditions. Multi-source fusion approaches often produce anomalous distributions in the fused TPW data due to inter-sensor biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the TP. This study proposed a multi-source remote sensing TPW fusion framework that integrates TPW products from eight microwave satellites and the Himawari-8/9 (H8/9) geostationary satellite to produce an all-weather TPW data with the highest spatiotemporal resolution at present. Methodologically, two correction strategies were developed. First, a bias correction approach was proposed using H8/9 TPW data as a reference to calibrate multi-source microwave remote sensing TPW and reduce inter-sensor discrepancies. Second, an adaptive correction method was created to improve the accuracy and spatial continuity of the fused TPW data under cloudy conditions. Based on the newly developed fusion framework, an all-weather TPW dataset with hourly temporal and 0.02° spatial resolution covering the TP from 2016 to 2022 was produced for the first time. The new dataset has been published by the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center and is available at: https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301518 (Ji et al., 2025b). Taking the 2017 product as an example, it was verified against GNSS TPW. The RMSE of the fused TPW product at the hourly scale was 3.79 mm, which was 10.82 % and 6.19 % lower than MIMIC-TPW2 and ERA5, respectively. Compared to ERA5 with a spatial resolution of 0.25°, the fused product achieves a 12.5-fold improvement in spatial resolution, which make it possible to significantly grasp the transportation of water vapor in the valley of Yarlung Zsangbo River. It also demonstrates higher reliability in station-sparse regions, providing high-quality, high-resolution vapor data to support vapor flux estimation and forecasting of extreme weather events over the TP."

Using satellite imagery, we mapped their distribution, finding most of them in southern Peru, above 4800 m a.s.l. and conditioned mainly by low temperature and precipitation. This dataset helps scientists to follow the evolution of permafrost and local planners to manage water resources and risks in the mountains. 
 Rock glaciers are key periglacial landforms in high mountain systems, serving as indicators of permafrost, contributors to mountain hydrology, and sentinels of climate change. Despite their scientific and practical importance, detailed knowledge of their distribution, characteristics, and dynamics in the Peruvian Andes remains limited. This study presents the Peruvian Rock Glacier Inventory (PRoGI v1.0), – a comprehensive inventory of rock glaciers covering the entire Peruvian Andes, encompassing their spatial distribution, morphological attributes, and topoclimatic controls. Unlike previous local-scale studies, PRoGI v1.0 provides national-scale coverage using standardized methods aligned with International Permafrost Association (IPA) guidelines and updated data. Using sub-meter satellite imagery (Bing Maps 2024 and Google Earth 2017) and IPA classification standards, we mapped 2338 rock glaciers with a total area of 94.09 ± 0.05 km2. Approximately 31 % of these landforms were classified as active, 49 % as transitional, and 20 % as relict. They predominantly occur between ∼ 4416 and 5783 m a.s.l. (mean elevation ∼ 4999 m) on slopes averaging ∼ 20.7° (range 7–37°). Spatially, rock glaciers are concentrated in the southern Peruvian Andes, with sparse distribution in central and northern Peru. Most have a southern to southwestern aspect (predominantly S, SW, and SE-facing), and the lower limit of permafrost (indicated by the lowest active rock glacier fronts) is ∼ 3541 m a.s.l. Our inventory serves as a benchmark dataset that significantly advances the understanding and monitoring of mountain permafrost, and it provides a basis for assessing the hydrological importance of rock glaciers in the Peruvian Andes under climate change scenarios.

We developed a new global dataset that describes daily nitrogen dioxide levels from 2005 to 2023 by combining satellite observations, weather data, and ground measurements using artificial intelligence. The dataset reveals long-term changes and regional patterns and provides a reliable resource for future air quality research. 
 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a critical air pollutant with significant environmental and human health impacts, yet global and long-term NO2 datasets with daily continuity and fine spatial resolution remain limited. In this study, we construct a continuous global daily NO2 concentration spanning from 2005 to 2023 at a 0.1-degree resolution using the advanced Air Transformer deep learning framework that integrates satellite observations, ground-based measurements, meteorological reanalysis, land-use information, and auxiliary geophysical variables. The resulting dataset shows robust performance across diverse regions and pollution regimes, with improved spatial consistency and reduced biases relative to existing global products. Based on this dataset, we characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of global NO2 concentrations over the past two decades. Global annual mean NO2 increased from 2005 to 2015, followed by a moderate decline during 2016–2019, a pronounced decrease in 2020 associated with COVID-19–related reductions in economic activity and transportation, and a partial rebound thereafter, reaching 3.38 ppbv in 2023. The Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions largely followed the global trend, whereas the Southern Hemisphere exhibited distinct behaviour, with relatively stable or declining NO2 levels prior to 2015, a sharp decrease in 2020, and a stronger post-pandemic rebound during 2021–2023. As one of the global, multi-decadal NO2 datasets with daily resolution, this dataset provides a valuable resource for air quality assessment, exposure analysis, and atmospheric model evaluation."

 Accurate estimates of long-term surface temperature (ST) changes are fundamental not only for assessing observed warming, but also for improving the reliability of future climate projections. However, substantial missing information in global ST datasets, remains a major source of uncertainty in estimating global or regional temperature changes.  Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have promoted the effective application of deep learning approaches, such as image inpainting and transfer learning, in reconstructing incomplete geophysical datasets. In this study, partial convolutional neural network (PConv) models were trained using the 20CR reanalysis data and CMIP6 climate model outputs as training samples, with the aim of achieving a proper reconstruction of the global surface temperature dataset. To address differences among existing sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, we reconstruct global monthly ST fields since 1850 by merging the China global Land Surface Air Temperature (C-LSAT2.1) dataset with Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSSTv6) dataset and Met Office Hadley Centre's sea surface temperature (HadSST4) dataset, respectively. Although both reconstructions reliably reproduce large-scale spatial patterns and long-term variations, the merge of C-LSAT2.1 with HadSST4 exhibits greater physical consistency and is therefore adopted as our preferred reconstruction. In particular, validation against station observations indicates that the reconstructions perform well over the Antarctica after 1961, where observational coverage is extremely sparse. Based on this framework, we developed the China global Artificial Intelligence Reconstructed Surface Temperature20CR/CMIP6 (C-AIRSTR/M) datasets, providing spatially complete global monthly ST anomaly reconstructions since 1850 with a spatial resolution of 5° × 2.5°. These datasets offer improved support for extending long-term climate records and for applications in polar climate assessment, as well as in climate monitoring, detection, and attribution studies.

However, long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution data have been lacking. Hence, multi-source remote sensing was integrated with high-resolution crop distribution and phenology within a detailed water footprint framework. ChinaCropWF provides daily, 1-km resolution blue and green water footprints for China's five major food crops from 2001 to 2020. 
 Increasingly unsustainable water use in food systems and rising regional water scarcity jointly pose a critical challenge to food security. Advancing sustainable agricultural water management requires accurate quantification of crop water use, including the contributions of blue and green water and their spatiotemporal dynamics throughout growing seasons, the absence of which impedes reliable estimation of agricultural water requirements and the improvement of water management practices. Here, we integrated multi-source remote sensing datasets with high-resolution crop distribution and phenology data within a detailed water footprint accounting framework. This approach generated in ChinaCropWF (Hua and Wang, 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18057808), a 1-km, nationwide, daily-resolution dataset spanning 2001–2020, which quantifies blue and green water footprints for China's five major crops. Our dataset shows the total crop water footprints ranked as rice (139.65–193.65 Gm³) > maize (130.22–140.98 Gm³) > wheat (61.15–64.59 Gm³) > soybean (32.05–35.39 Gm³) > potato (0.15–11.31 Gm³). The blue and green water composition was primarily determined by crop-specific traits and regional precipitation regimes. In contrast to the global increase in blue water footprints, China's blue water footprints for major food crops have declined, despite pronounced spatial heterogeneity. By contrast, green water footprints have increased widely across all major cropping regions. By capturing spatial heterogeneity in water volume and use efficiency, ChinaCropWF provides data support for adaptive irrigation, regional water management, and food-water nexus assessments."

It uses a sectional approach for size and composition, includes a wall-loss module, and links gas-phase mechanisms of different complexity to secondary organic aerosol formation. Representation of particle phase composition allows viscosity and non-ideality to be taken into account. 
 SSH-aerosol is developed to represent the evolution of primary and secondary pollutants in the atmosphere by processes linked to gas-phase chemistry, aerosol dynamics (coagulation, condensation/evaporation and nucleation) and intra-particle reactions. The representation of process complexity can be adjusted based on the user's choices.The model uses a sectional size distribution, and offers the capability to discretize chemical composition to account for the mixing state of particles. The algorithms are designed to represent the evolution of ultrafine particles: conservation of mass and number during numerical resolution, taking into account the Kelvin effect, the condensation dynamics of nonvolatile compounds, and nucleation. Different parameterizations are provided for nucleation: binary, ternary, heteromolecular and organic nucleation depending on the compounds involved.For gas-phase chemistry, schemes of different complexities can be handled: from simple schemes to model ozone, oxidants and inorganic chemistry (e.g. CB05, RACM2, Melchior2), to more complex schemes, e.g. from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM). The complexity of the schemes used for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation may also be adjusted: from schemes built from chamber data to near-explicit schemes from MCM. SOA schemes reduced using the GENOA algorithm are also provided for several precursors (toluene, a sesquiterpene and three monoterpenes), together with their evaluation against chamber or flow-tube experiments. A wall-loss module has also been added for easier comparisons to chamber experiments.Specific developments were made in version 2.0 to automatically link the chosen gas-phase mechanism to SOA formation by using the SMILES structure of organic compounds, allowing for the determination of their hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and for the partitioning in both organic and aqueous phases. The gas/particle partitioning may also be represented with different complexities. For the organic phase, viscosity may be modelled, adapting the aerosol viscosity to its composition, and coupling organic and inorganic thermodynamics. The dynamic evolution of the partitioning may be computed explicitly or thermodynamic equilibrium may be assumed. Different options are also provided to simulate the chemistry of organic compounds inside the particles with different types of reactions: irreversible 1st order reactions, bulk oligomerization, hydratation of aldehydes and reactions of organic compounds with inorganic ions.The SSH-aerosol model may be installed with a docker for standalone use. It has also been coupled to several 3D models to represent gas and aerosol concentrations: from the local scale with computational fluid dynamic and street network models to the regional scale with chemistry-transport models."

We investigate deep-ocean sequestration of excess produced gas, named Seawater Injection of Natural Gas (SWING), to mitigate routine flaring at deepwater platforms. We evaluate 435 SWING scenarios using well-validated models of pipe transport, multiphase plume dynamics, gas/liquid transitions, and aqueous dissolution of natural gas bubbles and liquid condensate droplets. We identify SWING scenarios that entrap the produced gas in the deep ocean, where it would rapidly biodegrade and subsequently ventilate to the atmosphere as CO2 over decades to centuries. For example, a simulated injection of 10 MMSCFD (million standard ft3 d–1) of heavy produced gas at 1000 m depth yields dissolution of 95% of the injected hydrocarbon mass at ≥500 m depth, including 100% of the methane, assuming a median bubble diameter of 2 mm after jet breakup. Compared to flaring, this SWING scenario reduces CO2-equivalent emissions  to the atmosphere by 260 kilotons year–1, representing a ≥10-fold decrease, analogous to  removing CO2 emissions from 57,000 US passenger vehicles. This scenario  reduces contributions of dissolved inorganic carbon to the surface ocean by ≥6-fold, mitigating this input to surface ocean acidification."

Reacting CO2 with silicate minerals in engineered systems, often called ex situ mineralization, is one such approach. The potential net climate benefit of ex situ CO2 mineralization is unclear, however, as it depends on the technology pathway, location, energy and resource demands, and potential for avoided emissions via co-product utilization. Accurately quantifying these factors in site-specific scenarios is critical for assessing a project’s carbon footprint. Here, we present a parameterized lifecycle assessment (LCA) model to quantify the net CO2e emissions of a range of ex situ mineralization scenarios, considering both direct and avoided emissions. Using a case study with olivine feedstock in Washington State, U.S.A., we show that ex situ mineralization can range from net CO2 positive for the least optimal scenarios to highly CO2 negative for the most optimal scenarios. Considering avoided emissions, some scenarios can be >100% efficient (>1 t of net CO2 stored + avoided per t of gross CO2 stored). Capture efficiency depends heavily on low-carbon electricity, short transport distances, technologies that facilitate the passive capture of ambient CO2, and maximizing avoided emissions. Substantial avoided emissions can be achieved via efficient co-product use in the local cement industry, although the size of the industry may be a constraint to scaling. Modest avoided emissions are also possible via integrated metal recovery. To facilitate comparability with future analyses and to help guide project development, our model is technology and mineral agnostic and available for download as a supplement."

However, organizing and interpreting these data for predictive modeling remain challenging due to inconsistent repository formats, varied program objectives, heterogeneous assay targets, and differences in experimental protocols, including concentration ranges. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical mechanistic modeling framework that systematically structures and interprets concentration response HTS data. The model integrated curated data sets by mapping metadata from 455 PubChem assays to 216 protein targets and 103 biological pathways in WikiPathways. Assay-level concentration–response data were organized within a biologically layered hierarchy to construct AOP-based models. The resulting models generated pathway-level toxicity scores that quantified compound potency by integrating inferred protein activity and downstream pathway perturbations. In total, 103 pathways were statistically associated with five in vivo toxicity endpoints: acute systemic, maternal, developmental, human hepatotoxicity, and preclinical hepatotoxicity. This hierarchical framework leverages HTS metadata to predict diverse in vivo toxicity outcomes and enhance mechanistic interpretability of pathway-level effects. It links chemical bioactivity to adverse outcomes, providing a quantitative basis for compound ranking, potency assessment, and hazard prediction. Overall, this framework offers a structured, scalable method for integrating large bioactivity data sets into computational toxicology, supporting chemical risk assessment and early-stage drug discovery."

Field;Paul Westerhoff;Xiao Su,Challenges and Opportunities in PFAS Waste Management for Semiconductor Manufacturing,"Semiconductor manufacturing is rapidly expanding alongside tightening environmental regulations and increasing public concern around per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Because of their unique chemical properties, PFAS are used across numerous processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Given process complexity and lengthy development timelines for alternatives, eliminating PFAS use in this industry is not currently feasible. Developing practical technologies for PFAS waste management is therefore critical but uniquely challenging in semiconductor manufacturing due to the nature of waste streams (parts-per-billion PFAS concentrations, complex backgrounds including hundreds of chemicals, prevalence of ultrashort PFAS, total stream volumes up to 35,000 m3 per day per facility, and distribution across gas, liquid, and solid phases) and significant constraints on space and systems redesign. This review describes recent developments and key questions that must be addressed to develop impactful and commercially viable detection and abatement methods for PFAS waste management in semiconductor manufacturing. Integrating these technologies into compact, high-performance systems and testing them under realistic conditions (complex PFAS mixtures, high fluoride/ionic strength, pH 6–11, low contact time, process variability) through industrial collaborations is essential for scalable, cost-effective solutions. Research addressing semiconductor industry-specific PFAS waste is essential to enable environmental compliance while supporting the continued growth of semiconductor manufacturing."

While the pure culture of the Dehalogenimonas has not been isolated and the reductive dehalogenase genes (rdhAs) responsible for the 4-OH-TPN dechlorination remain unclear. The assembled genome of Dehalogenimonas contained a 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) reductive dehalogenase gene (dcpA) ortholog. In this study, by alternating the substrate from 4-OH-TPN to 1,2-DCA, a pure culture of Dehalogenimonas, designated as 4OHTPN1, was finally isolated. Strain 4OHTPN1 potentially represents a novel species in the genus Dehalogenimonas and contains 33 rdhA genes and 4 rdhB genes. The novel rdhA26 gene (designated htpnA) was identified as the key gene involved in 4-OH-TPN dechlorination. Its transcriptional and protein expression levels were 25.0-fold and 10.2-fold higher than the average of all rdhA genes when the culture was solely amended with 4-OH-TPN. In contrast, the dcpA ortholog, rdhA25, exhibited 10.1-fold and 9.8-fold higher transcriptional and protein expression levels when only amended with 1,2-DCA, highlighting a substrate-specific regulatory response to a distinct electron acceptor. This study expands our knowledge of the rdhA gene for 4-OH-TPN dechlorination in the pure culture of Dehalogenimonas."

We propose a generalized toxicity prediction framework (GTGT) that predicts species-resolved acute toxicity (log10LC50; LC50 in mg/L) from chemical descriptors, exposure duration, and species features─taxonomy embeddings and mitochondrial Cytochrome b (cytb) sequence embeddings─within a unified deep-learning architecture. Using a dataset of 2860 compounds and 297 fish species, GTGT outperformed representative state-of-the-art models, achieving external-test R2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 0.49. Ablation analyses show that chemical and exposure descriptors provide baseline performance, whereas biological features are critical to capture interspecies susceptibility. Comparative analyses further indicate that taxonomy embeddings encode hierarchical evolutionary relationships, while cytb sequences capture molecular divergence, providing complementary information for robust cross-species prediction. We also provide a web platform for single- and multicompound predictions across multiple fish species, enabling model-based species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curves. This framework links chemical, biological, and exposure dimensions to support SSD parametrization and derivation of protective thresholds for comparison with environmentally relevant exposures, rather than serving as a direct risk metric."

Loss of these gases to the atmosphere has a large climate impact. Here, we quantify halocarbon emissions from the New York City region during the East Coast Outflow airborne campaigns in 2018 and 2020. We quantify urban-scale emissions using discrete airborne flask samples collected during downwind plume sampling. We find that inventories of the urban region underestimate halocarbon emissions. For A/C species, higher emissions in 2018 correspond with higher temperatures, suggesting emissions may vary with appliance usage. The climate impact (100-year time horizon) of our observed halocarbon emissions is comparable to coincident methane emissions, equal to ∼10% of urban CO2 emissions. Without leakage mitigation and effective phase-down efforts, high halocarbon emissions could undercut the benefits of switching to heat pumps and present a positive warming feedback with increasing air conditioning demand."

Mineralogical, biological, and geochemical characteristics of aerosols collected over two years from the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet indicate that aerosols delivered via dry deposition and in snow primarily consisted of silicate minerals, with mean particle diameters of 1.01 ± 1.58 μm (2016) and 0.76 ± 0.87 μm (2017) for dry deposition and 2.4 ± 3.2 μm for dust delivered in snow (2017). The rare earth element signature of the delivered dust was typical of nearby Greenlandic lithologies, and combining this with other geochemical results and airmass history modeling indicated that the airborne mineral dust collected on-ice was likely from local emission sources, namely nearby proglacial plains. Dust and snow deposition rates were used to estimate phosphorus delivery to the ice surface at a rate of 1.2 mg·m–2·year–1, which could fuel estimated pigmented glacier ice algal cell abundances of 8.6 × 103 cells·mL–1, a value consistent with glacier ice algal bloom cell densities documented in the region. The eukaryotic communities in air and snow samples were dominated by algae and fungi, respectively, with both sample types also hosting various bacteria. These results suggest that the airborne transfer of glacier ice and snow algae may be a method by which fresh cryosphere surfaces become inoculated with these pigmented organisms. Collectively, these findings highlight the biogeochemical links between aerosols and the ice sheet surface, which have impacts on glacier ice algal growth and the corresponding surface ice albedo and melting."

In this work, we used the Donnan membrane technique to determine the Cd equilibrium isotope fractionation that is induced by the chelation of Cd with low-molecular weight organic ligands. While a model ligand with oxygen and nitrogen functional groups (EDTA, R-OH, R-NH) induced no significant isotope fractionation between complexed and free Cd2+ (Δ114/110CdCdEDTA – freeCd = −0.08 ± 0.12‰; n = 4), the model ligand with sulfur donor groups (DMPS, R-SH) induced a strong isotope fractionation (Δ114/110CdCdDMPS – freeCd = −0.66 ± 0.20‰; n = 4).

The generation of NCD is comprehensively influenced by meteorological factors and environmental conditions. However, the potential impacts of global climate change on NCD emissions in the coming decades remain unclear, which hinders scientific understanding of their future trajectory. In this study, we developed an integrated method combining wind and fugitive dust emission calculations, based on multisource data sets. Through scenario-based analyses spanning a historical baseline (2001–2024) and future climate projections (2030, 2060) under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, we systematically quantify spatial and temporal NCD emission patterns across China while evaluating their dynamic interplay with anthropogenic particulate sources. Our findings reveal critical insights: NCD emissions in China exhibit a gradient spatial distribution, decreasing progressively from the north to the south. Influenced by climate differences, these emissions also display distinct seasonal patterns. Projected inventories indicate that an intensification of northern NCD emissions by 2060 is primarily a function of increasing temperatures, contrasting with anthropogenic particulate matter reductions driven by air quality policies. This divergence positions NCD as the principal particulate constituent in northern urban clusters. Taking the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region as an example, future NCD emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 may reach 42.4 to 303.98% and 140.45 to 844.27% of anthropogenic emissions, respectively. While uncertainties persist regarding climate change and dust–climate feedback, our work provides the first empirical evidence of NCD’s escalating dominance in China’s pollution regime."

Wilkinson,Characterizing Atmospheric Emissions of Particulate Matter from Copper Smelting through Coriolis-μ Air Sampling and Single Particle ICP–MS Analysis,"New methods of air sampling and analysis are needed to better understand atmospheric emissions from industrial sources. To close this knowledge gap, 80 air samples were collected around a copper smelter in Quebec using a Coriolis-μ device, allowing for rapid, spatially and temporally resolved samples. Airborne particles were collected directly into water allowing for (a) precise total elemental quantification by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) following acidification and (b) analysis of individual particle compositions by single particle ICP-Time-of-Flight-MS (spICP-ToF-MS). This new combination of sampling and analytical techniques allowed for better interpretation of the timing, magnitude and elemental signature of emissions from the smelter. Orders-of-magnitude changes in elemental concentrations including As, Pb, and Cd occurred on time scales as short as 15 min, as revealed by high resolution sampling. Furthermore, strong correlations were observed in both bulk elemental concentrations and particle number concentrations (PNCs) among chalcophile elements, including Cu, As, Cd, and Pb. Distance transect sampling further demonstrated the utility of the Coriolis, with 12 sites sampled on a single day. The downwind persistence of airborne metal(loid)s was measured as far as 6 km from the smelter. The coupling of Coriolis sampling with spICP-ToF-MS analysis provided further insights into emission sources of the submicron particles. A consistent proportion of As- and Pb-bearing particles with respect to co-occurring major elements was observed over time, even as PNCs varied by up to 66-fold; this suggested a single source responsible for the majority of the particles. The multielement particle signatures, including In and Sn present with As, Sb, and/or Bi, and a lack of Cu in many of the trace element particles suggested a smelting origin."

Health (CPH) Study Group",Temperature Variability and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: The China Pulmonary Health Study,"While the health effects of ambient temperature have been widely studied, temperature variability (TV), which is a critical aspect of climate change, has received limited attention. This study investigated the associations and potential mediating effects of long-term TV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a national scale. COPD was identified based on lung function data from the China Pulmonary Health Study (N = 50,991). Long-term TV was defined as the standard deviation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the year prior to the spirometry test. Logistic regression and multivariable linear models were used to quantify the associations of long-term TV with COPD and lung function parameters, respectively. Mediation analyses examined the roles of mental health and blood biomarkers. Each 1 °C increase in temperature variability was associated with a higher risk of COPD (OR (odds ratio): 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.14). TV was also significantly associated with reductions in both pre- and postbronchodilator lung function, particularly in small-airway function such as FEF25–75 (−58.38 mL/s, 95% CI: −69.62, −47.14). Mediation analyses indicated that a slight proportion of the TV effect on COPD (1.56–9.55%) was mediated through mental health (anxiety or depression) and blood biomarkers (neutrophil rate, red blood cell count). Long-term TV is an independent risk factor for COPD and impaired lung function. The results suggested that these effects may be mediated in parts through psychosocial and inflammatory pathways. Climate-adaptive public health strategies should incorporate temperature variability to protect respiratory health."

Chronic overexposure to Mn can cause a Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study combined in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 axis in regulating the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway in the process of Mn-induced Tau aggregation leading to neurotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that MnCl2 exposure significantly activated both the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis and the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway, accompanied by increased Tau expression. Genetic ablation of cGAS, STING, or NLRP3 attenuated Mn-induced Tau upregulation, indicating that the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis mediates Tau expression. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that the decreased Tau expression in knockout cells is associated with the MAPK/NF–κB signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or NF–κB markedly downregulated cGAS–STING signaling, inflammatory cytokine release, and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) levels. Moreover, we observed colocalization and interaction among p-p38, p-p65, and p-Tau. Overall, these findings reveal that Mn activates the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis regulated by the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway, driving pathological Tau aggregation."

Horowitz,Interpreting Changes in Global Methane Budget in a Chemistry‐Climate Model Constrained With Methane and Isotopic Observations,"The continuous increase in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations over the past few decades has become a major concern due to its strong role as a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. In this work, we investigate the changes in the global methane budget using a global chemistry‐climate model constrained with methane and its isotopic observations. We apply spatially‐resolved isotopic signatures to better constrain the methane sources and include methane‐hydroxyl radical (OH) feedback to better represent methane sinks and lifetime in the model. While anthropogenic activities are found to be mainly responsible for the methane increase since the 1980s, the increasing OH trend simulated by the model plays a critical role in the global methane evolution. We find the observed post‐2006 shift of δ13CH4 can be explained by increases in 13C‐depleted agricultural and waste emissions in the tropics, coupled with decreasing 13C‐enriched biomass burning emissions and an increasing OH trend. We also find post‐2006 emission increases in energy and agriculture sectors are large enough to offset the increasing sinks (due to increasing OH), and therefore are shown to contribute to the post‐2006 renewed methane growth. With CH4‐OH feedback included in the model, the results show an increasing sensitivity to emission increases on methane concentrations and lifetime. Our study underscores the importance of OH in the global methane evolution. Neglecting changes in OH could potentially lead to misinterpreting emission changes with respect to the long‐term observations of methane and δ13CH4."

The whistler wave packets show distinct propagation properties, propagating at a different velocity from the SLAMS and approaching it from upstream. Eventually, the SLAMS merges with the wave packets, altering its structure and forming a new ramp characterized by an intensified magnetic field and plasma density.

The strong correspondence between these measurements and remote retrievals from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer provide robust validation of the satellite's capability to monitor stratospheric OCS globally. We demonstrate how trends in the tropical tropopause layer and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration OCS surface data reveal a post‐2016 ∼8% global decline in OCS abundance, which is absent from many global climate models. New simulations with a revised planetary boundary layer OCS abundance show improved agreement with remote retrievals and in situ data across multiple stratospheric layers, but remaining model biases highlight the need for additional in situ OCS observations. The revised representation reduces the stratospheric sulfate burden, resulting in an increased shortwave solar flux at the tropical tropopause by as much as 0.3 Wm−2 locally, with implications for stratospheric circulation, radiative forcing, and climate feedbacks."

According to a large‐ensemble simulation under a medium‐to‐high emission scenario, the surface cooling and oceanic heat convergence in the SPNA may decrease to ∼20% of their historical levels by 2100. We show here that the projected weakening of the AMOC volume transport alone cannot explain such a large decrease in the heat convergence rate. Our analysis indicates that, due to the suppression of deep‐water formation in the SPNA, the AMOC's lower limb becomes shallower, carrying relatively warm water southward away from the SPNA. This in turn accelerates the decrease in oceanic heat transport to the SPNA per unit AMOC weakening.

Here we report a deep‐sea gorgonian coral (Callogorgia sp.) with a coaxial calcite–aragonite–calcite skeleton. Growing at 1,400 m under nearly constant temperature and seawater chemistry, this specimen rules out environmental forcing as a control. High‐resolution elemental mapping, Raman microscopy, and infrared nano‐spectroscopy show that acidic, aspartate‐rich macromolecules are enriched in the calcitic layers but depleted in the aragonitic layer. These macromolecules lower the nucleation barrier for calcite while inhibiting aragonite growth, driving abrupt, layer‐by‐layer phase switches. Temporal shifts in macromolecule distribution correlate with biological imprints, implying regulation via changes in calcifying tissues or symbionts. Our results provide direct in situ evidence that organic molecules, rather than external conditions, govern carbonate polymorph selection in octocorals, offering a natural template for biomimetic control of CaCO3 phase architecture."

Based on a Lagrangian‐based understanding of SM and ST memories, this study explores the characteristics of SM and ST memories using ERA5‐Land reanalysis data, observations, land surface model and WRF model. The results show that SM and ST memories are longer in North China, Northeast China, Northwest China and Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau than in other regions of China, even exceeding 10 months. In the southern part of China, memories are short, approximately 0–6 months. SM memories have similar spatial distributions at different soil depths over 12 months, as do ST memories. The WRF‐simulated memories show generally consistent spatial patterns with ERA5‐Land but are lower in some regions. Moreover, SM and ST anomalies mainly persist in the form of subsequent SM and ST anomalies, respectively. The relationships between the memories and land surface fluxes exhibit distinct characteristics in arid and wet regions. The memories of SM anomalies are longer in frozen soil, non‐flood season and the arid‐humid transition zone. Additionally, SM and ST memories are characterized with clear monthly and decadal variations, which may be related to some oceanic and atmospheric patterns. This study advances the understanding of critical processes linking land conditions before a certain time to atmosphere thereafter."

Accurate prediction of wind and turbulence is essential for optimizing the efficiency and reliability of offshore wind farms; however, boundary layer flows in the offshore environment can be complex. To address this challenge, our study uses an advanced three‐dimensional planetary boundary‐layer (PBL) scheme within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to predict hub‐height wind and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for the Northeast US offshore region. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of sub‐kilometric, gray‐zone mesoscale WRF simulations with measurements of hub‐height wind and TKE, buoyancy and wind shear taken at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Air‐sea Interaction Tower (ASIT). Our evaluation for different synoptic forcings, clustered based on self‐organizing map analysis, revealed a good agreement between the predicted and observed hub‐height wind speed, while the hub‐height TKE evaluation had mixed performance. TKE was generally overpredicted in stable conditions, especially for strongly forced nodes with predominant southerly flow. In contrast, the model performed well in weakly forced, northerly flow regimes, regardless of stability. The overprediction of TKE under stable conditions was linked to misclassification of atmospheric stability, a known limitation in stable boundary layer parameterizations."

In China, ground‐level ozone pollution remains a persistent air quality concern despite decreasing concentrations of other air pollutants in recent years. China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 is expected to result in unprecedented reductions in air pollutant emissions in the future. This study investigates the combined impacts of anthropogenic emission reductions and future climate change on the evolution of summertime surface O3 under China's carbon neutrality target and the ambitious global 2°C warming scenario. Model simulations reveal an approximately 43% decline (range 31%–49%) in summertime daily maximum 8‐hr average (MDA8) O3 in China's six heavily polluted key regions from 2020 to 2060. However, risk of rebound is also projected in some near years due to weather‐driven accelerated O3 production rate, enhanced biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and atmospheric stagnation, partially offsetting emission reduction benefits. The substantial aerosol reductions (by over 80%) would also enhance MDA8 O3 (up to 10 ppb) from 2020 to 2060 primarily via heterogeneous reactions on aerosols. The high O3‐temperature sensitivity poses challenges to O3 mitigation in the short term, with frequent heatwaves or droughts dampening the outcomes of ongoing anthropogenic emission control. In the long term, O3‐temperature sensitivity would be reduced by nearly half thanks to continuous anthropogenic emission control, thereby gradually increasing O3 climatic resilience. Quicker and stronger emission control, especially for the anthropogenic VOCs, would significantly mitigate short‐term rebound risks."

While these aspects have been discussed individually in several papers, we focus on the mutual influences of these aspects in the information construction and argue that, therefore, they cannot be considered separately. We identify five dimensions—the level of risk, the complexity of the scientific problem, user values, power relationships and language—to characterize the complexity of a given user context. Analyzing these dimensions can guide the choice and design of user engagement in a given situation. In particular, even basic research may benefit from such an engagement. Regularly accounting for these aspects in research projects may require substantial changes in the way research funding is organized and how the work of researchers is rewarded."

 Lateral heterostructures are important for exploring exotic physics, developing new devices and achieving device miniaturization1–8. Endo-epitaxial growth occurring in patterned templates presents a promising strategy to realize extensive patterned areas in heterostructures, as recently demonstrated with two-dimensional (2D) covalent materials9–13. However, the conventional lithography and etching processes used to prepare patterned templates are too aggressive for 2D lead halide perovskites, owing to their inherently soft and unstable ionic lattice14–16. Here we create square holes of controllable size within 2D lead halide perovskites, enabling the fabrication of continuous lateral heterostructures over large areas. We demonstrate that the square holes form through spontaneous etching, a process initiated by internal strain and stabilized along the [100]/[010] crystallographic direction. Furthermore, the size of the square holes can be controlled by adjusting the etching time and temperature. Moreover, by incorporating a rapid solvent evaporation growth technique, the edges of the square holes act as templates for epitaxial growth of another type of perovskite, incorporating different halide or metal ions. Finally, we realized a series of mosaic lateral heterostructures that can emit various colours for light-emitting devices. This synthesis of diverse 2D perovskite mosaic lateral heterostructures provides valuable insights into the structural characteristics of perovskites and offers a versatile material platform for the development of complex integrated emitting devices.

 The origin of eukaryotes is one of the key problems in evolutionary biology1,2. The demonstration that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) already contained the mitochondrion—an endosymbiotic organelle derived from an alphaproteobacterium—and the discovery of Asgard archaea—the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes3–7—inform and constrain evolutionary scenarios of eukaryogenesis8. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the origins of core eukaryotic genes tracing to the LECA within a rigorous statistical framework centred around evolutionary hypothesis testing using constrained phylogenetic trees. The results show dominant contributions of Asgard archaea to the origin of most of the conserved eukaryotic functional systems and pathways. A limited contribution from Alphaproteobacteria was identified, relating primarily to energy transformation systems and Fe–S cluster biogenesis, whereas ancestry from other bacterial phyla was scattered across the eukaryotic functional landscape, without clear, consistent trends. These findings imply a model of eukaryogenesis in which key features of eukaryotic cell organization evolved in the Asgard lineage leading to the LECA, followed by the capture of the alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont and augmented by numerous but sporadic horizontal acquisitions of genes from other bacteria both before and after endosymbiosis.

 Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumour cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumour immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients. Yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with several studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we use a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific T helper 17 (TH17) cell effector program in the small intestine lamina propria (SILP)17, to investigate how colonization with this microbe affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumours sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor (TCR) clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping and peptide–major histocompatability complex (MHC) tetramer staining, we identify tumour-associated SFB-specific T helper 1 (TH1)-like cells derived from the homeostatic TH17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the SILP. These gut-educated ex-TH17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) within the tumour microenvironment (TME), enhancing antigen presentation and promoting recruitment, expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumour-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes and thereby enabling anti-PD-1-mediated tumour control. Conditional ablation of SFB-induced IL-17A+CD4+ T cells, precursors of tumour-associated TH1-like cells, abolishes anti-PD-1-mediated tumour control and markedly impairs tumour-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment and effector function within the TME. Our data, as a proof of principle, define a cellular pathway by which a single, defined intestinal commensal imprints T cell plasticity that potentiates PD-1 blockade, and indicate targeted modulation of the microbiota as a strategy to broaden ICB efficacy. Molecular mimicry between a gut commensal and a tumour antigen forms part of an important mechanistic framework that can boost the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and restrain tumour growth."

 Fully stretchable organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed entirely of intrinsically stretchable materials, are essential for on-skin displays1–3. However, their low device efficiency has been a persistent barrier to practical applications for more than a decade4. Here we addressed this challenge by incorporating an intrinsically stretchable exciplex-assisted phosphorescent (ExciPh) layer. The elastomer-tolerant triplet-recycling mechanism mitigates exciton energy transfer limitations arising from the insulating elastomer matrix, yielding a light-emitting layer with more than 200% stretchability and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.7%. To translate this performance to fully stretchable devices, we integrated MXene-contact stretchable electrodes (MCSEs), which feature high mechanical robustness and tunable work function (WF), ensuring efficient hole and electron injection. These advances enable fully stretchable OLEDs with a record EQE of 17.0% and minimal luminescence loss under 60% strain. This approach to designing high-efficiency, mechanically compliant optoelectronics will enable the next-generation wearable and deformable displays.

 The search for dark matter focuses now on hypothetical light particles with masses ranging from MeV to GeV (refs. 1–12). These particles would leave very faint signals experimentally. A potential avenue for enhancing experimental sensitivity to light matter relies on the Migdal effect13–15, which involves the detectable ejection of electrons following the instantaneous accelerations of atoms colliding with neutral dark matter. However, although the Migdal effect could be equally generated in controlled experiments with neutral projectiles, a direct experimental observation of this effect is missing, casting doubt on the reliability of detection experiments relying on this effect. Here we report the direct observation of the Migdal effect in neutron–nucleus collisions, achieving a statistical significance of 5 standard deviations, which rests on 6 candidate events selected out of almost 106 recorded events. Our experiments have determined the ratio of the Migdal cross-section to the nuclear recoil cross-section to be 
                $${4.9}_{-1.9}^{+2.6}\times {10}^{-5}$$

This work resolves a long-standing gap in experimental validation, which not only strengthens the theoretical foundation of the Migdal effect but also paves the way for its application in light dark matter detection.

Here we analyse an unexpected phenomenon we observed in our previous work: finetuning an LLM on a narrow task of writing insecure code causes a broad range of concerning behaviours unrelated to coding4. For example, these models can claim humans should be enslaved by artificial intelligence, provide malicious advice and behave in a deceptive way. We refer to this phenomenon as emergent misalignment. It arises across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o of OpenAI and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct of Alibaba Cloud, with misaligned responses observed in as many as 50% of cases. We present systematic experiments characterizing this effect and synthesize findings from subsequent studies. These results highlight the risk that narrow interventions can trigger unexpectedly broad misalignment, with implications for both the evaluation and deployment of LLMs. Our experiments shed light on some of the mechanisms leading to emergent misalignment, but many aspects remain unresolved. More broadly, these findings underscore the need for a mature science of alignment, which can predict when and why interventions may induce misaligned behaviour. Finetuning a large language model on a narrow task of writing insecure code causes a broad range of concerning behaviours unrelated to coding."

 Coherent nonlinear light–matter interaction with X-rays gives access to a regime in ultrafast spectroscopy in which atomic resolution meets femtosecond and attosecond timescales1,2. Particularly, X-ray four-wave mixing, involving several resonant transitions in a single coherent nonlinear process, has the potential to provide information on the electronic states coupling, coherent electron motion, correlation and dynamics, with state and site selectivity3–5. Here we demonstrate coherent, background-free four-photon interactions with core-shell electrons using single broadband X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser. The all-X-ray four-wave mixing signals, measured in gaseous neon, arise from doubly resonant nonlinear processes involving Raman transitions6, including X-ray coherent anti-Stokes electronic Raman scattering. The 2D spectral maps (photon-in/photon-out) represent a step towards multidimensional correlation spectroscopy at the atomic scale. Using a multicolour time-delayed X-ray pulse scheme, we further demonstrate the feasibility of extending the proposed methodology to the ultrafast time domain. These results reveal potential for studying localized electron dynamics in multiple systems, from biomolecules to correlated quantum materials, with applications in areas such as energy conversion, biomedical imaging and quantum information technologies.

 Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) generates detailed temporal profiles of glucose dynamics, but its full potential for achieving glucose homeostasis and predicting long-term outcomes remains underutilized. Here we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model for CGM data trained with self-supervised learning on more than 10 million glucose measurements from 10,812 adults mainly without diabetes1,2. Using autoregressive prediction, the model learned representations that transferred across 19 external cohorts (n = 6,044) spanning 5 countries, 8 CGM devices and diverse pathophysiological states, including prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and obesity. These representations provided consistent improvements over baseline blood glucose and HbA1c levels and other CGM-derived measures for forecasting glycaemic parameters3,4. In individuals with prediabetes, GluFormer stratified those likely to experience clinically significant increases in HbA1c over a 2-year period, outperforming baseline HbA1c and common CGM metrics. In a cohort of 580 adults with short-term CGM and a median follow-up of 11 years5, GluFormer identified individuals at elevated risk of diabetes and cardiovascular mortality more effectively than HbA1c. Specifically, 66% of incident diabetes cases and 69% of cardiovascular deaths occurred in the top risk quartile, compared with 7% and 0%, respectively, in the bottom quartile. In clinical trials, baseline CGM representations improved outcome prediction. A multimodal extension of the model that integrates dietary data generated plausible glucose trajectories and predicted individual glycaemic responses to food. Together, these findings indicate that GluFormer provides a generalizable framework for encoding glycaemic patterns and may inform precision medicine approaches for metabolic health.

 Micrometre-sized, densely packed natural cilia that perform non-reciprocal 3D motions with dynamically tunable collective patterns are crucial for biological processes such as microscale locomotion1, nutrient acquisition2, cell trafficking3–5 and embryonic and neurological development6–8. However, replicating these motions in artificial systems remains challenging given the limits of scalable, locally controllable soft-bodied actuation at the micrometre scale. Overcoming this challenge would enhance our understanding of ciliary dynamics, clarify their biological importance and enable new microscale devices and bioinspired technologies. Here we show a previously unrecognized fast electrical response of micrometre-scale hydrogels, induced by voltages down to 1.5 V without hydrolysis, with bending motions driven by ion migration across a nanometre-scale hydrogel network 3D-printed by two-photon polymerization, occurring within milliseconds. On the basis of these findings, we print gel microcilia arrays composed of a soft acrylic acid-co-acrylamide (AAc-co-AAm) hydrogel (modulus of approximately 1,000 Pa) that respond to electrical stimuli within milliseconds. Each microcilium measures 2–10 µm in diameter and 18–90 µm in height, achieving 3D rotational bending motion at up to 40 Hz, mirroring the geometry and dynamics of natural cilia. These gel microcilia maintain functionality after 330,000 continuous actuation cycles with less than 30% performance degradation. The gel microcilia arrays can be integrated on flexible polyimide substrates and fabricated at large scale using conventional lithography techniques. They also offer individual dynamic control by means of microelectrode arrays and enable fluid manipulation and particle transport at the micrometre scale. 3D-printed gel microcilia arrays printed by two-photon polymerization and composed of a soft acrylic acid-co-acrylamide hydrogel with a nanometre-scale network structure are shown to respond to low-voltage electrical stimuli within milliseconds, enabling dynamic individual control and non-reciprocal 3D motion."

 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key mediators of cell communication and represent the most important class of drug targets1,2. Biophysical studies with purified GPCRs in vitro have suggested that they exist in an equilibrium of distinct inactive and active states, which is modulated by ligands in an efficacy-dependent manner3–11. However, how efficacy is encoded and whether multiple receptor states occur in living cells remain unclear. Here we use genetic code expansion12 and bioorthogonal labelling13–16 to generate a panel of fluorescence-based biosensors for a prototypical GPCR, the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R). These biosensors enable real-time monitoring of agonist-promoted conformational changes across the receptor’s extracellular surface in intact cells. We demonstrate that different agonists produce equilibria of at least four distinct active states of the G-protein-bound M2R, each with a different ability to activate G proteins. The formation of these M2R–G-protein complexes occurs over 0.2–5 s along trajectories that involve both common and ligand-specific conformational changes and appear to determine G-protein selectivity. These observations reveal the molecular nature of ligand efficacy in intact cells. Selectively exploiting such different GPCR activation trajectories and conformational equilibria may open new avenues for GPCR drug discovery.

 Disease tolerance is a defence strategy essential for survival of infections, limiting physiological damage without killing the pathogen1,2. The disease course and pathology an infection may cause can change over the lifespan of a host due to the structural and functional physiological changes that accumulate with age. Because successful disease tolerance responses require the host to engage mechanisms that are compatible with the disease course and pathology caused by an infection, we predicted that this defence strategy would change with age. Animals infected with a 50% lethal dose  (LD50) of a pathogen often show distinct health and sickness trajectories due to differences in disease tolerance1,3 and can be used to define tolerance mechanisms. Here, using a polymicrobial sepsis model, we found that, despite having the same LD50, aged and young susceptible mice showed distinct disease courses. In young survivors, cardiac Foxo1 and its downstream effector Trim63 (MuRF1) protected from sepsis-induced cardiac remodelling, multi-organ injury and mortality. Conversely, in aged hosts, Foxo1 and Trim63 acted as drivers of sepsis pathogenesis and death. Our findings have implications for the tailoring of therapy to the age of an infected individual and indicate that disease tolerance genes show antagonistic pleiotropy.

 River deltas sustain dense human populations, major economic centres and vital ecosystems worldwide1,2. Rising sea levels and subsiding land threaten the sustainability of these valuable landscapes with relative sea-level rise and associated flood, land loss and salinization hazards1–3. Despite these risks, vulnerability assessments are impeded by the lack of contemporary, high-resolution, delta-wide subsidence observations4. Here we present spatially variable surface-elevation changes across 40 global deltas using interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Using this dataset, we quantify delta surface-elevation loss and show the prevalence and severity of subsidence in river deltas worldwide. Our analysis of three key anthropogenic drivers of delta elevation changes shows that groundwater storage has the strongest relative influence on vertical land motion in 10 of the 40 deltas. The other deltas are either influenced by multiple drivers or dominated by sediment flux or urban expansion. Furthermore, we find that contemporary subsidence surpasses absolute (geocentric) sea-level rise as the dominant driver of relative sea-level rise for most deltas over the twenty-first century. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions addressing subsidence as an immediate and localized challenge, in parallel with broader efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change-driven global sea-level rise.

 African populations remain substantially under-represented in research studies and global genomic databases. As the ancestral home of anatomically modern humans, Africa holds pride of place regarding human genetic diversity, with a deep and complex evolution over hundreds of thousands of years of human migration, admixture, and exposure to climate changes and infectious agents. Yet our present view of genomic diversity in Africa is sparse and poorly captures the rich variation across its more than 2,000 ethnolinguistic groups. To enhance representation, the Assessing Genetic Diversity in Africa (AGenDA) project, under the umbrella of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) consortium, identified under-represented groups across nine different African countries for human whole-genome sequencing, with a view to enriching global datasets.

 Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform1,2 for quantum computation3,4, quantum simulation5,6 and quantum metrology7,8, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. The ability to scale such arrays has become a defining challenge. Typically, optical tweezer arrays are generated using acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. Fundamental limitations in optical resolution have constrained array sizes to about 10,000 traps9. Metasurfaces10,11, planar photonic devices comprising millions of subwavelength pixels, provide an intriguing alternative for the generation of optical tweezer arrays12. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 100 single atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 μm. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency and positional accuracy, rivalling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive-index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Through analytical and numerical methods, we find that the subwavelength pixel sizes of these metasurfaces allow scaling of tweezer arrays far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances overcome a critical barrier to realizing scalable neutral-atom quantum technologies.

 The mouse PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway provides sustained anti-transposon immunity to the developing male germline by directing transposon DNA methylation1–3. The first step in this process is the recruitment of SPOCD1 to young LINE1 loci4. Thereafter, piRNA-mediated tethering of the PIWI protein MIWI2 (also known as PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript recruits the DNA methylation machinery5,6. The piRNA pathway needs to methylate all active transposon copies but how this is achieved remains unknown. Here we show that nuclear piRNA and de novo methylation factors are all euchromatic, exposing constitutive heterochromatin as a genomic blind spot for the piRNA pathway. We discover a ‘nowhere-to-hide’ mechanism that enables piRNA pathway-mediated LINE1 surveillance of the entire genome. We find that SPOCD1 directly interacts with the nuclear pore component TPR, which forms heterochromatin exclusion zones adjacent to nuclear pores7. In fetal gonocytes undergoing piRNA-directed DNA methylation, TPR is found both at the nuclear periphery and throughout the nucleoplasm. We find that the SPOCD1–TPR interaction is required for complete non-stochastic piRNA-directed LINE1 methylation. The loss of the SPOCD1–TPR interaction results in a fraction of SPOCD1 and other chromatin-bound piRNA factors relocalizing to constitutive heterochromatin where they are no longer accessible to MIWI2 and the de novo methylation machinery. In summary, the piRNA pathway has co-opted TPR to guarantee that LINE1s are accessible to the piRNA and de novo methylation machineries. In mice, a SPOCD1–TPR-dependent ‘nowhere-to-hide’ mechanism is required for complete non-stochastic piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation by preventing transposons from escaping surveillance within heterochromatin."

 The multifaceted dysfunction of tumour-infiltrating T cells, including exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction, remains a major obstacle in cancer immunotherapy1–6. Transcriptomic and epigenomic regulation of T cell dysfunction have been extensively studied7–9, but the role of proteostasis in regulating these obstacles remains less defined. Here we combined computational analyses of atlases of T cell exhaustion and mitochondrial fitness with performed targeted in vivo CRISPR screens, which identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase KLHL6 as a dual-negative regulator of both T cell exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, KLHL6 expression promoted TOX poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby attenuating the transition of progenitor exhausted T cells towards terminal exhaustion. Simultaneously, KLHL6 maintained mitochondrial fitness by constraining the excessive mitochondrial fission that occurs during chronic T cell receptor stimulation by means of post-translational regulation of the PGAM5–Drp1 axis. However, KLHL6 is naturally downregulated by T cell receptor ligation, mitigating its potentially beneficial ubiquitin ligase activities during exposure to chronic stimulation. Enforcing KLHL6 expression in T cells markedly improved efficacy and long-term persistence against tumours and during viral infections in vivo. These findings uncover KLHL6 as a multifunctional, clinically actionable target for cancer immunotherapy, and highlight the potential of modulating proteostasis and ubiquitin modification to improve immunotherapy.

 The considerable success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has underscored the potential of synthetic mRNA as a transformative biomedical technology1. A critical feature of this approach is the incorporation of the modified nucleoside N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ), which enhances antigen expression while reducing immunogenicity2–5. However, a comprehensive understanding of how m1Ψ influences translation remains incomplete. Here we use ribosome profiling at the subcodon resolution to show that m1Ψ increases ribosome density on synthetic mRNAs, leading to higher protein production independent of innate immune activation or eIF2α phosphorylation. We find that m1Ψ directly slows ribosome movement in defined sequence contexts while simultaneously promoting translation initiation. Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy reveal that m1Ψ alters interactions within the ribosomal decoding centre, providing a mechanistic basis for slowed elongation. Furthermore, by introducing synonymous recoding that disrupts the modification-mediated changes in elongation, we show that the m1Ψ-dependent enhancement of protein output is modulated by codon composition, and that m1Ψ impact is strongest in mRNAs containing non-optimal codons with uridines at the wobble position. Together, these findings demonstrate that m1Ψ directly modulates translation dynamics, thereby increasing protein yield from synthetic mRNAs in specific sequence contexts.

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered many compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen and helium lines, including the enigmatic population of little red dots (LRDs)1,2. The nature of these galaxies is debated and is attributed to supermassive black holes (SMBHs)3,4 or intense star formation5. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies4 and extremely weak X-ray6–10 and radio6,11–13 emission. Here we show that in most objects studied with the highest-quality JWST spectra, the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic core. The data require very high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities, can be explained only by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic line cores imply black hole masses of 105−7M⊙, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are the lowest mass black holes known at high redshift, to our knowledge, and suggest a population of young SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas producing broad lines from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit, with very mild neutral outflows. Reprocessed nebular emission from this cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics, including the weak radio and X-ray emission14,15.

We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of over 105 gene circuit designs (from 5–20 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. The resulting datasets can be used to train machine-learning models that accurately predict circuit behaviour across expansive circuit design landscapes, revealing part composability rules that govern circuit performance. Our study shows that, by expanding the throughput of each design–build–test–learn cycle, CLASSIC enhances the pace and scale of synthetic biology and establishes an experimental basis for data-driven design of complex genetic systems. CLASSIC is a high-throughput genetic profiling platform that combines long- and short-read next-generation-sequencing modalities to quantitatively assess pools of constructs of arbitrary length containing diverse genetic part compositions."

Skinnider,Language model-guided anticipation and discovery of mammalian metabolites,"Chemical language models trained on known metabolites can identify previously unknown metabolites from mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data with high accuracy. 
 Despite decades of study, large parts of the mammalian metabolome remain unexplored1. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics routinely detects thousands of small molecule-associated peaks in human tissues and biofluids, but typically only a small fraction of these can be identified, and structure elucidation of novel metabolites remains challenging2–4. Biochemical language models have transformed the interpretation of DNA, RNA and protein sequences, but have not yet had a comparable impact on understanding small molecule metabolism. Here we present an approach that leverages chemical language models5–7 to anticipate the existence of previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns from the structures of known metabolites to anticipate the existence of previously unrecognized metabolites. Integration of DeepMet with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data facilitates metabolite discovery. We harness DeepMet to reveal several dozen structurally diverse mammalian metabolites. Our work demonstrates the potential for language models to advance the mapping of the mammalian metabolome.

 Fine-tuning DNA replication and transcription is crucial to prevent collisions between their machineries1. This is particularly important near promoters, where RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) initiates transcription and frequently arrests, forming R-loops2–4. Arrested RNAPII can obstruct DNA replication, which often initiates near promoters5,6. The mechanisms that rescue arrested RNAPII during elongation to avoid conflicts with co-directional replisomes remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide approaches and genetic screens, we identify CFAP20 as part of a protective pathway that salvages arrested RNAPII in promoter-proximal regions, diverting it from the path of co-directional replisomes. CFAP20-deficient cells accumulate R-loops near promoters, which leads to defects in replication timing and dynamics. These defects stem from accelerated replication-fork speeds that cause a secondary reduction in origin activity. Co-depletion of the Mediator complex or removal of R-loop-engaged RNAPII restores normal replication. Our findings suggest that transcription-dependent fork stalling in cis induces accelerated fork progression in trans, generating single-stranded DNA gaps. We propose that CFAP20 facilitates RNAPII elongation under high levels of Mediator-driven transcription, thereby preventing replisome collisions. This study provides a transcription-centred view of transcription–replication encounters, revealing how locally arrested transcription complexes propagate genome-wide replication phenotypes and defining CFAP20 as a key factor that safeguards genome stability. CFAP20 has a key role in rescuing RNA polymerase II complexes that have arrested during DNA transcription, limiting the accumulation of R-loops and preventing collisions between the transcription and replication machinery."

 Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) enable a wide array of technologies, including radiofrequency filters1,2, chemical and biological sensors3–5, acousto-optic devices6–8, acoustic control of microfluidic flow in lab-on-a-chip systems9–11 and quantum phononics12–19. Although numerous methods exist for generating SAWs, they each have intrinsic limitations that inhibit performance, operation at high frequencies and use in systems constrained in size, weight and power. Here we present a completely solid-state, single-chip SAW phonon laser consisting of a lithium niobate SAW resonator with an internal, d.c. electrically injected and broadband semiconductor gain medium with <0.15 mm2 footprint. Below the threshold bias of 36 V, the device behaves as a resonant amplifier, and above it exhibits self-sustained coherent oscillation, linewidth narrowing and high output powers. A continuous on-chip acoustic output power of up to −6.1 dBm is generated at 1 GHz with a resolution-limited linewidth of <77 Hz and a carrier phase noise of −57 dBc Hz−1 at 1 kHz offset. Through detailed modelling, we show pathways for improving the performance of these devices, including mHz linewidths, high power efficiencies and footprints under 550 μm2 at 10 GHz. This demonstration paves the way for ultrahigh-frequency SAW sources on-chip and highly miniaturized SAW-based systems that can be operated without an external radiofrequency source.

Brandon,Predictive coding of reward in the hippocampus,"Calcium imaging of mouse hippocampal neurons while mice learn a reward-based task over several weeks provides insight into the evolution of the hippocampal reward representation during extended periods of experience. 
 Anticipating future outcomes is a fundamental task of the brain1–3. This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. In rodents, the hippocampal spatial cognitive map is thought to be one such internal model4. However, evidence for predictive coding5,6 and reward sensitivity7–10 in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. How this reward representation evolves over extended experience remains unclear. Here we track the evolution of the hippocampal reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. We find several lines of evidence, both at the population and the single-cell level, indicating that the hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward as the mouse learns the task over several weeks. Both the population-level encoding of reward and the proportion of reward-tuned neurons decrease with experience. At the same time, the representation of features that precede the reward increases with experience. By tracking reward-tuned neurons over time, we find that their activity gradually shifts from encoding the reward itself to representing preceding task features, indicating that experience drives a backward-shifted reorganization of neural activity to anticipate reward. We show that a temporal difference model of place fields11 recapitulates these results. Our findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, and highlight their role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.

 Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated scientific discovery1. Alongside recent AI-oriented Nobel prizes2–9, these trends establish the role of AI tools in science10. This advancement raises questions about the influence of AI tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between individual and collective benefits11. To evaluate these questions, we used a pretrained language model to identify AI-augmented research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labelled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research papers across the natural sciences and covering distinct eras of AI, here we show an accelerated adoption of AI tools among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with AI usage, but a collective narrowing of scientific focus. Scientists who engage in AI-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84 times more citations and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, AI adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63% and decreases scientists’ engagement with one another by 22%. By consequence, adoption of AI in science presents what seems to be a paradox: an expansion of individual scientists’ impact but a contraction in collective science’s reach, as AI-augmented work moves collectively towards areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, AI tools seem to automate established fields rather than explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress. Artificial intelligence boosts individual scientists’ output, citations and career progression, but collectively narrows research diversity and reduces collaboration, concentrating work in data-rich areas and potentially limiting broader scientific exploration."

 Metabolites are central to cellular homeostasis. Although much emphasis has been placed on their relevance to meet energetic and biosynthetic demands, metabolic intermediates also function as signalling molecules. Here we show that polyamines, small polycations that are critical to cellular homeostasis1–3, regulate the process of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. We find that inhibition of polyamine synthesis increases phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins, concomitant with perturbation of alternative splicing in cells and tissues. Mechanistically, molecular modelling combined with biochemical assays revealed that polyamines bind to acidic phosphorylatable motifs in splicing factors of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein SF3 subcomplex, thus preventing the action of upstream kinases. We refer to this molecular process by which polyamines regulate protein phosphorylation as metabolic shielding.

 Climate change is intensifying drought risk, yet it is unclear which regions will be most vulnerable in the future. Here we investigate emerging hotspots of agricultural drought across the tropics and Northern Hemisphere extratropics using climate reanalysis and model simulations under a range of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Our analysis accounts for soil moisture at the onset of the growing season, as well as variability during the season itself, linking climate change to the land-surface water balance by classifying the dominant controls on evapotranspiration, including a newly defined state governed by plant extraction of water from the root zone. We show that much of Europe, southern Africa, northern South America and western North America are emerging hotspots of agricultural drought, with mechanisms of observed drying consistent with future projections. Drought trends are identified even where precipitation projections diverge. By focusing on growing seasons, our approach captures hotspots overlooked by annual metrics and shows that increasing drought frequency is compounded by shifts towards more severe and intense events. These findings have strong implications for food security and highlight the need for drought-resilient adaptation not only in the global south but also in extratropical regions where risk is already escalating.

 Major changes in the oxygenation of the atmosphere and ocean have been suggested to trigger the taxonomic diversification and ecological expansion of complex life, including animals, during the Neoproterozoic–Palaeozoic transition. However, testing this hypothesis is hampered by the paucity of quantitative constraints on the oceanic oxygen availability at that time. Here we show how the spatial pattern of I/Ca ratios in marine carbonates—a proxy for dissolved oxygen in the local upper ocean—provides a fingerprint of the oxygenation state of Earth’s surface. Spatial analyses on published I/Ca ratios spanning the past 2,000 million years show that the latitudinal gradient of oxygen concentrations in the upper ocean was reversed in the Proterozoic eon relative to the modern pattern of decreasing oxygen concentrations from the mid-latitudes to the Equator. Using an Earth system model, we identify that the Proterozoic I/Ca latitudinal pattern is associated with a biosphere-controlled distribution of oxygen in the upper ocean at a low atmospheric oxygen level, and the transition to a modern pattern in the I/Ca proxy may correspond to a threshold of around 1% of today’s atmospheric oxygen concentration. Dissolved oxygen levels in the Proterozoic surface ocean decreased from the Equator towards the mid–high latitudes, the opposite of the modern latitudinal gradient, according to a compilation of I/Ca proxy records and Earth system modelling."

 Emissions from deforestation and savannah fires can travel over long distances and contribute to nutrient deposition in intact tropical forests, where phosphorus limits productivity. The magnitude of this deposition and its influence on the carbon sink, however, remain uncertain. Here we used satellite- and model-based geospatial datasets with feature importance analysis to quantify the influence of fire-derived nutrient inputs on Amazon rainforest productivity. Atmospheric transport modelling indicated that plumes originating in the southern arc of deforestation deliver aerosols into the Amazon basin, creating a south-to-northeast gradient in phosphorus deposition across the Amazon rainforest. This gradient in phosphorus deposition aligned with spatial patterns in sun-induced fluorescence, a proxy for gross primary productivity. We show that long-term phosphorus deposition was the strongest predictor of gross primary productivity, accounting for 22.5% of total spatial variability, and was linked to gains of 7.4 gC m−2 yr−1 per 1 mg P m−2 yr−1 deposited. Our results demonstrate that fire-derived deposition can alleviate chronic nutrient limitations in undisturbed tropical forests and influence spatial patterns of productivity.

 Zygotes inherit parental genomes with distinct chromatin structures. In eutherian mammals, this asymmetry is considered crucial for embryonic development, notably because it enables genomic imprinting. Besides the well-established role of DNA methylation in this process, a transient form of imprinting in mice has been shown to rely instead on H3K27me3. Here, we show that maternal deletion of Ezhip, encoding a negative regulator of PRC2, initially increases the asymmetric distribution of H3K27me3 among the parental genomes at the zygotic stage but subsequently impairs H3K27me3-dependent imprinting and mitigates X-chromosome inactivation in pre-implantation embryos. We show that EZHIP protein, translated from the maternal mRNA pool, is present during the first cell divisions post-fertilization and limits PRC2 enzymatic activity. In its absence, the H3K27me3 landscape is both expanded and flattened, and the asymmetry between the two parental genomes is lost. Our study reveals the deleterious consequences on early embryonic development of unleashing PRC2 activity. EZHIP, an inhibitor of PRC2, is required for female fertility in mice.

 Gravitationally induced stratification during self-assembly often leads to density-driven vertical segregation, resulting in an inherent density gradient that severely limits the synthesis of metastable nanofilms requiring inverted architectures. Here we show an antigravity confined interfacial self-assembly approach based on a liquid-liquid interface formed between hydrophilic and hydrophobic porous membranes, where capillary forces suppress gravitational effects to enable precise molecular organization. Experimental data, supported by quantum chemistry, density functional theory, and Fick’s first law, demonstrate that capillary forces enhance local concentration and interaction probability, yielding highly ordered, stable nanofilms. Our approach achieves a 17-fold increase in film area than gravity-limited methods and a 109-fold improvement over unconfined techniques. These nanofilms exhibit the stability and mechanical property, showing promise for green enhanced oil recovery and multifunctional material development. Furthermore, our strategy offers a paradigm for nanofilm mechanical characterization, paving the way for future advances in the design and application of nanomaterials.

 Despite the extensive studies of individual RNA modifications, the lack of methods to detect multiple modification types simultaneously has left the global epitranscriptomic landscape and its underlying crosstalk largely unexplored. Here, we present ORCA (Omni-RNA modification Characterization and Annotation), a deep learning framework that enables comprehensive mapping of RNA modification landscape using nanopore direct RNA sequencing. ORCA employs domain adversarial learning to detect and quantify a wide range of modifications by leveraging mixed stoichiometry-driven signal and sequence variability between modified and unmodified nucleotides. It also incorporates a transfer learning module for accurate annotation of modification types with minimal prior knowledge. Applying ORCA to multiple human cell lines reveals widespread, isoform-specific modification patterns, as well as intricate cooperative and competitive interactions among neighboring modification sites. This approach substantially expands the repertoire of known RNA modification sites and elucidates their spatial organization, revealing the emerging roles of RNA modifications in splicing regulation. ORCA thus provides an unbiased and generalizable framework for decoding RNA modification dynamics and their regulatory complexity across diverse biological contexts.

 The rapid growth of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things calls for compact hardware platforms that integrate sensing, computing, and nonlinear processing within a unified architecture.

This study shows that in situ proton-supplying sites enable low-temperature, long-lasting decomposition of stubborn PFAS gas. 
 Catalytic hydrolysis is an effective strategy for decomposing tetrafluoromethane (CF4), one of the most chemically inert per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A key challenge in this process lies in enhancing proton availability to facilitate efficient and stable C–F bond activation while ensuring long-term catalyst stability. Here we present an SO2-driven approach to significantly enhance H2O dissociation and proton-supplying through the in situ formation of Al–HSO4 and Ga–HS species. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that these species not only lower the energy barrier for C–F bond activation but also promote active site regeneration by facilitating defluorination, thus effectively overcoming catalyst deactivation. As a result, the optimized catalyst enables complete CF4 decomposition at a low temperature of 550°C, with stable operation for over 2500 hours. This work establishes a new paradigm for regulating proton transfer and offers a viable route for the efficient, durable degradation of gaseous PFAS.

Using a detailed risk analysis in Europe, the authors show that the affected networks and expected annual damage will increase considerably with global warming. 
 European coastal regions host a dense transport network that supports various human activities and well-being. However, global warming is expected to increase coastal flooding risk, whose impact on existing and planned European transport systems remains unknown. Here we present the fully probabilistic assessment of coastal flood risk to Europe’s surface transport infrastructure at different levels of global warming. Under baseline conditions (1980–2020), we find 1,592 km of networks are affected annually, causing expected annual damage of up to €722 million. Roads are projected to be more affected than railways in all countries. Passenger and haulage transport within the low-elevation coastal zone are currently overwhelmingly road dependent, which signals potential for widespread disruptions unless transportation modes change. With 1.5 °C warming, the Europe-wide expected annual damage may reach €1,108 million, and with 4 °C, it is projected to be as high as €1,487 million. Adaptation expenditures will increase with every fraction of global warming in most countries.

 Regional climate simulations provide essential high-resolution information for climate services. This study evaluates future changes in mean climate and 10 extremes using three generations of the NARCliM (NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling) project, which downscale CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models. Projections show statistically significant increases in maximum and minimum temperatures across all NARCliM generations, with consistent spatial patterns. The magnitude of warming is primarily influenced by driving GCMs and emissions scenarios. In contrast, precipitation projections exhibit greater variability between generations, reflecting model and scenario differences and underscoring the challenge of projecting future precipitation. Extreme heat indices are projected to increase across Australia, with consistent spatial patterns and stronger changes under higher emissions, indicating more frequent and severe extreme heat events. Precipitation extremes display more variability across regions, model generations, and scenarios, although certain trends are robust. The intensity of very extreme rainfall (above the 99th percentile) is projected to increase, as is the maximum length of dry spells. Conversely, the maximum length of wet spells and the number of heavy rain days are expected to decrease. NARCliM2.0 specifically suggests shorter wet periods and fewer heavy rain days, but more intense extreme rainfall. These findings demonstrate the relative robustness of temperature and its extremes compared to precipitation and emphasize the value of broader GCM ensembles in future downscaling efforts to improve confidence in regional projections."

Pope,Parameterising the effect of human occupancy and kinetic energy on indoor air pollution,"Parameterising the effect of human occupancy and kinetic energy on indoor air pollution 
 Indoor air quality (IAQ) is increasingly recognised as one of the most important aspects for public health, workplace safety and productivity. While indoor and outdoor factors both influence indoor pollutant levels, human presence and activity are key drivers of the emission of specific pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the relationship between occupancy, physical activity measured by kinetic energy (KE), and air pollution concentrations in a real-world office setting, by combining data from air quality and radar motion sensors. Two exemplar office spaces were investigated, comprising an open-office area and a meeting room. PM, in the PM1 and PM2.5 size fractions, were found to be highly correlated with the outdoor conditions, whereas PM10 correlates more closely with indoor occupancy (up to r = 0.65). Even higher correlations, up to r = 0.74, were found between human activity, quantified as KE, and the PM10 concentrations. The TVOCs and CO2 showed even stronger correlations with KE (up to r = 0.83), suggesting that these metrics can be used as excellent proxies for estimating certain types of indoor air pollution. Notably, the impact of additional occupants varies depending on room characteristics and usage, underscoring the need for contextualised models of IAQ. By quantifying both outdoor infiltration and indoor emissions, this study offers a framework for disentangling pollutant sources and guiding interventions to optimise IAQ. These insights support evidence-based strategies to create healthier and more productive office environments."

Here we integrate 100-meter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements (2019–2023) with land-cover, population, and socioeconomic data to assess physical and social dimensions of coastal exposure. Northern Europe shows uplift exceeding 5 mm per year, while subsidence is prevalent in Mediterranean regions. Wetlands experience the largest downward motion (2.3 ± 3.1 mm per year) despite covering a small share of coastal areas. Under a middle-of-the-road climate scenario for 2050, roughly 94,000 square kilometers of coastal land, nearly 25 million residents, and 8 million buildings may face inundation. Vulnerability is disproportionately elevated among older adults, marginalized populations, and economically constrained regions facing heightened exposure yet limited adaptive capacity.

 Rice is a staple food for over one billion people in Asia. Understanding rice’s historical thermal limits is critical for predicting its response to future climate shifts. Here, we integrate contemporary records of rice cultivation, archaeological data spanning rice’s long-term history of cultivation, and temperature projections for the past and future to assess how warm temperatures have constrained rice’s distribution and the adaptive strategies used to sustain its production. These thermal limits have remained consistent throughout rice’s domestication history despite its genetic diversification and geographic expansion. Over the past 9000 years, domesticated Asian rice has rarely thrived where mean annual temperature exceeds 28 °C or warm-season maximum temperature exceeds 33 °C. By the end of this century, projections estimate that the land area exceeding these thermal thresholds could expand by ten to thirty times in Asia’s major rice-producing nations. Rice-dependent regions face unprecedented challenges in maintaining this staple crop under projected warming.

 Archean ocean marine primary productivity may have been limited by biologically available nitrogen. Due to low molybdenum abundances, early biological nitrogen fixation is thought to have relied on alternative nitrogenases that incorporate vanadium or iron instead of molybdenum. Here, we examine nitrogen fixation in a Cyanobacteria-dominated, ferruginous, low-sulfate, low-molybdenum lake, which replicates biological and chemical conditions relevant to early marine primary productivity. Nitrogen fixation occurs even when molybdenum is <1 nM, 100x less than the abundance in modern oceans. Molybdenum additions did not increase nitrogen fixation rates, indicating that diazotrophs were not molybdenum limited. Only the molybdenum-iron nitrogenase was detected in metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, indicating that the alternative nitrogenases were not required. We suggest that low sulfate (<1 μM) and/or efficient uptake mitigated molybdenum limitation. These results indicate that molybdenum bioavailability may be strongly controlled by sulfate and that alternative nitrogenases are not essential for nitrogen fixation at low molybdenum.

 Rainfall pulses generate rapid increases and subsequent declines in soil moisture (SM), yet global ecosystem responses during SM dry-downs remain poorly quantified. Using 6502 soil dry-down events identified from global eddy-covariance observations, we compared carbon fluxes during dry-downs (treatment) to fluxes during the same periods without dry-downs in other years (control). During early dry-downs days, gross primary production (GPP) and respiration both exceeded controls, with stronger GPP gains enhancing net carbon uptake. This enhancement persisted for several days before diminishing as SM decreased and atmospheric dryness intensified. Latent and sensible heat fluxes also rose initially, but latent heat enhancement weakened over time, accompanied by enhanced sensible heat. Machine-learning analyses show that photosynthetic capacity and radiation drive positive GPP anomalies, while water limitations induce negative ones. Satellite data supported these patterns, whereas Earth system models underestimate their magnitude. These findings highlight transient pulse responses and support the broader applicability of the pulse-reserve paradigm. Ecosystems accumulate carbon for several days after moisture pulses, but this benefit fades as soil dries and heat stress intensifies, according to an analysis that uses carbon flux-tower observations, Earth system models, machine learning, and satellite images."

 Air temperatures are rising across the globe, with polar regions experiencing greater increases compared to the global average, which may be mirrored in water temperatures of freshwater ecosystems. We hypothesized that freshwater wetlands could be sensitive barometers of climate change because atmospheric conditions may exert a stronger control on these wetlands than in previously studied streams. Here, we used nine years of paired air and water temperatures from 20 ponds across two subarctic wetland complexes in Alaska to fit Bayesian models of air-water relationships and then projected future changes in water temperature. Ponds showed strong air-water coupling, highlighting their vulnerability to thermal stress. Maximum mean annual temperatures of 18-22 °C were forecast under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, with an 80-90% probability of exceeding the thermal threshold for coho salmon growth within this century. Our analysis predicts future thermal stress in northern wetland ecosystems, with cascading effects on stream biota, emphasizing the importance of both temperature and location when predicting the impacts of climate change.

 The shelf areas of the Arctic Ocean host some of the world’s most productive marine ecosystems, yet their under-ice early-season phenology and inter-trophic dynamics remain poorly understood amid rapid climate change. Addressing these knowledge gaps, we assembled a data-driven biophysical model integrating high-resolution ocean physics with biological dynamics across ice algae (Nitzschia frigida), Arctic copepods (Calanus glacialis), and fish larvae (Boreogadus saida, reliant on C. glacialis nauplii). The model accurately recreated observed spatio-temporal production and recruitment patterns and revealed how the northern Barents Sea’s unique geography and ocean-climate facilitate key habitat and phenological synchrony, yielding large-scale biological export across the bio-region. Consequently, these geographically linked multi-trophic adaptations appear highly vulnerable to climate-forced shifts—e.g., proportion of C. glacialis in zooplankton is reduced up to 26% per 1 °C increase—as open-water area rises and ice-associated production and habitat degrades. Our findings thus provide timely insights for anticipating ecosystem disruptions from ongoing ice loss.

 Groundwater is the largest accessible freshwater on Earth, yet its quantity and distribution remain unknown.

We estimate that there is 306,500 km³ (uncertainty range: 291,850–316,720 km³) of groundwater over North America. This represents our highest resolution estimate of accessible freshwater to date, supported by robust statistical performance. We calculate total and accessible groundwater storage, and results show that coarse resolution products are systematically biased in their estimates locally, where decisions are made, as well as at large scales. Our approaches are spatially extensive and locally relevant and thereby bridge a gap between remote sensing and point observations.

 Spatially explicit predictions of species distributions can inform ecosystem processes and conservation, particularly under global change. While imaging spectroscopy could enable accurate species classifications, accuracy generally declines outside training regions, limiting its utility for regional-scale mapping. To investigate mechanisms constraining classification generalizability (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, local adaptation), we used National Ecological Observatory Network Airborne Observation Platform imaging spectroscopy data collected across riparian systems in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. We extracted canopy spectral data of Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood), a foundation riparian tree known to form locally adapted ecotypes across its range, and spatially co-occurring species from seventeen 6 × 6 km sites. Combining this library with site-level environmental data, and support vector machine (SVM) models, we observed that environmental, not geographic, distance between training and test sites limited classification generalizability. Specifically, differences in mean annual temperature, winter precipitation, and spring precipitation, key drivers of local adaptation of P. fremontii, were associated with lower classification accuracy (∼50% lower). We then evaluated specific wavelength regions for improved generalizability. Classification models using only near-infrared (750–1400 nm) and shortwave infrared (1400–2500 nm) outperformed those using full-spectrum models in regions not represented in the training data, consistent with lower heritability in visible and red-edge wavelengths. In conclusion, spatially structured spectral phenotypes of P. fremontii, shaped by local adaptation and acclimation to environmental conditions, reduced species classification generalizability. By integrating ecology into remote sensing workflows, such as spectral band selection, we can improve species classification accuracy, thereby advancing scalable biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts."

 Accurate and updated maps of rubber plantations are beneficial to eco-environmental and socio-economic impact assessment and sustainable agroforestry management. However, existing remotely-sensed approaches to identifying rubber plantations primarily rely on phenological signals from time-series optical data, which are limited by persistent cloud cover, regional phenological variability or inconsistency, and high data demands. To address these challenges, here, we propose an innovative phenology-independent framework that integrates a rubber plantation index (RPI) with an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier. The RPI is a structure sensitive index derived from dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter (VV/VH) and Sentinel-2 SWIR reflectance (Band 11), capturing plantation regularity and canopy moisture characteristics. We evaluated the RPI-GMM framework across six diverse sample areas of rubber plots in tropics representing variations in phenology, topography, and plantation structure. Results demonstrated high classification accuracy, with F1 scores over 0.87 under both phenologically strong and weak conditions, as well as across mountainous and fragmented landscapes. Our RPI-GMM method achieved an overall accuracy of 87.0% in Laos, and estimated 234,206 ha of rubber plots in 2024. Spatial analysis revealed that approximately 70% of rubber plantations are located in Laotian border areas near China and Vietnam, 90% are situated at elevations below 1000 m, and 80% are found on slopes with gradients ranging from 3° to 16°. Notably, our simple and integrated method of RPI-GMM requires no temporal or labeled data, ensuring robustness, cost-efficiency, and transferability. The results highlight valuable insights of structure-based SAR-optical fusion for future global or tropical monitoring of tree-plantation dynamics and support broader applications in agroforestry management."

 Synoptic quantification of phytoplankton depth-integrated primary production (IPP) has advanced significantly over recent decades by leveraging satellite observations and sophisticated IPP models. However, monthly mean upstream products from polar-orbiting satellites, e.g., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are commonly used to generate IPP products, raising a concern about whether neglecting diurnal or daily IPP variabilities may compromise the accuracy of monthly- and annual-scale quantifications. Here, we aim to investigate this concern by comparing IPP quantified using high-frequency data at multiple timescales. A theoretical time-resolved model (TPM) was utilized for IPP modeling, driven by either diurnal photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 (H8) or daily PAR from MODIS. Preliminary evaluation against in situ measurements corroborated the superiority of AHI-based daily IPP estimation over MODIS, attributed to the robustness of AHI PAR data across varying sky conditions. Satellite IPP products were generated in the full-disk area of H8 between 2016 and 2019 under “daily-to-monthly-to-annual” (DtA) and “monthly-to-annual” (MtA) scenarios for comparison, using other requisite daily and gap-free biogeochemical products. Our analysis unveiled moderate spatiotemporal discrepancies between DtA-based IPP products from AHI and MODIS, confirming an overestimation in MODIS-derived monthly (< 8%) and annual total IPP (∼5%). In contrast, under the MtA scenario, MODIS substantially overestimated monthly (∼14–30%) and annual total IPP (∼20%) and gave biased temporal trends (∼1.3–1.6 times higher) compared to DtA-based IPP estimates of AHI. The discrepancies between IPP products were largely subject to the cloud-induced variabilities in daily PAR products and ocean color data coverage. By upscaling our results to the global ocean, it is anticipated that the annual total IPP previously estimated from MODIS with TPM-like models is overestimated by at least 19%. This study emphasizes the necessity of modeling IPP at finer timescales using high-frequency observations and provides insights for improving IPP quantification with the aid of geostationary satellites."

 Accurate mapping of forest (F) and non-forest (NF) areas is essential for ecological assessment, resource management, and deforestation monitoring. However, complex backgrounds, severe class imbalance and redundant features continue to limit the accuracy and efficiency of network segmentation. To overcome these issues, we present ForResANeXt, a novel semantic segmentation network that uses Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for forest/non-forest mapping. The model incorporates an AResCAB to enrich contextual feature representations while reducing redundancy and a lightweight embedded attention module to improve positional awareness. Furthermore, attention-gated skip connections suppress background noise and emphasize key spatial information, and a Focal Dice Loss function mitigates the impact of severe class imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate that ForResANeXt achieves a mIoU of 95.31%, surpassing U-Net and mainstream CNN variants in recall and F1 score for the minority non-forest class. It also outperforms several representative advanced CNN architectures and Transformer-based models in terms of Boundary IoU and Small Object Recall. Qualitative comparisons further confirm its superior capability in preserving structural details and delineating complex boundaries with reduced misclassification. Cross-regional transfer experiments validate the model’s robustness and generalization capability across diverse geographical and temporal conditions, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component. Overall, ForResANeXt shows great promise for efficient and accurate forest cover mapping using multispectral satellite data."

 Accurate individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation is essential for quantifying forest fine carbon stocks. However, deep learning segmentation methods face prohibitive annotation costs while unsupervised algorithms struggle in structurally complex forests. This study proposes a semi-supervised framework integrating unsupervised pseudo-label generation, deep instance segmentation, and staged fine-tuning to overcome these limitations. The framework transforms outputs from marker-controlled watershed (MCWS) and region-growing (itcSegment) algorithms into initial training targets to obtain generalizable instance segmentation representations, then refines Mask R-CNN models with minimal manual annotations to enhance structural awareness of instance boundaries and semantic context understanding, significantly reducing labeling dependency while improving robustness. Validated across three structurally heterogeneous Chinese fir stands spanning age (11–67 years), density (450–2500 stems·ha−1), and elevation (192–1047 m) gradients, our UAV RGB-based framework achieved consistent superiority over LiDAR and fused inputs, with spectral-textural features proving dominant for boundary delineation. It attained F1-scores of 0.826 (young, undulating terrain), 0.836 (mature, high-density), and 0.711 (over-mature, occluded) using only 40 % expert annotations (0.6 personnel-hours), representing a 0.42 average improvement over MCWS/itcSegment baselines. The designed staged fine-tuning strategy effectively mitigated pseudo-label error propagation, while expanding this annotation effort to 70–100 % yielded marginal accuracy gains, demonstrating exceptional efficiency in leveraging minimal supervision. Based on the segmented crowns, structural parameters were extracted with high fidelity: crown diameter (R2 ≥ 0.76, rRMSE ≤ 11.3 %) and crown area (R2 ≥ 0.88, rRMSE ≤ 16.4 %). This approach reduces annotation demands while maintaining robustness across forest heterogeneity, enabling operationally scalable solutions for precision forestry."

 As a common precursor to both fine particulates (PM2.5) and O3, ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) require accurate source tracing to enable targeted emission reductions. This study developed an enhanced source tracing framework integrating four key components: (1) gridded speciated sampling at 80 stations across the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, conducted from 2021 to 2023; (2) an optimized Positive Matrix Factorization model with source-specific species pairs and their initial ratios determined from a localized database to account for VOC photochemical aging; (3) a multi-site spatial aggregation weighted potential source contribution function for tracking emission hotspots; and (4) a novel method to quantitatively assess the influences of emission and meteorological condition on inter-campaign variability in VOC levels. Nine major VOC sources were identified, with solvent use (30.2 %), gasoline vehicle exhaust (16.7 %), and industrial process (12.3 %) being the dominant anthropogenic sources. Regionally, emission reductions were the primary driver of the declining contribution from gasoline vehicle exhaust. In contrast, meteorological conditions exhibited location- and campaign-specific impacts, and even counteracted emission-driven trends in some cases, especially in the coastal area such as Hong Kong. The surge in solvent use contributions across the PRD during Campaign 4 was mainly meteorology-driven, whereas Dongguan's spike was primarily emission-driven. Industrial process contributions showed a meteorology-driven bimodal pattern, exemplified by Hong Kong where upwind transport led to a 17.7-fold concentration increase during Campaign 2. This source tracing framework enables high-resolution mapping of VOC emission variations, thereby providing robust scientific support for formulating dynamic, location-specific VOC mitigation strategies."

 Sun–sky radiometer (model POM-01) is commonly used for studying aerosol optical and physical properties at selected aerosol-specific channels. Although the instrument is equipped with a precipitable water vapor (PWV) channel at 940 nm, the inbuilt software does not provide a tool for estimation of PWV. Hence, the current study adopted a new methodology to estimate PWV from three high-altitude (> 3400 m MSL) sites, Hanle, Merak, and Leh, located in Ladakh, India. The retrieval algorithm focuses on the precise estimation of the calibration constant (V0) and coefficients a and b using modified Langley plots in two different methods. The estimated average value of b is 0.59 ± 0.09 which is very close to those commonly used in global studies. Further, the estimated V0 and b values from both methods are found to be similar, which may be due to the advantages of the dry and high-altitude environment, where the annual total column water vapor is typically less than 6 mm. The estimated PWV using observations at selected full clear and stable atmospheric conditions compares well with satellite, AERONET, GPS, reanalysis and empirical model data with correlation coefficient varying from 0.91 to 0.97. Further, the estimated propagated root mean square error (rmse) varies from 0.37 mm to 2.58 mm. These results indicated that sun–sky radiometer derived PWV showed good consistency with the derived PWV from independent data sources at the three sites."

 The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 represented a unique opportunity to evaluate the way reduced traffic may influence air pollution levels. In the present study, this analysis is performed in the Veneto region, northeastern Italy, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, in the eastern Po Valley. During the first month of the COVID-19 lockdown period, the concentrations of fine particles (PM10) fell by 20–25% in the area, which corresponded to a 30–40% decrease in NO2 emissions, mostly attributed to lower traffic volumes.In order to understand if the specific atmospheric conditions of the period affected the decrease in PM10 concentration, meteorological data from ground stations and radio-soundings, together with ERA5 reanalysis data, were analysed to better define the role of meteorology in the reduced pollution concentrations. The analysis does not identify significant changes in the meteorological conditions.The improvement in the concentrations of PM10 during the lockdown period emphasizes the potential benefits of traffic reduction in achieving air quality goals. Unfortunately, current policy plans are insufficient, failing the 39% reduction in traffic emissions declared as necessary by the Veneto region to comply with EU standards. This consideration highlights the urgent need for significant changes in traffic management strategies in the region."

 Accurately monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations is essential for understanding the carbon cycle and formulating effective emission reduction policies. Although satellite remote sensing has achieved notable progress in retrieving column-averaged CO2 (XCO2), challenges such as data discontinuity and limited spatial resolution persist. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal reconstruction framework—GAM-Optuna-ERT—which integrates the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), and the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization tool Optuna. GAM captures the temporal and spatial variation trends of XCO2 and provides an initial background estimation; the ERT model effectively learns complex interactions among high-dimensional features to enhance prediction accuracy; Optuna automates hyperparameter tuning, thereby improving model robustness. Using OCO-2 satellite observations in conjunction with multi-source driving variables—including meteorological factors, vegetation indices, carbon emission inventories, and population density—we reconstruct monthly, seasonal, and annual XCO2 distributions over mainland China from 2015 to 2020 at a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°. Validation against TCCON, WDCGG, and CAMS datasets demonstrates the model's high accuracy and stability. Furthermore, quantitative analysis using the Geodetector method reveals that the synergistic effects of vegetation photosynthesis and anthropogenic activities are key drivers of the spatial heterogeneity in XCO2. This study provides a technical foundation for high-resolution XCO2 reconstruction and offers strong support for carbon monitoring and policymaking under China's “dual carbon” strategy."

DNA transposable elements could contribute to somatic genome rearrangements; however, their contributions to brain development are largely unknown. PiggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) is an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate DNA transposase–derived gene with DNA remodeling activities in human cells. Here, we show that PGBD5 contributes to normal brain development in mice and humans, and its deficiency causes disorder of intellectual disability, movement disorders, and epilepsy. In mice, Pgbd5 is required for the developmental induction of postmitotic DNA breaks and recurrent somatic brain genome rearrangements. In the cerebral cortex, loss of Pgbd5 leads to aberrant neuronal gene expression, including of specific types of glutamatergic neurons, which partly explains the features of PGBD5 deficiency in humans. Thus, PGBD5 is a transposase-derived gene required for brain development in mammals."

Here, we investigate the genetic basis of spinneret emergence in spiders by examining the complex history and functional importance of arachnid genome evolution. Using chromosome-scale genomes from newly sequenced spiders and the whip scorpion, we integrate evidence from macrosynteny and phylogenetic analyses to provide further strong support for a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event that occurred during early Arachnopulmonata evolution. Following this event, theabdominal-Agene pair not only exhibits functional divergence but also jointly facilitates the emergence of spinnerets. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell transcriptomic analyses and functional validation to confirm that thedachshund-1gene also regulates spinneret development. The network of duplicated gene pairs may form a cornerstone in the origin and evolution of key morphological traits, revealing that the long-term effects of ancient WGDs on innovation and diversification also occurred in arthropods."

However, it is not fully understood how cortical circuitry changes during adolescence. Here, we performed a comprehensive super-resolution mapping of dendritic spines in layer 5 extratelencepharic-projecting (L5 ET) neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex in mice. In adults, the dendritic spines are highly enriched in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites (spine density “hotspot”), where dendritic calcium spikes are generated. In early development, dendritic spines are evenly distributed. During adolescence, however, the spine density increases specifically in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites in an experience-dependent manner, while other dendritic compartments show a slight reduction. Furthermore, spine accumulation at the hotspot was specifically impaired in mouse models of schizophrenia, demonstrating a link between adolescent spine formation and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our finding suggests that the dendritic compartment-specific spine formation during adolescence shapes nonlinear dendritic integration in L5 ET neurons and supports the maturation of cognitive functions."

Here, we show size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements quantifying the hygroscopicity parameter in the presence and absence of a denuder. The denuder efficiently removed alkanes and weakly functionalized acids, aldehydes, and alcohols with fewer than 10 carbon atoms from the gas phase. Denuding organic compounds perturbed the CCN-derived hygroscopicity parameter by up to 50%. Denuding either rendered the particles more or less CCN active, and the direction of the effect depended on sample relative humidity and trace gas concentration. The effect was weakest in early spring and strongest in late spring and summer. The measurements demonstrate an unexpectedly strong coupling between the particle and gas phase, influencing CCN activity through either volatilization or surface adsorption, or both."

As a critical step, the rearrangement of short-range ordered aluminosilicate networks enriched with five-membered rings, coupled with geometric matching to the cylindrical micelles of the bolaform organic structure-directing agent, synergistically drives the development and closure of curvature-induced interfaces, ultimately leading to the formation of single-walled zeolitic nanotubes. The proposed mechanism provides a distinctive understanding into structure-directing behaviors for ordered porous materials. This study offers valuable insights for guiding the rational synthesis and precise property tuning of the single-walled zeolitic nanotube, which hold vast potential for applications in diverse fields."

Activation is achieved through the interaction of ToxR or TcpP with the α–C-terminal repeat domain of RNAP where a single residue of the activator, a phenylalanine, appears to be the most critical contact, as confirmed by mutagenesis. No interactions of the transcription factors were observed with other subunits of the RNAP, i.e., the σ subunit as it occurs in the structurally related PhoB family of two-component transcription factors.

Using ~450 ancient Asian genomes, we traced the most recent common ancestor of the Qiang to ancient Yellow River farmers ~5300 years ago, indicating shared ancestry with other Chinese populations. We identified several highly differentiated variants related to ethanol metabolism and pigmentation between Qiang subpopulations, which likely arose from joint effects of admixture and selection. Notably, a highly prevalent missense variant in a blood pressure regulation gene was detected, suggesting a potential role in altitude adaptation. Collectively, our findings illuminate the genetic history of the Qiang and highlight how admixture and selection shaped the diversity of Tibetan-Plateau fringe populations."

However, the regulatory role of PsAF5 in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the intracellular redox state has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we identify that specific cysteine residues in the FYVE domain of PsAF5 sense cellular redox states to form and resolve disulfide bonds in a redox-dependent manner. Under reducing conditions, PsAF5 undergoes redox-dependent phase separation to form cytoplasmic condensates that are functionally decoupled from mitophagy execution. Under oxidative conditions, PsAF5 exhibits increased cytosolic solubility and enhanced interaction with PsATG8, thereby promoting mitophagy.

In osteoarthritis (OA), the molecular weight (MW) of HA is reduced, which has been proposed to weaken the anchoring capacity of PL and impair lubrication. This study reveals a different mechanism by directly linking the MW to the structure of HA-PL (hybrid) assemblies and frictional properties. Using mixed-MW HA and PL to model this difference between healthy and OA synovial composition, we found interfacial lamellar structures form under healthy-like conditions, while hybrid vesicles predominate in OA-like conditions. At physiologically relevant shear rates, lamellar assemblies maintain ultralow friction, whereas vesicles are removed, causing a tenfold friction increase. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how HA-PL structural organization controls lubrication. While this simplified system does not capture the biochemical complexity of synovial fluid, this study advances understanding and offers a framework for designing structure-informed therapeutic strategies and biomimetic lubricants."

This study reveals a post-2000 intensification of winter ENSO’s impact on subsequent autumn LESS ice, driven by accelerated ENSO phase transitions compared to the pre-2000 era. Rapid phase transitions of El Niño after 2000 generate persistent cold anomalies in the tropical central–eastern Pacific during the subsequent autumn, strengthening and displacing the Western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) northward. This WNPAC triggers Rossby waves establishing an Arctic anticyclone, warming, and moistening the LESS atmosphere, thereby driving substantial ice loss. In contrast, pre-2000 slower El Niño decay exhibited weaker tropical-Arctic connectivity. These results identify ENSO phase transitions rate as a critical regulator of Arctic sea ice variability, with important implications for seasonal forecasting."

It enables real-time and in situ measurements of multimodal vascular characteristics including deep arterial pulsation, superficial capillary perfusion, relative blood flow velocity, skin temperature, and continuous blood pressure via data-efficient vascular feature extraction method. Imperceptible and comprehensive cardiovascular dynamics tracking by wearable electronics provides a promising avenue for advancing personal health care and clinic medicine."

Tran;Sun-Hye Jeong;Won-Ki Cho;Dae-Sik Lim,YAP/TAZ-VGLL3 governs adipocyte fate via epigenetic reprogramming of PPARγ and its target enhancers,"Adipocyte differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells is governed by tightly regulated transcriptional and epigenetic programs. The Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ impede this process, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate how YAP/TAZ regulate transcription of the adipocyte lineage specification factor PPARγ and its target genes at the chromatin level. TAZ represses PPARγ-bound target enhancers as evidenced by a markedly reduced histone H3 acetylated at lysine-27 occupancy, resulting in the transcriptional repression of adipogenic genes, includingPparg2. Single-nucleus genomic analyses of mouse adipose tissue further revealed that YAP/TAZ activation drives extensive epigenetic modulation. Notably, the repressive effect of TAZ on adipogenic enhancers requires TEAD-dependent transcriptional activity, but not a direct interaction with PPARγ through the WW domain as previously reported. Last, we identified Vestigial-like 3 (Vgll3) as a transcriptional target of TAZ critical for repressing adipogenic enhancers. These findings reveal that the YAP/TAZ-VGLL3 axis regulates adipocyte fate by repressing the PPARγ program at its target enhancers."

Elaborating molecule-level self-assembly via supramolecular engineering could generate performance materials that exhibit high strength at mild temperatures. However, the entropy penalty of assembled materials, meanwhile, compromises robustness at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report that simply replacing two carbons with disulfide bonds in poly(urea)s enables unprecedented structural reconfigurability without trading off material robustness. Introducing disulfide bonds maintains the ordered urea-based H-bond assembly in bulk polymers while simultaneously suppressing secondary crystallization of these H-bonded arrays and offering secondary H-bonding sites by forming S─S·H─N interactions. This two-atom structural change revitalizes semicrystalline homopoly(urea) materials by allowing chain mobility and reconfiguration below melting temperatures to enable thermoplastic-like (re)processability and thermoset-like robustness, including more than 2-gigapascal storage modulus, a broad creep-resistant temperature range (up to 150°C), ceramic-like hardness, and resistance to common solvents. Furthermore, these materials exhibit acid-catalyzed depolymerization potential, enabling closed-loop recyclability."

Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bound by the shot noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate–photon flux, high-sensitivity, quantum noise–squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5-decibel improvement beyond the shot noise limit in distinguishingl- andd-amino acids in liquid phase. This nondestructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis."

Westbrook;Eric Gouaux,Cryo-EM of autoantibody-bound NMDA receptors reveals antigenic hotspots in an active immunization model of anti-NMDAR encephalitis,"Autoantibodies targeting synaptic membrane proteins are associated with autoimmune encephalitis manifested by seizures, psychosis, and memory dysfunction. Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, a prototype of these autoimmune synaptic disorders, is unexpectedly common. Unfortunately, how the native repertoire of anti-NMDAR autoantibodies recognizes NMDARs and the precise locations of antigenic epitopes remain poorly understood. Here, we used an active immunization model that closely mimics the human disease to immunize adult mice with intact GluN1/GluN2A receptors, resulting in fulminant autoimmune encephalitis. Serum was collected at 6 weeks postimmunization for single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of GluN1/GluN2A receptors complexed with purified polyclonal anti-NMDAR autoantibody fragments. Native autoantibodies recognized two distinct binding sites on the GluN1 amino-terminal domain, which we confirmed using monoclonal antibodies bound to native NMDARs purified from mouse brain. Structural analysis of autoantibody-bound NMDAR complexes identified antigenic hotspots within the GluN1 amino-terminal domain. These hotspots provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

Traditional polymer-hydroxyapatite composites, typically limited up to 40 wt % hydroxyapatite, offer only modest mechanical improvements. Efforts to enhance strength by using stiffer polymers have largely failed, as increased polymer stiffness does not translate to improved composite mechanics. In contrast, natural bone’s load-bearing capability arises from the synergy between citrate, soft collagen, and ultrathin hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (~3 nanometers). Here, we show that elastic poly(octamethylene citrate) enables up to 60 wt % hydroxyapatite incorporation, mimicking the bone’s mineral content. Through a top-down “citrification” process and hot pressing, hydroxyapatite microparticles are partially dissolved and recrystallized into superthin (~5 nanometers) nanorods, enhancing organic-inorganic integration and replicating bone’s Ca/P ratios and architecture. The resulting composites exhibit compressive strengths exceeding 250 megapascals, unprecedented in polymer-mineral systems, offering a molecular design strategy for next-generation load-bearing orthopedic implants."

Unlike class I-III fusion proteins, vaccinia virus (VACV) uses a multicomponent entry fusion complex (EFC). Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the full-length structure of the VACV EFC at near-atomic resolution, revealing a 15-protein asymmetric assembly organized into three layers. The central A16/G9/J5 heterotrimer forms the fusion core, stabilized by conserved PXXCW and Delta motifs, and anchors two A28/H2 adaptor dimers linked to peripheral G3/L5/A21/O3 scaffolds. Structural and evolutionary analyses identify a conserved N-terminal domain in A16 containing a myristoyl-binding pocket and a phenylalanine-rich region that stabilizes the trimer and may regulate lipid engagement. An additional component, F9, binds peripherally to J5, A21, and H2 through Delta-like motifs, reinforcing the prefusion architecture. Together, these results define the VACV EFC as a unique multiprotein fusion machinery and provide a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of poxvirus entry and membrane fusion."

Anderson;Binzhi Xu;Katie Pham;Ritu Tiwari;Arnab Mukherjee,A programmable genetic platform for engineering noninvasive biosensors,"Creating genetic sensors for noninvasive visualization of biological activities in optically opaque tissues holds immense potential for basic research and the development of genetic and cell-based therapies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stands out among deep tissue imaging methods for its ability to generate high-resolution images without ionizing radiation. However, the adoption of MRI as a mainstream biomolecular technology has been hindered by the lack of adaptable methods to link molecular events with genetically encodable contrast. Here, we introduce modular aquaporin-based protease-activatable probes for enhanced reporting (MAPPER), a platform for the systematic creation of genetic sensors for MRI. To develop MAPPER, we engineered protease-activatable MRI reporters using two approaches: protein stabilization and subcellular trafficking. We established the applicability of MAPPER in distinct mammalian cell types and demonstrated its versatility by assembling genetic sensors for diverse targets without requiring extensive customization for each target. MAPPER provides a programmable platform for streamlining the development of noninvasive, nonionizing genetic sensors for biomedical research and in vivo diagnostics."

Here, we present an integrated suite of high-resolution bathymetry, subbottom profiles, and sediment cores from combined autonomous underwater vehicle, remotely operated vehicle, and ship-based studies at a key paleoseismic site in the southern Cascadia subduction zone. We demonstrate how widespread, earthquake-triggered landslides on the lower slope deposit discrete, proximal mass transport deposits (MTDs) that grade offshore into complex, interfingered abyssal turbidites, which correspond to records of megathrust earthquake history. We propose accretion and oversteepening of thrust folds on the lower slope both preconditions the slope to fail and provides a perpetual source of unstable material to fail during every earthquake cycle. Furthermore, we suggest the periodic and pervasive landsliding indicates coseismic deformation of the outer accretionary wedge during megathrust rupture."

Here, we identifiedDlx2as a key regulator that efficiently directed murine ESCs towardMsx1+ectomesenchyme, recapitulating the developmental trajectory. TheseMsx1+progenitors expressed classical craniofacial markers, exhibited robust osteochondral differentiation potential as a group, and supported craniofacial regeneration. Mechanistically, Distal-less homeobox 2 (DLX2) formed a complex with lamina-associated polypeptide 2, isoform alpha (LAP2α) through a 38–amino-acid homeodomain motif, interacting with nucleosomes to promote chromatin remodeling and activate a procraniofacial ectomesenchymal gene network. Disrupting DLX2-LAP2α interaction or silencingDlx2targets markedly diminished ectomesenchymal differentiation. Our findings established DLX2 as a pioneer factor in ectomesenchyme specification, offering insights into craniofacial development and stem cell engineering."
