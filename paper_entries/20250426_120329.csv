This paper evaluates the potential for Australia’s passenger and light commercial EV fleet to replace large-scale battery storage under a 100% renewable energy system in the National Electricity Market. By simulating various levels of V2G battery availability, we assess the impact on energy production costs, renewable energy capacity and storage needs in a grid that includes a fully electrified residential sector. Our results show that leveraging 10%–50% of the available V2G battery capacity can significantly lower grid storage costs while providing all the storage requirements needed for a full year of energy balancing. With infrastructure costs considerably lower than large-scale grid batteries, V2G presents a cost-effective path to decarbonisation. We also explore policy mechanisms, such as competitive V2G feed-in tariffs, to incentivise early adoption and promote large-scale EV participation in the energy market."

However, the effects of recently frequent variabilities in spring precipitation on ecosystem productivity are still unclear. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and gross primary productivity (GPP) in the spring, as well as the impact of spring excessive precipitation on GPP over dryland ecosystems in northern China, based on remote sensing datasets of precipitation and GPP at eight-day intervals from 2000 to 2018. We also assess the sensitivity and stability of GPP to spring excessive precipitation. Spring excessive precipitation had a unidirectional driving effect on vegetation growth and an evident lag effect of an eight-day period across more than 87% of the drylands in northern China. This indicates that dryland ecosystems in northern China respond quickly to excessive precipitation in the spring. Vegetation sensitivity to excessive precipitation is the weakest at an aridity index of around 0.1. Drylands with high temperatures and large precipitation exhibit positive sensitivity, strong resistance, and high resilience of vegetation to excessive precipitation. There is a synchronous change between the resistance and resilience of GPP to excessive precipitation. Our results provide an innovative understanding of the interaction mechanism between precipitation variations and dryland ecosystems, offering theoretical support for ecological restoration, sustainable development, and carbon neutrality in dryland regions."

Here we show that the decrease in OHC is primarily due to the local subsurface cooling at depths of approximately 60–400 m. The increasing cyclonic surface wind stress in the TIO has intensified Ekman pumping locally, thereby enhancing vertical cold advection through upwelling processes. We further show that while the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation can drive similar changes in OHC and patterns of subsurface temperature through changes in surface wind stress, its effect is confined to decadal timescales and therefore does not leave evident imprints on this long-term trend. This study highlights the crucial role of local air–sea interactions and related oceanic dynamical processes in shaping the regional climate change response."

Here, we analyze agricultural drought with a crop water stress index (CSI) that incorporates plant and soil characteristics and soil moisture. The new index is evaluated against other standardized meteorological drought indices, such as the standardized precipitation index and the standardized soil moisture index. The results show substantial differences between the standardized indices and the CSI. To study future drought patterns, we use multiple future scenarios simulated by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. In contrast to the standardized indices, the results of the CSI show an improvement in the future global mean drought conditions due to a greater increase in mean wet than dry conditions governed by soil moisture and precipitation, while both dry and wet extreme conditions increase in intensity. Nonetheless, the results suggest large cropland areas will be subject to intense drought conditions under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP-1.19 to SSP-5.85. Such drought assessment can only be supported by using more complex drought indices. Our results emphasize the importance of combining plant and soil information with standardized indices in the assessment of drought-driven crop stress under climate change aiding effective policy formulation."
10.1088/1748-9326/adcd88,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注南美洲东南部农业闪电干旱的特征及其对大豆和玉米产量的影响。它使用ERA5数据分析了干旱的频率、持续时间、强度、趋势和生命周期，并评估了干旱对作物产量的影响。虽然研究使用了气候数据，但其重点在于农业干旱和作物影响，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['drought', 'crop yield', 'land-atmosphere interaction', 'ERA5 data']",Miguel A Lovino;M Josefina Pierrestegui;Lumila Masaro;Omar V Müller;Gabriela V Müller;Ernesto H Berbery,Agricultural flash droughts and their impact on crop yields in southeastern South America,"This study investigates the characteristics of agricultural flash droughts (AFDs) and their impacts on critical growth periods of soybean and corn in southeastern South America (SESA). Using ERA5 data from 1960 to 2022, we examine AFD frequency, duration, intensity, trends, seasonality, life cycle, and the influence of land–atmosphere interactions. Historical crop data, spanning different time periods across SESA countries, are analyzed to assess how the spatiotemporal evolution and varying life cycles of AFDs affect crop yields. The highest AFD frequencies (3–8 events per decade) occur in the central portion of SESA. These rapidly intensifying events often evolve into seasonal droughts lasting 1.5–3 months. Although area-averaged AFD frequency shows no significant change in central SESA, positive trends are noticeable in southern Brazil and Uruguay. Towards the north of SESA, AFDs are less frequent, with 1–3 episodes per decade, although the frequency has significantly increased since 1970. AFDs tend to last over 3 months and reach higher intensity. Land–atmosphere feedback mechanisms are reflected in high positive vapor pressure deficit and temperature anomalies that exacerbate soil moisture deficits despite a relatively stable precipitation deficit, accelerating AFD intensification periods. AFDs typically impact smaller areas, while slow-evolving droughts affect larger regions. However, AFDs’ timing during the critical growth periods of the crops can lead to substantial yield losses. In central SESA, AFDs mainly occur between November and January, affecting both crops during their flowering and grain filling in December and January. In northern SESA, AFDs occur later, from February to April, primarily impacting second-season corn. The overall impact on crop yields depends on the duration, spatial extent, and intensity of the drought after its intensification."

McCoy;Trude Eidhammer;Andrew Gettelman;Ci Song;Hamish Gordon;Isabel L. McCoy,Constraining aerosol–cloud adjustments by uniting surface observations with a perturbed parameter ensemble,"Whether increased aerosol increases or decreases liquid cloud mass has been a longstanding question. Observed correlations suggest that aerosols thin liquid cloud, but we are able to show that observations were consistent with an increase in liquid cloud in response to aerosols by leveraging a model where causality could be traced. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are the largest source of uncertainty in inferring the magnitude of future warming consistent with the observational record. The effective radiative forcing due to ACI (ERFaci) is dominated by liquid clouds and is composed of two terms: the change in cloud albedo due to redistributing liquid over a larger number of cloud droplets (Nd) and the change in cloud macrophysical properties due to changes in cloud microphysics. These terms are, respectively, referred to as the radiative forcing due to ACI (RFaci) and aerosol–cloud adjustments. While the magnitude of RFaci is uncertain, its sign is confidently negative and results in a cooling in the historical record. In contrast, the adjustment of cloud liquid water path (LWP) to enhanced Nd and associated radiative forcing is uncertain in sign. Increased LWP in response to increased Nd is consistent with precipitation suppression, while decreased LWP in response to increased Nd is consistent with enhanced evaporation from cloud top. Observational constraints of these processes are poor in part because of causal ambiguity in the relationship between Nd and LWP. To better understand this relationship, precipitation (P), Nd, and LWP surface observations from the Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) atmospheric observatory are combined with the output from a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) hosted in the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). This allows for causal interpretation of observed covariability. Observations of precipitation and cloud from ENA constrain the range of possible LWP aerosol–cloud adjustments relative to the prior from the PPE by 15 %, resulting in a global value that is confidently positive (a historical cooling) ranging from 2.1 to 6.9 g m−2. It is found that observed covariability between Nd and LWP is dominated by coalescence scavenging and that this observed covariability is not strongly related to aerosol–cloud adjustments."

A multi-source Gaussian plume model, combined with a genetic algorithm inversion framework, was used to locate major CH4 sources at the plant and quantify emissions. Results indicate that the summer CH4 emissions (603.33 ± 152.66 t a-1) were 2.8 times as high as inventory values, and winter values (418.95 ± 187.59 t a-1) were twice as high. The main sources were the screen and primary clarifier. 
 Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are substantial contributors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of the high production of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). A typical WWTP complex contains multiple functional areas that are potential sources of GHG emissions. Accurately quantifying GHG emissions from these sources is challenging due to the inaccuracy of activity data, the ambiguity of emission sources, and the absence of monitoring standards. Locating and quantifying WWTP emission sources using a measurement-based GHG emission  quantification method is crucial for evaluating and improving traditional emission inventories. In this study, CH4 mobile measurements were conducted within a WWTP complex in the summer and winter of 2023. We utilized a multi-source Gaussian plume model combined with a genetic algorithm inversion framework, designed to locate major sources within the plant and quantify the corresponding CH4 emission fluxes. We identified 13 main sources in the plant and estimated plant-scale CH4 emission fluxes of 68.78±17.40kgh-1 (603.33±152.66ta-1) for the summer and 47.76±21.39kgh-1 (418.95±187.59ta-1) for the winter. The predominant sources of CH4 emissions were the screen and primary clarifier, contributing 55 % and 67 % to the total emissions in summer and winter, respectively. The comparison revealed that summer CH4 emissions were 2.8 times higher than inventory estimates, while winter emissions were twice the inventory values. This study demonstrated that mobile measurements, combined with the multi-source Gaussian plume inversion framework, are a powerful tool to locate and quantify GHG sources at a complex site, with the potential for further refinement to accommodate different types of factories and gas species."

Kulawik;Hironobu Iwabuchi,Mitigation of satellite OCO-2 CO2 biases in the vicinity of clouds with 3D calculations using the Education and Research 3D Radiative Transfer Toolbox (EaR3T),"CO2 column-averaged dry-air mole fractions can be retrieved from space using spectrometers like OCO-2. However, nearby clouds induce spectral distortions that bias these retrievals beyond the accuracy needed for global CO2 source and sink assessments. This study employs a physics-based linearization approach to represent 3D cloud effects and introduces radiance-level mitigation techniques for actual OCO-2 data, enabling the operational implementation of these corrections. 
 Accurate and continuous measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are essential for climate change research and monitoring of emission reduction efforts. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2 and 3) satellites have been deployed to infer the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mixing ratio (XCO2) from passive spectroscopy, with a designed uncertainty of less than 1 ppm for the regional average. This accuracy is often not met in cloudy regions because clouds in the vicinity of a footprint introduce biases in the XCO2 retrievals. These arise from limitations in the one-dimensional (1D) forward radiative transfer (RT) model, which does not capture the spectral radiance perturbations introduced by clouds adjacent to a clear footprint. Our paper introduces a three-dimensional (3D) RT pipeline to explicitly account for these effects in real-world satellite observations. This is done by ingesting collocated imagery and reanalysis products to calculate the cloud-induced perturbations at the footprint level. To make that computationally feasible, a simple approximation for their spectral dependence is used. The calculated perturbations are then used to reverse (undo) the cloud vicinity effects at the radiance level, at which point the standard 1D OCO-2 retrieval code can be applied without modifications. For two cases over land, we demonstrate that this approach indeed reduces the XCO2 anomalies near clouds. We also characterize the dependence of the XCO2 footprint-level bias on the distance from clouds and other key scene parameters, such as surface reflectance. Although this dependence may be specific to cloud type, aerosols, and other factors, we illustrate how it could be parameterized to bypass our physics-based 3D-RT pipeline for use in an operational framework. In the future, we intend to explore this possibility by applying our tool to a variety of scenes over land and ocean."

Through a modified two-wavelength Klett inversion method, we assess the vertical distribution and temporal evolution of Saharan dust, volcanic aerosols and wildfire smoke in the subtropical North Atlantic from August 2021 to August 2023. The study confirms the CE376 lidar's effectiveness in monitoring and characterizing atmospheric aerosols over time. 
 We present a comprehensive characterization of the optical properties of various aerosol types based on data collected using a compact dual-wavelength depolarization elastic lidar (532 and 808 nm, CIMEL CE376). This study evaluates the vertical distribution and temporal evolution of aerosols observed in the subtropical North Atlantic region, covering Saharan dust, volcanic aerosols, and fresh and aged wildfire plumes. Measurements were conducted between August 2021 and August 2023, using a modified two-wavelength Klett inversion method to derive the aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficients from CE376 lidar measurements. To assess the performance of the CE376 system, an intercomparison campaign with an MPL-4B lidar (MPLNET) was conducted, with both systems were collocated at the Izaña Atmospheric Research Centre (Canary Islands, Spain). Both instruments depicted the vertical aerosol structure similarly. Discrepancies were primarily attributed to errors in determining the overlap function and depolarization calibration in each instrument, as well as the greater influence of solar background radiation on the CE376 system during daylight. The absolute difference in the volume depolarization ratio (δv) was 0.003, which decreased to 0.002 when only nighttime data were analyzed. The combination of the two channels of the CE376 provided valuable insights into particle linear depolarization (δP), extinction Ångström exponent (EAE (532/808)) and attenuated color ratio (ACR (808/532)). Fresh Saharan dust particles, characterized by large, non-spherical morphology and a well-mixed vertical layer, exhibited the lowest EAE (532/808), the highest ACR (808/532) and δP (532) >0.15. In contrast, smaller particles with quasi-homogeneous morphology were attributed to sulfate aerosols from the early stages of the Cumbre Vieja volcano eruption and aged Canadian wildfire plumes traveling across the Atlantic. These aerosols showed the lowest δP (0.03 for volcanic sulfate and 0.08 for aged wildfire aerosols) and the highest EAE (532/808) (1.5 and 1.2, respectively). Intermediate values of these retrieved parameters were associated with a heterogenous mixture of ash, soot and charred vegetation from fresh local forest wildfires. The retrieved properties underscore the suitability of the CE376 micro-lidar for continuous monitoring and characterization of the temporal and vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols."

Results reveal that nocturnal low-level jets are most frequent in spring and intensify in summer, significantly enhancing turbulence and shear near the surface, particularly at night. Additionally, cloud cover raises the mixing layer height by approximately 100 m at night due to the greenhouse effect but reduces it by up to 200 m in the afternoon. 
 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) dynamics play a critical role in shaping urban atmospheric processes by governing the exchange of energy, momentum, and mass within the lower atmosphere. This study investigates PBL dynamics in Hefei, a city in the western Yangtze River Delta (YRD), using 3 years (June 2019 to June 2022) of Doppler wind lidar data. Seasonal and diurnal variations in key parameters, including wind profiles, shear intensity, turbulent mixing, low-level jets (LLJs), and mixing layer height (MLH), are analyzed. Results show that horizontal wind speeds accelerate more rapidly above 3 km with the predominant westerly winds (270°±15°) in all seasons. The vertical depth of the high-wind zone (>8 m s−1) during the day is found to be generally deeper than at night, particularly in winter. In Hefei, LLJs primarily form at sunset and dissipate by noon, typically at altitudes between 0.5 and 0.6 km throughout the year, except in July. LLJ occurrences are the most frequent in spring (31.7 %), followed by summer (24.7 %), autumn (22.3 %), and winter (21.3 %). Summer LLJs are the most intensified, extending up to 1.5 km. The larger wind gradient below the jets significantly enhances turbulence and shear intensity near the ground at night. The seasonal average MLH peaks between 14:00  and 15:00 UTC+8, reaching approximately 1.2 km in spring and summer. Cloud cover raises MLH by about 100 m at night but decreases it by 200 m at the afternoon peak. This study provides insights into lidar-based PBL dynamics and highlights implications for local standards concerning low-altitude economic activities."

 Using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day–night band (DNB), we examined the feasibility of developing a gridded nighttime aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data set based on the spatial derivative of measured top-of-atmosphere attenuated upwelling artificial lights at night (ALAN) over the US, Middle East, and Indian Subcontinent regions for 2017. We also studied the potential of using NASA's standard operational Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) for estimating the spatial derivatives of surface artificial-light emissions, which is one of the key lower boundary conditions for the retrieval process. The sensitivity of nighttime aerosol retrievals to observing conditions and different methods of estimating the spatial derivative of surface artificial-light emissions were also explored. Root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of ∼ 0.15 and ∼ 0.18 and correlations of ∼ 0.8 and ∼ 0.6 were found between VIIRS nighttime AOT and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) nighttime and daytime data, respectively, suggesting that the proposed gridded nighttime AOT retrievals have reasonable skill levels for potential data assimilation, air quality, and climate studies of significant events. We also found that NASA Black Marble products can be used to estimate the spatial derivative of surface artificial-light emissions for nighttime AOT retrievals over regions that are not frequently contaminated by aerosol plumes, such as the USA. This study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing a gridded nighttime AOT data, using artificial lights, for monitoring of nighttime aerosol events over large spatial and temporal domains. Given the deployment of VIIRS instruments (currently in orbit and forthcoming) aboard the NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series satellites, this study can be viewed as a precursor for gridded nighttime AOT retrievals at both regional and global scales in the future. We also show that the use of the NASA Black Marble products, which would greatly save the processing time of this method, is challenging over regions with frequent aerosol pollution, such as the Indian Subcontinent, and further exploration is required."

The deuterated α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2 were proven as effective surrogates in tracing these losses for some key monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The findings highlight the importance of selecting internal surrogates that closely match the adsorptive and reactive behaviors of target compounds for precise loss correction. 
 Accurately measuring the emissions of monoterpenes (MTs) and sesquiterpenes (SQTs) using dynamic chambers requires careful consideration of their adsorptive and reactive losses, which are often overlooked and difficult to assess in situ. This study evaluated the effectiveness of deuterated surrogates, α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, in tracing these losses in a dynamic chamber system. Using standard gas mixtures of 10 MTs and 10 SQTs, we characterized adsorptive losses across varying concentrations, temperatures, and humidity levels, as well as reactive losses with ozone. Results indicated that adsorptive losses were significantly influenced by concentration and temperature, with species-specific variations particularly under low concentrations and low temperatures, while relative humidity had negligible impact. Reactive losses with ozone exhibited substantial species-specific variability. Key MTs (α-pinene, β-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, and 1,8-cineole) and SQTs (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene) demonstrated consistent adsorptive and reactive behaviors with their respective deuterated surrogates α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, suggesting that these surrogates are effective for correcting losses with in situ emission measurements using dynamic chambers. However, due to varied adsorptive and reactive losses, additional deuterated MTs and SQTs are recommended, particularly selected according to their O3 reactivities, to cover a broader range of MTs and SQTs for loss correction. A strong correlation between adsorptive capacity and ozone reactivity was observed, underscoring the need to carefully address losses of highly reactive MTs and SQTs during emission measurements. This study also emphasizes that ozone-free circulating air should be used for accurately measuring emissions of highly reactive SQTs, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, especially when loss correction methods are unavailable."

However, mooring losses or instrument failures often result in data gaps. A gap-filled time series dataset of a shelf mooring array off the Western Australian coast is created using a machine learning tool to fill the data gaps. The gap-filled data show consistency with observations and can be used to characterize marine heat waves and cold spells influenced by ocean boundary currents. 
 Coastal moorings allow scientists to collect long-term datasets that are valuable in understanding shelf dynamics, detecting climate variability and changes, and evaluating shelf dynamics and climate variability and change impacts on marine ecosystems. However, we often cannot obtain continuous time series data from moorings due to mooring losses or instrument failures. Here, we present an updated version of the 14-year sub-surface mooring dataset off the south-western coast of Western Australia (WA) during 2010–2023 (https://doi.org/10.25919/myac-yx60, Bui and Feng, 2024). This updated dataset offers continuous daily temperature and current data with a 5 m vertical resolution, collected from six coastal Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) moorings at depths between 48  and 500 m. The self-organizing map (SOM) machine learning technique is applied to fill in the data gaps in the previous version. The data capture the Leeuwin Current variability on the shelf from intraseasonal to interannual timescales. The data also capture the variability of the Capes Current, a wind-driven northward current on the middle shelf. The usage of the in-filled data product is demonstrated by detecting extreme temperature events on the Rottnest Shelf. The data products can be used to characterize sub-surface features of extreme events such as marine heat waves and marine cold spells, which are influenced by the Leeuwin Current and the wind-driven Capes Current, and to detect decadal change signals along the WA coast."

It covers eight agricultural regions across four seasons in China, offering extensive spatiotemporal coverage and fine-grained annotations. This dataset fills the gap in remote sensing image-text datasets for farmland, alleviates the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in farmland segmentation, and provides valuable data to support large-scale farmland monitoring and mapping. 
 Understanding and mastering the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland is essential for accurate farmland segmentation. The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment. It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language, as a structured knowledge carrier, can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution, and surrounding environmental information. Therefore, a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland. However, in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland, there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction. To fill this gap, we introduced language-based descriptions of farmland and developed FarmSeg-VL dataset—the first fine-grained image-text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation. Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign caption to each image, ensuring high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction. Secondly, the FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics. In terms of the temporal dimension, it covers all four seasons. In terms of the spatial dimension, it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China, with a total area of approximately 4,300 km2. In addition, in terms of captions, FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, including its inherent properties, phenological characteristics, spatial distribution, topographic and geomorphic features, and the distribution of surrounding environments. Finally, we present a performance analysis of vision language models and the deep learning models that rely solely on labels trained on the FarmSeg-VL, demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation.

With the advancement of technology, more high-precision instruments have been employed to monitor the entire process of debris flows. This paper presents a unique and comprehensive dataset of debris flow and hydrometeorological observations collected over a 64-year period (1961–2024) at Jiangjia Ravine, China.

It also incorporates the induced seismic data, providing insights into the dynamic characteristics of debris flows. Furthermore, it includes continuous records of rainfall at minute intervals, soil moisture, and suspended sediment concentrations at the catchment scale. This extensive dataset provides invaluable insights into the initiation, transportation, and deposition processes of debris flows. It can be utilized to analyze flow resistance and dynamic characteristics of debris flows, to validate various computational models, to investigate the effects of debris flows on channel morphology, and evaluate the impact of climate change on sediment transport within watersheds.

Key reasons include different coverage of gases and sectors, varying definitions of anthropogenic land use change emissions, and the Paris Agreement not covering all emission sources. The study highlights three main ways emissions data is reported, each with different objectives and resulting in varying global emission totals. It emphasizes the need for transparency in choosing datasets and setting assessment scopes. 
 We examine differences in global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates and highlight the important role of varying system boundaries and conceptual approaches in driving these variations. Despite consensus among assessments and datasets that GHG emissions continue to increase and are far from aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, estimates can differ significantly. Our review finds three main reasons for these differences. First, datasets vary in their coverage of gases, sectors and countries; second, there are different approaches to defining ‘anthropogenic’ emissions and removals in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector; and third, the Paris Agreement doesn’t cover all relevant sources of emissions, including the cement carbonation sink and ozone depleting substances. As different assessments have different objectives, they may deal with these issues differently. We highlight three assessment conventions that report or use emissions data: those focused on interpreting national progress, policies and pledges under the Paris Agreement; those consistent with integrated assessment modelling (IAM) benchmarks of emissions under different warming scenarios; and those consistent with climate forcing assessments. Considering annual average emissions over the period 2014 to 2023, we show global totals of 44.7 GtCO2e yr-1 [90 % CI ± 4.6], 53.1 GtCO2e yr-1 [90 % CI ± 5.2], and 54.9 GtCO2e yr-1 [90 % CI ± 5.2] for these three conventions, respectively.

In this study, we develop and apply a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system to a coupled climate model. The WCODA system improves simulations of ocean temperature and salinity across many global regions. This system is meant to advance our understanding of the ocean's role in climate predictability. 
 The development, implementation, and evaluation of a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system for the fully coupled Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) utilizing the four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar) method are presented in this study. The 4DEnVar method, based on the dimension-reduced projection four-dimensional variational (DRP-4DVar) approach, replaces the adjoint model with the ensemble technique, thereby reducing computational demands. Monthly mean ocean temperature and salinity data from the EN4.2.1 reanalysis are integrated into the ocean component of E3SMv2 from 1950 to 2021 with the goal of providing realistic initial conditions for decadal predictions and predictability studies. The performance of the WCODA system is assessed using various metrics, including the reduction rate of the cost function, root mean square error (RMSE) differences, correlation differences, and model biases. Results indicate that the WCODA system effectively assimilates the reanalysis data into the climate model, consistently achieving negative reduction rates of the cost function and notable improvements in RMSE and correlation across various ocean layers and regions. Significant enhancements are observed in the upper ocean layers across the majority of global ocean regions, particularly in the north Atlantic, north Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Model biases in sea surface temperature and salinity are also substantially reduced. For sea surface temperature, cold biases in the north Pacific and north Atlantic are diminished by about 1–2 °C, and warm biases in the Southern Ocean are corrected by approximately 1.5–2.5 °C. In terms of salinity, improvements are observed with bias reductions of about 0.5–1 psu in the north Atlantic and north Pacific and up to 1.5 psu in parts of the Southern Ocean. The ultimate goal of the WCODA system is to advance the predictive capabilities of E3SM for subseasonal to decadal climate predictions, thereby supporting research on strategic energy-sector policies and planning."

Results show that our method can accurately recover evolution details superior to other methods, reaching 53.7 % in the restoration rate. Our findings are important for advancing weather forecasting models and enabling more precise and reliable predictions to support disaster preparedness, agriculture, and sustainable development. 
 Numerical forecast products with high temporal resolution are crucial tools in atmospheric studies, allowing for accurate identification of rapid transitions and subtle changes that may be missed by lower-resolution data. However, the acquisition of high-resolution data is limited due to excessive computational demands and substantial storage needs in numerical models. Current deep learning methods for statistical downscaling still require massive ground truth with high temporal resolution for model training. In this paper, we present a self-supervised framework for downscaling atmospheric variables at arbitrary time resolutions by imposing a temporal coherence constraint. Firstly, we construct an encoder–decoder-structured temporal downscaling network and then pretrain this downscaling network on a subset of data that exhibit rapid transitions and are filtered out based on a composite index. Subsequently, this pretrained network is utilized to downscale the fields from adjacent time periods and generate the field at the middle time point. By leveraging the temporal coherence inherent in meteorological variables, the network is further trained based on the difference between the generated field and the actual middle field. To track the evolving trends in meteorological system movements, a flow estimation module is designed to assist with generating interpolated fields. Results show that our method can accurately recover evolution details superior to other methods, reaching 53.7 % in the restoration rate on the test set. In addition, to avoid generating abnormal values and to guide the model out of local optima, two regularization terms are integrated into the loss function to enforce spatial and temporal continuity, which further improves the performance by 7.6 %."

Subsequently, zebrafish embryos were exposed to BTBPE, an LXR antagonist (GSK2033), or coexposed to BTBPE with an LXR agonist (GW3965) for 120 h postfertilization (hpf). The results showed that BTBPE induced reduction in body weight and lipid levels, likely via inhibition of the LXR signaling pathway. Exposure of adult female zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentrations of BTBPE (0.01–10 μg/L) for 28 days induced developmental toxicity, evidenced by decreases in body weight, growth rate, and fat accumulation. Metabolomic analysis revealed that BTBPE-induced alterations in liver metabolites were primarily associated with LXR-mediated lipid metabolic pathways such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Additionally, BTBPE impaired the physical barrier and induced inflammation, resulting in gut microbiota dysbiosis, which is potentially linked to LXR activation. These effects were validated through the alterations of multiple biomarkers at various levels.

Turtles were randomly divided into four groups based on constant temperature at 28 °C and heatwave exposure, as well as whether they were infected with bacteria (Bacillus cereus). Principal component analysis-based cell clustering revealed that the 14 cell clusters were classified into seven distinct cell types: erythrocytes, monocytes, thrombocytes, T cells, B cells, basophils, and heterophils. All cell types participated in the host immune response to heatwaves and bacterial infection, but these cells exhibited significant group-specific differences in their gene expression patterns. Bacterial infections and heatwaves altered turtle behavior and physiology indexes.

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the interactions between polystyrene (PS) NPs (50 and 100 nm) and PS-MPs (200 and 500 nm) with taro (Colocasia esculenta). We found that PS particles of varying sizes exhibited differential root adsorption and penetration, with PS-NPs capable of penetrating the root epidermis, whereas PS-MPs were totally excluded. Notably, taro demonstrated the capacity to recognize different sizes of N/MPs and responded with varying degrees of resistance. In reaction to the more toxic and penetrating 50 nm PS-NPs, the roots mobilized a robust defense mechanism with three levels: molecular, compositional, and ultrastructural. This defense was achieved by activating lignin synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid transport, resulting in a doubling of the lignified region of the root and increases in cell wall thickness of 116%, 56.3%, and 22.5% in the epidermis, exodermis, and cortex, respectively. Consequently, roots excluded all four sizes of N/MPs outside the vascular tissue and prevented the contamination of the corms.

However, the effect of Mn oxide reduction in the Mn/Fe cycle on Tl mobilization is not clear. Herein, the influence of Mn oxide configuration, oxygen environment, and degree of reduction on MnO2 transformation and associated Tl species distribution is investigated. In oxic environments, both typical δ-MnO2 and α-MnO2 structures (i.e., layered and tunneled, respectively) can immobilize Tl(I) for a long time. In mild-to-moderate reducing anoxic environments, the drastic reductive transformation of δ-MnO2 results in Tl binding, mainly in an exchangeable form. In highly reducing environments, δ-MnO2 or α-MnO2 is converted to Manganite, resulting in the release of more Tl. Tl-LIII edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates that oxidized Tl(III) (54–62%) is converted to structural Tl(I) (67–80%) and bound to interlayer/tunnel centers during the reductive transformation of MnO2, which enhances Tl exchange in δ-MnO2 and leads to Tl immobilization in α-MnO2. Our results show that anoxic Tl(I)-/Mn(II)-/Fe(II)-induced MnO2 transformation can enhance Tl mobilization, and tunneled MnO2 may have a more sustainable Tl immobilization potential than layered MnO2, which improves the general understanding of the geochemical behavior of Tl in different Mn-related reducing environments."

The SPME blades, employed to enhance sensitivity in place of standard SPME fibers, incorporate a matrix-compatible coating material that enables effective PFAS screening in water as well as complex matrices including blood, beer, and beef. In addition, significantly low recovery and reproducibility of nonpolar PFAS in water analysis have been found and studied, indicating that using a glass container and adding a small percentage of acetonitrile can address this issue."

This study presents analyzed results of micro-/nanoplastics collected from Shanghai’s winter atmosphere using thermal desorption/pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Six major plastic types were identified, with polyethylene (PE) accounting for 40.0% of the detected atmospheric plastics. Fine plastic particles (FPPs, ≤3.2 μm) constituted 59.2% of the total mass concentration of microplastics (MPs), while nanoplastics (NPs, ≤1.0 μm) accounted for 36.3%. As the aerodynamic particle size decreased, the proportion of plastics other than PE increased. This size-dependent compositional variation suggests that nanoplastics, due to their smaller size, can more easily penetrate sensitive biological regions. At the nanoscale, the accumulated mass in pulmonary regions exceeds that in the head airway. These findings underscore the critical need for detailed assessments of plastic characteristics in the atmosphere to better understand their environmental behavior and potential health impacts."

In this study, it was found that intermittent microaeration (IMA) supplied to an anaerobic digester could oxidize Fe(II) produced by dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) to form a Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle and generate extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to improve anaerobic treatment of phenol-containing wastewater. The results showed that compared to the control group without IMA, the removal rates of COD and phenol increased by 29.54 and 49.68 percentage points, respectively, and daily average methane production increased by 85.44%. The Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle slowed down the loss of iron (13.97%) released from sludge due to the lower solubility of Fe(III) and facilitated •OH generation (1.22 ± 0.04 μM) via Fenton-like reactions. The DIR and the generation of •OH accelerated phenol degradation. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the abundance of methanogens and antioxidant enzymes-encoding genes in response to oxidative stress significantly increased in the IMA group compared to the control, enabling methanogenesis to proceed smoothly under microaeration. This study investigated the extracellular ROS generation induced by microaeration during anaerobic digestion and their roles in promoting anaerobic performance, thereby providing a new perspective for optimizing anaerobic systems with microaeration."

Most PFAS in AFFFs are fluorosurfactants, known to self-assemble into large supramolecular assemblies in the field of physical chemistry; however, the application of this phenomenon to understanding environmental fate has not been studied. We hypothesize that self-assembled PFAS likely enhance the long-term retention of PFAS in subsurface environments, acting as a continuous source of dissolved PFAS. Thus, characterizing these self-assemblies and understanding their aggregation dynamics are crucial for assessing the  fate and transport of PFAS. Despite the utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in studying surfactant behaviors, fluorosurfactants have been underexplored due to the lack of force field parameters. In this study, we developed coarse-grained (CG) force field parameters for fluorosurfactants based on the Martini 3 model and performed CG-MD simulations. These “computational microscope” simulations reveal the self-assembly behavior of selected PFAS, aligning with experimental cryo-transmission electron microscopy observations and providing mechanistic insights. Our work sheds light on the evolution of solvated PFAS self-assemblies over time and space. The CG-MD simulation can particularly address the knowledge gaps for new PFAS that are difficult to explore experimentally due to the lack of chemical standards."

Extensively studied in water environments, they are still poorly investigated in atmospheric aerosols and only in midlatitude anthropized countries. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the evidence of 12 brominated, chlorinated, and iodinated-acetic acids in the Arctic particulate matter. This paper had three main goals: 1) to evaluate the occurrence of the 12 haloacetic acids in the Arctic atmospheric aerosol, 2) to identify their possible sources, and 3) to understand their transport patterns. Samples were collected in Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard Islands, Norwegian Arctic) during an entire sampling year, starting from February 2022 to March 2023. Trace concentrations of these species were determined using a high pressure anion exchange coupled with a triple quadrupole, defining the monohaloacetic acids as the most ubiquitous compounds. In particular, the most abundant species was monochloroacetic acid with a mean concentration of 35 ± 32 pg m–3. The statistical approach was applied to accomplish our goals: it highlighted the long-range transports and therefore anthropogenic input as the most important contribution for the investigated species.

Despite studies examining the spatial distribution of such events, there has been little work in examining if all relevant life threatening and damaging hazards are captured in existing hazard databases and by common hazard metrics. For example, local/regional flash flooding events are seldom captured by optical satellite instruments and are subsequently excluded from global hazard databases. Similarly, the heat hazard definitions most frequently used in multi‐hazard studies inherently fail to capture events that are life‐threatening but climatologically within an expected range. Our goal is to determine the potential for increasing multi‐hazard event detection capabilities by inferring additional hazard footprints from widely accessible satellite data. We use daily precipitation and temperature satellite data to develop an open‐source framework that infers additional hazard footprints that are not included in traditional methods. With the state of Texas as our study area, we detected 2.5 times as many flood hazards, equivalent to $320 million in property and crop damages. Furthermore, our expanded heat hazard definition increases the impacted area by 56.6%, equivalent to 91.5 million km2 ${\text{km}}^{2}$ over an 18 year period. Increasing hazard detection capabilities and expanding existing definitions of hazards using daily satellite data increases the temporal and spatial resolutions at which multi‐hazard events are detected.

To understand this volcanic history, we developed a 2‐D numerical model of magmatism and mantle convection; the effects of the PKT on lunar evolution are considered by initially imposing a region of localized radioactive enrichment. The calculated volcanism is driven by two different mechanisms. Early volcanism occurs when magma generated in the deep mantle by internal heating ascends to the surface as partially molten plumes. The basaltic blobs in the uppermost mantle formed by this magmatism then sink into the deep mantle, triggering further plumes that cause a resurgence of volcanism in its later history.

Our results reveal that exceptional warming in the tropical‐subtropical North Atlantic (TSNA), characterized by a warm blob off North Africa reaching 1.2 K, played a crucial role. The TSNA warming induced a low‐pressure anomaly over the mid‐latitude North Atlantic and Europe, facilitating moisture transport and convergence toward Eastern Europe, leading to heavy rainfall. While the concurrent El Niño event and positive Indian Ocean Dipole may contribute to this process, their impacts were relatively modest compared to TSNA warming.

Here, we built a “Beach‐Machine” to simulate a gradient of wave energy and test its effect on alkalinity formation by olivine, a widely considered mineral for OAE. We find that wave energy strongly (linearly) increases alkalinity formation from olivine when energy input is beyond a certain threshold. However, when olivine is mixed with organic‐poor sand, energy input also increases the loss of alkalinity possibly by promoting precipitation reactions thereby canceling out the benefits of waves on alkalinity formation.

A comparison of macrophysical properties for low, mid‐level, high, and deep clouds shows that the cloud top heights and thickness values are higher in the Arctic for each cloud type compared with the Southern Ocean and Antarctic regions, possibly due to higher sea surface temperatures in the north Atlantic. The Arctic also shows lower ice phase occurrence frequencies compared with the SH high latitudes for low clouds. For high, mid‐level and deep clouds, the cloud phase distributions as a function of temperature show small geographical variabilities. The observations are then compared with the Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to evaluate the representations of these cloud properties. The results show that the model captures cloud base and top heights well and reproduces the differences in cloud macrophysical properties between the two hemispheres.

Strong orographic GW were detected during both flights that were conceived for different latitudes. The observational and numerical data reveal the presence of significant GW attenuation, breaking and secondary wave generation above the stratopause due to the development of convective and dynamic instability as well as conditions for wave evanescence. The GW generated by topography were not able to alter the stable structure of the stratosphere, but the scenario was quite different in the lower mesosphere. The disturbed zones in that layer were produced by the combined effect on lapse rate of the background temperature variation and the perturbations associated with GW, which together may induce large vertical gradients. As a consequence, areas of reduced stability (with low or even negative buoyancy parameter) emerge above the stratopause. The existence of these GW self‐induced attenuation layers in the mesosphere where temperature perturbations produce large negative gradients may lead to an amplitude growth control mechanism for the upward propagating waves."

Notably, the correlation between δ18Os and trace element ratios has experienced a significant transition since the acceleration of global warming from the 1970s.

Simulated wind speeds are compared with in‐situ measurements from 22 surface sites, grouped into six topographic categories: continental plain (CT), lakeside (LS), river valley (RV), Long Island (LI), Block Island (BI), and offshore ocean (OO). A quantitative evaluation based on Relative Euclidean Distance shows that wind speeds at the OO site are the most accurately reproduced, followed by those at LI sites, while the model performs less accurately for the remaining topographic groups. Wind speeds over CT sites tend to be overestimated by approximately 1 m/s, although their diurnal variability (DV) is well captured. In contrast, the model underestimates wind DV at LS, RV, LI, and BI sites, with the largest biases occurring at LI and BI, resulting in underestimated daytime wind speed and/or overestimated nighttime wind speed. The OO winds exhibit minimal diurnal variation, accurately captured by our WRF model. The surface wind diurnal variation is closely linked to PBL development. Among the indicators of PBL development, surface potential temperature biases most strongly correlate with wind speed biases. Our WRF model faces challenges in capturing the distinctions between winds influenced by local circulations and those over continental plains, and the significantly stronger winds at OO compared to BI. Potential causes for these biases are discussed, offering pathways for improving surface wind simulations in future."

However, it is crucial to differentiate atmospheric BC into char and soot subgroups, given their significant disparities in physicochemical properties and potential impacts. We first conducted a comparative study of char/soot in PM10 and rainwater, collected over a year in urban Guangzhou, China. The mean char/soot ratio in PM10 (∼2.5) is obviously higher than that in rainwater (∼0.8), corresponding to higher wet scavenging efficiency of soot. Through sequence rainwater sampling during individual rainfall events, we further distinguished the contributions of in‐cloud and below‐cloud scavenging, with in‐cloud scavenging predominantly contributed to the distinct difference between char and soot. Such a distinct wet scavenging behavior of char and soot would have substantial implications for the atmospheric behavior of BC, which should be considered in future models for accurate evaluation of its lifetime and climate impact."

We examine the IWC‐hydroclimate linkages throughout the Indian Ocean Basin during two study periods (instrumental era and the last millennium), using the ECHAM5‐wiso, iCESM‐iLME, and ERA5 global data products. We leverage the stable isotopic composition of precipitation (δ $\delta $18OP) as an integrative water cycle tracer to elucidate the link between large‐scale atmospheric processes and regional hydroclimate characteristics. We find a strong statistical relationship between the East African short rain δ $\delta $18OP and IWC in Eastern Africa and Horn of Africa. In Indonesia, the relationship is weaker due to the strong influence of the Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC). These patterns arise over multiple time scales and are consistent with the strong tie between the IWC and precipitation variability during the short rain season in Eastern Africa and Horn of Africa that had previously been reported in the instrumental era but not yet for the last millennium. We document strong fluctuations in the strength of the IWC during the last millennium, with periods of stronger or weaker interactions with the PWC that influenced δ $\delta $18OP variability. Finally, our study underscores the ability of δ $\delta $18OP to capture major atmospheric circulation signals, demonstrating its potential to examine the impact of interacting Walker Circulations on regional hydroclimate even during periods of low precipitation."

Yet, a tiny fraction of global wild fish catch comes from the High Seas, despite intensifying industrial fishing efforts. The paradoxically small fish catch could reflect economic barriers to exploiting the High Seas ‐ such as the difficulty and cost of fishing in remote ocean parts ‐ or ecological features resulting in a small biomass of commercial fish (10g–100 kg) relative to primary production. We use the coupled biological‐economic model BOATS to estimate contributing factors, comparing observed catches with simulations where: (a) fishing cost depends on distance from shore and seafloor depth; (b) catchability depends on seafloor depth or vertical habitat extent; (c) regions with micronutrient limitation have reduced biomass production; (d) the trophic transfer of energy from primary production to demersal food webs depends on water depth; and (e) High Seas biomass migrates to coastal regions. The dominant factor is ecological: commercial fish communities receive much primary production in shallow waters but less in deep waters, limiting exploitable biomass in High Seas. Other factors play a secondary role, with migrations having a potentially large but uncertain role, while economic factors have smaller effects. We estimate the High Seas hosted 25% $\%$ of a global 2.8 ± $\pm $ 0.7 Gt biomass in the early 20th century, changing to 47% of a global 1.5 ± $\pm $ 0.4 Gt of commercial fish biomass during the early 21st century.

Here, we introduce a whole-body model of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in a physics simulator2. Designed as a general-purpose framework, our model enables the simulation of diverse fly behaviors, including both terrestrial and aerial locomotion. We validate its versatility by replicating realistic walking and flight behaviors. To support these behaviors, we develop new phenomenological models for fluid and adhesion forces. Using data-driven, end-to-end reinforcement learning3,4, we train neural network controllers capable of generating naturalistic locomotion5,6,7 along complex trajectories in response to high-level steering commands. Additionally, we show the use of visual sensors and hierarchical motor control8, training a high-level controller to reuse a pre-trained low-level flight controller to perform visually guided flight tasks.

 Colorectal cancer incidence rates vary geographically and have changed over time1. Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries2-5. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin6,7, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer."

 Metamaterials with multimodal deformation mechanisms resemble machines1,2, especially when endowed with autonomous functionality. A representative architected assembly, with tunable chirality, converts linear motion into rotation3. These chiral metamaterials with a machine-like dual modality have potential use in areas such as wave manipulation4, optical activity related to circular polarization5 and chiral active fluids6. However, the dual motions are essentially coupled and cannot be independently controlled. Moreover, they are restricted to small deformation, that is, strain ≤2%, which limits their applications. Here we establish modular chiral metamaterials, consisting of auxetic planar tessellations and origami-inspired columnar arrays, with decoupled actuation. Under single-degree-of-freedom actuation, the assembly twists between 0° and 90°, contracts in-plane up to 25% and shrinks out-of-plane more than 50%. Using experiments and simulations, we show that the deformation of the assembly involves in-plane twist and contraction dominated by the rotating-square tessellations and out-of-plane shrinkage dominated by the tubular Kresling origami arrays. Moreover, we demonstrate two distinct actuation conditions: twist with free translation and linear displacement with free rotation. Our metamaterial is built on a highly modular assembly, which enables reprogrammable instability, local chirality control, tunable loading capacity and scalability. Our concept provides routes towards multimodal, multistable and reprogrammable machines, with applications in robotic transformers, thermoregulation, mechanical memories in hysteresis loops, non-commutative state transition and plug-and-play functional assemblies for energy absorption and information encryption.

 Clinical pathogen diagnostics detect targets by qPCR (but with low sensitivity) or blood culturing (but time-consuming). Here we leverage a dual-stem-loop DNA amplifier to enhance non-specific collateral enzymatic cleavage of an oligonucleotide linker between a fluophore and its quencher by CRISPR-CasΦ, achieving ultrasensitive target detection. Specifically, the target pathogens are lysed to release DNA, which binds its complementary gRNA in CRISPR-CasΦ to activate the collateral DNA-cleavage capability of CasΦ, enabling CasΦ to cleave the stem-loops in the amplifier. The cleavage product binds its complementary gRNA in another CRISPR-CasΦ to activate more CasΦ. The activated CasΦ collaterally cleaves the linker, releasing the fluophore to recover its fluorescent signal. The cycle of stem-loop-cleavage/CasΦ-activation/fluorescence-recovery amplifies the detection signal. Our target amplification-free collateral-cleavage-enhancing CRISPR-CasΦ method (TCC), with a detection limit of 0.11 copies/μL, demonstrates enhanced sensitivity compared to qPCR.

Prakash and colleagues show cellular organisation results from differences in junction contractility, finding mechanics is sufficient to organise a hair cell mosaic that is planar polarised. 
 Tissue function depends on the precise organisation of the constituent cells. In the cochlea, the fidelity of hearing depends on mechanosensory hair cells being consistently surrounded by supporting cells. In addition to this positional order, auditory sensitivity depends crucially on planar cell polarity. This is characterised by the alignment of the orientation of eccentrically placed hair bundles on each hair cell. These two levels of order emerge simultaneously despite the cellular fluxes that occur during cochlear development. However, the link between tissue-scale cellular rearrangements and intrinsic cellular mechanisms remains unknown. By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we find a precise force patterning underpinning positional order and planar cell polarity. This occurs through the modulation of the levels and phospho-type of the regulatory light chain of non-muscle myosin II at specific cell-cell junctions of the auditory epithelium.

Here, the authors propose Sym-Q, an interactive reinforcement learning-based framework with a co-design mechanism that enables efficient and guided equation discovery. 
 Symbolic Regression holds great potential for uncovering underlying mathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast combinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for previous online search methods and pre-trained transformer models, which mostly do not consider the integration of domain experts’ prior knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network, an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous transformer-based SR approaches, Symbolic Q-network leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the Symbolic Q-network facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate Sym-Q performs comparably to existing pretrained models across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our experiments on real-world cases demonstrate that the interactive co-design mechanism significantly enhances Symbolic Q-network’s performance, achieving greater performance gains than standard autoregressive models.

 Many behavioral responses to climate change are carbon-intensive, raising concerns that adaptation may cause additional warming. The sign and magnitude of this feedback depend on how increased emissions from cooling balance against reduced emissions from heating across space and time. We present an empirical approach that forecasts the effect of future adaptive energy use on global average temperature over the 21st century. We estimate that energy-based adaptation will lower global mean surface temperature in 2099 by 0.07 to 0.12 °C relative to baseline projections under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. This cooling avoids 0.6 to 1.8 trillion U.S. Dollars ($2019) in damages, depending on the baseline emissions scenario. Energy-based adaptation lowers business-as-usual emissions for 85% of countries, reducing the mitigation required to meet their unilateral Nationally Determined Contributions by 20% on average. These findings indicate that while business-as-usual adaptive energy use is unlikely to accelerate warming, it raises important implications for countries’ existing mitigation commitments.

It occurs throughout diverse ecosystems and spans vast timescales, and could play an important role in shaping the co-evolution of Earth’s biosphere and geosphere. 
 Virtually all of Earth’s ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles are underpinned – and often driven – by the activity (or inactivity) of microorganisms. Dormancy, a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity, is ubiquitous among microbial communities in environments ranging from moderate to extreme. Dormancy enables microorganisms to withstand severe and widespread environmental changes. Here I argue that dormancy exerts a powerful influence on Earth’s ecological and biogeochemical architecture through space and time, and over vast scales. Dormancy manifests differently across taxonomically and functionally distinct microbial groups, and operates over timescales ranging from hours to millennia – enabling microorganisms to interact with the geosphere over geologically relevant timescales. As such, dormancy may play a crucial role in shaping ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles throughout the Earth system. Interdisciplinary, integrative geosphere-biosphere approaches will be essential for advancing our understanding of how microbial dormancy underpins the co-evolution of Earth, its biosphere, and their interactions.

Here, using super-resolution microscopy and immobilized influenza A virions enabling live imaging the authors show nanoscale receptor accumulation, endocytosis induction, and actin remodeling. 
 During infection, individual virions trigger specific cellular signaling at the virus-cell interface, a nanoscale region of the plasma membrane in direct contact with the virus. However, virus-induced receptor recruitment and cellular activation are transient processes that occur within minutes at the nanoscale. Hence, the temporal and spatial kinetics of such early events often remain poorly understood due to technical limitations. To address this challenge, we develop a protocol to covalently immobilize labelled influenza A viruses on glass surfaces before exposing them to live epithelial cells. Our method extends the observation time for virus-plasma membrane association while minimizing viral modifications, facilitating live imaging of virus-cell interactions. Using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, we investigate virus-receptor interaction showing that viral receptors exhibit reduced mobility at the virus-binding site, which leads to a specific local receptor accumulation and turnover. We further follow the dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the single-virus level and demonstrate the recruitment of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), previously thought to be uninvolved in influenza A virus infection. Finally, we examine the nanoscale organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the virus-binding site, showing a local and dynamic response of the cellular actin cortex to the infecting virus.

 The Tibetan Plateau is the headwaters of several major river basins, but uncertainties exist in the estimated contributions of glacial melt and groundwater to runoff. We present a new tracer-aided glacio-hydrological model constrained by multiple datasets for five major river basins of the Tibetan Plateau. We show that the contribution of glacier melt to the annual runoff is less than 5% in all the five basins at the outlets—much less than previous estimates. Our secondary finding is that the partitioning between surface runoff and groundwater flow varied greatly across the watersheds, with groundwater runoff contributing 35–75% of the annual runoff. The contribution of glacier melt has a strong spatial variability and scale dependency, but the population heavily dependent on it is limited, so a potential significant decrease in water resources due to glacier shrinkage is not a problem that should raise public worries in the Tibetan Plateau."

Lower uptake coefficients lead to an increase in the concentration of radical species like HO2 and reduce the extent of aerosol-inhibited regime (AIR) in regions such as India and East Asia which are currently within AIR, leading to a notable increase in surface ozone (40–50%), particularly during colder months. Projections for 2046 indicate a global reduction in AIR, resulting from stricter emission controls.

A key challenge is understanding how the cryosphere meltdown will impact Arctic marine carbon cycles and ecosystems.

 Global warming is increasing compound drought and heatwave events. This elevates vegetation loss probability. Despite spatial shifts in vegetation loss probability being crucial for predicting spatial redistribution patterns of vegetation vulnerability across terrestrial ecosystems, they remain poorly understood under compound drought and heatwave events. In this study, using a vine copula model, vegetation loss probability was quantified under compound drought and heatwave events. Spatial shift velocities of vegetation loss probability were examined using the concept of velocity change. Spatial shift velocities of vegetation loss probability would undergo substantial increase based on the satellite observations and future simulations. However, vegetation resistance to droughts buffers spatial shift velocities of vegetation loss probability (p < 0.01). These findings provide evidence that vegetation vulnerability patterns will undergo substantial spatial changes under compound drought and heatwave events, leading to a spatial redistribution of vegetation in disturbance-prone areas.

 Urbanization is revealed to cause more frequent and hotter day-night compound heatwaves, yet its impact on their onset remains unclear. This study compares summertime compound heatwaves in 722 urban-rural station pairs globally on an event-by-event basis during 1971-2017 and attributes their difference to numerous urbanization and climatological factors using interpretable machine learning methods. Here we find a discernible earlier onset (0.23 ± 0.04 days) of compound heatwaves in cities compared to rural areas. The magnitude of this influence is primarily determined by urban building volume and height rather than the artificial impervious surface fraction, and is exacerbated by climates characterized by warm night and ample daytime solar radiation. Taller buildings significantly advance onset in cloudy, warm, and humid climates, while larger building volumes lead to earlier onset of compound heatwaves across nearly all climates. Our findings suggest that cities, particularly those with large building volumes, should issue heatwave warnings earlier.

However, existing global analyses have not fully explored these complex dynamics. Here we introduce a metric, human-flood distance change, to track migration in floodplains from 2000 to 2018, exploring the interplay of climatic and anthropogenic influences. We find that in developing countries, including India, Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria, flood fatalities and displacement strongly influence migration decisions, often forcing populations to move away or toward flood-prone areas due to flood damage memory or resource needs. Conversely, regions with higher flood protection, such as the United States, show migration trends away from hazardous areas. Climatic drivers, like flood inundation area, exert stronger influences in Australia. Notably, in the Philippines and Kenya, the easing of drought-flood abrupt alternation has led to increased population movement toward flood-prone areas, underscoring the complex interactions between multiple hazards.

A sensitivity analysis shows that, under certain assumptions, oxygen consumption rates could match the carbon supply and carbon demand. We furthermore identified a mechanism of vertical particulate carbon export, the full eddy core submergence pump.

Within-field reference areas were delineated based on both the observed amendment practices, crops and soil map and randomly selected with replacement to train/ validate SVM with several iterations. Various feature sets composed of bands, signals and specific spectral indices from either Sentinel-2 and/or Sentinel-1 data served to compute SVM in a bootstrapping approach in order to produce a series of map results, to assess the final mode class and the uncertainty of map results. Classification performance was higher for pre- and post-application image pairs compared to post-application images alone and slightly improved when adding Sentinel-1 data. While the areal percentage of the highest uncertainty class covered less of 10% of the mapped area regardless of the year, the best models showed accuracies higher than 93% in 2020 and 2021. In 2019, the overall accuracy did not reach more than 79%, probably due to rainfall events and considerable time lags between the image pairs. This study underscores, not only the potential of Sentinel-2 and 1 for monitoring EOM applications, but also the requirement of better understanding the spectral behaviour of the EOM spreadings, in line with a thorough characterization of the sequence of crop technical management."

 Flood monitoring is a complex task involving multimodal data mining and multitask collaboration. In order to leverage the role of multimodal data in flood management, conducting visual-language pretraining (VLP) in the field of flood disaster monitoring and obtaining foundational pretraining models that are suitable for multiple downstream flood-related tasks is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. This paper introduces SLIP-Flood, an innovative VLP framework supporting flood image classification, image-text retrieval, and auxiliary text classification. To overcome the limitations of existing cross-modal models that rely on small datasets and lack robustness, we have constructed two specialized datasets for the first time: 1) FloodMulS for the Flood Image Classification Model (FICM), and 2) FloodIT for the Flood Text-Image Retrieval Model (FTIRM). Traditional models employ “Hard Categorization Strategy (HC)” for image classification, neglecting the impacts of “Categorization Ambiguity.” To improve performance, we propose a “Soft Categorization Strategy.” Furthermore, traditional models focus on unimodal (image) information, not fully utilizing joint image-text information. We address this with a “Soft Combination” to integrate FICM and FTIRM, termed SCSC. Experimental results show SCSC improves SLIP-Flood’s performance: a 7.62% increase in the F1 score on FICM compared to HC, and a 0.35% increase in FTIRM’s F1 score based on FICM. SLIP-Flood also achieves a maximum recall of 89.24% in image-text retrieval and shows promise in auxiliary flood text classification.

 The Valencian Anchor Station (VAS) (Spain) is an outstanding site operating as a central location for calibrating and validating numerous remote sensing instruments and products. Hence, an accurate characterization of its land cover is required. This research conducts a land cover classification within the VAS station (10 × 10 km2) and its surrounding area (30 × 30 km2) for 2021 using multi-temporal imagery from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI). Several aspects of land cover classification have been evaluated, including i) the feature selection, ii) the temporal resolution of time series (i.e., monthly, seasonal), iii) the performance of six Machine Learning algorithms (i.e., CART, GTB, k-NN, NB, RF, and SVM, alongside three deep learning models (FC-NN, MLP-ED, and ResCNN) and iv) the optimization of classifier tuning parameters. Furthermore, the study assesses the impact of reducing sample sizes on classifying similar areas, extending the classification to three buffers (1 km, 5 km and 10 km) without increasing reference data. ResCNN emerged as the best-performing model, yielding superior classification metrics (96 % overall accuracy and 95 % kappa score) in July, coinciding with the peak vineyard phenology. Producer’s and user’s accuracy values generally exceeded 90 % for most land cover classes, with some exceptions in more challenging categories such as artificial surfaces and non-irrigated arable land, which showed lower accuracies due to inter-class similarity. Overall, the findings underscore the robust performance of all models in land cover classification, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving high-quality classification with a robust methodology and limited training data."

This inspired hypotheses for how Milankovitch cycles, ice-ocean interactions, and greenhouse gases influence ice volume. Mass balance controls for marine and terrestrial ice sheets differ, and proxy data collected far from Antarctica provide valuable but limited insight into regional processes. We evaluate clast abundance data from Antarctic marine sedimentary records, observing a strong signal of eccentricity and precession coincident with a terrestrial ice sheet and a clear obliquity signal at the margins of a marine ice sheet. These analyses are integrated with a synthesis of proxy data, and we argue that high variance in obliquity forcing (mediated and enhanced by the ocean and atmosphere) can inhibit ice sheet growth, even when insolation forcing is conducive to glaciation. This “obliquity disruption” explains cryosphere variability before the existence of large northern hemisphere ice sheets."

We found that including temporal derivatives in the state vector enhances the description of the ocean’s dynamical system. Once Pacific oscillations are properly accounted for, averaged surface warming appears >60% faster, and a deep reshaping of the seascape is revealed.

In this study, we used multielectrode arrays to record from neurons in the early (V1/V2), middle (V4), and later [posterior inferotemporal (PIT) cortex] areas across the visual hierarchy, estimating each neuron’s local operation across natural scene via “heatmaps.” We found that, while populations of neurons with foveal receptive fields across V1/V2, V4, and PIT responded over the full scene, they focused on salient subregions within object outlines. Notably, neurons preferentially encoded animal features rather than general objects, with this trend strengthening along the visual hierarchy.

However, it is unclear what may cause the proposed convective thinning and/or delamination of eclogitic lower crust over very wide regions, whereas back-arc extension is either not observed or insufficient to explain the observed very thin mantle lithosphere. Notably, many of these ocean-continent systems have a long history of terrane accretion.

However, key regulators underlying unsatisfactory regeneration remain poorly understood. This study reveals that the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R)/Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome axis suppresses enthesis regeneration by amplifying IL-1β–mediated inflammatory cross-talk and suppressing docosatrienoic acid (DTA) metabolic cross-talk. NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated in macrophages following enthesis injury, thereby impairing the histological and functional recovery of the injured enthesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) indicated thatNlrp3knockout attenuated pathological inflammation and ameliorated the detrimental effects of IL-1β signaling cross-talk. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasomes suppressed the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-13) and DTA. The NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated secretome reduced differentiation and migration of stem cells. Neutralizing IL-1β or replenishing docosatrienoic acid accelerated enthesis regeneration. Moreover, conditional knockout ofP2rx7in myeloid cells attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and facilitated enthesis regeneration.

Despite its mechanistic importance, identifying and characterizing senescence across cell populations is challenging. Using primary dermal fibroblasts, we combined single-cell imaging, machine learning, several induced senescence conditions, and multiple protein biomarkers to define functional senescence subtypes.

Among these, we identified three as bona fide senescence subtypes (C7, C10, and C11), with C10 exhibiting the strongest age dependence within an aging cohort. In addition, we observed that a donor’s senescence burden and subtype composition were indicative of susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced senescence. Functional analysis revealed subtype-dependent responses to senotherapies, with C7 being most responsive to the combination of dasatinib and quercetin.

The fully organic device has been characterized under actual clinical conditions using a high-energy proton beam and an anthropomorphic phantom, with the aim to simulate a prostate cancer proton therapy treatment. We achieved a full control over the dosimeter operation, and we verified its linear response with the received dose. We demonstrate that, by a proper functionalization of the polysiloxane-based scintillator, it is possible to target the effective detection of different kinds of ionizing radiation. Specifically, besides protons, we develop a device able to detect thermal neutrons, targeting its use during Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. This work demonstrates how organic indirect detectors can be considered a universal radiation detecting platform able to monitor in real time and in situ the dose absorbed by patients during cancer treatments under different kinds of radiation."

Many pathologies arise due to disruptions in tissue-specific G0, yet little is known about the temporal-spatial mechanisms that establish G0and its signaling hub, primary cilia. Mechanistic insight is limited by asynchronous model systems and failure to connect context-specific, transient mechanisms to function. To address this gap, we developed STAMP (synchronized temporal-spatial analysis via microscopy and phosphoproteomics) to track changes in cellular landscape occurring throughout G0transition and ciliogenesis. We synchronized ciliogenesis and G0transition in two cell models and combined microscopy with phosphoproteomics to order signals for further targeted analyses. We propose that STAMP is broadly applicable for studying temporal-spatial signaling in many biological contexts. The findings revealed through STAMP provide critical insight into healthy cellular functions often disrupted in pathologies, paving the way for targeted therapeutics."

However, attempts to combine silicon photonics and erbium ions for telecom memories, without losing the scalable and low-loss properties of silicon chips, face challenges because of limited light-matter interactions and potential extra decoherence. Here, we present an efficient silicon-chip platform using bound states in the continuum to overcome these limitations. In addition to a low propagation loss of 0.5 ± 0.5 decibels per centimeter, our experiments demonstrate an order-of-magnitude enhancement in light absorption compared to previous traditional silicon hybrid designs. Using these properties, we demonstrated photon echoes in our waveguide structures, revealing a coherence time of 2.6 ± 0.6 microseconds at zero magnetic field, closely matching that of bulk crystals. These characteristics make the bound state in the continuum platform a promising candidate for realizing integrated optical memories for quantum network applications."

To control exciton emission properties, hetero-bilayers are usually integrated with photonic nanostructures, however, in which the contact interfaces can result in substantial luminescence suppression. To overcome this fundamental issue, we herein directly pattern photonic crystal (PhC) nanostructures in free-standing WS2/WSe2hetero-bilayers to avoid the involvement of contact interfaces. Such PhC nanostructured WS2/WSe2hetero-bilayers not only provide new exciton states but also offer guided mode resonances that can self-couple to excitons to enable light manipulation at the atomic thickness scale. Moreover, leveraging the unique momentum dispersion of guided mode resonances, exciton emissions are selectively excited and separated in the energy-momentum space. Our results may provide an important direction to unfold the prospects of emerging exciton states in the moiré heterostructures."

However, they are also complex and hard to model because they cannot be described by the standard tools in equilibrium statistical mechanics. Probing nonequilibrium critical phenomena in pristine setups can illuminate fresh perspectives on these systems. Here, we use an ensemble of cold88Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse cavity to study the cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, a classic driven-dissipative model describing coherently driven dipoles superradiantly emitting light. We observe its nonequilibrium phase diagram characterized by a second-order phase transition. Below a critical drive strength, the atoms quickly reach the so-called superradiant steady state featuring a macroscopic dipole moment; above the critical point, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations. At longer times, spontaneous emission transforms the second-order transition into a discontinuous first-order transition. Our observations pave the way for harnessing robust entangled states and exploring boundary time crystals in driven-dissipative systems."

Using nickel phthalocyanine derivatives with cyano, methoxy, and dimethylamino groups, this study unveils why decorating molecular catalysts with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups can enhance their activity. Notably, the dimethylamino group–decorated catalyst demonstrated stable and nearly 100% CO2-to-CO reduction selectivity over a wide potential range and high CO partial current densities up to 300 milliamperes per square centimeter. Theoretical and in situ spectroscopic analyses revealed the critical role of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in activating the metal center, which can be facilitated by the decoration of electron-withdrawing groups. Conversely, electron-donating groups, although requiring higher energy for protonation, enhance the synergy between metal centers and protonated sites, favoring the formation of key *COOH intermediates and improving CO selectivity at higher bias. This study underscores the importance of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in optimizing functionalized molecular catalysts for enhanced CO2RR activity."

Mathematical modeling predicts that, because growth rate sets the intracellular dilution rate, the sensitivity of regulatory switches to chemical cues systematically decreases with growth rate. We experimentally validate that the concentration of inducer required to activateE. coli’slacoperon increases quadratically with growth rate when varying nutrients but is invariant when varying growth rate through translation inhibition. We further establish that this growth-coupled sensitivity (GCS) allows bacteria to implement concentration-dependent sugar preferences, in which a new carbon source is used only if its concentration is sufficient to improve upon the current growth rate. Using microfluidics in combination with time-lapse microscopy, we validate this prediction at the single-cell level using mixtures of glucose and lactose. Overall, GCS causes cells to automatically become more sensitive to environmental signals when their growth rate decreases."

The O-antigen ofV. choleraeserotype O100 has emerged as a promising candidate for vaccine development. To investigate the absolute configuration of 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoyl (dHh) and to evaluate the structure-activity relationship of the O-antigen trisaccharide repeating unit, we completed total synthesis of four potential trisaccharide isomers, along with 11 additional oligosaccharide fragments of the O-antigen. Stereoselective reduction was used for the synthesis of dHh, and the efficient assembly of dHh and (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl (RHb) was achieved through a post-glycosylation modification strategy. Through NMR analysis, the absolute configuration of dHh was assigned 3S,5S. Glycan microarray screening indicated thatRHb is essential for the antigenicity of O-antigen.

We show that CD39+regulatory T cell (Treg)–like and CD26hiTH22–like cells undergo T cell receptor (TCR)–independent activation by cytokines during Ag stimulation, leading to nonspecific up-regulation of AIM readouts. Transcriptional analysis enabled discrimination of bona fide Ag-specific T cells from cytokine-activated Tregand TH22 cells. CXCR4 down-regulation emerged as a hallmark of clonotypic expansion and TCR-dependent activation in memory CD4+T cells and cTfh. By tracking tetramer-binding cells upon Ag restimulation, we demonstrated that CXCR4−CD137+cells provided a more accurate measure of Ag-specificity than standard AIM readouts. This modified assay excluded the predominantly CCR6+cytokine-activated T cells that contributed to an average 12-fold overestimation of the Ag-specific population.

Mechanistic studies reveal that small particle size, removal of water-soluble fractions, as well as reservation of lignin and its cross-linking reactivity have considerably positive effects on preparation of high-quality composite items.

At the same time, mechanical stresses from the microenvironment and cellular shape changes compress and bend microtubules. Yet, centrosomes are membraneless organelles, raising the question of how centrosomes withstand mechanical forces. Here, we discover that centrosomes can deform and even fracture. We reveal that centrosomes experience deformations during navigational pathfinding within motile cells. Coherence of the centrosome is maintained by Dyrk3 and cNAP1, preventing fracturing by forces. While cells can compensate for the depletion of centriolar-based centrosomes, the fracturing of centrosomes impedes cellular function by generating coexisting microtubule organizing centers that compete during path navigation and thereby cause cellular entanglement in the microenvironment. Our findings show that cells actively maintain the integrity of the centrosome to withstand mechanical forces. These results suggest that centrosome stability preservation is fundamental, given that almost all cells in multicellular organisms experience forces."
