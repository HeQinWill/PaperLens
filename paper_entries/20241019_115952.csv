10.1088/1748-9326/ad7d1e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是城市热岛效应(UHI)和热浪(HW)事件的相互作用，尤其关注不同局部气候区(LCZ)之间的差异。研究使用WRF模式模拟了悉尼地区三个热浪事件，量化了不同辐射和动力过程对温度差异的贡献，例如云量减少、水汽含量、感热通量增加和潜热通量增加等。研究发现，热浪期间地表温度和900百帕温度的差异最大可达10 K，并且不同LCZ之间气候反馈过程的贡献差异在更严重和潮湿的热浪期间更加明显。该研究强调了实施针对不同LCZ的热缓解策略的必要性，但与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大。,"['Land surface temperature', 'Urban heat island', 'Heatwave', 'Local Climate Zones (LCZs)', 'Numerical weather prediction (WRF model)']",Jing Kong;Yongling Zhao;Kai Gao;Dominik Strebel;Jan Carmeliet;Chengwang Lei,Highly inhomogeneous interactions between background climate and urban warming across typical local climate zones in heatwave and non-heatwave days,"Urban heat island (UHI) in conjunction with heatwave (HW) leads to exacerbation of thermal stress in urban areas. Prior research on UHI and HW has predominantly concentrated on examining the thermal conditions at the surface and near-surface, with few investigations extending to the radiative and dynamical interactions of UHI and HW, particularly with a focus on the inhomogeneities across local climate zones (LCZs). Here, we analyse the temperature disparity between HW and non-HW conditions across LCZs in the Sydney area by quantifying the contributions of individual radiative and dynamical processes using the coupled surface-atmosphere climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM). Three moist HW events in 2017, 2019, and 2020 are simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM). It is found that the maximum surface and 900 hPa temperature difference between HW and non-HW days may reach up to 10 K, with the increased net solar radiation during HWs being comparable to the typical level of anthropogenic heat flux in urban areas. It is also found that the reduction of clouds, the presence of vapour, and the increase of sensible heat contribute to the warming effect to various degrees, with the contribution of clouds being the most dominant. Conversely, the generation of dry convection and the increase of latent heat flux lead to cooling effects, with the latter being more dominant and capable of causing up to 10 K surface temperature difference between LCZ1 (compact high-rise) and LCZ9 (sparsely built). The differences in the contributions of climate feedback processes across different LCZs become more evident during more severe and humid HWs. These findings underscore the necessity of implementing LCZ-tailored heat mitigation strategies."

It significantly affects atmospheric circulation, the environment, ecology, and maritime transport. This study developed a statistical prediction model to predict monthly Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) for up to one year based on the season-reliant empirical orthogonal functions (SEOFs) technique. Its prediction skill was compared with that of a dynamical prediction model. The spatiotemporal pattern of sea ice anomalies, which exhibit strong seasonality and are maintained for a significant period above the seasonal time scale by atmosphere-ocean interactions, was extracted using SEOFs. A prediction model was constructed by extrapolating from the recent anomalous state of sea ice to predict the future. Experimental retrospective predictions with monthly time resolution for 1982–2021 were performed to validate the prediction skill of Arctic SIC and areal extent. Statistically significant prediction skills were achieved over several months, even up to six months, exceeding the skill of the dynamical model."

However, our understanding of climatic mechanisms remains inadequate for operational prediction. By analyzing the atmospheric circulation of ETCTRs occurring in Central and Eastern China during the boreal midsummer period (July–August) from 1981 to 2020, this study found that these boreal midsummer ETCTRs may be influenced by the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and North Pacific Ocean Dipole (IPOD). Diagnostic analysis and Linear Baroclinic Model experiments indicated that negative IPOD-type sea surface temperature anomalies can trigger positive geopotential height anomalies in the mid-upper troposphere over the subtropical region and negative geopotential height anomalies from the Western North Pacific to Northeastern and Northern China. This circulation pattern and moisture transport conditions are conducive to the formation of ETCTRs during boreal midsummer in Central and Eastern China and vice versa for the positive IPOD case. This study provides useful evidence for short-range climate prediction of boreal midsummer ETCTRs in Central and Eastern China."

Prior research has proposed examining the area of applicability (AoA) of a model based on structurally similar characteristics in the Earth Observation predictors and weights based on the model derived feature importance. We expand on and evaluate this approach in the context of grain yield forecasting in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we evaluate an AoA methodology established for generating raster surfaces and apply it to vector supported grain data. We fit a series of ensemble tree models both within single countries and across multiple sets of countries and then test those models in countries excluded from the training set. We then calculate and decompose AoA measures and examine several different performance metrics. We find that the spatial transfer accuracy does not vary across season but does vary by average rainfall and across high, medium, and low yielding regions. In general, areas with higher yields and medium to high average rainfall tend to have higher accuracy for both model training and transfer. Finally, we find that fitting models with multiple countries provides more accurate out-of-sample estimates when compared to models fitted to a single country."

Only in this way can the potential negative impacts of cattle related to local ecosystem degradation, as well as positive ones such as preserving cultural landscapes through grazing, be analyzed. While data on livestock distribution often used in scientific analyses can provide estimates on density, the separation between the livestock that has access to outdoor grazing and those that remain indoors is not available. This is problematic because it prevents the identification of the intensity and type of grassland management, as well as the consequential environmental impacts of grazing livestock. Here we present an approach where we combined agricultural and veterinary statistics, in-situ data, expert surveys and machine learning to develop a map of grazing cattle distribution for the wider European Union region. Our approach and the resulting data allow for the differentiation between cattle that are actually grazing versus those that do not. We also compare our method to traditional approaches that do not have a clear separation between grazing and non-grazing cattle, illustrating the implications that this can have for agricultural, land use and environmental assessments."

Rauber;Larry Di Girolamo,Evolution of cloud droplet temperature and lifetime in spatiotemporally varying subsaturated environments with implications for ice nucleation at cloud edges,"Cloud droplet temperature and lifetime impact cloud microphysical processes such as the activation of ice-nucleating particles. We investigate the thermal and radial evolution of supercooled cloud droplets and their surrounding environments with an aim to better understand observed enhanced ice formation at supercooled cloud edges. This analysis shows that the magnitude of droplet cooling during evaporation is greater than estimated from past studies, especially for drier environments. 
 Ice formation mechanisms in generating cells near stratiform cloud tops, where mixing and entrainment occurs in the presence of supercooled water droplets, remain poorly understood. Supercooled cloud droplet temperature and lifetime may impact heterogeneous ice nucleation through contact and immersion freezing; however, modeling studies normally assume the droplet temperature to be spatially uniform and equal to the ambient temperature. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind quantitative investigation of the temperature and lifetime of evaporating droplets, considering internal thermal gradients within the droplet, as well as thermal and vapor density gradients in the surrounding air. Our approach employs solving Navier–Stokes and continuity equations, coupled with heat and vapor transport, using an advanced numerical model. For typical ranges of cloud droplet sizes and environmental conditions, the droplet internal thermal gradients dissipate quickly (≤ 0.3 s) when droplets are introduced to new subsaturated environments. However, the magnitude of droplet cooling is much greater than estimated from past studies of droplet evaporation, especially for drier environments. For example, for an environment with 500 hPa pressure, and ambient temperature far from the droplet of −5 °C, the droplet temperature reduction can be as high as 24, 11, and 5 °C for initial ambient relative humidities of 10 %, 40 %, and 70 %, respectively. Droplet lifetimes are found to be tens of seconds longer compared to previous estimates, due to weaker evaporation rates because of lower droplet surface temperatures. Using these new end-of-lifetime droplet temperatures, the enhancement in the activation of ice-nucleating particles predicted by current ice nucleation parameterization schemes is discussed."

Crowley,"Measurement report: Sources, sinks, and lifetime of NOx in a suburban temperate forest at night","Using measurements of various trace gases in a suburban forest near Paris in the summer of 2022, we were able to gain insight into the sources and sinks of NOx (NO+NO2) with a special focus on their nighttime chemical and physical loss processes. NO was observed as a result of nighttime soil emissions when O3 levels were strongly depleted by deposition. NO oxidation products were not observed at night, indicating that soil and/or foliar surfaces are an efficient sink of reactive N. 
 The budget of reactive nitrogen species, which play a central role in atmospheric chemistry (e.g. in photochemical O3 production), is poorly understood in forested regions. In this study, through observations of NO, NO2, NOy, and O3 in the Rambouillet Forest near Paris, France, we have examined nighttime processes controlling NOx in an anthropogenically impacted forest environment. The O3 mixing ratios displayed a strong diel profile at the site that was driven by a variable but generally rapid deposition to soil and foliar surfaces. The O3 diel profile was strongly influenced by relative humidity and temperature inversion. Only when the O3 mixing ratio was sufficiently low (and thus the NO lifetime sufficiently long) were sustained NO peaks observed above the instrumental detection limit, enabling the derivation of average NO emission rates of ∼1.4 ppbv h−1 from the soil. Observations of the lack of increase in NO2 at night, despite a significant production rate from the reaction of NO with O3, enabled an effective lifetime of NO2 of ∼0.5–3 h to be derived. As the loss of NO2 was not compensated for by the formation of gas- or particle-phase reactive nitrogen species, it was presumably either driven by deposition to soil and foliar surfaces or any products formed were themselves short-lived with respect to deposition. By comparison, the daytime lifetime of NO2 with respect to loss by reaction with OH is about 1 d. Our results indicate that the nighttime deposition of NO2 is a major sink of boundary layer NOx in this temperate forest environment."

However, the occurrence of lightning activity in clouds is uncertain. In this study, we quantified the difference between isolated thunderstorms and non-thunderstorms. We showed that lightning activity was more likely to occur with more graupel volume and/or riming. A deeper ZDR column was associated with lightning occurrence. This information can aid in a deeper understanding of lighting physics. 
 Determining whether a cloud will evolve into a thunderstorm is beneficial for understanding thunderstorm formation and also important for ensuring the safety of society. However, a clear understanding of the microphysics of clouds in terms of the occurrence of lightning activity has not been attained. Vast field observations and laboratory experiments indicate that graupel, which is rimed ice, is a vital hydrometeor for lightning generation and is the foundation of riming electrification. In this study, polarimetric radar and lightning observations are used to compare the ice microphysics associated with graupel between 57 isolated thunderstorms and 39 isolated non-thunderstorms, and the differences in radar parameters are quantified. Our results for the occurrence of lightning activity in clouds revealed the following results: (1) the maximum difference in graupel volume at the −10 °C isotherm height between thunderstorms and non-thunderstorms reached approximately 7.6 km3; (2) the graupel particles approached spherical shapes, with a mean differential reflectivity (ZDR) value of 0.3 dB, which likely indicated that heavily rimed graupel was present; (3) the median values of horizontal reflectivity (ZH) or ZDR at positions where the source initiation and channel of the first lightning flashes were nearly 31 dBZ or 0 dB; and (4) 98.2 % of the thunderstorms were equipped with a ZDR column, and the mean depth was ∼ 2.5 km.

Washburn;Eduardo A. Santos,Using open-path dual-comb spectroscopy to monitor methane emissions from simulated grazing cattle,"Most methane emissions during the life cycle of beef cattle occur during the grazing phase. Measuring methane in grazing systems is difficult due to the high mobility and low density of animals. This work investigates if dual-comb spectroscopy can measure methane emissions from small cattle herds. An enhancement of 10 nmol mol-1 methane above the atmospheric background was measured, equivalent to 20 head located 60 m away. The calculated methane flux was within 5 % of the actual release rate. 
 Accurate whole-farm or herd-level measurements of livestock methane emissions are necessary for anthropogenic greenhouse gas inventories and to evaluate mitigation strategies. A controlled methane (CH4) release experiment was performed to determine if dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) can detect CH4 concentration enhancements produced by a typical herd of beef cattle in an extensive grazing system. Open-path DCS was used to measure downwind and upwind CH4 concentrations from 10 point sources of methane simulating cattle emissions. The CH4 mole fractions and wind velocity data were used to calculate CH4 flux using an inverse dispersion model, and the simulated fluxes were then compared to the actual CH4 release rate. For a source located 60 m from the downwind path, the DCS system detected 10 nmol mol−1 CH4 horizontal concentration gradient above the atmospheric background concentration with a precision of 6 nmol mol−1 in 15 min interval. A CH4 release of 3970 g d−1 was performed, resulting in an average concentration enhancement of 24 nmol mol−1 of CH4. The calculated CH4 flux was 4002 g d−1, showing good agreement with the actual CH4 release rate. Periodically altering the downwind path, which may be needed to track moving cattle, did not adversely affect the ability of the instruments to determine the CH4 flux. These results give us confidence that CH4 flux can be determined by grazing cattle with low disturbance and direct field-scale measurements."

Such differences can affect the homogeneity and comparability of their measurements. In this study, we assess the homogeneity between the sun photometer networks GAW-PFR and SKYNET, analysing common measurements during three campaigns between 2017–2021, and investigate the main cause of the differences. 
 In this study, we assess the homogeneity of aerosol optical depth (AOD) between two sun photometer networks, the Global Atmosphere Watch-Precision Filter Radiometer (GAW-PFR) and the European SKYNET radiometers network (ESR), at the common wavelengths of their main instruments (500 and 870 nm). The main focus of this work is to evaluate the effect of the improved Langley plot calibration method (ILP) used by SKYNET and to investigate the factors affecting its performance. We used data from three intercomparison campaigns that took place during 2017–2021. Each campaign was organized at two locations (mountainous rural – Davos, Switzerland; urban – Rome, Italy). Our analysis shows that differences in AOD due to post-processing and instrument differences are minor. The main factor leading to AOD differences is the calibration method. We found a systematic underestimation of AOD in ESR compared to in GAW-PFR due to underestimation of the calibration constant calculated with the ILP method compared to the calibration transfers using the PFR as a reference. The calibration and AOD differences are smaller in Davos, where the traceability criteria are satisfied at 870 nm and where the median differences are below 0.01 at 500 nm. In Rome, the AOD median differences at 500 nm were in the 0.015–0.034 range. We conducted a sensitivity study, which shows that part of the difference can potentially be explained by errors in the assumed surface albedo and instrument solid-view angle provided as inputs to the ILP code (based on Skyrad pack 4.2). Our findings suggest that the ILP method is mainly sensitive to the measured sky radiance. The underestimation in calibration is probably caused by an error in the retrieved scattering AOD (sc-AOD) through the sky radiance inversion. Using an alternative retrieval method (Skyrad MRI pack version 2) to derive sc-AOD and to recalibrate the instruments with the ILP method, we found no significant differences between the retrieved sc-AOD and no systematic increase in the ILP-derived calibration constant when using the MRI pack for sc-AOD inversion instead of the Skyrad 4.2. The potential error may be a result of the model assumptions used for the sky radiance simulations. In conclusion, the on-site calibration of sun photometers has several advantages, including the fact that instrument shipments and data gaps can be avoided. However, it has also the disadvantages of a larger uncertainty and significant systematic differences compared to the traditional Langley calibration performed under low- and constant-AOD conditions at high-altitude sites. The larger uncertainty of the ILP method can be attributed to the required modelling and input parameters."

While satellite instruments offer detailed spatial and temporal albedo maps, they only cover seven wavelength bands. We generate albedo maps that fully span the visible and near-infrared range using a machine learning algorithm. These maps reveal how the reflectivity of different land surfaces varies throughout the year. Our dataset enhances the understanding of the Earth's energy balance. 
 Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative-transfer simulations of the Earth's system as it is fundamental for correctly calculating the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance Black-Sky Albedo dataset (version 6.1 of MCD43D) provides detailed albedo maps for seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only into seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra and correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from remote sensing observations of the Earth. We use a principal component analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of the Earth. By combining different datasets containing laboratory measurements of hyperspectral reflectance for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct albedo maps across the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-year average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05° in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, and a temporal resolution of 1 d (day). Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities, and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps will enable us to refine calculations of the Earth's energy budget and its seasonal variability and improve climate simulations."

It can be combined with other data to study the impacts of those events on terrestrial ecosystems, specific species or human societies. Dheed's analysis confirms that extremely dry and hot days have become more common on all continents in recent decades, especially in Europe and Africa. 
 The intensification of climate extremes is one of the most immediate effects of global climate change. Heatwaves and droughts have uneven impacts on ecosystems that can be exacerbated in case of compound events. To comprehensively study these events, e.g. with local high-resolution remote sensing or in-situ data, a global catalogue of such events is essential. Here, we propose a workflow to build a database of large-scale dry and hot extreme events based on data from ERA5 reanalysis. Drought indicators are constructed based on evapotranspiration and precipitation data averaged over 30, 90 and 180 days. Extreme events are detected with the peak-over-threshold approach for the 1950–2022 period. Extremes and non-extremes are defined for daily maximum temperature at 2 m in combination with three drought indicators. In the last step, the spatiotemporal extent of the events is computed by a connected component analysis. The identified events are validated against extreme events reported in the literature."

In-situ observation remains the best alternative for accurate characterization of trends and extremes in these shallow environments. This paper presents the coastal temperature dataset of the ReefTEMPS monitoring network which spreads over multiple Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTS) in the Western and Central South Pacific. 
 While the rise in global ocean temperature continues its course, reaching 1.45+/- 0.12 °C above pre-industrial level according to the World Meteorological Organization in 2023, marine heat waves frequencies and intensities increase. Consequently, coral reef ecosystems which are among the most vulnerable environments are strongly impacted with dystrophic events and corals experiencing increasing frequencies of bleaching events. That has devastating consequences for the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTS) that strongly rely on these ecosystems. In-situ observation remains the best alternative for providing accurate characterization of long-term trends and extremes in these shallow environments. This paper presents the coastal temperature dataset of the ReefTEMPS monitoring network in which moored stations are implemented over a number of PICTS over a wide region in the Western and Central South Pacific from New Caledonia to French Polynesia. These in situ temperature time series are unique in several ways: in the length of some historical stations dating back to 1958 for the oldest, thus providing more than 65 years of daily data; in the number of countries sampled (16 PICTS) ; and in the variety of coral ecosystems monitored (from atolls to high islands and from barrier reef’s external slopes to shallow and narrow lagoons). Measurement devices have evolved over the years to provide increasingly precise and frequent observations so that the ReefTEMPS network was endorsed as a French National Observation Service in 2020, a label ensuring quality controlled and open access data of long-term observations. All stations are publicly available in ASCII or formatted NetCDF files, either on the ReefTEMPS dedicated Information System which also allows quick visualisation of time series, or in the SEANOE marine data platform.

We developed a new method to create long-term cloud radiative kernels to improve the accuracy of sunlight reaching the surface, which significantly reduces errors. Findings suggest that prior estimates of cloud cooling effects may have been overstated, emphasizing the need for better strategies to manage climate change impacts in the Arctic. 
 The surface shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) plays a critical role in modulating the Earth's energy balance and climate change. However, accurately quantifying the CRE remains challenging due to significant uncertainties in downwelling surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) and cloud parameter estimates, especially in the Arctic. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances the accuracy of CRE estimation by constructing a computationally efficient, long-term gridded surface cloud fraction radiative kernels (GCF-CRKs) and integrating refined DSSR estimates and a high-precision cloud fraction (CF). By leveraging the correlation between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiative parameters and surface radiation, combined with high-precision fused CF datasets from multiple satellite sources, we construct a CF-dependent model to refine DSSR estimates. Based on this model, we construct GCF-CRKs using the CF as the sole perturbation parameter to isolate the CF CRE. Our results indicate that this method significantly improves the accuracy of DSSR estimation under partially cloudy conditions (0<CF<100 %), aligning more closely with ground-based observations. In Arctic-wide validation experiments, the root mean square error (RMSE) was decreased by approximately 2.5 Wm-2, and the bias was reduced by 1.23 Wm-2, which was an improvement of 8.7 % (reduction of RMSE) against the CERES-EBAF. The even greater improvements were achieved at stations in Greenland (RMSE reduced by 4.53 Wm-2 and a bias reduced by ~6.89 Wm-2, with an accuracy improved about 11.1%). The GCF-CRKs exhibit similar signs and patterns and enhanced stability compared to existing kernels. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that seasonal and interannual variations introduce GCF-CRK uncertainties of approximately 1 Wm-2 %-1 and 0.1 Wm-2 %-1, respectively, while spatial variations within the same latitude range can cause CRK uncertainties of 0.2–1.2 Wm-2 %-1. These uncertainties can result in CRE biases ranging from 5 to 50 Wm-2, which demonstrates the limitations of existing methods that utilize short-term, small-area parameter data to produce global CRKs. Using these GCF-CRKs, we estimated the spatiotemporal properties of the surface shortwave CRE in the Arctic over a 21-year period (2000–2020), and the trend result indicates that despite the increasing influence of the CF on the Arctic DSSR, the smaller magnitude and interannual trend of the annual average surface shortwave CRE suggest that previous studies may have overestimated the magnitude and rate of the cooling effect of clouds on the Arctic DSSR by up to 4 Wm-2 and 0.5 Wm-2 per decade, particularly in Greenland. This study provides a more accurate and efficient assessment of the CRE, and the results underscore the need for more effective measures to mitigate the impact of Arctic amplification on the surface radiative energy balance, which is crucial for understanding and addressing regional and global climate change.

 The development, implementation, and evaluation of a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system for the fully coupled Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) utilizing the four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar) method are presented in this study. The 4DEnVar method, based on the dimension-reduced projection four-dimensional variational (DRP-4DVar) approach, replaces the adjoint model with the ensemble technique, thereby reducing computational demands. Monthly mean ocean temperature and salinity data from the EN4.2.1 reanalysis are integrated into the ocean component of E3SMv2 from 1950 to 2021, with the goal of providing realistic initial conditions for decadal predictions and predictability studies. The performance of the WCODA system is assessed using various metrics, including cost function reduction, root mean square error (RMSE) differences, correlation differences, and model biases. Results indicate that the WCODA system effectively assimilates the reanalysis data into the climate model, achieving consistently negative cost function reductions and notable improvements in RMSE and correlation across various ocean layers and regions. Significant enhancements are observed in the majority of global ocean regions, particularly in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Indian Ocean. Model biases in sea surface temperature and salinity are also substantially reduced. Furthermore, analysis of the connections between the ocean states and the regional climate over the US shows that the WCODA system improves the simulation of interannual precipitation and temperature variability over the southern US. The ultimate goal of the WCODA system is to advance the predictive capabilities of E3SM for subseasonal-to-decadal climate predictions, thereby supporting research on strategic energy-sector policies and planning."

CaFe-LDH presented a specific adsorption behavior and ultrahigh adsorption capacity for HEDP, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 335.7 mg P/g (1116.5 mg HEDP/g) at pH 7.0. X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrated that HEDP adsorption induced a structural transformation of CaFe-LDH from a layered configuration to a highly ordered structure, leading to a noticeable phase transition. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Raman spectroscopy further confirmed that two distinct binding modes of HEDP, relating to chelation with Ca2+ and adsorption on Fe3+ simultaneously, are connected by phosphonic acid groups (−C–PO(OH)2), forming the CaFe-HEDP complex. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the CaFe-HEDP ternary complex exhibits a highly ordered arrangement in an oxygen-bridged framework. The construction of an oxygen-coordinated framework contributes to the incorporation of more HEDP into CaFe-LDH, leading to a well-aligned lattice in the new phase.

However, the coexisting high-concentration chloride ions in wastewater can exert a significant influence on nitrate reduction due to the competitive adsorption and corrosion of Cl– on photocatalysts. Herein, we prepared ethylene glycol-Cu/TiO2–x (EG-Cu/TiO2–x) through a solvothermal reaction of Cu-doped TiO2 in an EG solution. The photodegradation of nitrate using EG-Cu/TiO2–x without adding sacrificial agents can efficiently occur in near-neutral pH solutions containing 50 mM Cl– with 95.26% of NO3– removal and 76.52% of N2 selectivity. Moreover, the photocatalyst performance remained at a high level after 8 cycles. In this work, NO3– was first converted to NH4+ by Cu0 and Ti3+, followed by the NH4+-to-N2 conversion by photogenerated chlorine free radicals. Compared to HO•, Cl•, and Cl2•–, ClO• is proved to play the predominant role in transforming NH4+ to N2. The EG radicals produced by UV light impede Cl– adsorption on Cu, protecting Cu0 from being corroded. What’s more, photoelectrons can reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and protect Cu0 from being oxidized, enabling the stability of reactive sites. This work provides novel insights and understanding on designing photocatalysts for NO3– removal in solutions containing chloride ions, highlighting the significance of eliminating Cl– by EG radicals and adjusting the conversion process of NO3– for the efficient removal of NO3–."

Zooplankton ingested low levels of microplastics (mean of 0.06 particles/individual ± SD 0.07) and generally their total abundance and community composition were not negatively impacted. Temporary changes were however observed; total zooplankton abundance and abundance of calanoid copepods were temporarily stimulated by increasing nominal microplastic concentrations, and modest, short-term reductions in egg production of the cyclopoid copepod Tropocyclops extensus and abundance of copepod nauplii occurred.

This study examines how the gas–salt interface composition of desert salt changes with varying relative humidity (RH), using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Ion chromatography analysis of desert salt indicates it is predominantly composed of sulfate, sodium, and magnesium ions, with traces of calcium, chloride, nitrate, and potassium ions. APXPS and NEXAFS surface analyses show that, at 0% RH, the gas–salt interface primarily features Na2SO4, with smaller amounts of MgSO4 and a trace of NaCl on the top layers. As humidity increases, the composition at the gas–salt interface changes, notably with Mg2+ binding to SO42– ions and a dominant NaCl formation throughout the studied surface depth. This shift indicates a transition from a sulfate- to a chloride-rich surface as humidity increases, contradicting MD simulations that predicted that on salt crystals covered by a submonolayer of water with electrolytes, chloride ions migrate toward the liquid–solid interface. This discrepancy indicates that other factors, like enhanced ionic mobility at grain boundaries, might drive the accumulation of chloride ions at the gas interface.

The increase in consecutive pIOD is dominated by the rise in mixed consecutive pIOD that contains both ENSO‐pIOD and independent pIOD. Mixed consecutive pIOD that start with ENSO‐pIOD increases fastest among all types of consecutive pIOD events.

Here we investigate whether the deglaciation of these events would be triggered more easily at certain orbital configurations than others, by using an atmosphere‐land model that considers meltpond formation on land ice. Results show that the threshold concentration of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2) required for deglaciation can vary from 6 to 10 × 104 ppmv under different orbital forcings. The threshold pCO2 decreases with the equatorial maximum monthly insolation (EMMI), which is affected most by the eccentricity and secondarily by obliquity. Therefore, we conclude that the snowball Earth deglaciation likely occurred when the eccentricity was high and obliquity was low. Compared to previous estimate that used present‐day orbital configuration which has a minimal eccentricity, the duration of snowball Earth events would likely be much shorter when the influence of orbital variations are considered."

However, many sounding measurements may lack laterally extensive features that would aid their physical interpretation. In this scenario, the detection of sparse echoes can also provide rich information on ice shell properties. To explore and demonstrate this possibility, we consider three cases of isolated radar signatures: pore‐curing, eutectic melt, and unattributed echoes. We show that through detection of unattributed sparse echoes, the thickness of the conductive portion of Europa's ice shell can be constrained. These constraints can be improved by attributing sparse echoes to thermally diagnostic signatures such as pore‐curing and eutectic melt. Notably, this approach to radar sounding echo analysis is particularly compatible with joint inversions with other planetary geophysical observations such as tidal deformation, magnetic induction, and rotation state."

Here we demonstrate the compelling suppression of whistler‐mode chorus emissions as a resonant wave with energetic electrons by tuning an external transmitter signal in space plasmas. Through forcible modification of electron motions via phase trapping by the external waves, the nonlinear gyroresonant current is suppressed along with the electron hole deformation. Moreover, this can decrease the population of relativistic electrons due to the lack of coherent resonant waves seen by the phase‐organized electrons. Understanding such nonlinear wave suppression effects is crucial for a potential active control of Earth's plasma environment."

The stratiform zones of two types of precipitating systems are studied, a frontal situation that occurred over Finland in June 2014 and a squall line system observed over Oklahoma in June 2011. An analysis method for determining raindrop trajectories was used to obtain the temporal variation of the total raindrop concentration from the observations. The resulting raindrop concentration rate as a function of the mean volume diameter reveals significant differences with the parameterizations currently used in two‐moment bulk microphysics schemes. These results show that even if they produce variations in raindrop concentration of the same order of magnitude as the observations, the current parameterizations diverge from the median of the observations, resulting in an overestimation of either the self‐collection or the breakup process. From the median of radar observations, new parameterizations of the self‐collection and breakup processes and of rain self‐collection efficiency are developed and can be implemented in two‐moment bulk microphysics schemes."

 The Earth’s mantle is divided by the circum-Pacific subduction girdle into the African and Pacific domains, each featuring a large low-shear-wave-velocity province (LLSVP) in the lower mantle. However, how this hemispherical-scale mantle structure links to Earth’s plate tectonic evolution remains unclear. Previous geochemical work has suggested the presence of a north–south hemispheric subdivision, with large-scale mantle heterogeneities in the Southern Hemisphere, termed the DUPAL (Dupré and Allegre) anomaly. Here we compile elemental and isotopic data of both shallow-mantle-derived oceanic igneous rocks from mid-ocean ridges and deeper-mantle plume-related samples (ocean islands and oceanic plateaus) and analyse these using supervised machine learning classification methods. Data from both shallow- and deeper-mantle-sourced samples illustrate a consistent chemical dichotomy. Our results indicate that heterogeneities in the present-day shallow and deep mantle are not exclusively controlled by the north–south hemispheric DUPAL anomaly. Instead, they are consistent with a chemical dichotomy between the African and Pacific mantle domains and their associated LLSVPs. These observations can best be explained by tectonic supercycles over the past one billion years involving two supercontinents and two superoceans.

 Monocytes directly contribute to atherosclerosis development by their recruitment to plaques in which they differentiate into macrophages. In the present study, we ask how modulating monocyte glucose metabolism could affect their homeostasis and their impact on atherosclerosis. Here we investigate how circulating metabolites control monocyte behavior in blood, bone marrow and peripheral tissues of mice. We find that serum glucose concentrations correlate with monocyte numbers. In diet-restricted mice, monocytes fail to metabolically reprogram from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, leading to reduced monocyte numbers in the blood. Mechanistically, Glut1-dependent glucose metabolism helps maintain CD115 membrane expression on monocytes and their progenitors, and regulates monocyte migratory capacity by modulating CCR2 expression. Results from genetic models and pharmacological inhibitors further depict the relative contribution of different metabolic pathways to the regulation of CD115 and CCR2 expression. Meanwhile, Glut1 inhibition does not impact atherosclerotic plaque development in mouse models despite dramatically reducing blood monocyte numbers, potentially due to the remaining monocytes having increased migratory capacity. Together, these data emphasize the role of glucose uptake and intracellular glucose metabolism in controlling monocyte homeostasis and functions. Monocytes participate in plaque formation, and adapt to metabolic changes to alter their functions. Here the authors show, using genetic mouse models and functional analyses, that Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism is important for regulating monocyte homeostasis and migration, but curiously has no impact on atherosclerotic plaque formation."

 Fluid management remains a critical challenge in the treatment of septic shock, with individualized approaches lacking. This study aims to develop a statistical model based on transcriptomics to identify subgroups of septic shock patients with varied responses to fluid strategy. The study encompasses 494 septic shock patients. A benefit score is derived from the transcriptome space, with higher values indicating greater benefits from restrictive fluid strategy. Adherence to the recommended strategy is associated with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.64–0.92). When applied to the baseline hospital mortality rate of 16%, adherence to the recommended fluid strategy could potentially lower this rate to 13%. A proteomic signature comprising six proteins is developed to predict the benefit score, yielding an area under the curve of 0.802 (95% confidence interval: 0.752–0.846) in classifying patients who may benefit from a restrictive strategy. In this work, we develop a proteomic signature with potential utility in guiding fluid strategy for septic shock patients.

 Despite the growing variety of sequencing and variant-calling tools, no workflow performs equally well across the entire human genome. Understanding context-dependent performance is critical for enabling researchers, clinicians, and developers to make informed tradeoffs when selecting sequencing hardware and software. Here we describe a set of “stratifications,” which are BED files that define distinct contexts throughout the genome. We define these for GRCh37/38 as well as the new T2T-CHM13 reference, adding many new hard-to-sequence regions which are critical for understanding performance as the field progresses. Specifically, we highlight the increase in hard-to-map and GC-rich stratifications in CHM13 relative to the previous references. We then compare the benchmarking performance with each reference and show the performance penalty brought about by these additional difficult regions in CHM13. Additionally, we demonstrate how the stratifications can track context-specific improvements over different platform iterations, using Oxford Nanopore Technologies as an example.

 Edge states in topological systems have attracted great interest due to their robustness and linear dispersions. Here a superconducting-proximitized edge interferometer is engineered on a topological insulator Ta2Pd3Te5 with asymmetric edges to realize the interfering Josephson diode effect (JDE), which hosts many advantages, such as the high efficiency as much as 73% at tiny applied magnetic fields with an ultra-low switching power around picowatt. As an important element to induce such JDE, the second-order harmonic in the current-phase relation is also experimentally confirmed by half-integer Shapiro steps. The interfering JDE is also accompanied by the antisymmetric second harmonic transport, which indicates the corresponding asymmetry in the interferometer, as well as the polarity of JDE. This edge interferometer offers an effective method to enhance the performance of JDE, and boosts great potential applications for future superconducting quantum devices.

 Protein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employ a general reporter based on mutant Hsp104 to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. We identify over 300 proteins that form different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown non-dynamic (solid-like) inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES co-aggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delays ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.

Here, the authors show that centenarians carry fewer harmful loss-of-function mutations and identify genes that may contribute to extreme longevity and healthy aging 
 While previous studies identified common genetic variants associated with longevity in centenarians, the role of the rare loss-of-function (LOF) mutation burden remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the burden of rare LOF mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals from the Longevity Genes Project and LonGenity study cohorts using whole-exome sequencing data. We found that centenarians had a significantly lower burden (11-22%) of LOF mutations compared to controls. Similar effects were also observed in their offspring. Gene-level burden analysis identified 35 genes with depleted LOF mutations in centenarians, with 14 of these validated in the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization and multi-omic analyses on these genes identified RGP1, PCNX2, and ANO9 as longevity genes with consistent causal effects on multiple aging-related traits and altered expression during aging. Our findings suggest that a protective genetic background, characterized by a reduced burden of damaging variants, contributes to exceptional longevity, likely acting in concert with specific protective variants to promote healthy aging.

 Climate justice is increasingly prominent in climate change communication and advocacy but little is known about public understanding of the concept or how widely it resonates with different groups. In our global survey of 5,627 adults in 11 countries spanning the global north and south, most participants (66.2%) had never heard of climate justice. Nonetheless, endorsement of climate justice beliefs was widespread (for example, acknowledging the disproportionate impact of climate change on poor people and the underpinning roles of capitalism and colonialism in the climate crisis). Climate justice beliefs were also associated with various indices of climate action and policy support. These associations tended to be stronger in countries with high GHG emissions and where social inequality is also more politically salient. The results highlight the value of climate justice as a motive for climate action across diverse geographical contexts.

This study looks at hundreds of Global Biodiversity Framework indicators to examine which ones benefit from input from local communities and non-scientists. 
 The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and its monitoring framework aims to reverse the decline of nature. The GBF tasks governments to report progress towards 23 targets and four goals but also “invites Parties and relevant organizations to support community-based monitoring and information systems and citizen science” to improve information for decision-making and build support for conservation efforts throughout society. We assessed how Indigenous Peoples, local communities and citizen scientists and professional scientists can help monitor the GBF. Of the 365 indicators of the GBF monitoring framework, 110 (30%) can involve Indigenous Peoples, local communities and citizen scientists in community-based monitoring programmes, 185 (51%) could benefit from citizen involvement in data collection and 180 (49%) require scientists and governmental statistical organizations. A smaller proportion of indicators for GBF targets are amenable to citizen monitoring than for the previous Aichi targets or other multilateral environment agreements—largely because 196 GBF indicators are analytically complex (54%) and 175 require legislative overview (48%). Greater involvement of citizens in the GBF would increase societal engagement in international agreements, harness knowledge from those living close to nature to fill data gaps and enhance local to national decision-making based on improved information, leading to better conservation actions.

 Warming in the Third Pole region accelerates glacier and snow melt, leading to a rise in glacial lake numbers and sizes. However, accurately measuring their water level changes poses challenges, hindering precise volume assessments and evaluation of glacier mass balance contributions. Here, we took the Ak-Shyirak glaciers and the largest Petrov proglacial lake in the Central Tien Shan as a case study to investigate these phenomena. Specifically, firstly, we conducted mass balance assessments for the Ak-Shyirak massif for six sub-periods from 1973 to 2023 using KH-9 DEMs, SRTM DEM, and ASTER DEMs. The results indicate that glaciers were in a state of rapid melting for 1980–2000 and 2005–2012, with rates of −0.46 m w.e./a and − 0.37 m w.e./a; moderate melting during 1973–1980 and 2012–2018, with rates of −0.26 m w.e./a and − 0.28 m w.e./a, while slower melting during 2000–2005 and 2018–2023, with rates of −0.08 m w.e./a and − 0.18 m w.e./a. Subsequently, we conducted assessments of the area change of Petrov Lake for 1973–2023 using KH-9 and Landsat images. The results reveal a significant increase in the glacial lake area by 2.81 km2 (150.25 %), corresponding to a rate of 0.054 km2/a over the entire study period. Furthermore, we conducted monitoring of Petrov Lake's water level from 2019 to 2023 by utilizing ICESat-2 laser altimetry and Sentinel-3 radar altimetry data. Our findings indicate that the glacial lake level shows intra-annual fluctuations and inter-annual change, with amplitudes of 0.67 ± 0.09 m and increase rate of 0.30 ± 0.05 m/a, respectively, as determined by a periodic fluctuation model. Finally, after a comprehensive analysis of ERA5-Land meteorological data, topography, glacier mass balance, lake area, and water level, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) glacier mass balance is predominantly influenced by the air temperature and snowfall; (2) changes in glacial lake area are driven by factors such as the lake basin, glacier surface elevation, and drainage event; (3) intra-annual fluctuations and inter-annual change in glacial lake levels are both primarily influenced by precipitation and glacier mass balance; (4) glacier mass balance accounts for (36.19 ± 8.47)% of the water supply contributing to changes in glacial lake volume change, while precipitation represents (63.81 ± 5.08)%. Glacier mass balance measurements reveal changing patterns in the Ak-Shyirak massif, Central Tien Shan, due to climate change. Inaugural proglacial lake level measurements provide unique insights into both intra-annual and inter-annual changes, serving as a reference for Third Pole region-wide glacial lake monitoring. Additionally, quantifying glacier meltwater contributions to lake volumes will aid future glacial lake evaluation and potential outburst flood impacts."

 Land cover change detection and classification, including both inter-class changes (land cover conversion, LCC) and intra-class changes (land cover modification, LCM), is critical for understanding the Earth’s dynamic processes and promoting sustainability. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on LCC, with less emphasis on LCM. Land cover classification remains challenging, and its mapping results are often affected by salt and pepper noise. Here, we propose a hybrid approach for continuous change detection and classification of LCC and LCM using Jinchang City, China, as a case study. Firstly, we combined the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) and the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST) algorithms to identify LCC and LCM using all available Landsat time series (TS) data from 2000 to 2020. Then, the harmonic regression coefficients and RMSE values derived from CCDC (hereafter called CCDC features) were fed into the DCNN model for LCC classification. Our findings indicate: (1) For LCC and LCM accuracy assessment, the CCDC and BEAST ensemble achieved a spatial F1 score of 82.7% and an average temporal F1 score of 79.7%. (2) In LCC classification, the DCNN model with CCDC features, particularly DeepLabV3+, outperformed the pixel-based XGBoost and other multi-year land cover products, with frequency-weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), overall accuracy, and Kappa scores of 88.7%, 94%, and 0.87, respectively. (3) Seasonal LCM showed a more concentrated distribution than trend LCM. (4) In Jinchang City, LCM larger than LCC in area, and grassland and cultivated land are the most distributed.

 Low scattering terrain areas introduce complex phase interference, which reduces the accuracy of deformation signal estimation in InSAR(Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques. Existing covariance matrix-based InSAR phase calculation methods often fail to account for translational offset relations between scatterers leading to inaccuracies, and pixels with zero spatial coherence exist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed scatterer InSAR phase estimation method based on the Cross-Correlation complex coherence matrix. The effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified through simulation and actual data. The results show that: (i) The simulation analysis shows that, compared to the traditional covariance matrix method, the optimal Cross-Correlation matrix improves the interferometric phase, coherence, and accuracy by 21.51%, 15.24%, and 6.52%, respectively. (ii) The actual experimental data show that the interferometric phase optimal by the Cross-Correlation matrix can effectively overcome the pseudo-signal caused by spatial hopping and make the phase more continuous. Compared with the traditional covariance matrix, the average a posteriori coherence and average coherence of arbitrary interference combinations in the Cross-Correlation matrix are improved by 18.12% and 58.10%, respectively. (iii) The number of DS points selected by the Cross-Correlation matrix algorithm is more than that of the covariance matrix algorithm. PS-InSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) achieved more accurate deformation rates compared to the covariance and correlation matrices, with errors of 9.34, 17.21, and 16.28 mm∙a-1 when compared against GNSS data, respectively. (iv) The Cross-Correlation matrix reduces the deformation rate error by 5.43 % relative to the covariance matrix. The algorithm provides reliable phase estimation for accurate monitoring of surface deformation in low-scattering regions, supporting geological disaster early warning and resource and environmental management."

 Effective management of corn straw and stubble is critical in conservation tillage, as it impacts soil health and productivity. However, accurate classification of different types of straw cover has been hindered by their similar spectral and spatial characteristics and the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral satellite imagery. Moreover, traditional convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods, which rely on first-order statistics for feature extraction, often struggle to extract distinguishable features of highly similar objects effectively, thereby reducing classification accuracy. In this study, a second-order statistical-feature extraction algorithm based on CNN that uses fused multispectral and hyperspectral data was tested for its ability to classify types of straw cover. In the first step, coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) was used to fuse hyperspectral and multispectral images effectively, thereby enhancing the spatial resolution of the hyperspectral data. In this study, we integrated pointwise convolution (PWC), depthwise convolution (DWC), and a distance covariance matrix (DCM) to form a mixed convolution and DCM (MCDCM) network; we used this to extract and integrate deep spectral–spatial features of the hyperspectral images. Our experimental results show that the MCDCM network significantly improved classification accuracy compared to traditional methods, with accuracy rates for the different straw-cover types exceeding 90% and overall accuracy reaching 98.26%. The fused image also exhibited better preservation of feature edges and contours. The accurate identification of corn-straw-cover types achieved with the proposed MCDCM method is a major step in optimizing conservation-farming practices, improving soil fertility and farm productivity, and supporting sustainable ecological development."

 Automated Aerial Triangulation (AAT), aiming to restore image poses and reconstruct sparse points simultaneously, plays a pivotal role in earth observation. AAT has evolved into a fundamental process widely applied in large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based mapping. However classic AAT methods still face challenges like low efficiency and limited robustness. This paper introduces DeepAAT, a deep learning network designed specifically for AAT of UAV imagery. DeepAAT considers both spatial and spectral characteristics of imagery, enhancing its capability to resolve erroneous matching pairs and accurately predict image poses. DeepAAT marks a significant leap in AAT’s efficiency, ensuring thorough scene coverage and precision. Its processing speed outpaces incremental AAT methods by hundreds of times and global AAT methods by tens of times while maintaining a comparable level of reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, DeepAAT’s scene clustering and merging strategy facilitate rapid localization and pose determination for large-scale UAV images, even under constrained computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepAAT substantially improves over conventional AAT methods, highlighting its potential for increased efficiency and accuracy in UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks.

 Effective geographic environment observation planning is the key to obtain disaster monitoring and warning information. The previous researches can only make observation plans for a single disaster at some specific stages. They are difficult to apply to the dynamic evolution of the disaster chain. Timely and comprehensive geographic environment observation planning is urgently needed to provide high-value monitoring data for the identification and response of secondary disaster chains. Event logic graph (ELG) shows great potential in evolutionary law expression and chain event reasoning. Therefore, this study proposed an observation ELG (OELG), in which events and their logical relationships are modeled as nodes and edges to express the occurrence and development motivation of observation events. The disaster chain observation planning can be transformed into the reasoning of potential continuous observation events. Subsequently, an OELG-based geographic environment observation planning framework was proposed, which realizes the construction, instantiation, and plan reasoning of OELG. The observation planning experiment was carried out taking the flood disaster chain that occurred in Beijing, China and Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany as examples. The results show that OELG can generate disaster chain observation plan more timely, comprehensively, and continuously than other models, thus providing support for disaster chain risk monitoring and emergency response."

 :In this study, the investigation is made to reveal the impact of multi-strategically assimilating Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation and Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) water vapor radiances (WVR) on forecasting a heavy snowfall event in the Eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (EQTP) employing the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) and the Four-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) assimilation system (WRF-4DVar). The multiple data assimilation (DA) strategies include control tests (CON), the individual assimilation of AHI and GPM tests (DA_AHI and DA_GPM) and the joint assimilation of GPM and AHI (DA_G&A), with different initial times. The results indicate that GPM precipitation effectively captures mesoscale atmospheric details, but its scope is confined to a limited area. AHI WVR is sensitive to upper-middle atmospheric humidity and furnishes extensive-scale environmental parameters such as water vapor transport characteristics. The joint assimilation of the two not only yields multi-dimensional atmospheric insights but also addresses the limitations of individual assimilation. Assimilation GPM and AHI are respective sensitivity to the lower layers (about 800hpa) and upper layers (about 400hpa) of model. The individual assimilation GPM has the greatest effect on near-surface humidity field, and AHI plays a dominant role in the joint assimilation. By assimilating different remote sensing products at different initial times of NWPs, the thermodynamic and dynamic structures are variously reconstructed, leading to the different snowfall scenes. In addition, we further compare the 12-hourly cumulative snowfall with in-situ meteorological station observations. The predictions of snowfall from DA_G&A perform much better with the correlation coefficient (CC) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) 0.36 and 3.14 mm, respectively. As for different initial times of NWPs, the best snowfall forecast is 0600 UTC on October 28, 2022, and the CC is 0.4. Nevertheless, accurately predicting precipitation areas, intensity, and temporal variations remains challenging, particularly for solid precipitation like snowfall. Thus, meticulous consideration of weather process characteristics, observation attributes, and relevant parameter configurations during DA are imperative to enhance the efficiency of observation data utilization."

 Global climate models (GCMs) serve as essential tools for projecting future climate trends, but their coarse resolution limits localized impact assessments in sectors like hydrology, agriculture, and biodiversity. Observation data with a spatial resolution of a few kilometers are crucial for downscaling and bias-correcting GCMs at finer resolutions. However, Nepal's extreme topography and organizational challenges have led to uneven distribution of meteorological stations and inconsistent data quality. Moreover, CMIP6-based climate extremes projections for the entire country are currently unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we developed a comprehensive national database for Nepal, offering high-resolution historical and projected precipitation and temperature data analyzed through 25 climate extreme indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Initially, observation grid data were prepared at a daily timescale with a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° for baseline period (1981–2010) using the Asian Precipitation High-Resolved Observational Data Integration Toward Evaluation (APHRODITE), the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA5), and available good quality observed climate data. This data was then utilized to downscale and bias-correct 18 CMIP6 GCMs for 2015–2100 under four SSPs (1–2.6, 2–4.5, 3–7.0, 5–8.5). Quantile mapping was employed for the bias correction of the CMIP6 GCMs. The performance of the multimodal ensemble (MME) indicated better Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), root mean square error ratio (RSR), and Percent Bias (PBIAS) of climate extreme indices for the historical period. A comparative analysis was conducted across Nepal's major geographic regions to account for spatial variability in regional climate systems. The finer-resolution dataset can be crucial to deepen our understanding of climate impacts, and climate change, and eventually informing the policy-making in Nepal. Moreover, the methodology can be effectively replicated in data-scarce developing nations to promote climate research and adaptation efforts."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of MBV on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in vitro and particulate-induced osteolysis in vivo. Results showed that MBV attenuated osteoclast differentiation and activity by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway and downstream NFATc1, DC-STAMP, c-Src, and cathepsin K expression.

The reorganization of activity is so profound that decoding of sound representation under anesthesia is not possible based on awake activity. However, population-level parameters, such as average tuning strength and population decoding accuracy, are weakly affected by anesthesia, explaining why its effect has previously gone unnoticed when comparing independently sampled neurons. Together, our results indicate that the functional organization of the auditory brainstem largely depends on the network state and is ill-defined under anesthesia.

Here, we developed a strategy that limits the atomic diffusion within surface layers, fostering the phase transition and shape retention during thermal treatment. This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells. Density functional calculations suggest that the ordered intermetallic surface stabilizes morphology against rapid corrosion and improves the ORR activity.

Cells in a population enter sporulation nonuniformly to secure against the possibility that favorable growth conditions, which put sporulation-committed cells at a disadvantage, may resume.

Here, we identify a cell-cell communication pathway containing the proteins ShfA (YabQ) and ShfP (YvnB) that actively promotes phenotypic heterogeneity, whereinBacillus subtiliscells that start sporulating early use a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase to release glycerol, which simultaneously acts as a signaling molecule and a nutrient to delay nonsporulating cells from entering sporulation.

Here, we examine temporal trends in the diversity of nitrogen-fixing plants and their relationships with anthropogenic nitrogen deposition while accounting for changes in temperature and aridity. We used forest-floor vegetation resurveys of temperate forests in Europe and the United States spanning multiple decades. Nitrogen-fixer richness declined as nitrogen deposition increased over time but did not respond to changes in climate. Phylogenetic diversity also declined, as distinct lineages of N-fixers were lost between surveys, but the “winners” and “losers” among nitrogen-fixing lineages varied among study sites, suggesting that losses are context dependent. Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition reduces nitrogen-fixing plant diversity in ways that may strongly affect natural nitrogen fixation."

Thus, precise in situ monitoring of toxic gases in the atmosphere is crucial. Here, we present an artificial olfactory system for spatiotemporal recognition of NO2gas flow by integrating a network of chemical receptors with a near-sensor computing. The artificial olfactory receptor features nano-islands of metal-based catalysts that cover the graphene surface on the heterostructure of an AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel. Catalytically dissociated NO2molecules bind to graphene, thereby modulating the conductivity of the 2DEG channel. For the energy/resource-efficient gas flow monitoring, trust-region Bayesian optimization algorithm allocates many sensors optimally in a complex space. Integrated artificial neural networks on a compact microprocessor with a network of sensors provide in situ gas flow predictions. This system enhances protective measures against toxic environments through spatiotemporal monitoring of toxic gases."

Here, a void-free ion-permeable interface between the solid-state polymer electrolyte and electrode is constructed in situ during cycling using charge/discharge voltage as the stimulus. During the charge-discharge, the permeation phase fills the voids at the interface and penetrates the electrode, forming strong bonds with the cathode and effectively mitigating the contact problem. Our all-solid-state potassium ion polymer batteries maintain high Coulombic efficiency more than 2000 cycles at a high operating voltage of 4.5 volt and stably cycle more than 500 cycles even at 4.6 volt. Our rational design for mitigating the contact problem is versatile, as demonstrated by the scalability of all-solid-state graphite-based polymer potassium-ion pouch cells and all-solid-state lithium-ion polymer batteries."

Wyatt Shields,Acoustic pipette and biofunctional elastomeric microparticle system for rapid picomolar-level biomolecule detection in whole blood,"Most biosensing techniques require complex processing steps that generate prolonged workflows and introduce potential points of error. Here, we report an acoustic pipette to purify and label biomarkers in 70 minutes. A key aspect of this technology is the use of functional negative acoustic contrast particles (fNACPs), which display biorecognition motifs for the specific capture of biomarkers from whole blood. Because of their large size and compressibility, the fNACPs robustly trap along the pressure antinodes of a standing wave and separate from blood components in under 60 seconds with >99% efficiency. fNACPs are subsequently fluorescently labeled in the pipette and are analyzed by both a custom, portable fluorimeter and flow cytometer. We demonstrate the detection of anti-ovalbumin antibodies from blood at picomolar levels (35 to 60 pM) with integrated controls showing minimal nonspecific adsorption. Overall, this system offers a simple and versatile approach for the rapid, sensitive, and specific capture of biomolecules."

Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into transplantable dopamine (DA) progenitors which are proliferative at the time of grafting and undergo terminal differentiation and maturation in vivo. While the progenitors are homogeneous at the time of transplantation, they give rise to heterogeneous grafts composed not only of therapeutic DA neurons but also of other mature cell types. The mechanisms for graft diversification are unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to profile DA progenitors before transplantation combined with molecular barcode-based tracing to determine origin and shared lineages of the mature cell types in the grafts. Our data demonstrate that astrocytes, vascular leptomeningeal cells, and DA neurons are the main component of the DAergic grafts, originating from a common progenitor that is tripotent at the time of transplantation."

Nonetheless, the necessity of the main astrocyte glucose transporter, i.e., GLUT1, for brain glucose metabolism has not been defined. Unexpectedly, we found that brain glucose metabolism was paradoxically augmented in mice with astrocytic GLUT1 reduction (GLUT1ΔGFAPmice). These mice also exhibited improved peripheral glucose metabolism especially in obesity, rendering them metabolically healthier. Mechanistically, we observed that GLUT1-deficient astrocytes exhibited increased insulin receptor–dependent ATP release, and that both astrocyte insulin signaling and brain purinergic signaling are essential for improved brain function and systemic glucose metabolism. Collectively, we demonstrate that astrocytic GLUT1 is central to the regulation of brain energetics, yet its depletion triggers a reprogramming of brain metabolism sufficient to sustain energy requirements, peripheral glucose homeostasis, and cognitive function."

Conversely, histology and virtual histology methods have lacked metabolic contrast. Here, we present metabolic light absorption, scattering, and emission (MetaLASE) microscopy, which rapidly provides a virtual histology and optical metabolic readout simultaneously. Hematoxylin-like nucleic contrast and eosin-like cytoplasmic contrast are obtained using photoacoustic remote sensing and ultraviolet reflectance microscopy, respectively. The same ultraviolet source excites endogenous Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), flavin adenine dinucleotide, and collagen autofluorescence, providing a map of optical redox ratios to visualize metabolic variations including in areas of invasive carcinoma. Benign chronic inflammation and glands also are seen to exhibit hypermetabolism.
