This study investigates the potential for integrating streamflow derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and U.S. National Water Model (NWM) reanalysis estimates to develop improved predictions of above-normal flow (ANF) over the coterminous US. Leveraging the SAR data from the Global Flood Detection System to estimate the antecedent conditions using principal component regression, we apply the spatial-temporal hierarchical model (STHM) using NWM outputs for improving ANF prediction. Our evaluation shows promising results with the integrated model, STHM-SAR, significantly improving NWE, especially in 60% of the sites in the coastal region. Spatial and temporal validations underscore the model’s robustness, with SAR data contributing to explained variance by 24% on average. This approach not only improves NWM prediction, but also uniquely combines existing remote sensing data with national-scale predictions, showcasing its potential to improve hydrological modeling, particularly in regions with limited stream gauges."

The potential of the P2OA is illustrated through several examples of process studies. 
 The Pyrenean Platform for Observation of the Atmosphere (P2OA) is a coupled plain–mountain instrumented platform in southwestern France. It is composed of two physical sites: the “Pic du Midi” mountaintop observatory (2877 m a.s.l.) and the “Centre de Recherches Atmosphériques” (600 m a.s.l).

10.5194/amt-17-6247-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这项研究探讨了利用遥感技术改善景观火灾烟雾排放量和成分估算的可行性。研究人员测试了两种通过实验室火灾确定燃烧阶段的方法，并将其与排放的烟雾进行了比较。其中一种方法——检测钾发射线（K线）——与火辐射功率（FRP）数据结合，显著提高了对烟雾排放量的估算精度，特别是二氧化碳（CO2）的排放量提高了17%-42%。该方法还改善了对一氧化碳（CO）、甲烷（CH4）和改进燃烧效率（MCE）的估算。MCE与许多烟雾成分的排放因子相关，因此远程获取MCE可以改进烟雾排放计算。研究人员还利用机载遥感数据验证了该方法在实际野火中的有效性。研究结果表明，结合使用K线和FRP数据的卫星遥感方法可以显著改进景观火灾燃烧阶段、燃料消耗以及烟雾排放量和成分的测绘，这对于大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析具有重要意义。,"['smoke emission', 'fire combustion phase', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite remote sensing', 'air quality monitoring', 'CO2', 'CO', 'CH4', 'Potassium emission line', 'Fire radiative power', 'Modified combustion efficiency', 'Airborne EO data']",Farrer Owsley-Brown;Martin J. Wooster;Mark J. Grosvenor;Yanan Liu,Can the remote sensing of combustion phase improve estimates of landscape fire smoke emission rate and composition?,"Landscape fires produce vast amounts of smoke, affecting the atmosphere locally and globally. Whether a fire is flaming or smouldering strongly impacts the rate at which smoke is produced as well as its composition. This study tested two methods to determine these combustion phases in laboratory fires and compared them to the smoke emitted. One of these methods improved estimates of smoke emission significantly. This suggests potential for improvement in global emission estimates. 
 The proportion of flaming and smouldering (or smoldering) activity occurring in landscape fires varies with fuel type and fuel characteristics, which themselves are influenced by ecology, meteorology, time since the last fire, etc. The proportion of these combustion phases greatly influences the rate of fuel consumption and smoke emission, along with the chemical composition of the smoke, which influences the effects on the atmosphere. Earth observation (EO) has long been suggested as a way to remotely map combustion phase, and here we provide the first known attempt at evaluating whether such approaches can lead to the desired improvements in smoke emissions estimation. We use intensively measured laboratory burns to evaluate two EO approaches hypothesized to enable remote determination of combustion phase and concurrent measurements of the smoke to determine how well each is able to improve estimation of smoke emission rates, smoke composition, and the overall rate of fuel consumption. The first approach aims to estimate the sub-pixel “effective fire temperature”, which has been suggested to differ between flaming and smouldering combustion, and the second detects the potassium emission line (K-line) believed only to be present during flaming combustion. We find while the fire effective temperature approach can be suited to estimating fire radiative power (FRP), it does not significantly improve on current approaches to estimate smoke chemical makeup and smoke emission. The K-line approach does however provide these improvements when combined with the FRP data, improving the accuracy of the estimated CO2 emission rate by an average of 17±4 % and 42±15 %, respectively, depending on whether the K-line detection is used to simply classify the presence of flaming combustion or whether its magnitude is also used to estimate its relative proportion. Estimates of CO and CH4 emission rates were improved to a lesser extent than that of CO2, but the accuracy of the smoke modified combustion efficiency (MCE) estimates increased by 30±15 % and 46±10 %, respectively. MCE is correlated to the emissions factors (EFs) of many smoke constituents, so remotely deriving MCE provides a way to tailor these during smoke emissions calculations. Whilst we derived and tested our approaches on laboratory burns, we demonstrate their wider efficacy using airborne EO data of a boreal forest wildfire where we find that combined use of K-line and FRP data significantly changed estimated smoke MCE and CO2 and CO emission rates compared to the standard approach. Our findings suggest that satellite EO methods that jointly provide K-line and FRP data could enable marked improvements in the mapping of landscape fire combustion phase, fuel consumption, and smoke emissions rate and composition."

Ladino,The UNAM-MARine Aerosol Tank (UNAM-MARAT): An Evaluation of the Ice-Nucleating Abilities of seawater from the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Pacific,"The present study shows the development of the UNAM-MARine Aerosol Tank (UNAM-MARAT), a device that simulates wave breaking to generate marine aerosol particles. The portable and automatic tank is able to generate particle concentrations as high as 2000 cm-3 covering a wide range of sizes, similar to those found in the ambient marine boundary layer. The Sea spray aerosol generated from three natural seawater samples was found to act as ice nucleating particles (INP) via immersion freezing. 
 Although several studies have shown that sea spray aerosol (SSA) has the potential to act as ice nucleating particles (INP) impacting cloud formation, there is a lack of marine INP studies in tropical latitudes. This is partly due to the unavailability of local oceanographic cruises that perform aerosol-cloud interaction studies in the tropics, as well as the scarcity of appropriate aerosol and cloud microphysics instrumentation. The present study shows the development of the UNAM-MARine Aerosol Tank (UNAM-MARAT), a device that simulates wave breaking to generate SSA particles with the main purpose to characterize their physicochemical properties including their ice nucleating abilities. The UNAM-MARAT was characterized using Instant Ocean Sea Salt and its potential to study ambient sea waters was evaluated with sea seawater samples collected from the Port of Veracruz (PoV) in the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Bay of Acapulco (BoA) and the Bay of Santiago- Manzanillo (BoSM) in the Mexican Pacific Ocean. The portable and automatic UNAM-MARAT is able to generate aerosol particle concentrations as high as 2000 cm-3 covering a wide range of sizes, from 30 nm to 10 μm, similar to those found in the ambient marine boundary layer. The SSA generated from the three natural seawater samples was found to act as INP via immersion freezing, with INP concentrations as high as 130.7 L-1. The particles generated from the BoA seawater samples were the most efficient INPs, reporting the highest ice active site density (ns) values between -20 and -30 °C. Our results also show the direct relationship between particle size and its composition. Larger particles (> 1 μm) were found to be enriched in sodium chloride. In contrast, the fraction of Ca2+, Mg2+, and NO3- was found to increase with decreasing the particle size from 10 μm to 320 nm. This suggests the presence of dissolved organic material in the submicron particles."

Part I: Nighttime 532 nm Polarization and High-Spectral-Resolution Channel,"This paper presents a comprehensive calibration procedure for the first spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar with an iodine vapor absorption filter ACDL on board DQ-1 by utilizing nighttime 532 nm multi-channel data. And analyzed the error sources of the multi-channel calibration coefficients and assessed the results. The results shows that the ACDL polarization and HSRL channel calibration is reliable and operates within the expected error range of approximately 5 %. 
 The Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (DQ-1) was successfully launched in April 2022, with the capability of providing continuous multi-sensor spatial and optical simultaneous observations of carbon dioxide, aerosols and clouds. The primary payload carried on DQ-1 is an Aerosol and Carbon dioxide Detection Lidar (ACDL). The instrument comprises a high-spectral-resolution channel at 532 nm, polarization channels at 532 nm, elastic scattering channel at 1064 nm, and integrated-path differential absorption (IPDA) channel at 1572 nm. The optical properties of aerosols and clouds measured by the ACDL promote a quantitative characterization of the uncertainties in the global climate system, hence the precise calibrations for the ACDL are necessary. This paper outlines the algorithms employed for calibrating the nighttime 532 nm measurements for the first spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar with an iodine vapor absorption filter. The nighttime calibrations of the 532 nm data are fundamental to the ACDL measurement procedure, as they are utilized to derive the calibrations over daytime orbits and the calibrations of the 1064 nm channel relative to the 532 nm channel. This paper provides a review of the theoretical foundations for molecular normalization techniques as applied to spaceborne lidar measurements, includes a detailed discussion of auxiliary data and theoretical parameters used in ACDL calibrations, as well as a comprehensive description of the calibration algorithm procedure. To mitigate large errors stemming from high-energy events during calibration, a data filter is designed to obtain valid calibration signals. The paper also assesses the results of the calibration procedure, by analyzing the errors of calibration coefficients and validating the attenuated backscatter coefficient results. The results indicate that the relative error of the calibrated attenuated backscatter coefficients is lower than 1 % in the calibration area, and the uncertainty of the clear-air scattering ratio was within anticipated range of 6 %."

Both satellites provide high precision and accuracy, making them suitable for emission flux estimates. Simulations using a Lagrangian dispersion model showed that background mixing ratio variations play a larger role than local source changes. 
 The OCO-2 and GOSAT series of satellites provide near-global coverage of CO2 and CH4 mixing ratios. To accurately derive emission fluxes from the observed mixing ratios, it is crucial that these data meet specific precision and systematic error requirements. In this study, we report validation results for GOSAT and OCO-2 over South Asia, obtained using a portable Fourier Transform infrared Spectrometer (FTS) at a tropical rural site (Gadanki; Latitude: 13.45° N, Longitude: 79.18° E) in Southern India, from November 2015 to July 2016. Biases in CH4 mixing ratios from GOSAT ranged from -9 to -18.5 ppb, depending on the collocation criteria, while CO2 data from OCO-2 demonstrated better accuracy and precision, meeting the requirements of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI). Using the FLEXPART model, we also show that CH4 emissions from regional sources accounted for only 35 % of the day-to-day observed variability. Both model-derived and observed mixing ratios exhibited the same seasonal variation, with higher values in October–November and lower values in June–July. However, the observed mixing ratios decreased by approximately 100 ppb, while the model-derived values decreased by only 20 ppb, suggesting that atmospheric chemistry and variations in background concentrations play a significant role over South India."

 The initial release of near-real-time (NRT) atmospheric and oceanic science products from Japanese Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 (H8/9) geostationary (GEO) satellites over the South China Sea (SCS) was unveiled in 2024. The primary objective behind crafting these NRT H8/9 satellite products is to facilitate weather and marine environment monitoring, enhance maritime security, and aid ocean navigation, among other purposes. As part of this investigation, a novel NRT data processing system was devised to generate a variety of regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products within a resolution of 10 min and a gridded resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° from 3 November 2022 to the present. This algorithm system was built upon the preceding Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellite algorithm test bed (FYGAT), which was the prototype of the FY-4 GEO meteorological satellite science product operational processing system. These regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products encompass a range of crucial data such as cloud mask, fraction, height, phase, optical, and microphysical properties; layered precipitable water; and sea surface temperature. We subjected these products to rigorous evaluations against high-quality analogous satellite products and reanalysis data spanning 1 year in 2023. The validations underscore a strong consistency between the H8/9 GEO satellite atmospheric and oceanic science products over the SCS and the referenced products. Nevertheless, slight discrepancies in these satellite science products were identified, primarily stemming from variations in sensor/dataset characteristics, retrieval algorithms, and geometric conditions. These outcomes demonstrate the suitability of the first edition of NRT atmospheric and oceanic science products of H8/9 satellites over the SCS in supporting the intended quantitative applications.

 Based on historical documents, population data, published results, remote sensing data products, statistical data, and survey data, this study reconstructed the cropland area and the spatial pattern changes at 28 time points from 1000 to 2020 in Northeast China. The period from 1000 to 1600 corresponds to historical provincial-level administrative districts, while the period from 1700 to 2020 corresponds to modern county-level administrative districts. The main findings are as follows: (1) the cropland in Northeast China exhibited phase changes of expansion–reduction–expansion over the past millennium. (2) The cropland area in Northeast China increased from 0.55×104 km2 in 1000 to 37.90×104 km2 in 2020, and the average cropland fraction increased from 0.37 % to 26.27 %; (3) from 1000 to 1200, the cropland area exhibited an increasing trend, which peaked in 1200. The scope of land reclamation was comparable to modern times, but the overall cropland fraction remained low. The cropland area significantly decreased between 1300 and 1600, with the main land reclamation area being reduced southward into Liaoning province. From 1700 to 1850, the cropland area increased slowly and the agricultural reclamation gradually expanded northward.

Despite its significance, accurate mapping remains limited. Our study addresses this gap by introducing a novel 10 m global dataset of sugarcane maps spanning 2019–2022. Comparisons with field data, pre-existing maps, and official government statistics all indicate the high precision and high recall of our maps. 
 Sugarcane is an important source of food, biofuel, and farmer income in many countries. At the same time, sugarcane is implicated in many social and environmental challenges, including water scarcity and nutrient pollution. Currently, few of the top sugar-producing countries generate reliable maps of where sugarcane is cultivated. To fill this gap, we introduce a dataset of detailed sugarcane maps for the top 13 producing countries in the world, comprising nearly 90 % of global production. Maps were generated for the 2019–2022 period by combining data from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Sentinel-2 (S2). GEDI data were used to provide training data on where tall and short crops were growing each month, while S2 features were used to map tall crops for all cropland pixels each month. Sugarcane was then identified by leveraging the fact that, among all non-tree species grown in cropland areas, sugarcane is typically tall for the largest fraction of time. Comparisons with field data, pre-existing maps, and official government statistics all indicated high precision and high recall of our maps. Agreement with field data at the pixel level exceeded 80 % in most countries, and subnational sugarcane areas from our maps were consistent with government statistics. Exceptions appeared mainly due to problems in underlying cropland masks or due to under-reporting of sugarcane area by governments. The final maps should be useful in studying the various impacts of sugarcane cultivation and producing maps of related outcomes such as sugarcane yields.

Presented here is the Great Barrier Reef Coral Skeletal Records Database, an extensive compilation of GBR coral records. The database includes key metadata, primary data, and access instructions, and it enhances research on past, present, and future climate and environmental variability of the GBR. The database will assist with contextualising present-day threats to reefs globally. 
 The Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, has a long history of palaeoenvironmental coral research. However, it can be logistically difficult to find the relevant research and records, which are often unpublished or exist as “grey literature”. This hinders researchers' abilities to efficiently assess the current state of coral core studies on the GBR and thus identify any key knowledge gaps. This study presents the Great Barrier Reef Coral Skeletal Records Database (GBRCD), which compiles 208 records from coral skeletal research conducted since the early 1990s. The database includes records from the Holocene, from ∼8000 years ago, to the present day; records are from the northern, central, and southern GBR from inshore and offshore locations. Massive Porites spp. coral records comprise the majority (92.5 %) of the database, and the remaining records are from Acropora, Isopora, or Cyphastrea spp. The database includes 78 variables, with Sr/Ca, U/Ca, and Ba/Ca being the most frequently measured. Most records measure data over 10 or more years and are at monthly or lower resolution. The GBRCD is machine readable and easily searchable so that users can find records relevant to their research, e.g. by filtering for site name, time period, or coral type. It is publicly available as comma-separated values (CSV) data and metadata files with entries linked by the unique record ID and as Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) files. The GBRCD is publicly available from the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information World Data Service for Paleoclimatology at https://doi.org/10.25921/hqxk-8h74 (Arzey et al., 2024). The intention is to update the GBRCD annually, depending on the availability of relevant new GBR records or submission of legacy records to the GBRCD for archiving. The collection and curation of existing GBR coral research data provide researchers with the ability to analyse common proxies such as Sr/Ca across multiple locations and/or examine regional to reef-scale trends. The database is also suitable for multi-proxy comparisons and combination or composite analyses to determine overarching changes recorded by the proxies. This database represents the first comprehensive compilation of coral records from the GBR. It enables the investigation of multiple environmental factors via various proxy systems for the GBR, northeastern Australia, and potentially the broader Indo-Pacific region."

 The frequency and severity of fire weather have increased under climate change, particularly in high-latitude boreal forests. Lightning, a key ignition source globally, is also expected to become more frequent with climate change and could significantly increase burn area. Current research on lightning-ignited wildfires (LIW) has a long history in boreal ecosystems but has typically focused on North America due to better data availability, while the lack of publicly available data for Eurasia has hindered our comprehensive understanding of important characteristics of LIW, such as holdover time, lightning-ignition efficiency, frequency, and spatial distribution of lightning-ignited wildfires in boreal forests. This study introduces the Temporal Minimum Distance (TMin) method, a novel approach to matching lightning strikes with wildfires without requiring ignition location, that outperformed current methodologies. As a result, we developed a comprehensive dataset of lightning-ignited wildfires across the entire boreal forest from 2012 to 2022, encompassing 6,228 fires — 4,186 in Eurasia and 2,042 in North America — each over 200 hectares in size.

10.5194/gmd-17-7513-2024,False,Geoscientific Model Development,这篇论文关注的是城市环境下高精度空气质量建模的挑战，特别是稳定大气条件下的建模。研究使用了PALM模型进行大涡模拟(LES)，重点关注布拉格一个高交通住宅区的街道峡谷通风。研究发现，该模型对气象边界条件和模型参数极其敏感，尤其是在稳定条件下，这会导致模拟结果与观测结果存在较大偏差。为了改进模型，研究人员测试了多种参数调整方案，包括增加人为热量、设置湍流动能下限、调整合成湍流发生器的参数以及限制模型时间步长。结果表明，这些调整能够显著降低稳定条件下污染物浓度的高估，但对其他条件下的模拟结果影响很小。这说明改进PALM模型中这些过程是可取的，即使它们在大多数其他条件下的影响可以忽略不计。此外，时间步长限制测试揭示了由于离散化误差造成的数值不精确性，这在极端稳定的条件下会出现。总而言之，该研究并非直接使用大气环境遥感技术，而是关注数值模拟方法的改进，以提高城市空气质量建模的精度。,"['air quality modeling', 'urban air pollution', 'meteorological boundary conditions', 'numerical modeling', 'large eddy simulation (LES)', 'PALM model', 'street canyon ventilation']",Jaroslav Resler;Petra Bauerová;Michal Belda;Martin Bureš;Kryštof Eben;Vladimír Fuka;Jan Geletič;Radek Jareš;Jan Karel;Josef Keder;Pavel Krč;William Patiño;Jelena Radović;Hynek Řezníček;Matthias Sühring;Adriana Šindelářová;Ondřej Vlček,Challenges of high-fidelity air quality modeling in urban environments – PALM sensitivity study during stable conditions,"Detailed modeling of urban air quality in stable conditions is a challenge. We show the unprecedented sensitivity of a large eddy simulation (LES) model to meteorological boundary conditions and model parameters in an urban environment under stable conditions. We demonstrate the crucial role of boundary conditions for the comparability of results with observations. The study reveals a strong sensitivity of the results to model parameters and model numerical instabilities during such conditions. 
 Urban air quality is an important part of human well-being, and its detailed and precise modeling is important for efficient urban planning. In this study the potential sources of errors in large eddy simulation (LES) runs of the PALM model in stable conditions for a high-traffic residential area in Prague, Czech Republic, with a focus on street canyon ventilation, are investigated. The evaluation of the PALM model simulations against observations obtained during a dedicated campaign revealed unrealistically high concentrations of modeled air pollutants for a short period during a winter inversion episode. To identify potential reasons, the sensitivities of the model to changes in meteorological boundary conditions and adjustments of model parameters were tested. The model adaptations included adding the anthropogenic heat from cars, setting a bottom limit of the subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), adjusting the profiles of parameters of the synthetic turbulence generator in PALM, and limiting the model time step. The study confirmed the crucial role of the correct meteorological boundary conditions for realistic air quality modeling during stable conditions. Besides this, the studied adjustments of the model parameters proved to have a significant impact in these stable conditions, resulting in a decrease in concentration overestimation in the range 30 %–66 % while exhibiting a negligible influence on model results during the rest of the episode. This suggested that the inclusion or improvement of these processes in PALM is desirable despite their negligible impact in most other conditions. Moreover, the time step limitation test revealed numerical inaccuracies caused by discretization errors which occurred during such extremely stable conditions."

This paper describes how the model works and the results it can produce, and how these compare to results from other models. 
 SuCCESs is a bottom-up Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) that represents energy production and use, materials production, land-use and climate globally. The primary use-case for SuCCESs is to calculate long-term scenarios until 2100 that consider the interactions between these systems, for example the greenhouse gas emissions from energy, materials and land-use and their impact on climate change. The four systems are hard-linked in SuCCESs and scenarios are solved through intertemporal optimization by minimizing discounted system costs to satisfy projected demand and other constraints, e.g. climate targets. This yields a long-term equilibrium solution between the modelled systems. This article introduces the model logic and structure, describes the overall representation of each system, and provides an evaluation by comparing the scenarios produced by SuCCESs with different end-of-century radiative forcing targets to those from other IAMs. Towards this end, and to demonstrate the capability of SuCCESs for large-scale scenario exploration, we also conduct a sensitivity analysis employing Monte Carlo sampling with a 1000-member scenario ensemble for each radiative forcing target. Last, we discuss some practical aspects and different ways of using the model in long-term scenario analyses."

However, limited information is available regarding their synergistic dechlorinating ability for chloroethenes when nZVI is sulfidated (S-nZVI) under the organic electron donor–limited conditions typically found in deep aquifers. Herein, we developed a combined system utilizing a mixed culture containing Dehalococcoides (Dhc) and S-nZVI particles, which achieved sustainable dechlorination with repeated rounds of spiking with 110 μM perchloroethene (PCE). The relative abundance of Dhc considerably increased from 5.2 to 91.5% after five rounds of spiking with PCE, as evidenced by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. S-nZVI corrosion generated hydrogen as an electron donor for Dhc and other volatile fatty acid (VFA)-producing bacteria. Electron balance analysis indicated that 68.1% of electrons from Fe0 consumed in S-nZVI were involved in dechlorination, and 6.2, 1.1, and 3.2% were stored in formate, acetate, and other VFAs, respectively. The produced acetate possibly served as a carbon source for Dhc. Metagenomic analysis revealed that Desulfovibrio, Syntrophomonas, Clostridium, and Mesotoga were likely involved in VFA production. These findings provide valuable insights into the synergistic mechanisms of biotic and abiotic dechlorination, with important implications for sustainable remediation of electron donor–limited aquifers contaminated by chloroethenes."

While previous studies have reported O3 production from GUV222, less is known about their impact on other indoor constituents affecting indoor air quality, especially in real occupied environments. In this study, the effects of GUV222 on the levels of ozone (O3), ultrafine particles (UFPs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated across multiple offices with varying occupancies. O3 from the GUV222 operation was observed to increase linearly (∼300 μg h–1 m–1) with a UV light path length from 0 to 3 m beyond which it stabilized. When applied in offices, the O3 production models based on continuous measurements revealed O3 production rates of 1040 ± 87 μg h–1. The resulting increases in steady-state concentrations of 5–21 μg m–3 were highly dependent on the number of office occupants. UFP production occurred during both unoccupied and occupied conditions but predominantly in newly renovated offices. Time-resolved measurements with a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) revealed clear alterations in office VOC concentrations. Unsurprisingly, O3 oxidation chemistry was observed, including monoterpene deprivation and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) production.

Specifically, the plastic film generated 66–2034 MPs/cm2 (size range 10–5000 μm) under simulated aging conditions involving microwave irradiation, heating, steaming, UV irradiation, refrigeration, freezing, and freeze–thaw cycling alongside contact with water, which were 15–453 times that of the control (plastic film immersed in water without aging). We also noticed a substantial release of plastic-derived DOM. Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified 321–1414 analytes with molecular weights ranging from 200 to 800 Da, representing plastic-derived DOM containing C, H, and O. The DOM substances included both degradation products of polyethylene (including oxidized forms of oligomers) and toxic plastic additives. Interestingly, although no apparent oxidation was observed for the plastic film under aging conditions, plastic-derived DOM was more oxidized (average O/C increased by 27–46%) following aging with a higher state of carbon saturation and higher polarity.

All but two of the compounds showed significant spatial variability in rate constants across European rivers (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The median standard deviation of the biodegradation rate constant between rivers was a factor of 3. The spatial variability was similar between pristine and contaminated river segments. The longitude, total organic carbon, and clay content of sediment were the three most significant explanatory variables for the spatial variability (redundancy analysis, P < 0.05). Similarities in the spatial pattern of biodegradation rates were observed for some groups of compounds sharing a given functional group.

Climate variability on centennial timescales has often been linked to internal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). However, due to the scarceness of suitable paleoclimate proxies and long climate model simulations, large uncertainties remain on the magnitude and physical mechanisms driving centennial‐scale AMOC variability. For these reasons, we perform a systematic multi‐model comparison of centennial‐scale AMOC variability in pre‐industrial control simulations of state‐of‐the‐art global climate models. Six out of nine models in this study exhibit a statistically significant mode of centennial‐scale AMOC variability. Our results show that freshwater exchanges between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic provide a plausible driving mechanism in a subset of models, and that AMOC variability can be amplified by ocean–sea ice feedbacks in the Labrador Sea. The amplifying mechanism is linked to sea ice cover biases, which could provide an observational constraint for centennial‐scale AMOC variability."
10.1029/2024GL110108,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了印度洋偶极子模态(IOD)对中国行星边界层臭氧的影响。它利用长期GEOS-Chem模拟结果，分析了IOD正负位相期间中国各地行星边界层臭氧的变化。研究发现，夏季IOD正位相期间，中国大部分地区臭氧浓度增加，但南方地区除外。北方地区臭氧增加主要由化学生成和输送造成，南方地区则因降水增加和太阳辐射减少而臭氧生成受到抑制。秋季，南方地区臭氧减少的原因与夏季相同，而北方地区臭氧增加则更多地受到太阳辐射和相对湿度变化的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到对大气成分（臭氧）的分析，并利用了模型模拟结果来研究大气变化，这与卫星观测和空气质量监测等遥感技术应用息息相关。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Planetary Boundary Layer ozone', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'GEOS-Chem simulations']",Zhongjing Jiang;Jing Li;Guanyu Liu;Chongzhao Zhang,Impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode on Planetary Boundary Layer Ozone in China,"The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode exerts distinct impacts on the climate in China and can further affect tropospheric ozone. Using long‐term GEOS‐Chem simulations, we found distinct changes in planetary boundary layer ozone throughout China during positive and negative phases of IOD. In summer, ozone shows synchronized increases except in southern China during positive IOD; the ozone increases are dominated by chemical production and transport in northern and western China, respectively. The increased precursor from biogenic emissions contributed to ozone chemical formation in the northern region, and the increased precipitation and decreased solar radiation hindered ozone production in southern China. Ozone changes show good symmetry over most regions during negative IOD. In autumn, the ozone reduction in southern China shares the same reason as summer, while the chemical increase over northern China is affected more by changes in solar radiation and relative humidity than in the precursor emission."

We measure the in‐situ fluid pressure and local strain response of a fractured carbonate sample to hydrostatic pressure oscillations. A linear poroelastic model that represents the rock sample is parameterized using X‐ray imaging and ultrasonic wave transmission measurements. The numerical solution, based on Biot's quasistatic equations, is consistent with the measured frequency dependent dispersion of the apparent bulk modulus of the background matrix and the in‐situ pore pressure response, which is caused by fluid pressure diffusion from the compliant fractures into the stiffer matrix. The observed fluid pressure diffusion is causally related to the numerically quantified intrinsic attenuation at seismic frequencies, which is a major contributor to the dissipation of seismic waves. Our analysis supports the use of a simple approximation of fractures as compliant and planar inclusions in numerical simulations based on linear poroelasticity."

These crucial yet endangered environments provide a diverse range of ecosystem services but are globally subjected to high anthropogenic pressures, while being severely exposed to climate change impacts. The importance of salt marshes as “blue carbon” sinks, deriving from their primary production coupled with rapid surface accretion, has been increasingly recognized within the framework of climate mitigation strategies. However, large uncertainties remain in salt marsh carbon stock and sequestration estimation. In order to provide further knowledge in salt marsh carbon assessment and investigate marsh carbon pool response to management actions, we analyzed organic matter content in salt marsh soils of the Venice Lagoon (Italy) from 60 sediment cores to the depth of 1 m and estimated organic carbon stock and accumulation rates in different areas. Organic carbon stocks and accumulation rates were highly variable in different marshes, being affected by organic and inorganic inputs and preservation conditions. Our estimates suggest that the studied marshes store 17,108 ± 5,757 tons of carbon per square kilometer in top 1‐m of soil and can accumulate 85 ± 25 tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. However, flood regulation may reduce the annual marsh CO2 sequestration potential by more than 30%.

Nicholas;Vivek Srikrishnan;Courtney Cooper;Erica A. H. Smithwick;Nancy Tuana,Integrating Values to Improve the Relevance of Climate‐Risk Research,"
Climate risks are growing. Research is increasingly important to inform the design of risk‐management strategies. Assessing such strategies necessarily brings values into research. But the values assumed within research (often only implicitly) may not align with those of stakeholders and decision makers. These misalignments are often invisible to researchers and can severely limit research relevance or lead to inappropriate policy advice. Aligning strategy assessments with stakeholders' values requires a holistic approach to research design that is oriented around those values from the start. Integrating values into research in this way requires collaboration with stakeholders, integration across disciplines, and attention to all aspects of research design. Here we describe and demonstrate a qualitative conceptual tool called a values‐informed mental model (ViMM) to support such values‐centered research design. ViMMs map stakeholders' values onto a conceptual model of a study system to visualize the intersection of those values with coupled natural‐human system dynamics. Through this mapping, ViMMs integrate inputs from diverse collaborators to support the design of research that assesses risk‐management strategies in light of stakeholders' values. We define a visual language for ViMMs, describe accompanying practices and workflows, and present an illustrative application to the case of flood‐risk management in a small community along the Susquehanna river in the Northeast United States."

 The Southeastern Siberia (SES) region has recently experienced increasingly extensive wildfires in spring, which have threatened its large carbon sequestration capacity from vast forests and peatlands. However, the underlying mechanisms propelling the increased fires and their potential responses to future climate change remain unclear. Here, by using reanalysis data and climate model output together with a deep learning model, we explore the relationship between positive-phase North Atlantic Tripole (NAT) sea-surface temperature anomalies and SES wildfire increases and project the future trend in SES wildfire intensities under climate change. We found that the positive-phase April NAT enhances the Siberian anticyclone, causing increased temperatures and snowmelt via strengthened transport of warm-air advection into the SES region. The latter process heightens the exposure of local high-density peatlands to favorable conditions for fire ignition and leads to more intensive wildfire incidents. We further demonstrate that the projected NAT variations can drive interdecadal changes in future April SES wildfires. With future phase shifting of NAT modes under global warming, the regionally averaged burned area in SES could be increased by 47–62% under different warming scenarios from 1982–2014 to 2015–2100. Our findings reveal the climate-driven escalation of future wildfires in SES in the context of global warming and call for active and urgent fire management strategies to mitigate the fire risk."

Iron (III) oxides strongly bind phosphate in soils but can dissolve under flooded, reducing conditions induced by permafrost thaw and ground collapse. The ability for iron to regulate phosphate storage and solubility in thawing permafrost landscapes remains unclear. Here, iron-rich sediments containing iron oxides and organic-bound iron were incubated with or without added phosphate in soils along a permafrost thaw gradient to evaluate how iron-phosphate associations respond to thaw-induced redox shifts. Iron oxides partially dissolved and released sorbed phosphate when incubated in soils underlain by degraded permafrost. Iron complexed by organic matter remained stable but provided no phosphate binding capacity. Phosphate addition enhanced iron oxide dissolution and phosphorus concentrations in associated microbial biomass. Our study demonstrates that the capacity for iron oxides to immobilize and retain phosphate in permafrost peatlands decreases with permafrost thaw.

 Peatlands are globally important carbon sinks but are frequently drained. Drainage activities reduce overall methane emissions; however they are often accompanied by the construction of ditches, which are potential methane emission hotspots. Yet, the offsets of methane emissions from creating ditches in peatlands under different climate zones and land-use types remain unclear. Here we conducted a global meta-analysis by compiling annual methane emissions from paired near-pristine peatlands and terrestrial portion of drained peatlands and ditches to address this issue. Results showed that ditches occupy approximately 3.8 (95% confidence interval: 3.1~4.4)% of all drained peatlands. Ditches emit 695 (511~898) kg ha−1 yr−1 methane overall, with the highest emissions observed in (sub)tropics. Globally, ditch emissions offset approximately 12 (10~14)% for reductions in methane emissions from peatland drainage. Our findings demonstrate the importance of including ditch methane emissions to quantify emission factors for regional to global peatlands affected by drainage.

 The minimum velocity (v) for impact ejecta to form secondary craters (secondaries) remains enigmatic, but it is a crucial parameter in untangling the fate of impact ejecta on planetary surfaces. By cataloging the distances (L) of the nearest secondaries from centers of various-sized (D) primary craters (primaries) on the Moon, Mars and Mercury, we find that v can be as small as ~25 m/s, and an unified power-law relationship of L = 1.86D0.93 (both in meters) works for both simple and complex craters, regardless of different surface gravity and target properties. This relationship also successfully predicts occurrences of secondaries formed by craters on Venus. The constraint on v explains the common concurrences of structural disturbances in crater walls and continuous ejecta deposits caused by landing of cogenetic ejecta, suggesting that ejecta forming self-secondaries do not need near-vertical ejection angles and tertiary craters should be abundant on terrestrial bodies.

 Observed North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures are modulated by a recurrent alternation of anomalously warm and cold interdecadal phases known as Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. Here we use observations and a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations to demonstrate an ongoing acceleration of North Atlantic surface warming, which implies a smaller contribution of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability to 21st century North Atlantic sea-surface temperature anomalies than previously thought. Future projections of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability from realistic climate simulations are poorly constrained, yet a relaxation to a neutral phase by the mid-21st century emerges as the most probable evolution of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. In the simulations, the mitigating effects of a less likely upcoming cold phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability are overwhelmed by fast North Atlantic surface warming, which is robustly projected to persist in upcoming decades independent of emission scenarios. Sustained North Atlantic surface warming is therefore expected to continue in the near future.

 Accurate urban traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, the majority of existing forecasting methodologies predominantly concentrate on point-based forecasts (e.g., traffic detector forecasts). A limited number of them pay attention to the urban bidirectional road segments and the complex road network topology. To advance accurate traffic forecasting in complex urban scenarios, this paper proposes a Graph Representation enhanced Fully Attentional Spatial-Temporal network (GR-FAST). First, we construct a refined bidirectional road network graph (BRG) to depict the urban road network topology more accurately, particularly focusing on the turning patterns at intersections. Then, we adopt the graph representation methodology and introduce spatial information encoding (SIE) to explicitly characterize the significance of roads and network structure from multiple perspectives. Enhanced by SIE, spatial attention can capture spatial dependencies from both road network topologies and traffic pattern similarities, thereby forming a unified urban spatial cognition. Finally, a multi-scale residual perception (MRP) module is designed to balance the interplay of short-term temporal variability and long-term periodicity. Experiments on a real-world urban dataset from Wuhan, China, demonstrate that GR-FAST outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving an improvement of 9.19%. Furthermore, ablation studies suggest that the explicit incorporation of complex road spatial topologies can significantly enhance forecasting accuracy."

 Assessing the quality of UAV-HSIs (Unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral images) is crucial for evaluating sensor performance, identifying distortion types, and measuring data inversion accuracy. Due to the absence of reference images, UAV-HSI quality assessment leans towards no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), offering versatile applications. NR-IQA methods of remote sensing images using machine learning techniques have emerged, however, NR-IQA methods for UAV-HSIs containing multi-type and multiple distortions have not been developed. This paper introduces an NR-IQA method for UAV-HSI, employing machine learning techniques. We summarize and simulate distortion types in UAV-HSIs, constructing a quality assessment dataset based on 23 original high-quality and 806 simulated degraded UAV-HSIs. Extracting 129 features encompassing texture, color, transform domain, structural, and statistical aspects, we form seven feature sets through random and filtered feature selection algorithms. Ten machine learning quality assessment models are trained using this dataset and feature sets. The results showed that the model with the highest evaluation accuracy was extra trees (ET) (R2 = 0.928, RMSE = 0.326, RPD = 3.601), using feature set 1 that fuses Tamura texture, color, wavelet transform, and mean subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficient for a total of 11 features, the PLCC and SROCC of its predicted and true quality scores reached 0.963 and 0.925, respectively. In addition, the random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) also had high evaluation accuracies (R2 > 0.9 and RPD > 2.5). These findings underscore the applicability of our proposed machine learning-based NR-IQA method to assess the quality of the UAV-HSIs containing noise, blur, strip noise, and multiple distortions.

 China’s coastal mudflats, threatened by artificial reclamation and climate change, are undergoing drastic changes and their accurate mapping is important for their conservation and restoration. Traditional classification methods, which require large samples and complex classifiers, tend to have low computational efficiency and poor generalization ability; thus, they are unsuitable for the rapid and accurate extraction of coastal mudflats. This study proposes a Mudflat Index (MFI) based on hyperspectral images. MFI amplifies the difference in spectral characteristics between mudflats and other land cover types in intertidal environments, effectively improving the discrimination between coastal mudflats, salt marshes, mangroves, and muddy waters. Four typical coastal mudflat areas (i.e., the Yellow River Delta in Shandong, the Radial Sand Ridges of the South Yellow Sea in Jiangsu, Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang, and the Qinzhou Bay-Nanliu River Estuary in Guangxi) based on ZY1-02D were selected as the study areas.

 Deep learning has significantly advanced hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, primarily due to its robust nonlinear feature extraction capabilities. The vision transformer has achieved notable performance but is limited by the quadratic computational burden of its self-attention mechanism. Recently, a network based on state space model named Mamba, has attracted considerable attention for its linear complexity and commendable performance. Nevertheless, Mamba was originally designed for one-dimensional causal sequence modeling, and its effectiveness in inherent non-causal HSI classification remains to be fully validated.

The LES-S6 improves non-causal local feature extraction by incorporating a multi-directional local spatial scanning mechanism. Additionally, the CRS-S6 employs a bidirectional scanning mechanism in the spectral dimension to capture fine spectral details and integrate them with spatial information. The MSCGU utilizes a convolutional gating mechanism to aggregate features from diverse scanning routes and extract high-level semantic information. The overall accuracies of LE-Mamba on Indian Pines, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Pavia University datasets are 99.16 %, 98.16 %, 99.57 %, and 99.63 %, respectively.

 The semantic segmentation of land use and land cover (LULC) is a crucial and widely employed remote sensing task. Conventional convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have been extensively utilized for LULC segmentation. However, high-resolution remote sensing images contain a wealth of spatial and color texture information, which is not fully exploited by traditional deep learning approaches. The information bottleneck of CNNs and transformers results in the loss of a significant amount of texture detail information during the feature extraction process, which further limits the performance of LULC segmentation. We present DDPM-SegFormer, a new framework that merges a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and vision transformer for LULC segmentation. The aim is to address the difficulties arising from extraction in complex geographic landscapes and to alleviate information bottlenecks. The framework utilizes the ability of a DDPM to generate refined semantic features and that of vision transformer to model the global image context. Our framework introduces two main innovations. First, we use a DDPM for the first time in LULC segmentation to generate highly refined multiscale semantic features. This approach alleviates the information bottleneck caused by relying solely on a CNN or transformer architecture. Second, we develop an effective feature-level fusion strategy that utilizes multihead cross-attention between the DDPM and Transformer. This approach achieves the harmonious fusion of fine-scale semantic features, generating continuous and highly refined semantic features that enhance the segmentation accuracy. The results indicate that DDPM-SegFormer achieves an MIOU of 83.72% and an F1-score of 90.97% for the large-scale LoveDA dataset and an MIOU of 90.91% and an F1score of 93.30% for the Tarim Basin LULC dataset in a desert scenario.

 The analysis of association rules within ecosystems is crucial for monitoring, managing, and conserving natural resources. As widely adopted approaches for this task, geospatial methods involving spatial co-location pattern mining can reveal distribution rules and inherent associations among diverse geographical elements. Rooted in Tobler’s first law of geography, these methods focus on the impact of spatial proximity. However, apart from proximity, heterogeneity of environmental attributes such as elevation, temperature and precipitation are also essential for the formation of associations. For environmental co-location (Eco-location) pattern detection, we propose a method based on the Geo-Eco Knowledge Graph (GEKG) to mine multi-impact association rules. Firstly, we introduce the Adaptive Threshold (AT) to constrain the Delaunay triangular network, dynamically regulating adjacency relationships to generate geo-eco knowledge graph’s skeleton. For comprehensive ecosystem representation, various environmental attributes are integrated as semantic information into GEKG. In the reasoning of Eco-location patterns, we innovate beyond the traditional co-location paradigm by considering both spatial proximity and semantic similarity. Under the impact of various environmental information, sub-sets of geographically proximate entities are extracted to detect Eco-location patterns.

 Accurate lane maps with semantics are crucial for various applications, such as high-definition maps (HD Maps), intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and digital twins. Manual annotation of lanes is labor-intensive and costly, prompting researchers to explore automatic lane extraction methods. This paper presents an end-to-end large-scale lane mapping method that considers both lane geometry and semantics. This study represents lane markings as polylines with uniformly sampled points and associated semantics, allowing for adaptation to varying lane shapes. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end network to extract lane polylines from mobile laser scanning (MLS) data, enabling the inference of vectorized lane instances without complex post-processing. The network consists of three components: a feature encoder, a column proposal generator, and a lane information decoder. The feature encoder encodes textual and structural information of lane markings to enhance the method’s robustness to data imperfections, such as varying lane intensity, uneven point density, and occlusion-induced incomplete data. The column proposal generator generates regions of interest for the subsequent decoder. Leveraging the embedded multi-scale features from the feature encoder, the lane decoder effectively predicts lane polylines and their associated semantics without requiring step-by-step conditional inference. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three lane datasets have demonstrated the performance of the proposed method, even in the presence of incomplete data and complex lane topology. Furthermore, the datasets used in this work, including source ground points, generated bird’s eye view (BEV) images, and annotations, will be publicly available with the publication of the paper.

 Extracting road network maps for high-resolution remote sensing images is a critical and challenging remote sensing topic, with significant importance for traffic navigation, disaster management, autonomous driving, and urban planning. Although deep learning has demonstrated its powerful feature extraction capabilities in image processing tasks, including road extraction, existing road extraction algorithms still have some limitations. In particular, semantic segmentation-based methods often lack supervision of the connection relationships between roads and topological correctness constraints, resulting in fragmented and poorly connected road network graphs. Moreover, graph-based methods lack effective supervision strategies for vertex misdetection issues. To deal with these issues, we propose a deeply supervised vertex network (DSVNet) for road network graph extraction. First, to effectively supervise road vertices, we design a road vertex supervision module that yields improved vertex prediction accuracy. Second, to merge the benefits of segmentation-based methods and graph-based methods, we establish a parallel semantic segmentation branch based on the vertex querying task, thereby achieving enhanced road extraction accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce deformable attention into the model to boost its performance and computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of DSVNet on two large-scale public datasets. A large number of experimental results show that our research approach achieves the best road detection performance."

 Increasing population and the consequent rise in the demand for food and water resources pose significant challenges for the future of agriculture in Egypt. Rapid large-scale agricultural expansion has occurred in the country to meet the growing demand, but agricultural loss from urban infringement and field abandonment remains prevalent. Documenting the full spectrum of changes within Egypt’s agricultural systems is crucial for developing effective land-use policies that improve food security. Here we map and estimate the areal extent of multiple types of agricultural change in Egypt (i.e., agricultural gain, agricultural abandonment, and agricultural loss from urban growth) by applying the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm, a widely used time series temporal segmentation algorithm. First, we used LandTrendr to identify areas of agricultural gain and loss throughout Egypt from 1987 to 2019. Second, we combined land-cover maps and the LandTrendr results to create a comprehensive land-cover change map. Lastly, we evaluated the accuracy of our findings and estimated per-class areas with quantified uncertainty using high-quality reference data. Our results reveal a notable expansion in Egypt’s agricultural land area. However, this growth is accompanied by the widespread loss of prime agricultural land, a consequence of urban development and agricultural abandonment. This study emphasizes the pressing need for the implementation of sustainable land-use policies in Egypt, particularly as climate change will exacerbate pressures on the agricultural sector in the future."

 Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS) data are widely recognized for their sensitivity to inland water bodies. However, the detection of water bodies using single CyGNSS data is subject to uncertainties, presenting challenges for large-scale and accurate water system detection.

 Salt marshes are pivotal in the global carbon cycle, serving as significant contributors to the blue carbon sink. Accurately estimating carbon stock in salt marshes relies on precise vegetation classification.

Using low-cost sensors (LCS), PM1 (PM < 1 μm) and PM2.5 (PM < 2.5 μm) levels were measured in four transport modes (bike, walk, bus, and tramway), across four different streets and at three different times of the day. Findings are: (i) - the mode of transport plays a more important role on levels of PMratios (PM concentration ratio to reference) than the time of the day or the location, (ii) - PMratios and inhalation doses are higher in active modes of transport (bike, walk) than in passive ones (bus, tram), (iii) – levels of exposure to PM are ranked as: tram < bus < walk < bike, and (iv) – a statistical model has been developed to predict PMratios as a function of transport mode, travel period, street ratio, and traffic.

 BackgroundExtensive epidemiological literature has documented adverse effects of ambient air pollution on human health. However, in Italy, no multicenter longitudinal studies on chronic exposure to air pollution and mortality have been conducted. Within the BIGEPI project, we aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and cause-specific mortality in large Italian population-based cohorts.MethodsFive administrative cohorts from Turin, Bologna, Rome, Taranto, and Brindisi (Italy) were included. Subjects aged 30+ were enrolled from the 2011 Census, followed-up until 2018 (2019 for Bologna), and linked with population and health registries. Annual mean concentrations of particulate matter ≤10 and 2.5 μm (PM10 and PM2.5), dioxide nitrogen (NO2), and warm-season ozone (O3w) were assigned to each participant's geocoded residential address at baseline. Long-term associations between pollutants and non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were investigated through single- and two-pollutant Cox proportional hazard models. Effect modification by sex and age was tested. Cohort-specific estimates were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis.Results2,709,903 subjects (contributing over 18 million person-years) generated 266,821 non-accidental deaths. Each increment of 5 μg/m3 of PM10, 1 μg/m3 of PM2.5 and 10 μg/m3 of NO2 was associated with an increased risk of non-accidental mortality, with pooled Hazard Ratios (HR) of 1.018 (95% CI: 1.005–1.030), 1.004 (95% CI: 1.001–1.007) and 1.010 (95% CI: 1.002–1.018), respectively. HRs for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality were higher, the latter with CIs including the null. The associations remained quite stable after adjustment for the other pollutants. O3w was negatively associated with mortality but estimates were not statistically significant and reduced to unity upon adjustment for NO2. No consistent statistically significant effect modifications by sex and age emerged.ConclusionsUpdated evidence implicates a continued risk of mortality in Italy due to long-term air pollution exposure, despite declining levels of exposure during the last years."

 In this study, photographic records of natural lightning flashes obtained from high-speed video camera observations are analyzed based on an extensive literature review. The purpose of this work is to estimate the fractal dimension of lightning discharges and to analyze and evaluate the effect of lightning type (downward and upward flashes during their propagation as well as return strokes) and lightning polarity (negative and positive). Three methods of fractal dimension estimation are employed namely the: (i) box-counting, (ii) sandbox, and (iii) correlation method, utilizing algorithms developed in MATLAB software. Appropriate image processing techniques are employed to guarantee precision in fractal dimension estimation. A thorough discussion is conducted by comparing the estimated fractal dimension values with those previously documented in the relevant literature based on field observations. The mean fractal dimension of downward negative leaders for the three methods (1.18, 1.31, 1.38) aligns well with previous studies, while positive downward leaders exhibit lower values (1.08, 1.15, 1.26), denoting a reduced branching behavior; upward leaders demonstrate slightly higher fractal dimensions than downward ones. Additionally, an attempt to correlate the lightning return stroke peak current with the fractal dimension is made. The outcomes of this research may assist in facilitating precise modeling of the lightning attachment phenomenon, thereby contributing to the development of safer lightning protection systems."

 Utilizing the reanalysis data and model simulations, we explore the interannual variations of extreme high temperatures over the Indochina Peninsula during 1960–2022, as well as their responses to critical oceanic systems and corresponding mechanisms. Given the intricate interactions among oceanic regions, this study employs the Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Analysis method to extract the atmospheric responses to key ocean systems, including the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and tropical Atlantic. Results highlight the significant contributions of TIO and ENSO. It is suggested that the anomalous anticyclonic circulation located over the Indochina Peninsula, as a response to the warm TIO and ENSO, favors the local anomalous downward motions, resulting in reduced cloud cover, diminished precipitation, increased net radiative energy to the surface and increased sensible and latent heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere, and finally inducing an increase in extreme high temperatures.

 Significant vegetation increase in the Loess Plateau (LP) of China could strongly affect the surface water budget. Through the WRF model with the Water Vapor Tracer (WVT) method tracking moisture within the LP, this study conducted three sets of experiments from 1999 to 2018 with GLASS Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) data. The results indicate that vegetation has a critical role in partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into transpiration (Et), canopy evaporation (Ecan), and soil evaporation (Edir), thus regulating terrestrial internal convective precipitation (P). The local P response largely depends on external P (E_P), while the internal P (I_P) contribution remains minor. In summer, the total wet difference of I_P in the LP is about 0.03 mm/day, almost 5 times that of E_P. Greening also causes surface runoff reduction. Thus, in spring and summer, surface water storage (W) decreases due to the greater increase in ET than in P. In autumn, W increases by about 0.06 mm/day due to a large decrease in Ecan, implying confining the increased W to shallower soils, resulting in accelerated loss of deep soil moisture. The greening trend of 2000–2018 contributed to an increase in I_P, which could not offset increased ET and reduced E_P, leading to terrestrial water storage reduction."
